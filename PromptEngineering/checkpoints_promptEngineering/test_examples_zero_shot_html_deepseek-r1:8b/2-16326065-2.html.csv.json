    "claim": "iowa be the team that jam vanderberg belong to when the completion have a status of redshirt",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"iowa be the team that jam vanderberg belong to when the completion have a status of redshirt.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I think it's trying to say that Iowa is the team for Jam Vanderberg, and at some point in their careers where they had \"redshirt\" completions, perhaps their performance was not great.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The rows are from 2008 to 2012, plus a college totals row. \n\nI need to look for any redshirt status related to completions. Wait, in the table, there's a column named \"completion %\" which shows percentages like 48.3%, 62.5%, etc. But the term \"redshirt\" is used as data in some cells. For example, in 2008 and 2009, the team is Iowa, attempts are redshirt, completions are redshirt. Wait, does that mean they were redshirts? Or maybe it's indicating something else.\n\nWait, perhaps \"redshirt\" refers to a playing status. So if someone was a redshirt, they might have attempted but not completed as many passes. But the claim mentions \"completion have a status of redshirt.\" Maybe it means when their completions were categorized as redshirts in terms of performance.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- 2008: team is Iowa, attempts=redshirt, completions=redshirt, etc.\n- 2009: attempts=87, completions=42, which are actual numbers. Completion% is 48.3%.\n- 2010: attempts=8, completions=5, completion% 62.5%.\n- 2011 and 2012 show higher attempts and completions with percentages like 58.7%, 57.3%.\n\nThe claim says that when the completion has a redshirt status, Iowa is the team for Jam Vanderberg. Wait, but in the table, the only rows where \"redshirt\" is mentioned are 2008, 2009, and then college totals. But in those years, the team is Iowa. So maybe if there's a row where the completion status is redshirt, then that's when Iowa is Jam Vanderberg's team.\n\nBut wait, the claim doesn't specify which year or context. It just says \"when the completion have a status of redshirt.\" So I think we need to see if in any row where completions are marked as redshirt, the team is Iowa. From the table, yes, 2008 and 2009 have redshirt completions (and attempts) and the team is Iowa.\n\nSo the claim is saying that when the completion status is redshirt, Iowa is Jam Vanderberg's team. Therefore, this seems to be supported by the data because in those years where completion% is redshirt, the team is indeed Iowa.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if \"redshirt\" refers strictly to completions or attempts. In 2008, both attempts and completions are redshirt, which might indicate that the player was a redshirt, meaning they weren't eligible for significant playing time, so their stats were low or zero. But in 2009, the team is still Iowa, but the completions are higher, 42 out of 87.\n\nBut regardless of that, the claim is about the completion status being redshirt and whether the team is Iowa. Since in those years (2008-2012), when there's a redshirt completion, the team is Iowa, then the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where \"redshirt\" appears in the completions column for Iowa.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"completions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 2010, the player with Iowa make 5 completions for a total of 45 yards.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the year mentioned in the claim, which is 2010. Scanning through the table, I see that there's a row for 2010. Let me focus on that row.\n\nIn the 2010 row, under the \"team\" column, it says \"iowa.\" So that matches up with the claim referring to Iowa. Next, looking at the \"completions\" column for 2010, it shows 5 completions. That's exactly what the claim states\u20145 completions.\n\nNow, checking the \"yards\" column for that same row, I see it's 45 yards. The claim also mentions 45 yards as the total, so that matches too. \n\nPutting this together: in 2010, the Iowa team had 5 completions and 45 yards. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate based on the table data.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies between the claim and the corresponding cells in the table for 2010.

Let me start by carefully examining the table structure and the specific data.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to the team \"iowa.\" Scanning through the 'team' column, I see that each row lists \"iowa\" as the team from 2008 to 2012. The last row is labeled \"college totals,\" which probably aggregates the previous years.\n\nThe claim mentions \"completion,\" so I'm focusing on the 'completions' and 'completion %' columns. The completions column shows numerical values, while completion percentage includes a percentage symbol. The claim specifies \"42 completion,\" which likely refers to completions rather than percentage.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n- 2008: All cells are \"redshirt.\" This doesn't apply because it's not a numeric value.\n- 2009: Completions are 42, which matches the claim exactly.\n- 2010 and onwards: Different numbers, so they don't affect this specific claim.\n- College totals row shows 507 completions, but that's an aggregate and the claim refers to a specific number.\n\nThe key point is that in 2009, Iowa had 42 completions.

Let me first read the claim carefully: \"there be 223 completion be record with there be 389 attempt.\"\n\nHmm, the user provided a table with several columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The claim seems to be talking about specific numbers in these columns.\n\nI think the claim is saying that for some year or team, when they have 389 attempts, their completions should be 223. So I need to check if there's any row where attempts=389 and completions=223.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n- 2008: All redshirt, so probably not relevant.\n- 2009: Attempts=87, completions=42. Not matching.\n- 2010: Attempts=8, completions=5. No match.\n- 2011: Attempts=404, completions=237. Not the numbers in question.\n- 2012: Attempts=389 and completions=223.

The claim states: \"From 2008 to 2012, the number of attempts be 888.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a time frame from 2008 to 2012 and refers to the \"number of attempts\" being 888. I should look through each row of the table to find where this information is located.\n\nLooking at the table headers, the relevant columns are 'year', 'attempts', etc. The claim specifically mentions the number of attempts, so I'm focusing on the 'attempts' column.\n\nNow, checking each row:\n- 2008: Attempts are \"redshirt\" \u2013 not a numerical value.\n- 2009: Attempts are 87.\n- 2010: Attempts are 8.\n- 2011: Attempts are 404.\n- 2012: Attempts are 389.\n- College totals: Attempts are 888.\n\nWait, the last row says \"college totals\" with 888 attempts. The claim refers to years from 2008 to 2012, which would include 2008 to 2012 and possibly the college totals. However, the term \"from 2008 to 2012\" usually refers to those specific years (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) and not including a separate \"college totals\" row.\n\nTherefore, within the given years (2008-2012), none of the rows have 888 attempts except the last row which is about college totals. So, the claim's assertion that \"the number of attempts be 888\" during those years isn't fully supported by the data provided because only the college totals row shows this figure.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"iowa record 389 attempt when they also record 2249 yard.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Iowa records 389 attempts.\n2. In the same year (assuming same row), they record 2249 yards.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2008 to 2012 and includes various statistics. The columns relevant here are \"attempts\" and \"yards.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows have 389 attempts. Scanning through the \"year\" column:\n- 2008: Not 389\n- 2009: Not 389\n- 2010: Not 389\n- 2011: 389 attempts? Wait, looking at the \"attempts\" column for each year:\n    - 2008: redshirt (not a number)\n    - 2009: 87\n    - 2010: 8\n    - 2011: 404\n    - 2012: 389\n\nSo, in 2012, Iowa has 389 attempts. Now, I need to check if in that same row (2012), the \"yards\" column also shows 2249.\n\nLooking at the \"yards\" column:\n- 2008: redshirt\n- 2009: 470\n- 2010: 45\n- 2011: 3022\n- 2012: 2249\n\nYes, in 2012, the yards are 2249. Therefore, both conditions are met in the same row (row index 5, assuming we start counting from 0 or 1). \n\nWait, but in the table provided, the rows are numbered as follows:\n- Row 0: 2008\n- Row 1: 2009\n- Row 2: 2010\n- Row 3: 2011\n- Row 4: 2012\n- Row 5: college totals\n\nSo, in row index 4 (2012), both attempts and yards match the claim.

The table has multiple columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, yards.\n\nSo for 2012, the team is Iowa, and attempts are 389. Therefore, there's no row in 2012 where attempts are 404. Maybe the claim is referring to a different context or maybe a typo? But based on the table, it's not supported.\n\nAlso, I should check if any other rows have 404 attempts. Scanning through: 2008 has redshirt, 2009 has 87, 2010 has 8, 2011 has 404, and 2012 has 389. Oh, wait! In 2011, the attempts are 404. So if the claim is about 2012, it's false because 2012 doesn't have 404 attempts. However, maybe I misread the table.\n\nWait no, in 2011, it's 404 attempts, not 2012. So the claim says \"in 2012,\" which would be the 2012 row, but that's 389.

However, the claim specifies \"on iowa,\" so perhaps it's referring to a game where Vanderberg played against Iowa.\n\nNext, I check each row for any mention of James Vanderberg. Scanning through the 'team' column, all entries are either \"iowa\" or \"college totals.\" There's no mention of \"james vanderberg\" as a player in this table.

So maybe the claim is referring to the college total attempts across all four years, including 2008.\n\nHowever, in 2008, 'attempts' is listed as \"redshirt\". If that's considered as zero or not counted, then adding up from 2009 onwards gives us 499. But if we include 2008, it would be 499 + 0 = 499. So even considering 2008, the total isn't 888.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misinterpreting \"college totals\" as the sum for those years, but according to the table, college totals have 888 attempts. Maybe that's a row outside the specific years, so it's not directly comparable.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the actual number of attempts from 2008 to 2011 isn't 888.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that from 2008 to 2011, the total attempts are 888. Calculating the sum for those years (excluding 2008 as 'redshirt' isn't a number), we get 87 + 8 + 404 = 499. The claim is false because the actual total is 499, not 888.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Let's break it down. \n\n\"404 attempt\" likely refers to a number of attempts in some context\u2014maybe passes or attempts by a player. The term \"vanderberg\" is probably a last name, so we're looking for someone named Vanderberg. \"On iowa\" suggests that this is related to the University of Iowa team.\n\nThe next part, \"when the record yard be 2249,\" refers to a record where the total yards are 2249. So, I'm thinking this might relate to a specific game or season where the opposing team had 2249 yards.\n\nNow, looking at the table, it's about the University of Iowa's attempts, completions, and other statistics over several years from 2008 to 2012, plus college totals. The columns are year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards.\n\nI need to check if there's a row where the attempt count is 404 for Vanderberg on Iowa when the yards were 2249. But I don't see any entry in the table with the name \"Vanderberg.\" The teams listed are all \"iowa,\" so maybe Vanderberg is an alias or a specific player, but it's not mentioned here.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 2008: All redshirt entries, no relevant data.\n- 2009: Attempts=87, etc. No mention of Vanderberg.\n- 2010: Attempts=8.\n- 2011: Attempts=404, yards=3022.\n- 2012: Attempts=389, yards=2249.\n- College totals: Not specific to a player.\n\nIn the 2011 row, attempts are 404, which matches the number in the claim. However, the yards for that row are 3022, not 2249. The next year, 2012, has 389 attempts and 2249 yards, but no 404 attempts there. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could the \"record yard\" refer to a season total? If so, in 2011, the yards are 3022, which isn't matching. In 2012, it's 2249, but that's with 389 attempts. There's no row where both 404 attempts and 2249 yards occur for Vanderberg on Iowa.\n\nSince Vanderberg isn't listed as a player in the table, there's no data to support the claim. The only mention of 404 attempts is in 2011 with 3022 yards. Therefore, the claim seems to mix up the years and specifics that don't align with the actual data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes specific numbers and names not found in the provided table. The table shows that in 2011, Iowa had 404 attempts but only 3022 yards, not 2249. In 2012, they had fewer attempts (389) but reached 2249 yards. There's no Vanderberg listed either. Thus, the claim is unsupported.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
