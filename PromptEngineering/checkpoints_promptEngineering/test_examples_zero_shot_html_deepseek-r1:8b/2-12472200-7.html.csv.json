    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Olga Govortsova have never reach the final in a grand slam tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table. The key elements are \"Olga Govortsova,\" \"reach the final,\" and \"grand slam tournaments.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various tournaments and their performance across different years. The \"grand slam tournaments\" row seems relevant because that's exactly what the claim is about.\n\nNext, I'll look for rows related to Olga Govortsova. Scanning through each row, I notice that there's a row labeled \"australian open,\" but it doesn't mention her name. However, further down, I find a row labeled \"olga govortsova\" in the second row of the tbody.\n\nNow, focusing on Olga Govortsova's performance: In 2007 (column '2007'), she reached the 'a' stage, which is probably an abbreviation for the first round or a qualifying round. The same pattern continues through 2011, where each year she seems to reach either 'a', '1r', or sometimes '2r'. None of these entries indicate that she reached the final (which would likely be denoted as 'Final' or 'F', but in the table, finals might just be represented differently).\n\nWait, looking again, I see that the row for \"olga govortsova\" has the same data across all years: 'a', '1r', etc. Since there's no indication of her reaching a final, it appears she hasn't.\n\nSo, based on the table, Olga Govortsova never reached the final in any grand slam tournament mentioned here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"olga govortsova\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the furthest Olga Govortsova have ever advance in a grand slam tournament be the third round.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"grand slam tournaments,\" so I'll look for that term in the table. Scanning through the table headers, the first row under 'tournament' is \"grand slam tournaments,\" which is directly related.\n\nNext, looking at the data under this header, each cell corresponds to a specific year from 2007 to 2011. The claim refers to advancement, so I need to check how Olga Govortsova performed in these years. \n\nFrom the table:\n- In 2007: 'a' (probably stands for first round win or absence)\n- In 2008: '3r' (third round)\n- In 2009: '3r'\n- In 2010: '2r'\n- In 2011: '1r'\n\nSo, in 2008 and 2009, she reached the third round. The furthest is the third round, as per the claim. \n\nI should find which row corresponds to her performance. Looking at the table rows, the second row after 'grand slam tournaments' (row index 1) lists her results each year.

The claim says: \"From 2007 - 2011, Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking have never gone up.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant rows and columns in the table related to Olga Govortsova. From the table, I see that there are two rows mentioning her: one under \"win - loss\" with values for each year from 2007 to 2011, and another row for \"year-end ranking\" which has numbers for those years.\n\nWait, but actually, looking back, I might have misread. The rows like \"grand slam tournaments,\" \"australian open,\" etc., are separate entries. Then there's a specific row: \"win - loss\" with data 2-2, 3-4, etc., which probably refers to her performance in each year. However, the claim is about her WTA year-end ranking, so I should focus on the \"year-end ranking\" row.\n\nIn the table, under \"year-end ranking,\" the cells for 2007 are 49, 2008 is also 49, 2009 is 52, 2010 is 74, and 2011 is 114. So each year from 2007 onwards, her ranking changed. \n\nThe claim says that her ranking \"have never gone up,\" but according to the table, her ranking went from 49 in 2008 to 52 in 2009, which is an increase. Therefore, the claim is false because her ranking did go up during those years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year-end ranking\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Olga Govortsova winning at least one Grand Slam tournament match in any given year from 2007 to 2011 is true or false. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table is showing. The table has columns for each year from 2007 to 2011 and rows representing different tournaments. For each tournament, there are entries under each year indicating her performance, like 'a' for absent or '1r' for first round loss, etc.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Olga Govortsova's wins in Grand Slam tournaments. So I need to focus on the 'grand slam tournaments' row because that's where her actual matches would be listed.\n\nLooking at the table, the first data row is 'grand slam tournaments'. Each cell under this row represents her performance in each year from 2007 to 2011. The entries are:\n\n- 2007: grand slam tournaments (cell value)\nWait, actually, no, looking closer, the second row is 'australian open' with values like 'a', not 'grand slam'. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the first data row after the headers is 'grand slam tournaments' and under each year 2007-2011, it's also listed as 'grand slam tournaments'. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing.\n\nWait no, the table starts with the header row for 2007, 2008, etc., then the first data row is 'grand slam tournaments', and the cells under 2007 to 2011 are just text \"grand slam tournaments\". So perhaps this row isn't specific to any player but just general. So maybe Olga's performance is not listed here directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. The table has headers for each year from 2007 to 2011, then the first data row is 'grand slam tournaments' with each cell containing \"grand slam tournaments\". Then other rows are specific tournaments like 'australian open', 'dubai', etc.\n\nSo maybe the 'grand slam tournaments' row is just indicating that she participated in those tournaments but didn't win any. So her wins would be in other contexts, perhaps in smaller tournaments or matches not part of the main Grand Slam events.\n\nBut the claim is about winning at least one Grand Slam tournament match in any given year from 2007-2011. So if she won a match in any of those years in a Grand Slam tournament, that would satisfy the claim.\n\nLooking through the table, under 'grand slam tournaments', each cell says \"grand slam tournaments\", which might mean she didn't win any matches there because it's just indicating the event itself, not her performance. So perhaps she didn't win any Grand Slam matches in those years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look for another row that refers to her wins. But in the table, each tournament is listed separately, and only 'grand slam tournaments' is a general term. There's no specific row for Olga Govortsova or her match outcomes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says she won at least one Grand Slam tournament match in any given year from 2007-2011. So I need to check if there's any indication that she won a match in those years in a Grand Slam event.\n\nLooking back at the table, under 'grand slam tournaments' row, each cell just lists \"grand slam tournaments\". That might mean she participated but didn't win any matches. Or perhaps it indicates that she did win some matches, but without specific numbers or indicators like 'a' for absent or '1r' loss.\n\nWait, actually, in other rows like 'australian open', the cell values are things like 'a' for absence, '1r' for first round loss, etc. So maybe in the 'grand slam tournaments' row, if it's marked differently, that would indicate her performance.\n\nBut in the table provided, under 'grand slam tournaments' each year 2007-2011 has the same value: \"grand slam tournaments\". That might mean she didn't win any matches there because there's no specific notation like 'win' or a number indicating rounds won. Or perhaps it means that she did win some matches but it's not noted here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the absence of specific indicators like '1r', '2r' etc., in the 'grand slam tournaments' row could mean she didn't participate or didn't win any matches there. But I'm not entirely sure how to interpret this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each tournament, including Grand Slams, if she won a match, it would be noted under that specific tournament's row. So for example, in 'australian open', her result is 'a' meaning she didn't participate or lost early. But since 'grand slam tournaments' is a separate row, maybe she didn't win any matches there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term 'win at least 1 grand slam tournament match' refers to winning a match in a Grand Slam tournament, not necessarily the entire tournament. So if she won one match in a Grand Slam, that would count.\n\nBut looking through each year from 2007-2011, under the 'grand slam tournaments' row, each cell just says \"grand slam tournaments\". Maybe this means that she didn't have any wins there because it's not marked as 'win', or perhaps it's indicating that she did win some matches but it's not specified.\n\nWait, I think I might be missing something. Let me look at the data again:\n\nThe first data row is 'grand slam tournaments' and under each year, it's just \"grand slam tournaments\". So maybe this indicates her performance in those tournaments. If it's not marked with a loss or absence, perhaps she didn't win any matches there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the absence of specific notation means she did win some matches, but without further info, it's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at other rows like 'australian open', which has entries like 'a' for 2007, 'lq' for 2008, etc. So perhaps in the 'grand slam tournaments' row, if her result was a win, it would be indicated differently, like 'win'. But since there's no such indication, maybe she didn't win any matches in Grand Slams during those years.\n\nTherefore, based on this, Olga Govortsova did not have any wins in the Grand Slam tournaments from 2007-2011, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, Olga Govortsova did not win any matches in the Grand Slam tournaments during the years 2007 to 2011. Therefore, the claim that she won at least one Grand Slam tournament match in any given year during this period is **false**.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",

The claim mentions Olga Govortsova advancing to the third round in consecutive years at the French Open.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it includes information about tournaments, years from 2007 to 2011, and details for each tournament. Specifically, there's a row for \"french open\" which lists the results for each year:\n\n- 2007: a\n- 2008: 3r\n- 2009: 3r\n- 2010: 2r\n- 2011: 2r\n\nI need to check if Olga Govortsova reached the third round in two consecutive years. The term \"third round\" corresponds to \"3r\". \n\nFrom the table:\n- In 2008, she was at 3r.\n- In 2009, she was also at 3r.\n- In 2010 and 2011, she didn't make it past the second round (2r).\n\nSo, she advanced to the third round in 2008 and 2009, which are two consecutive years. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells for verification. The \"french open\" row is at index 2, with columns 2007 (column index 1), 2008 (index 2), 2009 (index 3), and so on. Specifically, the third round results are in column 2008 and 2009.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 2, columns 2007, 2008, and 2009.\nBut since the claim refers to advancing to the third round two years in a row, only the 2008 and 2009 columns (third rounds) are directly relevant. However, for full verification, maybe including more cells is necessary, but as per instructions, I should list all relevant cells that directly support the claim.\n\nWait, the table lists the results for each year, so the 2007 column might show she didn't advance past a certain round, which isn't needed here since the claim starts from 2008.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"Olga Govortsova reach the final in a grand slam tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for relevant rows and columns. The claim mentions Olga Govortsova reaching the final of a Grand Slam Tournament. So, I should focus on rows where \"grand slam tournaments\" are mentioned and see their performance over the years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a tournament or event. There's a row for \"grand slam tournaments\" as well as individual ones like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, etc.\n\nIn the \"grand slam tournaments\" row, there are cells under each year from 2007 to 2011 with values: 'a', '1r', '1r', '1r', and '1r'. The letters here might represent different stages. I think 'a' could mean absent or not held, and '1r' probably means the player reached the first round but didn't go further.\n\nNext, looking at individual grand slams like the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. Each of these has their own progression through the years. For example, the French Open in 2007 was an 'a', which might mean not held or she wasn't present that year. In 2008, it's 3r, so third round. Then in 2009 again 3r, 2010 as 2r, and 2011 as 2r.\n\nIf Olga Govortsova reached the final, there should be a 'final' or something indicating she made it that far. In the table, the columns are labeled with stages like QF (quarterfinals), SF (semifinal), etc., but I don't see an explicit column for finals. Wait, maybe in some rows, the final is indicated as 'lq' which might mean she lost in the last stage.\n\nWait, no. The term 'final' isn't explicitly listed in the table's columns. So perhaps the data shows whether she reached certain stages each year but not necessarily if she made it to the final. Alternatively, maybe I need to infer based on her progress.\n\nIn 2007, for example, her Australian Open was 'a', so she didn't participate. In 2008, she got to 3r in French Open and possibly further elsewhere. But without a clear indication of her reaching the final, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlso, the table includes \"year end ranking\" but that doesn't directly relate to whether she made the final.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I should check if any row specifically mentions her reaching the final.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the furthest Olga Govortsova have ever advance in a grand slam tournament be the second round.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out where Olga Govortsova's data is in the table. Looking at the table headers, it seems like each row represents a different tournament or event. The first column is \"tournament,\" and the rows after that are probably the years from 2007 to 2011.\n\nI need to look for the row where the tournament is specifically named as something related to Olga Govortsova. Hmm, but wait, looking through the table, I see rows like \"australian open,\" \"french open,\" etc., but none of them directly mention Olga Govortsova. So maybe she's not listed here? Or perhaps her progress is indicated in another way.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the row \"win - loss\" refers to her performance. Let me check that row. The entries under \"win - loss\" for each year are: 2-2, 3-4, 3-4, 1-4, and 1-4. These numbers likely represent her wins and losses in different years.\n\nBut the claim is about how far she advanced, not just her win-loss record. So maybe I need to look at each grand slam tournament row to see her performance. For example, under \"australian open,\" it's 'a' for 2007, which probably means she was a qualifier or didn't make it past the first round. Similarly, \"french open\" has 'lq' in 2010 and 2011, meaning she lost in the early rounds.\n\nWait, but the claim is about her advancing the furthest. So I need to find if there's any row where she reached at least the second round. Looking again, for each grand slam:\n\n- Australian Open: 'a' (maybe first round), then 'lq' in later years.\n- French Open: 'a', 'lq', etc.\n- Wimbledon and US Open: Not directly listed but assumed similar to other slams.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The table doesn't list her name; it lists tournaments and their results. So maybe the claim is based on an assumption about her performance, which isn't directly supported by the table data. Or perhaps there's a row that indicates she reached at least the second round in any grand slam.\n\nLooking for \"grand slam\" in the column names\u2014yes, some columns mention \"Grand Slam.\" Wait, no, looking again, each row is a tournament name, and the columns are years. So I'm not seeing a direct reference to her progress in each tournament.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"year end ranking\" at the bottom shows her position, but that doesn't indicate how far she advanced. The claim is about advancement, so it's more about rounds reached rather than rankings.\n\nI think I need to consider that the furthest she went was, say, the second round in some tournament. If the table doesn't show her reaching beyond a certain point, then maybe the claim is false because the data doesn't support her going as far as the second round.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in 2007, she didn't advance past the first round (as indicated by 'a'), so she didn't reach the second round that year. Then, in later years, she sometimes lost earlier (like 'lq'). So maybe she never reached the second round in any grand slam, making the claim false.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure because I don't see her name in the table. The table lists tournaments and their performance each year, but not individual players' progress beyond that. So perhaps the data doesn't directly confirm whether she went as far as the second round or not.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for a tournament where she advanced past the first round. If in all grand slams, she didn't make it past the first round, then the claim is false because she never reached the second round.\n\nBut without explicit data on her advancement, I can't confirm from the table whether she did or not. So perhaps the claim isn't fully supported by the table data, making the answer \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that there's insufficient data in the provided table to confirm Olga Govortsova's furthest advancement in a grand slam tournament beyond the first round. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Maybe this indicates how she performed in each tournament. But I'm not sure if these rows represent individual players or just the tournaments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists the results of various tournaments, and I need to find her wins from 2007-2011. Since she's a player, perhaps the \"year end ranking\" row is relevant, but that only shows numbers like 49, 49, etc., which doesn't directly indicate tournament wins.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The claim is about her having won at least five grand slam matches in any given year from 2007-2011.

The rows are about different tournaments or categories like win-loss records.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a \"grand slam tournament match\" category that tracks her wins annually.

So maybe she didn't achieve five wins in any year.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the table seems to represent various tournaments and their outcomes rather than individual players' performances. Without specific data on Olga's grand slam match wins from 2007-2011, I can't confirm the claim. Therefore, the answer is probably FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe provided HTML table includes information about various tournaments and their performance over the years from 2007 to 2011. However, upon careful examination, there is no specific row or data entry that directly corresponds to Olga Govortsova's performance in grand slam tournament matches during those years. The claim requires information on her wins, which isn't present in the table. Therefore, it cannot be verified.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking from 2007 to 2011 always going up is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim states that from 2007 to 2011, Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end rankings have always gone up. So I need to check each year from 2007 to 2011 and see if there's an upward trend in her ranking.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a row for \"year - end ranking\" with values for each year:\n\n- 2007: 49\n- 2008: 49\n- 2009: 52\n- 2010: 74\n- 2011: 114\n\nSo let's list these out:\n\n2007: 49\n2008: 49 (same as 2007)\n2009: 52 (increase from 49 to 52)\n2010: 74 (increase from 52 to 74)\n2011: 114 (increase from 74 to 114)\n\nNow, the claim is that they \"always go up.\" So I need to check if each subsequent year's ranking is higher than the previous one. \n\nFrom 2007 to 2008, it stays the same at 49, which doesn't go up. Then in 2009, it increases, then again in 2010, and most significantly in 2011.\n\nSo, since 2008 didn't have an increase compared to 2007, the ranking didn't always go up every single year from 2007 to 2011. The claim might be considering only the years where there was an increase, but strictly speaking, if it's about each year showing an increase, then 2008 is a point of failure.\n\nWait, but the user instructions mention that the relevant cells are the ones used to verify the claim. So I need to find which cells support or contradict the claim. Since the claim says \"always go up,\" any year where the ranking doesn't increase would make the statement false.\n\nIn 2007 vs 2008: 49 to 49, so no increase.\nTherefore, that's a relevant cell because it shows the ranking didn't go up, which contradicts the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include both the years where there was an increase and the year where there wasn't. But specifically, since the claim is about \"always going up,\" any instance of not going up is relevant.\n\nTherefore, I should identify all the cells that contribute to this comparison.\n\nEach row corresponds to a year, so rows 0 (2007), 1 (2008), 2 (2009), 3 (2010), and 4 (2011) are the ones with the ranking data. The column is \"year - end ranking.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells would be each of these five rows because they all contribute to determining if the ranking went up each year.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the claim is about whether from 2007-2011 her rankings always went up. So for that to be true, every subsequent year must have a higher ranking than the previous. Since 2008 is equal to 2007, that's a point where it didn't go up, so the entire statement isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would include all five rows because each year's data is needed to assess if the rankings went up each time.\n\nSo in terms of the JSON structure, I need to list all these cells as they are all part of verifying the claim. Each row has a row index and the column name \"year - end ranking.\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking from 2007 to 2011 always went up, we analyze each year's ranking:\n\n- **2007**: 49\n- **2008**: 49 (no increase)\n- **2009**: 52 (increase)\n- **2010**: 74 (increase)\n- **2011**: 114 (increase)\n\nSince the ranking did not increase from 2007 to 2008, the claim is false. All five years are relevant as they show that while there were increases in some years, not all years reflected an upward trend.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Olga Govortsova advance to the third round in the French Open 5 years in a row\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has a header with columns like 'tournament', '2007', '2008', and so on up to '2011'. Each row represents a different tournament or category, and each cell under the year indicates some performance or status, like 'a' for absent, '1r' for first round, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Olga Govortsova\" advancing to the third round in the French Open five years in a row. So I need to find relevant cells that relate to her performance specifically at the French Open each year from 2007 to 2011.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see a few entries related to the French Open:\n\n- The second row is for \"french open\", with cells under '2007', '2008', etc. Each of these cells shows her performance that year.\n- There's also a row labeled \"win - loss\" which might not directly relate unless it affects her advancement, but I think it's more about wins and losses overall.\n- The rows for \"summer olympics\" and \"tokyo\" probably aren't relevant here.\n\nFocusing on the French Open row:\n\n- In 2007: 'a' \u2013 maybe she was a participant or absent.\n- 2008: '3r' \u2013 third round.\n- 2009: I don't see it, so perhaps she didn't reach there that year. Wait, looking again, the columns are up to '2011', so each row has entries from 2007-2011.\n\nWait, in the provided table, the French Open row shows:\n\n'2007': a\n'2008': 3r\n'2009': a\n'2010': lq (last quarterfinals?)\n'2011': lq\n\nSo, in 2008, she made it to the third round. In 2009, maybe she didn't enter or was absent ('a'). In 2010 and 2011, she reached the last quarterfinals, which is further than the third round.\n\nWait, but the claim says she advanced to the third round five years in a row. So I need to check each year from 2007-2011 whether she made it to at least the third round each time.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 2007: 'a' \u2013 not sure if this means she didn't participate or was a bye. If 'a' indicates absence, then she might not have advanced beyond the first round.\n- 2008: '3r' \u2013 yes, she advanced to third round.\n- 2009: 'a' \u2013 again, maybe she didn't play, so no advancement.\n- 2010: 'lq' \u2013 last quarterfinals is further than third round. So that's better than third round.\n- 2011: 'lq' \u2013 same as above.\n\nSo in 2008 and 2010-2011, she advanced beyond the third round. In 2007 and 2009, it's unclear or she didn't advance. Therefore, she didn't make it to the third round every year from 2007-2011. The claim says five years in a row, so that would require her to do it each consecutive year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding 'a' as absence. If 'a' means she was present but didn't advance past the first round, then in 2007 and 2009, she did participate but lost early. So she didn't reach the third round those years.\n\nSo, only in 2008, 2010, and 2011 did she reach beyond the third round. That's three times, not five consecutive years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because she didn't advance to the third round each of the five years mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Olga Govortsova did not advance to the third round in the French Open for all five years from 2007 to 2011. She only achieved this in 2008, 2010, and 2011.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"french open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2007\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2010\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
