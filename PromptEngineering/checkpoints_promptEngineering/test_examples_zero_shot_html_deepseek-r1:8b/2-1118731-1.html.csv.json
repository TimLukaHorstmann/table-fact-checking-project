    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: generation, years, engine, power, torque, induction. The relevant part here is the 'power' column because the claim refers to it.\n\nI should find all rows where \"years\" include 1972 and check the corresponding 'power' value. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row with i and 1971: doesn't apply.\n- Rows from i, 1971-1973: also don't include 1972 specifically.\n- Looking for rows where \"years\" is exactly 1972.\n\nI spot a row where \"generation\" is 'ii', and \"years\" is '1977 - 1978' with a different engine. Not applicable. Wait, actually, I might have missed it. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nWait, the first few rows are for generation i in 1971, then 1971-73, etc. Then comes generation ii starting from 1977. So 1972 is not covered under 'ii' yet. Wait, no, perhaps I need to check if any row specifically mentions 1972.\n\nLooking again: \n\nThe rows are grouped by generation i and ii. For generation i, the years go up to 1973. Then for generation ii, it starts in 1977-78, then 1979, etc. There's no row that exactly matches 1972. \n\nWait, but looking closely, is there a row where \"years\" is '1972'? No, the rows have years like '1971', '1971-73', '1972' in some cases? Let me check.\n\nAh! Here's a row: generation ii, years 1977-78. So no, that's not 1972. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The user is asking about the 1972 engine, so perhaps there's an exact match.\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nLooking for any row where \"years\" includes 1972. Let me scan each row's \"years\" column.\n\nRow 1: i, 1971\nRow 2: i, 1971-73\nRow 3: i, 1972\nYes! Here it is. Third row in the table is for generation i and year 1972. So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, what's the 'power' value for this row? The table shows \"n/a\" which I think stands for not available or not given. So the power isn't specified here.\n\nThe claim says that \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\". If the power is listed as 'n/a', it means it's not provided, so the claim would be correct because the power isn't specified in hp or kw.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the row where \"years\" is 1972 and the \"power\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is where the year is exactly 1972 and the 'power' value is listed as 'n/a'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
