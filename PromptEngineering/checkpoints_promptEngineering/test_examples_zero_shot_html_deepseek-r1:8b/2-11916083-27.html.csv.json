    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the highest issue price is $24.95 and the lowest is $15.95.\" So, I should check if in the table, there's a maximum of 24.95 and a minimum of 15.95 in the 'issue price' column.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'issue price' values from each row. The table has multiple rows, each with a year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. I'm focusing on the 'issue price' column.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Most entries are 15.95 or 24.95.\n- In 2008, there are several instances of both 15.95 and 24.95.\n- Similarly, in 2009, all issue prices are either 24.95 or higher? Wait, no, actually, looking closer:\n\nWait, for 2009, all the issue prices are 24.95 except... Hmm, no, checking again: in 2009, every row has 24.95 as the issue price. So in 2008, there are both 15.95 and 24.95, but in 2009, only 24.95.\n\nSo for each year:\n\n- 2008: Both 15.95 and 24.95 exist.\n- 2009: Only 24.95 exists.\n\nNow, considering the entire table across all years:\n\nThe highest issue price is indeed 24.95 because that's the maximum in both 2008 and 2009. The lowest is 15.95, which also appears in multiple rows.\n\nBut wait, does every year have both? For 2008, yes, but for 2009, only 24.95 is present. So in the entire dataset, 15.95 still exists as a price, so it's the minimum across all years. The maximum is consistently 24.95.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds because there's an issue price of $24.95 (highest) and one of $15.95 (lowest). Even though 2009 doesn't have 15.95, since 2008 does, the overall dataset includes both prices. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"1 third of the coin from coin and puck set\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions a specific fraction of a coin related to a particular set.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns seem to be 'year', 'theme', 'artist', 'issue price', and 'special notes'. The claim is specifically about \"coin from coin and puck set,\" so I should focus on rows where the 'special notes' mention this set and see if any coins are being referenced in a third.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row to check for entries related to \"coin and puck set.\" Scanning down, I notice that several rows have \"from coin and puck set\" as their special note. For example, the first row (row 0) has this note, and similarly, rows 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 also mention this set.\n\nNow, looking at the 'issue price' column for these rows, each entry is either $15.95 or $24.95. The claim talks about a \"1/3 of the coin,\" so I need to see if there's any indication that a third is being sold or part of the set. However, in all these entries, the issue price is either 15.95 or 24.95, which don't mention anything about thirds.\n\nI also notice that the 'artist' column has \"n / a\" for all rows except when the theme is Calgary Flames in 2009, but that's not relevant here. The 'theme' seems to vary across different teams, and I'm looking for specific mentions of coins or fractions.\n\nSince none of the special notes for \"coin and puck set\" mention a third, there's no direct support for the claim. The issue prices are fixed, so unless there's additional data about how many coins come in the set, it's hard to calculate a third. Without that information, I can't confirm if 1/3 of the coin is being sold.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there's no evidence supporting the claim that one third of the coin from the \"coin and puck set\" is being offered.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"special notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"special notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"special notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"special notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"special notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"special notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"special notes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the toronto maple leaf coin sell for both 24.95 and 15.95\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It states that the Toronto Maple Leaf coins are sold at two different prices: $24.95 and $15.95. So, I need to find entries in the table for Toronto Maple Leafs with both these issue prices.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. The relevant columns here are 'issue price' because that's where the pricing information is, and perhaps 'theme' to confirm it's about Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. Scanning through the rows, I find several entries for \"toronto maple leafs\" (note: spelling is consistent as per the table). Each of these has an issue price. \n\n2. For each occurrence of \"toronto maple leafs\", there are two issue prices listed:\n   - The first entry has a price of 15.95 and notes it's from the \"coin and puck set\".\n   - The second entry for that team has a higher price of 24.95, specifically mentioned as part of the \"toronto maple leafs gift set\".\n\n3. Therefore, both prices are present for Toronto Maple Leaf coins in different rows.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or missing data that would contradict this.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"all of the coin in 2009 have an issue price of 24.95.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that every coin released by each team in 2009 had a single issue price of $24.95. So my task is to check all the relevant rows for 2009 and see if their issue prices are all 24.95.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that it has columns: year, theme, artist, issue price, special notes. The years in the table go from 2008 to 2009, with 2009 starting from row 13 onwards (since there are 14 entries for 2008 and then 7 for 2009).\n\nFor 2009, each team has one entry where the issue price is listed as \"24.95.\" For example:\n\n- Calgary Flames: 2009, $24.95\n- Edmonton Oilers: 2009, $24.95\n- Montreal Canadiens: 2009, $24.95\n- Ottawa Senators: 2009, $24.95\n- Toronto Maple Leafs: 2009, $24.95\n- Vancouver Canucks: 2009, $24.95\n\nAll these entries for 2009 have the issue price of 24.95. Now, I need to check if all these are the only coins released in 2009 or if there are more that might have different prices.\n\nBut looking at the table, each team only has one coin release per year. For example, Calgary Flames in 2008 have two entries (15.95 and 24.95), but in 2009, they only have one entry for 24.95. The same pattern applies to all other teams: in 2008, some have two entries with different prices, but in 2009, each has a single entry at 24.95.\n\nTherefore, since every coin from 2009 listed in the table has an issue price of 24.95, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"each theme be use 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means.\n\nThe claim says that each theme appears exactly three times in the table. So, my task is to check how many times each 'theme' occurs across all rows.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has a 'year', 'theme', 'artist', 'issue price', and 'special notes'. The relevant column for this claim is the 'theme' column.\n\nI'll go through each row and count the occurrences of each theme.\n\nStarting with 'calgary flames':\n- 2008: appears twice (once with issue price 15.95, once with 24.95)\nWait, no, looking at the table, under 'year' 2008, Calgary Flames have two entries: one with $15.95 and another with $24.95. Then in 2009, there's another Calgary Flames entry with $24.95.\n\nSo Calgary Flames appear three times:\n- 2008 (x2) and 2009 (x1). Wait, that's actually four times if I count each row separately. Wait no, the claim is about each theme being used three times. So Calgary Flames have entries in 2008 (two rows) and 2009 (one row), totaling three instances. No, wait: 2008 has two separate rows for Calgary Flames, so that's two, plus 2009 makes it three. Wait no, 2008 has two rows but the same theme, so it's counted as one instance per year? Or does each row count as a separate occurrence?\n\nWait, no. Each row is a separate entry, even if the same team is listed multiple times in the same year or different years. So Calgary Flames appear in four different rows: 2008 (two rows), and 2009 (one). Wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Calgary Flames are present in:\n  - 2008, first row.\n  - 2008, second row.\n  - 2009, ninth row.\n\nThat's three rows. So each theme is used three times. But wait, no, because in 2008 they have two entries, so that's more than once per year, but the claim is about each theme being used three times overall, regardless of year.\n\nWait, the claim says \"each theme be use 3 time.\" So for each team (theme), how many times do they appear as 'theme' in the table?\n\nLet me list all themes and their counts:\n\n1. Calgary Flames: appears in rows 0,1,8 \u2192 three times.\n2. Edmonton Oilers: rows 2,3 \u2192 two times.\n3. Montreal Canadiens: rows 4,5 \u2192 two times.\n4. Ottawa Senators: rows 6,7 \u2192 two times.\n5. Toronto Maple Leafs: rows 9,10 \u2192 two times.\n6. Vancouver Canucks: rows 11,12 \u2192 two times.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the table provided, I see more entries for some teams. Let me recount properly:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n0: Calgary Flames\n1: Calgary Flames\n2: Edmonton Oilers\n3: Edmonton Oilers\n4: Montreal Canadiens\n5: Montreal Canadiens\n6: Ottawa Senators\n7: Ottawa Senators\n8: Toronto Maple Leafs\n9: Toronto Maple Leafs\n10: Vancouver Canucks\n11: Vancouver Canucks\n12: Vancouver Canucks\n\nWait, no. Let me list each row's theme:\n\nRow 0: Calgary Flames\nRow 1: Calgary Flames\nRow 2: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 3: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 4: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 5: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 6: Ottawa Senators\nRow 7: Ottawa Senators\nRow 8: Toronto Maple Leafs\nRow 9: Toronto Maple Leafs\nRow 10: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 11: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 12: Vancouver Canucks\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me count each row from the provided table:\n\nLooking back at the table structure, it's a bit confusing because the HTML isn't properly formatted, but I think the rows are as follows:\n\n1. Calgary Flames (2008)\n2. Calgary Flames (2008)\n3. Edmonton Oilers (2008)\n4. Edmonton Oilers (2008)\n5. Montreal Canadiens (2008)\n6. Montreal Canadiens (2008)\n7. Ottawa Senators (2008)\n8. Ottawa Senators (2008)\n9. Toronto Maple Leafs (2008)\n10. Toronto Maple Leaves? Wait, no. Let me try to list each row correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all the themes in order as they appear in the table:\n\nRow 0: Calgary Flames\nRow 1: Calgary Flames\nRow 2: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 3: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 4: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 5: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 6: Ottawa Senators\nRow 7: Ottawa Senators\nRow 8: Toronto Maple Leafs\nRow 9: Toronto Maple Leaves (I think it's Toronto Maple Leafs)\nRow 10: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 11: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 12: Vancouver Canucks\n\nWait, but the table has 13 rows (0-12). Let me recount each theme:\n\nCalgary Flames: Rows 0,1 \u2192 two times.\nEdmonton Oilers: Rows 2,3 \u2192 two times.\nMontreal Canadiens: Rows 4,5 \u2192 two times.\nOttawa Senators: Rows 6,7 \u2192 two times.\nToronto Maple Leafs: Rows 8,9 \u2192 two times.\nVancouver Canucks: Rows 10,11,12 \u2192 three times.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because in the table provided earlier, the last few rows are:\n\n8. Toronto Maple Leaves? Or Leafs?\n9. Vancouver Canucks\n10. Vancouver Canucks\n11. Vancouver Canucks\n\nNo, let me get this right. The table has 13 rows (0-12). Let's list them all with their themes:\n\nRow 0: Calgary Flames\nRow 1: Calgary Flames\nRow 2: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 3: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 4: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 5: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 6: Ottawa Senators\nRow 7: Ottawa Senators\nRow 8: Toronto Maple Leafs\nRow 9: Toronto Maple Leaves? No, it's Toronto Maple Leafs.\nRow 10: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 11: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 12: Vancouver Canucks\n\nWait, so:\n\n- Calgary Flames: 2 times (Rows 0,1)\n- Edmonton Oilers: 2 times (Rows 2,3)\n- Montreal Canadiens: 2 times (4,5)\n- Ottawa Senators: 2 times (6,7)\n- Toronto Maple Leafs: 2 times (8,9)\n- Vancouver Canucks: 3 times (10,11,12)\n\nSo the claim is \"each theme be use 3 time.\" But some themes are used twice. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but wait. The claim says \"each theme be use 3 time,\" meaning each theme must appear exactly three times. However, Vancouver Canucks appear three times, while others appear two or less. So not all themes meet the criteria.\n\nBut looking back at the table, perhaps I miscounted. Let me make sure:\n\nTotal rows: 13 (0-12)\n\nThemes:\nCalgary Flames: Rows 0,1 \u2192 2\nEdmonton Oilers: 2,3 \u2192 2\nMontreal Canadiens:4,5\u21922\nOttawa Senators:6,7\u21922\nToronto Maple Leafs:8,9\u21922\nVancouver Canucks:10,11,12\u21923\n\nYes, so only Vancouver Canucks appear three times. The rest appear two times.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"each theme be use 3 time\" is incorrect because not all themes meet this condition.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the initial description of the table:\n\nThe user provided a table with 13 entries (from Row 0 to Row 12), each with a \"Theme\" column.\n\nThemes listed are:\n\nRow 0: Calgary Flames\nRow 1: Calgary Flames\nRow 2: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 3: Edmonton Oilers\nRow 4: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 5: Montreal Canadiens\nRow 6: Ottawa Senators\nRow 7: Ottawa Senators\nRow 8: Toronto Maple Leafs\nRow 9: Toronto Maple Leaves? No, it's likely Toronto Maple Leafs.\nRow 10: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 11: Vancouver Canucks\nRow 12: Vancouver Canucks\n\nThus, the count is as above.\n\nTherefore, the claim that each theme appears three times is incorrect because most appear two times, and only one appears three times.\n\nHence, the task is to determine whether the claim holds. Since not all themes meet the condition, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"each theme be use 3 time\" is incorrect because not all themes appear exactly three times in the provided table. Only the Vancouver Canucks theme meets this criterion, while the others appear two or fewer times.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false. Not every theme appears three times; only Vancouver Canucks do so.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim says. The user provided: \"the highest issue price 24.95 and the lowest be 14.95.\" Hmm, wait, that seems a bit off. Maybe they meant \"the highest issue price is 24.95 and the lowest is 14.95.\" That makes more sense.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check for each row if there's an issue price of 24.95 (highest) and 14.95 (lowest). The columns relevant here are \"year,\" \"theme,\" \"artist,\" \"issue price,\" and \"special notes.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- For 2008, Calgary Flames: Issue price is either 15.95 or 24.95. So, 24.95 is the highest for them.\n- Edmonton Oilers same as Calgary: 15.95 and 24.95.\n- Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks all have both prices.\n- For 2009, Calgary Flames onwards, only 24.95.\n\nWait, but I don't see any issue price of 14.95 in the table. All the \"issue price\" cells are either 15.95 or 24.95. So, if the claim says the lowest is 14.95, that's not true because the lowest in the table is 15.95.\n\nSo, the claim includes a part that's incorrect because there's no 14.95 issue price. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"issue price\" column is definitely important because both 24.95 and the missing 14.95 are mentioned. Also, rows where these prices occur should be included.\n\nLet's list all the rows with 24.95:\n\n- Calgary Flames (2008)\n- Edmonton Oilers (2008)\n- Montreal Canadiens (2008)\n- Ottawa Senators (2008)\n- Toronto Maple Leafs (2008)\n- Vancouver Canucks (2008)\n- Calgary Flames (2009)\n- Edmonton Oilers (2009)\n- Montreal Canadiens (2009)\n- Ottawa Senators (2009)\n- Toronto Maple Leafs (2009)\n- Vancouver Canucks (2009)\n\nEach of these has the highest price, so all their \"issue price\" cells are relevant. Also, since the claim mentions 14.95 and it's not present, but to check if there was any instance, I should look through all rows. But none have 14.95, so perhaps the absence is important.\n\nBut according to the instructions, we need to find which cells are relevant for verifying the claim. Since the claim includes both a high (24.95) and low (14.95), but only 24.95 exists, any cell with 24.95 is relevant because it's part of the claim. So, all rows where issue price is 24.95 need to be included.\n\nSo, in total, there are 12 rows where issue price is 24.95. Each of these has \"row_index\" from 0 to 11 (since there are 14 data rows, but some might not have 24.95). Wait, let me count:\n\nLooking at the table, each team appears twice except maybe Calgary? Let's see:\n\nCalgary Flames: two entries (2008 and 2009)\nEdmonton Oilers: two entries\n Montreal Canadiens: two\nOttawa Senators: two\nToronto Maple Leafs: two\nVancouver Canucks: two\n\nSo that's 12 rows with issue price 24.95.\n\nEach of these should be included in relevant_cells as they have the highest price mentioned.\n\nAdditionally, since the claim mentions a lowest of 14.95, which doesn't exist, perhaps we need to check if any cell has 14.95 to confirm its absence, but it's not present. So, maybe including all cells where issue price is 24.95 and noting that none have 14.95 would be necessary.\n\nBut according to the instructions, relevant_cells should include cells that are relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim includes both a highest and lowest, and we need to check for each part. So, for the highest (24.95), all those cells are relevant. For the lowest (14.95), since it's not present, perhaps any cell with 14.95 is also needed, but there are none. Alternatively, maybe just the 24.95 cells are sufficient because the claim includes both, and if one part is incorrect, the entire claim fails.\n\nSo, I think including all 12 cells where issue price is 24.95 would be appropriate to show that the highest exists, but since the lowest doesn't exist either, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "1 half of the coin from coin and puck set",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a \"coin from coin and puck set,\" specifically stating that \"1 half of the coin\" is involved. So, this implies that each coin in the set has two halves, and one half is being considered here.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. The rows represent different entries for various teams from 2008 to 2009.\n\nI'm particularly interested in the 'special notes' column because that's where information about the sets might be located. Each row in the table has a 'special notes' entry, which describes how the set was obtained. For example, one row says \"from coin and puck set,\" another says \"from calgary flames gift set,\" etc.\n\nSince the claim is about a coin from a specific set (\"coin and puck set\"), I should focus on rows where the 'special notes' mention this particular set. Let me scan through each row's special notes:\n\n- 2008 Calgary Flames: from coin and puck set\n- 2008 Edmonton Oilers: same\n- Similarly, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks all have entries mentioning \"from coin and puck set.\"\n\nSo these rows are relevant because they describe the sets we're interested in.\n\nNow, looking at the 'issue price' column. The issue prices vary between 15.95 and 24.95. The claim is about a specific part of the coin, not the entire set's value. However, the presence of \"coin\" suggests that perhaps each team has an associated coin, maybe as part of their gift sets.\n\nBut wait, in all the relevant rows (those mentioning the coin and puck set), the issue price for these teams is either 15.95 or 24.95. This could indicate two different priced items within the same set\u2014perhaps a single item versus a bundle. \n\nIf \"1 half of the coin\" refers to a specific pricing point, we need to see if that's consistent across all relevant rows. However, since each row is for a different team and has different issue prices, it's unclear whether 15.95 or 24.95 corresponds to one half.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the price of just the coin part. If so, we'd need to see if each coin from these sets consistently costs either 15.95 or 24.95, but since both prices are present, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, another angle: the 'special notes' don't mention anything about the price of a half-coin; they just describe the set. So perhaps the claim is not about the monetary value but about the existence of a half-coin in each set.\n\nLooking at the 'artist' column, which lists teams, and the 'year,' there's no information on coin halves. The only relevant data points are the issue prices and special notes.\n\nGiven that the 'special notes' don't specify anything about halves or pricing beyond the set origin, I'm leaning towards the claim not being fully supported by the table. There's no direct evidence in the provided data that each \"coin from the coin and puck set\" has a half-coin. The issue prices might relate to the entire set or individual items within it, but without specific information about halves, we can't confirm the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the given table, the claim doesn't have sufficient support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"special_notes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the toronto maple leaf coin sell for both 27.95 and 15.95\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions that the Toronto Maple Leaf coin sells for both 27.95 and 15.95. So, I need to check if there are entries in the table where the price is either of these amounts for the Toronto Maple Leaf coins.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. The relevant column here is \"issue price.\" I should focus on this column for each row involving the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nNext, I'll scan through each row to see if any pertain to the Toronto Maple Leaf team. Scrolling down the table, I find rows where the theme is \"toronto maple leafs\" or similar (I notice that sometimes it's spelled as \"toronto maple leafs\"). \n\nNow, for each of these rows, I'll note their issue price:\n\n- Row 8: 15.95\n- Row 9: 24.95\n- Row 10: 15.95\n- Row 11: 24.95\n\nWait, so in the table, the prices are either 15.95 or 24.95 for Toronto Maple Leaf coins. There's no row where the price is 27.95.\n\nThe claim states that they sell for both 27.95 and 15.95. From the table, I see that 15.95 exists, but there's no entry for 27.95. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n\nI should also check if any rows have a price of 27.95. Skimming through all the rows again, I don't see any issue price of 27.95 listed for Toronto Maple Leaf coins. The highest price is 24.95.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is incorrect because there's no evidence in the table that the coin sells for both stated prices. Only 15.95 and 24.95 are present.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for Toronto Maple Leaf coins and their issue prices. The table shows prices of $15.95 and $24.95, but not $27.95.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"issue price\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"all of the coin in 2008 have an issue price of 24.95\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The relevant columns seem to be 'year', 'theme', 'artist', 'issue price', and 'special notes'. The claim specifically mentions \"all of the coin in 2008\" so I should focus on rows where the year is 2008.\n\nLooking through the table, all the entries for 2008 have either an issue price of 15.95 or 24.95. For example, the Calgary Flames row has both prices: one at 15.95 and another at 24.95. Similarly, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, etc., have two entries each with both prices.\n\nThe claim says that all coins in 2008 have an issue price of 24.95. But from the table, I can see that some coins have a lower price of 15.95. Therefore, not all coins in 2008 have the issue price of 24.95; only some do. This means the claim is false.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. For each row where year is 2008 and the issue price is either 15.95 or 24.95, I need to note their 'row_index' and 'column_name'. Since it's a table, each row has an index based on its position starting from 0.\n\nSo, for 2008 rows:\n\n- Row 0: Calgary Flames, $15.95\n- Row 1: Calgary Flames, $24.95\n- Row 2: Edmonton Oilers, $15.95\n- Row 3: Edmonton Oilers, $24.95\n- And so on, up to row 21 (Vancouver Canucks), with some having both prices.\n\nEach of these rows has an issue price that isn't all 24.95, so the claim is false, and these cells are relevant.\n\nI should list each relevant cell's row index and column name.
