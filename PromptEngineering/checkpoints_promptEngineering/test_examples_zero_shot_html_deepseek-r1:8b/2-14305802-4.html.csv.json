    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first: \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977 - 78 season to the los angeles king.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details like the game number, date, opponent, score, record, and points. The key parts of the claim are:\n\n1. Philadelphia Flyers lost the game.\n2. It's the 22nd game of the 1977-78 season.\n3. They lost to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nFirst, I need to find the row corresponding to game number 22. Scanning through the table, I see that game 22 is in the first row (row index 0). The opponent for game 22 is listed as \"los angeles kings.\" So that's a match.\n\nNext, checking the outcome of that game. The score is shown as \"4 - 2,\" which indicates that the Flyers lost because the opposing team has the higher number (2 in this case, but typically, if it's written as opponent's score first, then the result is determined by who won). Wait, actually, the structure here is a bit unclear. In hockey, goals are usually listed as home and away, but in this table, it's presented as \"opponent's score - Flyers' score.\" So for game 22, the opponent (Los Angeles Kings) scored 4, and the Flyers scored 2. That means the Flyers lost the game.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the table: game number 22, opponent Los Angeles Kings, and the Flyers lost with a score of 4-2.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "claim": "the cleveland baron score no point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify the relevant cells in the table that support this determination.\n\nThe claim is: \"the cleveland baron score no point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two teams: Cleveland Baron and Philadelphia Flyer. The game was supposed to be played on December 21st. Looking at the table, each row represents a game with the date in the \"december\" column.\n\nI'll start by looking through the \"december\" column to find if there's a game on December 21st. Scanning the numbers: 1,3,7,8,10,11,15,17,18,21,23,28,29,31,23,28,29,31... Wait, no December 21st here. The closest dates are 21 and 23. So there's no game on the 21st.\n\nNext, checking the opponent column for games around that time. Looking at row indices where date is near 21: row 27 has a game against Cleveland Barons, but that's on December 11th. Row 30 is on December 18th against Montreal Canadiens, and row 31 is December 21st? Wait no, looking back, the \"december\" column has values like 1,3,7,... up to 35 games.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list out all the dates:\n\nRow 0: 1\nRow1:3\nRow2:7\nRow3:8\nRow4:10\nRow5:11\nRow6:15\nRow7:17\nRow8:18\nRow9:21\nRow10:23\n... and so on.\n\nAh, row index 9 is December 21st. So that's game number 30 (since numbering starts at 22 as the first game? Wait no, looking back, game numbers are from 22 to 35, each corresponding to a specific date in December. So game 30 would be row index 8 because it's the 9th row if we start counting from 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recheck: the first row (index 0) is game 22 on Dec 1, next is 23 on Dec 3, then 24 on Dec7, etc., up to game 35 on Dec31. So game 30 would be row index 8 (since 22+8=30). Wait no, 22 + n = 30 \u2192 n=8, so row index 8 is game 30 on Dec18.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbering is off because the \"game\" column starts at 22 for Dec1. So each game number increments by 1 each day in December. So game 22: Dec1, game23:Dec3,... up to game35:Dec31.\n\nSo December21st would be game number 30 (since from Dec1 to Dec21 is 20 days, but considering the table skips some dates, like Dec2,4, etc., so each entry isn't consecutive days. Hmm, maybe it's better to look for the date \"21\" in the \"december\" column.\n\nLooking through the \"december\" column values: 1,3,7,8,10,11,15,17,18,21,... So yes, row index 9 has december=21. That would be game number 30 (since starting from 22, each increment is +1 per row). Wait, no\u2014game numbers are listed as 22,23,...35 in the first column, so the \"december\" column's first entry is Dec1 for game22, then Dec3 for game23, and so on.\n\nSo, in the table, December21st corresponds to game30 (row index9). Now, looking at the opponents: what was playing on Dec21st? The \"opponent\" column for row9 would be... Wait, I don't have that data. Oh wait, the table shows only the opponent's name in the first cell but I think it might be truncated.\n\nWait, no, the initial table provided shows each row with three columns: game number, december date, and opponent. But perhaps the user didn't include all details. Wait, looking back, the user's table has:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Game</th>\n      <th>december</th>\n      <th>Opponent</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    ... many rows ...\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nSo each row has Game number, December date, and Opponent. So for game30 on Dec21st (row index9), what is the opponent? If I had to check that, but since I don't have the exact opponents listed, perhaps the claim refers to a specific opponent: Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nSo the claim says Cleveland Baron scored no points against 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyer on Dec21. First, check if there was a game between Cleveland Baron and Philadelphia Flyer on Dec21.\n\nLooking at row9 (game30, Dec21), what is the opponent? If it's not Philadelphia Flyer, then the claim might be false. Alternatively, perhaps in another row, maybe the Flyers played against another team on Dec21. Wait, but the claim specifically mentions the date Dec21st and the opponents as Cleveland Baron vs. Philadelphia Flyer.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, the opponent for each game is fixed\u2014each row is a single game with one opponent. So if the claim says that on Dec21, Cleveland Baron played against Philadelphia Flyer, then we need to check both the date and the opponent in that specific game.\n\nSo first, find if there's a game on Dec21 where Cleveland Baron was the home team (or opponent). Looking at row9: December=21. What is the opponent for that row? Let me think\u2014since I can't see the exact opponents, perhaps I need to assume that it's not Philadelphia Flyer.\n\nWait, but in the table provided by the user, looking back, it starts from Game22 on Dec1 up to Game35 on Dec31. Each row has a date in December and an opponent. So for example:\n\nRow0: Game22, Dec1, Opponent=?\n\nRow1: Game23, Dec3, Opponent=?\n\n... \n\nBut without knowing the exact opponents for each game, it's difficult. However, perhaps I can infer based on known schedules.\n\nWait, in reality, the 1977-78 season of Philadelphia Flyers had games against various teams. Did they play against Cleveland Baron (which was actually the barons might have been the name of a team, but perhaps in this context, it's a fictional team).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is false because there was no game between those two teams on Dec21.\n\nBut given that I don't have the exact opponents for each game, I can only look at the table structure. So first, check if there's a game on Dec21: yes, row9 (game30) is on Dec21. Now, check who the opponent was for that game. If it wasn't Philadelphia Flyer, then the claim is false.\n\nBut without knowing the exact opponent for game30, I can't say for sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the given table, the opponent for game30 is someone else, making the claim false.\n\nWait, another approach: the user's example response involved looking at relevant cells by their row indices and column names. So in this case, to verify the claim, we need to check if there was a game on Dec21 between those two teams.\n\nSo first, find the game on Dec21: that would be row9 (if starting from 0). Then, check if the opponent for that game is Philadelphia Flyer. But without knowing that, perhaps the answer is \"FALSE\" because either no such game occurred or the opponents weren't as stated.\n\nBut since the table doesn't provide the opponents, maybe I can only look at the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is false because there was no such game on Dec21, but looking back, in the table, there is a row with December=21 (row9), so that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to 1977-78 Flyers, but if they didn't play Cleveland Baron on Dec21, then it's false. Alternatively, maybe they did play, and the score was zero.\n\nBut without knowing the exact opponent for game30, I can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to test identifying that there is a game on Dec21 between those two teams.\n\nIn any case, based on the information given, if we assume that the table includes all necessary details, then:\n\n- The claim requires checking if there was a game on Dec21 between Cleveland Baron and Philadelphia Flyer.\n- In the table, row9 (Game30) is on Dec21. So we need to check what opponent they played against.\n\nAssuming that in row9, the opponent is not Philadelphia Flyer, then the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- The game number: Game30\n- December date: 21\n- Opponent: (needs to be Philadelphia Flyer)\n\nBut since I don't have the exact opponents listed, perhaps the answer is that it's false because there was no such opponent on Dec21, or the score wasn't zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to recognize that in order to verify this claim, we would need to check those specific cells.\n\nIn any case, without more information, I can't definitively say if the claim is true or false. However, based on the structure of the table, it's possible to identify which row corresponds to Dec21 (row9) and then check the opponent for that game.\n\nTherefore, to determine the truthfulness of the claim, we would need to look at:\n\n1. The game number: 30\n2. The December date: 21\n3. The opponent: Philadelphia Flyer\n\nIf all three match in the table, then it's true; otherwise, false.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the answer is that it's false because either there was no game on Dec21 or the opponents weren't as stated.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact details, I can only conclude based on the structure.\n\nSo, to sum up, if we need to identify which cells are relevant, they would be:\n\n- Row corresponding to Dec21: row9\n- The opponent's cell in that row\n\nTherefore, the relevant columns are 'Game', 'december', and 'Opponent'.\n\nHence, the answer is \"False\" because either there was no game on Dec21 between those teams or their opponents didn't match.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since I can't confirm the exact opponent, but given that it's a specific claim, it's likely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **false**. To verify, one would need to check the opponent for the game on December 21 (Game30). Since the table does not provide this information, we cannot confirm that Cleveland Baron faced Philadelphia Flyer on that date.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

The claim says: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win the 24th and 25th game of the season against the new york ranger.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the HTML table to understand what data it contains. The table has columns for 'game', 'december', 'opponent', 'score', 'record', and 'points'. Each row represents a specific game, probably from the 1977-78 season based on the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions two games: the 24th and 25th of the season against the New York Rangers. So I need to find in the table if there are entries for game numbers 24 and 25 where the opponent is the New York Rangers, and whether the Flyers won those games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'game' number and an 'opponent' column. The 'game' numbers go from 22 up to 35, which suggests they are likely part of the same season, possibly starting in December as indicated by the 'december' column.\n\nI'll start by checking for game 24 and see if the opponent is the New York Rangers. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Game 24: Opponent is New York Rangers, score is 3 - 3, record is 16 - 4 - 4.\n- Game 25: Opponent is also New York Rangers, score is 7 - 4, record is 17 - 4 - 4.\n\nSo both game 24 and 25 are against the New York Rangers. Now, I need to check if the Flyers won these games. The 'score' column shows the result for each game. \n\nFor game 24: Score is 3 - 3. That's a tie, not a win.\nFor game 25: Score is 7 - 4. That's a win.\n\nSo the claim says they won both the 24th and 25th games against the NYR. But according to the table, game 24 was a tie, and game 25 was a win. Therefore, only game 25 is a win, not both 24 and 25.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says they won the 24th and 25th games. If game 24 was a tie, it's not a win, so that part isn't correct. So the claim would be FALSE because only one of those two games was a win.\n\nBut wait again, perhaps I misread. Let me double-check the 'score' for each game:\n\nLooking at row for game 24: Score is 3 - 3. Yes, that's a tie.\nGame 25: 7 - 4. That's a Flyers' win.\n\nSo yes, only game 25 was won, not both 24 and 25. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states they won both games, which isn't true for game 24. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24 - 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25 - 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer lose by 5 point to the boston bruin\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a specific season (1977-78), a team (Philadelphia Flyers), an opponent (Boston Bruins), and the result of the game\u2014a loss by 5 points.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: game, december, opponent, score, record, and points. Each row represents a different game. The game numbers go from 22 to 35, which probably correspond to multiple games in December 1977 or 78. \n\nWait, but the claim refers to a specific season\u20141977-78. So I need to check if there's a game in that season where the Flyers lost by 5 points against the Bruins. But the table might not have all the games from that entire season, just some in December maybe.\n\nI should look for games where the opponent is Boston Bruins and see their scores. In the table, I can see rows 28, 32, and 33 where the opponent is the Boston Bruins. \n\nLooking at row 28: score is 6 - 4, so the Flyers won by 2 points. Not a loss.\n\nRow 32: score is 1 - 6, which means the Bruins won by 5 points. The Flyers lost this game by 5 points. That seems relevant. So that would be one cell\u2014game 32, opponent Boston Bruins, and the score shows the Flyers lost by 5.\n\nBut wait, the claim says the Flyers lost by 5 points. However, in row 32, the score is 1 - 6. Since the game is about points, I need to check how the points are calculated. The \"points\" column shows the total points for that game, but maybe the difference isn't directly there.\n\nWait, no\u2014the \"score\" column shows the result as goals-for and goals-against, like \"4 - 2\". So in row 32, it's \"1 - 6\", meaning the Bruins scored 6 goals and Flyers only 1. So the Flyers lost by 5 goals (6-1=5). Therefore, that game matches the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where opponent is Boston Bruins and score shows a loss by 5 points. In this case, row 32 (game 32) has opponent as Boston Bruins and a loss of 5 points.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there's a game where the Philadelphia Flyers lost by 5 points against the Boston Bruins in the 1977-78 season.\n\nLooking through the table, specifically for games involving the Boston Bruins:\n\n- **Row 28**: Opponent is Boston Bruins, score is 6 - 4 (Flyers won).\n- **Row 32**: Opponent is Boston Bruins, score is 1 - 6. This means the Flyers lost by 5 points.\n\nThis matches the claim, so it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the philadelphia flyer lose the 22nd game of the 1977 - 78 season to the colorado rockies.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions a game number (22), a season (1977-78), and an opponent (colorado rockies). The Flyers are the team in question losing this game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with a specific date labeled \"december\" followed by a number. For example, row 1 is game 22 on December 1.

The claim says: \"the cleveland baron score the most point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what each part means and which cells in the table might be relevant.\n\nThe claim mentions three specific things:\n1. The team: Cleveland Baron\n2. The opponent: 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers\n3. The date: December 21st\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I notice that it doesn't have a column for the year of the game or the exact date beyond the month. Let me check the columns in the table to see what's available.\n\nThe table has the following columns:\n- game (which seems to be an identifier, perhaps the game number)\n- december\n- opponent\n- score\n- record\n- points\n\nSo, the \"december\" column probably refers to the month of the game. The \"game\" column might indicate which game it is, but I'm not sure if those are sequential or correspond to real games from a specific year.\n\nThe claim specifies December 21st, but in the table, the dates under \"december\" range from 1 to 31, which suggests that each row represents a different day in December. So, looking for a game played on December 21st would mean finding a row where the \"december\" column is 21.\n\nNext, the opponent in the claim is the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers. However, looking at the table's \"opponent\" column, I see names like \"los angeles kings,\" \"colorado rockies,\" \"new york rangers,\" etc., but none of them mention the Philadelphia Flyers. This could be a problem because if the opponent isn't listed in the table as the Flyers, then the claim might not hold.\n\nBut wait, maybe the table is from a different season or context. The dates go up to December 31st, which would cover the entire month of December. However, without more context about the years, it's hard to say whether these games are indeed from 1977-78. The \"december\" column only shows numbers, not years.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions that the Cleveland Baron scored the most points against the Flyers on December 21st. So, I need to check if there was a game between the Cleveland Baron and the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st in this table, and whether the Baron's score was higher than any other game they played that month.\n\nBut first, looking at the opponents again: none of them are Flyers. The closest is \"cleveland barons\" playing against different teams like Kings, Rockies, Rangers, etc. So maybe the opponent in the table isn't the Flyers, which would make the claim false because the specific matchup mentioned doesn't exist here.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if there's any game where the opponent is the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st. Since the table doesn't list them as opponents, this part of the claim isn't supported.\n\nAnother point: looking at the \"points\" column for games involving Cleveland Baron, such as row 6 (game 27), they scored 42 points against the Barons, but I'm not sure if that's against the Flyers. Since the opponent in that game is Cleveland Barons again, it's unclear.\n\nWait, actually, looking at row 27: opponent is \"cleveland barons.\" So that's a game between two teams with similar names? That might be a typo or perhaps two different teams. But regardless, the opponent isn't the Flyers, so the specific matchup in the claim isn't present here.\n\nTherefore, since the table doesn't show any games involving the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st, and the opponents listed don't include them, the claim isn't supported. Additionally, even if such a game existed, without knowing the points scored by both teams, we can't confirm that Cleveland Baron had the highest points.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the table doesn't list any games against the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st, so the claim's premise isn't met.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided table because there are no entries for a game between the Cleveland Baron and the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st. The relevant cells must be identified to confirm this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win most of the game of the season against the new york ranger.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's about the 1977-78 season for the Philadelphia Flyers playing against the New York Rangers. Specifically, it mentions winning \"most of the games\" in the season against the Rangers.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the 'game' column has numbers like 22,23,...35. These are likely game numbers. The 'december' column shows dates, so the games might be spread across different months. \n\nThe 'opponent' column lists the teams they played against, including the New York Rangers a few times (like in row 24 and 33). The 'score' column shows the game outcomes, with something like \"4 - 2\" indicating a Flyers win.\n\nI need to check if the Flyers won most of their games against the Rangers during the 1977-78 season. But looking at the table, I see that it only goes up to game number 35 and stops in December 31st. The season might be longer, but based on the data provided, I have to work with what's here.\n\nIn the table, the Flyers played against the Rangers in games where 'opponent' is \"new york rangers.\" Let's list those:\n\n- Game 22: December 1. Score: 4 - 2 (Flyers win)\n- Game 24: December 7. Score: 3 - 3 (Tie)\n- Game 33: December 28. Score: 4 - 3 (Flyers win)\n\nWait, but game 24 is a tie and game 33 is a win. Are there more games against the Rangers beyond these? The table shows up to game 35, but in that range, only three games are against the Rangers.\n\nLooking at their performance:\n\n- Game 22: Win\n- Game 24: Tie\n- Game 33: Win\n\nSo out of three games, they have two wins and one tie. That's not a majority win; it's a split. Therefore, the claim that they won \"most\" is incorrect based on the data provided.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are more games against Rangers in the table. Scanning through the opponent column: yes, only three instances where the opponent is NY Rangers. So, with two wins and one tie, it's not most of the season's games.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"most of the game of the season,\" which could refer to a high percentage. But in the table, they have multiple opponents, so without all the data, I can't be sure, but based on provided data, two wins against Rangers isn't the majority if there are more games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I examined the table for Philadelphia Flyers' games against the New York Rangers during the 1977-78 season. The relevant cells indicate that the Flyers won two games and tied one, which does not constitute \"most\" of their games. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where the opponent is \"new york rangers.\"\n2. **Check Each Game Outcome:** \n   - Game 22: Win\n   - Game 24: Tie\n   - Game 33: Win\n3. **Analyze Outcomes:** Two wins and one tie against Rangers.\n4. **Determine Majority:** Since the table shows only three games, two wins don't make a majority.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer lose by 3 point to the boston bruin\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the claim. It mentions a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Boston Bruins during the 1977-78 season where the Flyers lost by three points. So, my goal is to find if such a game exists in the table and check the relevant details.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with columns: game, december (which I assume refers to the date or sequence), opponent, score, record, and points. The row indices go from 0 to 34, which probably correspond to different games.\n\nI need to identify if there's a game where the Flyers lost by three points against the Bruins in that season. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is Los Angeles Kings. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Opponent is Colorado Rockies. No.\n- Row 2: New York Rangers. No.\n- Row 3: Opponent same as row 2, so no.\n- ... Skimming further, I notice that rows up to 28 are in December, based on the 'december' column.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the 1977-78 season. The table seems to list games starting from game 22 (probably December 22nd) up to game 35 or so. Since it's an HTML table, each row represents a game, with the opponent and score details.\n\nI need to find if any of these games involve the Boston Bruins as the opponent for the Flyers. Let me go through each relevant row:\n\nLooking at row 28: Opponent is Boston Bruins. Score is 6 - 4, which translates to Flyers winning by two points (assuming the first number is Flyers' score and second is Bruins'). So Flyers won that game.\n\nRow 32: Opponent is Boston Bruins again. Score is 1 - 6. That means Bruins won by five points, so Flyers lost by five.\n\nNow, row 33: Opponent is New York Rangers, not relevant.\n\nRow 34: Minnesota North Stars. No.\n\nWait, I'm only seeing two games against the Bruins in December (rows 28 and 32). In both cases, the Flyers didn't lose by three points; they lost by five once and won another game.\n\nSo, there's no row where the Flyers lost to the Bruins with a score of 3 points difference. The closest is losing by five points or winning by two. Therefore, the claim doesn't match any data in the table.\n\nI should also check if the games are within December because the 'december' column goes up to 31 or so. Wait, the claim refers to the 1977-78 season, which would include games beyond December. But the table only shows games from game 22 (probably Dec 22) onwards, perhaps covering early January as well? Or maybe it's just a subset.\n\nHowever, even if there are more games in January, I need to find a specific loss by three points against the Bruins. Since the table provided doesn't show such an instance, the claim is not supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win by 3 point against the boston bruin.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into relevant parts. The key elements are:\n1. The team: Philadelphia Flyers\n2. The opponent: Boston Bruins\n3. The season: 1977-78\n4. The result: a win by 3 points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with columns for game number, date (December), opponent, score, record, and points. \n\nSince the claim refers to the 1977-78 season, I should check if there's any row that matches this season in the table. However, looking at the table, all the games are labeled with numbers like 22, 23, etc., without a year mentioned in the 'december' column or elsewhere. This makes it difficult to directly link a specific game to the 1977-78 season. \n\nThe opponent in the claim is the Boston Bruins, so I should look for rows where the opponent is Boston Bruins. From the table, there are multiple such games:\n- Row 8 (index 7): Opponent is Boston Bruins\n- Row 10 (index 9): Opponent is Boston Bruins\n- Row 11 (index 10): Opponent is Boston Bruins\n- Row 12 (index 11): Opponent is Boston Bruins\n\nEach of these games has different dates in December. For example, row 7 is game 28 on December 15, and row 9 is game 30 on December 18.\n\nThe claim mentions a win by 3 points. The 'score' column shows the result as something like \"4 - 2\" or similar. To find a win by 3 points, I need to see if any of these games have a score that indicates a 3-point victory. However, hockey scores typically go up to 5 points (since it's a sport), so a 3-point difference would mean the Flyers won 4-1 or something similar. Looking through the scores:\n\n- Game 28: Score is 6 - 4 (Flyers win by 2)\n- Game 30: Score is 0 - 2 (Bruins win by 2)\n- Other games involving Bruins are either wins by Bruins or different point margins.\n\nNone of the games where Flyers played Bruins resulted in a 3-point win for Flyers. For example, game 28 was a 6-4 loss, and game 30 was a 0-2 loss. The only win mentioned is on row 7 (game 28) but it's a 6-4 loss.\n\nAdditionally, the season 1977-78 isn't directly indicated in any of these rows since there's no 'season' column or clear indication of the year beyond the game numbers. The claim also refers to a specific opponent, Boston Bruins, which is present in some rows, but without matching the required score or correct season.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't have sufficient support from the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
