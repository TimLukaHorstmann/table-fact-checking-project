    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"in the sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final , tisha venturini play 4 match at gavle.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: match, date, location, lineup, result, and competition. Each row represents a different match with various details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tisha venturini play 4 match at gavle.\" I think this refers to Tisha Venturini playing in four matches during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, specifically at Gavle.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that it starts with entries labeled 1 to 13. Each of these corresponds to a different match. The first row after the header is match 1, then match 2, and so on until match 13.\n\nI need to find any matches where Tisha Venturini played, particularly in four games at Gavle. However, looking through the table's rows, I don't see any entries that mention Tisha Venturini by name or imply her participation in these matches. The 'lineup' column lists things like \"start,\" \"80' (cromwell),\" etc., but no player names.\n\nAdditionally, the claim refers to the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final specifically. From the table, I can see there are multiple matches listed under different stages: group match, quarter-final, semifinal, third place match. But none of these seem to relate directly to Tisha Venturini or her participation in four matches at Gavle.\n\nTherefore, since there is no information in the provided table that supports the claim about Tisha Venturini playing four matches at Gavle in the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about Tisha Venturini's career is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"in tisha venturini 's career 3 match end in a draw , 1995 - 06 - 06 , 1996 - 07 - 25 and 1999 - 07 - 10\". So, it's saying that there are three matches in Tisha Venturini's career where the game ended in a draw on those specific dates.\n\nNow, I need to check if these specific matches exist in the table provided. The table lists various matches with details like date, location, result, etc. \n\nLet me look through each row of the table and see if any match these dates and results.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Date is 1995 - 06 - 06. In this row, under 'result' column, it's 3-3. So that's a draw. But let me check the 'match' description: It says \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\". Wait, Tisha Venturini might be an American player, so maybe she wasn't part of Sweden's team in 1995. I'm not entirely sure about her national team history, but let me proceed.\n\n- Row 3: Date is 1995 - 06 - 10. Result is 4-1. Not a draw.\n- Row 4: Date is 1995 - 06 - 13. Result is 4-0. Not a draw.\n- Row 5: 1995 - 06 - 15. Result 0-1. No.\n- Row 6: 1995 - 06 - 17. Result 2-0. No.\n  \nSo, the first date mentioned in the claim is 1995-06-06, which is a draw. But I'm not sure if Tisha was involved here.\n\nMoving on to the next dates:\n\nRow 11: Date is 1996 - 08 - 01. Result is 2-1. Not a draw.\nRow 12: 1999-06-27. Result 3-0. No.\nRow 13: 1999-07-10. Result is 0-0 (PSO 5-4). That's a draw. So that matches one of the dates.\n\nWait, so only two dates in the claim have corresponding draws in the table: 1995-06-06 and 1999-07-10. But the claim says three matches ended in a draw on those dates. Wait, but the third date is 1996-07-25. Let me check if that exists.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 9: 1996 - 07 - 25. Result is 2-1 AET. Not a draw.\nWait, row 10 is 1996-08-01, which I already checked. So there's no match on 1996-07-25 in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the rows. Let me list out all the rows with their dates:\n\nRow 1: 1995-06-06\nRow 2: 1995-06-10\nRow 3: 1995-06-13\nRow 4: 1995-06-15\nRow 5: 1995-06-17\nRow 6: 1995-06-17? Wait, no, row 6 is 1996-08-01. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the table starts with:\n\nRows 1 to 13, each with their own dates. Let me list them properly:\n\n1. 1995-06-06\n2. 1995-06-10\n3. 1995-06-13\n4. 1995-06-15\n5. 1995-06-17\n6. 1996-08-01\n7. 1999-06-27\n8. 1999-07-10\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe first set is in 1995, then 1996, then 1999. So row numbers go from 1 to 13.\n\nRow 1: 1995-06-06\nRow 2: 1995-06-10\nRow 3: 1995-06-13\nRow 4: 1995-06-15\nRow 5: 1995-06-17\nRow 6: 1996-08-01\nRow 7: 1999-06-27\nRow 8: 1999-07-10\n\nWait, but in the table provided, there are more rows beyond that. Let me recount properly.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe table has a tbody with 13 rows (from row 1 to row 13). The dates are spread across different years. So, for 1995: rows 1-5; 1996: rows 6 and 11; 1999: rows 7,8,12,13.\n\nSo, the date 1996-07-25 isn't present in any row. Therefore, there's no match on that date.\n\nSo, the claim mentions three dates: 1995-06-06 (draw), 1996-07-25 (no draw), and 1999-07-10 (draw). Since 1996-07-25 isn't a valid date in the table, only two matches ended in draws on those dates.\n\nBut the claim says three matches. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it lists an extra date that doesn't have a corresponding draw in the table.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if Tisha Venturini was actually involved in those matches. For example, in 1995-06-06, the match was Sweden vs. Norway, which might not be her game as she plays for USA. Similarly, 1999-07-10 was the final where USA won on penalties.\n\nI'm not entirely certain about Tisha's participation in each of these matches, but based on the table, only two dates correspond to draws. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states three matches ended in a draw on those specific dates when only two did.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"in the highest scoring game 5 goal be score , which be on 1995 - 06 - 10\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about a game where the highest scoring (which I think refers to the maximum goals scored in that match) is five goals. This supposedly happened on June 10, 1995.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's any match that took place on June 10, 1995, and check its result to see if it had five goals or was the highest scoring.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table. The rows have a \"date\" column, so I can look for 1995-06-10 in there. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 1: date is \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\". Doesn't match.\n- Rows 2,3,4: dates are 06-06, 06-08, and 06-10 respectively. Wait, row 3's date is 1995 - 06 - 10. That matches the claim's date.\n\nNow, what's the result for that row? The \"result\" column shows \"4 - 1\". So the score was 4-1, which is four goals in total, not five. Therefore, it wasn't a game where five goals were scored.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"highest scoring game 5 goal be score\". Maybe it's referring to the maximum goals in that tournament or something else. Let me check other rows for higher scores.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 4: result is 4-0\n- Row 3: 4-1\n- Row 6: 2-0\n- Row 5: 0-1\n- Row 10: 2-1 aet\n- Row 11: 2-1\n- Row 12: 3-0\n- Row 13: 0-0 (PSO)\n\nNone of these have five goals. The highest is four. So the claim is incorrect because there was no game on June 10, 1995 with a score of five goals.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. In row 3, date is 06-10, result is 4-1. No five goals. There's another entry: row 13 has 0-0 in the final, but that's on July 10. So no match with five goals.\n\nSo the claim is false because there was no game on June 10, 1995, with a score of five goals.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any match took place on 1995-06-10 and scored five goals.\n\n1. **Check for matches on 1995-06-10**: The date \"1995 - 06 - 10\" corresponds to row 3 in the table.\n2. **Examine the result of that match**: The score was 4-1, not five goals.\n\nSince no match on that date scored five goals, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"1 out of the 13 matches be a gold medal match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that exactly one (1) out of the total 13 matches in the table was a gold medal match. So, my task is to check how many times \"gold medal match\" appears as a result in the table and see if it's just once.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a match with details filled across several columns: match name, date, location, lineup, result, and competition. The 'result' column seems to hold information about the outcome of each match, such as scores or specific notes like \"aet\" for extra time or penalties.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row's result to count how many times \"gold medal match\" appears:\n\n1. The first match (row 0) is the final of the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. The result is \"3 - 3,\" which might have been a draw, but it doesn't mention \"gold medal.\"\n\n2. Moving down, row 11 seems to be the key one. It's labeled as \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\" and the result is \"2 - 1.\" But looking closer, in the 'result' column for row 11, it says \"gold medal match.\" So that's one instance.\n\nI should check if there are any others. The other matches mention results like group stage, semifinal, quarter-final, etc., but none specifically say \"gold medal match\" except for row 11. \n\nWait, actually, let me double-check each result column to ensure I didn't miss any:\n\n- Row 0: no\n- Rows 1-6: nope, they all mention group matches or semifinals, quarter-finals.\n- Row 7-10: group stage or semifinal again.\n- Then row 11: yes, \"gold medal match.\"\n- Rows 12 and 13 don't have that either.\n\nSo only one match (row 11) is a gold medal match. Therefore, the claim says \"1 out of the 13 matches be a gold medal match,\" which is accurate because there's exactly one such match.\n\nHence, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Tisha Venturini played a total of 13 matches in 3 different tournaments\" is true based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main parts: the number of matches (13) and the number of tournaments (3). So, I need to check if Tisha Venturini played 13 matches in total across three different tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists matches from various tournaments. Each row represents a match with details like the date, location, lineup, result, etc. The first column seems to be an identifier (like 1,2,3...), but the key columns are \"date,\" \"location,\" and others related to the tournament.\n\nI need to look for rows where the competition is the same because that would represent different tournaments. For example, the first set of rows are about the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final, so each match in those rows is part of that one tournament. Similarly, the Atlanta 1996 Olympics and the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup each form separate tournaments.\n\nNow, focusing on Tisha Venturini: I remember she's a notable player, perhaps from the USA teams. Looking through the table, I see rows where the lineup includes her name, but in this table, it seems the lineup column sometimes mentions specific players like \"Cromwell\" or \"Milbrett.\" However, the names here might not include Tisha Venturini.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If Tisha isn't listed anywhere in the lineup column, then how can we know how many matches she played? Maybe her matches are elsewhere, but the table provided doesn't have her name. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nLooking again, the first row is \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final,\" and each cell in that row is the same, which might be a header or something else. But then rows 4-13 list specific matches with different tournaments.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check: Each row seems to represent a match, and the \"competition\" column is filled for each. So, for example, row 1 is the final of the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, hosted by Sweden. Then rows 2-11 are from other tournaments.\n\nBut in this table, I don't see Tisha Venturini mentioned anywhere. That suggests she isn't included, which would mean that there might not be any matches for her, making the claim false. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the \"lineup\" column refers to players, and Tisha is one of them, but in this table, only some are listed. For example, row 13 has a lineup with \"milbrett,\" which is probably Cindy Parolo or another player. But without Tisha's name, we can't confirm her matches.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about Tisha Venturini, so if she isn't in any of these lineups, then she didn't play 13 matches here. So perhaps the table doesn't include her at all. Alternatively, maybe she did play, but the lineup column doesn't list her name for some reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe each row is a different match, and the tournaments are determined by the competition column. So, for example, rows 1-3 might be part of the same tournament if they share the same competition.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nRows 1: Sweden 1995\nRow 2: ?\nWait, no, each row's competition is listed as \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\" etc. So each set of rows corresponds to a single tournament.\n\nSo, in this table, there are three tournaments:\n\n1. 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup (rows 1-3)\n2. 1996 Atlanta Olympics (rows 4-11)\n3. 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup (row 12)\n\nWait, no. Row 13 is part of the 1999 tournament as well, but it's a different match.\n\nSo each set of rows corresponds to a tournament:\n\n- 1995: rows 1-3\n- 1996: rows 4-11\n- 1999: rows 12-13\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the 1996 Olympics had more matches. So perhaps the table is structured such that each set of rows corresponds to a specific tournament.\n\nBut in any case, looking for Tisha Venturini's matches would require her to be listed in the lineup column. Since I don't see her name there, it suggests she wasn't involved in these matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she played 13 matches in three tournaments is not supported by this table because either she didn't play enough matches here or isn't included at all.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong about the tournaments. Let me count how many tournaments are listed:\n\n- 1995\n- 1996 (Olympics)\n- 1999\n\nThat's three tournaments, as per the claim. But if Tisha didn't play enough matches in these tournaments to reach 13 total, or if she didn't play any, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only includes some of her matches, and she played more elsewhere. But since the table doesn't include all her matches, we can't confirm whether she reached 13.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check each condition against the table. So if the table doesn't list any of Tisha's matches, then we can't verify that she played 13 matches here. Therefore, the claim might not be fully supported.\n\nBut wait, looking again, maybe I misread some rows. Let me check row 12: Boston, start, 3-0 group stage. That's part of the 1999 World Cup. Then row 13 is a final match where someone scored in extra time and won with a penalty shootout (5-4). So that's two matches in the 1999 tournament.\n\nIn the 1996 Olympics, there are multiple matches. For example, rows 10-11: Athens, semifinal and final. Each of those would be separate matches, so perhaps Tisha played several times in the Olympics.\n\nSimilarly, in 1995, if she was part of that World Cup, she might have played more matches.\n\nBut without her name in the lineup column, we can't confirm how many matches she played. So perhaps the claim is false because the table doesn't include enough information about her participation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key is whether Tisha Venturini's total matches across three tournaments equal 13. If the table doesn't list any of her matches, then we can't confirm she played that many.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"a total of 13 match in 3 tournaments.\" So perhaps each tournament has a certain number of matches for her, adding up to 13.\n\nBut again, without her name listed in the lineup column, it's impossible to know.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the data provided doesn't include any information about Tisha Venturini's matches, so we can't verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether Tisha Venturini played a total of 13 matches across three specified tournaments based on the provided table. \n\nFirstly, the table lists three distinct tournaments:\n1. The **1995 FIFA Women's World Cup** (hosted by Sweden).\n2. The **1996 Atlanta Olympics**.\n3. The **1999 FIFA Women's World Cup**.\n\nEach tournament is represented by multiple rows in the table, each indicating a match with details such as location, whether it was a start or final, and the scoreline. However, there are no entries in the \"Lineup\" column for Tisha Venturini, which would have listed her participation in any of these matches.\n\nSince the data does not include Tisha Venturini's name, it is impossible to confirm whether she played enough matches within these tournaments to reach a total of 13. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.\n\n**Answer:** The claim cannot be verified with the provided data as Tisha Venturini's participation in any matches is not recorded.",

This seems like a specific event, probably a football match, with certain details.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: match, date, location, lineup, result, competition. Each row represents a different match.\n\nI'll need to check each part of the claim against the table data. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. Date: 1995 - 06 - 06\n2. Location: gavle\n3. Lineup: start\n4. Result: 3 - 3 (though this might be a tie, so maybe looking for \"draw\" or similar)\n5. Competition: group match\n\nNow, I'll go through the table rows to find matching data.\n\nStarting from row 0, which seems to have all the same entries, but that's probably just header repetition. The real data starts from row 2 onwards (since the first row is repeated as headers).\n\nLooking for a date of June 6, 1995. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 3: 1995 - 06 - 10 (June 10th)\n- Row 4: 1995 - 06 - 13\n- Row 5: 1995 - 06 - 15\n- So on.\n\nWait, the claim's date is June 6, which isn't present in any of these rows. Hmm, that might be a red flag. Let me double-check. \n\nLooking at row 2, it's June 8th. Row 3 is June 10th, then June 13th, June 15th, etc. No row has June 6th. So the date doesn't match any in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again: the first data row after headers is row index 1 (row starts at 0). Wait, no\u2014the table shows row indices from 0 to 13, with each row's data starting from the second line. So the actual matches start at row index 2? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back, the HTML structure: there are headers, then a tbody with multiple rows. Each row in the tbody is one match. Let me count the rows properly.\n\nIn the provided table, after the header (row 0), the first data row is at index 1: 1995 - 06 - 06 Gavle... No, wait, no. Let me recount:\n\n- The first line inside tbody is \"1995 - 06 - 06 gavle...\", which would be row index 1? Or maybe 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial lines are just headers, and then each subsequent line is a data row starting from row index 2.\n\nBut looking at the table as provided:\n\nThe first line after <tbody> is \"1995 - 06 - 06...\", so that would be row 1 (since indexing starts at 0). So:\n\n- Row 0: headers\n- Row 1: 1995-06-06, Gavle, Start, 3-3, Group match\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The initial lines are likely the header, so in the HTML, the first row is the header, and then each subsequent line is a data row starting from index 1 onwards.\n\nBut the provided table shows:\n\nRow 0: \"1995 - 06 - 06...\" (no headers)\nThen columns like match, date, etc., which might be headers. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait no\u2014the user provided the HTML code, so the structure is:\n\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>match</th>\n    ...\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    ... data rows\n  </tr>\n...\n\nSo each row in the tbody is a match. Therefore, the first data row is at index 1 (row 0 is headers), and so on.\n\nWait no\u2014the HTML starts with <tbody>, then inside are multiple <tr> elements. Each <tr> represents a row, starting from index 0 as the header. So in the table provided:\n\n- The first row (index 0) is the header: match, date, location, lineup, result, competition.\n\nThen each subsequent row is data, starting at index 1 onwards.\n\nSo for example, row index 1 would be:\n\n1995 - 06 - 06 gavle start 3 - 3 group match\n\nWait, but in the user's table, the first data row after the header (row index 1) has date as 1995-06-06. Then row 2 is June 10th, etc.\n\nWait, let me look at the actual content:\n\nIn the provided HTML table:\n\nThe first data row is \"1995 - 06 - 06 gavle...\" which would be row index 1 (since header is row 0). So in this case, the date is correct.\n\nWait, no: in the user's table, the header is inside a <thead>, then the body has multiple rows. So let me parse the HTML correctly.\n\nLooking at the provided table:\n\n- The first line is \"1995 - 06 - 06...\", which is inside the tbody, so that would be row index 0 (since tbody starts counting from 0).\n\nWait no\u2014that can't be because then the header is in a separate thead. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial lines are part of the data rows before the actual headers, but that seems unlikely.\n\nThis confusion might lead me to incorrect conclusions, so let's try another approach: instead of focusing on row indices, focus on the data.\n\nThe claim is for June 6, 1995, in Gavle, with a lineup of \"start\", result of 3-3, and competition as group match.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1 (if first data row): date is 06/06/1995, location Gavle, lineup start, result 3-3, competition group match. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo if the table's first data row after headers has this exact information, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, in the provided HTML, the first data row is indeed:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>1995 - 06 - 06</td>\n  <td>Gavle</td>\n  <td>start</td>\n  <td>3 - 3 group match</td>\n  ... etc.\n\nSo yes, that matches all the claim's details.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index where this data is found. Since headers are in row 0, and the first data row is row 1, so:\n\nRow index: 1\nColumns: date (2), location (3), lineup (4), result (5), competition (6)\n\nBut the user wants to know which cells correspond to each part of the claim.\n\nSo for the claim \"1995 - 06 - 06 gavle start 3-3 group match\", we need to find which columns and rows these values are in.\n\nAssuming the columns are:\n\n0: match (maybe not used)\n1: date\n2: location\n3: lineup\n4: result\n5: competition\n\nSo, the claim's date is in column 1, row 1.\nLocation is column 2, row 1.\nLineup is column 3, row 1.\nResult is column 4, row 1 (though \"3-3\" might be in the same cell as result).\nCompetition is column 5, row 1.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to note that all these fields are present in row 1 and columns 1-5.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to know which cells specifically correspond to each part of the claim, we can list them:\n\n- Date: row 1, column 1\n- Location: row 1, column 2\n- Lineup: row 1, column 3\n- Result: row 1, column 4\n- Competition: row 1, column 5\n\nBut since the result is given as \"3-3 group match\", which combines both result and competition, perhaps it's better to say that all these fields are present in row 1.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that each part of the claim maps to a specific cell, then:\n\nDate: row 1, column 1\nLocation: row 1, column 2\nLineup: row 1, column 3\nResult and Competition (since they are combined): row 1, columns 4 and 5.\n\nBut perhaps in this context, each part is its own cell. So the claim's parts correspond to specific cells in row 1:\n\n- \"1995 - 06 - 06\" is in column 1, row 1\n- \"Gavle\" is in column 2, row 1\n- \"start\" is in column 3, row 1\n- \"3-3 group match\" is in columns 4 and 5 of row 1.\n\nAlternatively, if \"group match\" is part of the competition cell, then it's column 5, row 1.\n\nSo, to sum up, all these elements are present in row 1 (the first data row) of the table. Therefore, the cells in question are:\n\n- The first data row (row 1)\n- Columns corresponding to date, location, lineup, result, and competition.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are row 1, columns 1 through 5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"1995 - 06 - 06 gavle start 3-3 group match\" is present in the provided table, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Data Rows**: The table's body starts with a data row immediately after the header. This first data row corresponds to the year 1995, month June, and day 6.\n\n2. **Match Each Part of the Claim**:\n   - **Date (1995 - 06 - 06)**: Found in the second column (column index 1) of the first data row.\n   - **Location (Gavle)**: Found in the third column (column index 2) of the first data row.\n   - **Lineup (Start)**: Found in the fourth column (column index 3) of the first data row.\n   - **Result and Competition (3-3 group match)**: Combined in the fifth column (column index 4) as \"3-3 group match\".\n\n3. **Conclusion**: All parts of the claim are present in the first data row (row index 1) of the table.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is found in the first data row (row index 1) and columns 1 through 5 of the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to support my conclusion.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\". It seems to be listing three separate events:\n\n1. The 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final in Sweden.\n2. The 1996 Atlanta Olympic Women's Football Tournament.\n3. The 1999 USA FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nNow, I'll examine the HTML table provided to see if it includes information about these three tournaments.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Rows 0: This seems to be a header row with column names like \"match\", \"date\", etc., so not relevant.\n- Row 1: This is the first data row. Let's check each cell:\n  - match: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n  - date: \"1995 - 06 - 06\"\n  - location: \"gavle\"\n  - lineup: \"start\"\n  - result: \"3 - 3\"\n  - competition: \"group match\"\n\nThis row appears to be about a group stage match, not the final. So, perhaps it's not the final we're looking for.\n\n- Row 2: Same as above but with a different date and result.\n- Row 3: Again, another group stage match.\n- Row 4: This seems to be a quarter-final match in Sweden, so still not the final of the World Cup.\n- Row 5: Semi-final in Vasteras.\n- Row 6: Third place match.\n\nAfter row 6, there's a new competition mentioned as \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\". Let's check rows starting from 7 onwards:\n\n- Row 7: First data row for the Atlanta tournament. The competition is listed as \"gold medal match\" in row 11.\n\nWait, that might be important. So the Atlanta tournament includes a gold medal match on August 1st. But the claim refers to the \"olympic women 's football tournament\", not necessarily the final or medal match.\n\nMoving further down:\n\n- Rows 12: This is the USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, specifically a group stage match in Boston.\n- Row 13: The final match of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, which went into extra time and penalties.\n\nSo, for each event in the claim, we can find corresponding entries in the table:\n\n1. \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\": Looking at rows, it seems that there isn't a row explicitly labeled as the final. Rows 1-6 are group stage matches and quarter-finals/semis. The closest is perhaps not directly present. However, in reality, the FIFA Women's World Cup final would likely be part of the tournament but might not have its own separate entry in this table. So maybe the claim includes an assumption that the listed tournaments exist, which they do.\n\n2. \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\": The table has rows starting from row 7 onwards mentioning Atlanta and Athens, GA, with dates in August and early August. There's a gold medal match on row 11, so this event is present.\n\n3. \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\": The table includes rows for the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, specifically group stage (row 12) and final (row 13). So this is covered.\n\nNow, considering that each of these events exists in the table, the claim appears to be factually correct. Each event mentioned does have an entry in the table. However, I should note whether the specific details align. For example, the claim refers to \"final\" for Sweden in 1995, but the table doesn't explicitly list a final beyond row 13 in 1999.\n\nBut since the instruction is to check each condition against the table and determine if fully supported, I can see that the events mentioned exist, even if details like the specific stage (final) aren't directly listed. Therefore, the claim is likely TRUE as it refers to existing tournaments, even if their exact stage isn't explicitly detailed in the cells.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For each event:\n\n- \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\": The most relevant rows would be those where competition starts with \"usa 1999...\" and \"sweden 1995...\", but perhaps looking for group stages leading up to the final isn't necessary since the table doesn't explicitly have a row for the final. Alternatively, maybe it's safer to look for cells that match the event names.\n\nWait, in the table, each tournament entry is repeated multiple times, once for each match. So, for \"sweden 1995...\", rows 1-6 are group stages and one quarter-final (row4). Since the claim refers to the final, which isn't explicitly a cell, perhaps it's not directly verifiable from the table. However, since the table includes matches related to these tournaments, we can still consider them relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is stating that these three events exist, and looking at the table, each of these events does have entries (rows 1-6 for Sweden, rows7-11 for Atlanta, and rows12-13 for USA). Therefore, all cells corresponding to these tournaments are relevant.\n\nThus, I'll identify the row indices where each event is listed. However, the same event is repeated multiple times in the table, once per match. So, perhaps the first occurrence of each event is relevant, but given that the instruction isn't clear on selecting specific matches, maybe all instances need to be considered.\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"Carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\"\n\nSo for each part of the claim:\n\n- \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\": Check rows where competition is \"sweden 1995...\" or similar. This occurs in row1-row6.\n\n- \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\": Occurs starting at row7, but specifically the gold medal match is row11.\n\n- \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\": Occurs rows12 and13.\n\nBut perhaps for each event, we can select the first cell where the competition name matches. Or maybe all relevant cells need to be considered. To be thorough, I'll list all cells that mention these events.\n\nAlternatively, since each tournament has multiple matches in the table, but the claim is about their existence rather than specific match details, perhaps only the initial occurrence needs to be marked as relevant.\n\nThis might vary, but based on the instruction, it's better to err on the side of including more cells.\n\nTherefore, I'll list all the cells where each event is mentioned. But considering that, for example, \"sweden 1995...\" occurs in rows1-6 (group stages and one quarter-final). Since the claim refers to the final, which isn't explicitly listed as a separate row, perhaps only rows4 and onwards? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's sufficient to mark all cells where the competition starts with each respective name. So:\n\nFor \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\": Cells in rows1-6 (as they mention Sweden 1995).\n\nFor \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\": Cells starting from row7 onwards, specifically the ones mentioning Atlanta.\n\nFor \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\": Rows12 and13.\n\nBut since it's a bit ambiguous, I think the safest approach is to consider that each event has multiple cells, so all relevant cells should be marked. Alternatively, perhaps only the first occurrence of each event is needed. Given the complexity, I'll list all cells where each event is mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to three specific events: the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final in Sweden, the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Women's Football Tournament, and the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup in the USA. Each of these events has multiple corresponding entries in the table:\n\n1. **Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final**: Relevant cells are rows 1-6 (group stages and a quarter-final).\n2. **Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament**: Relevant cells start at row7, with specific mention in row11 (gold medal match).\n3. **USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup**: Relevant cells are rows12 (group stage) and row13 (final).\n\nThese cells confirm the existence of each event as described in the claim.\n\n### Answer:\nThe statement is based on verifiable data within the provided table, confirming the existence of each referenced tournament. All corresponding cells are relevant for validation.\n\n\\boxed{TRUE}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific match is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"1996 - 08 - 01 athens , ga start 2 - 1 gold medal match\". This seems to describe a particular soccer (football) match that took place in Athens, Georgia, on August 1st, 1996. The result was a 2-1 victory by the starting team in a gold medal match.\n\nNow, I need to check if this information is fully supported by the data in the table provided. The table lists various matches, including dates, locations, lineups, results, and competition types.\n\nLooking at the structure of the HTML table:\n\n- Each row represents a specific match.\n- Columns include \"match\" (a brief description), \"date\", \"location\", \"lineup\", \"result\", and \"competition\".\n\nThe claim mentions:\n- Date: 1996 - 08 - 01\n- Location: Athens, GA\n- Lineup: start\n- Result: 2 - 1\n- Competition: gold medal match\n\nI need to find a row in the table that matches all these aspects.\n\nStarting with the last row before the next \"match\" description, which is row 11. Let me check each cell:\n\nRow 11 has:\n- match: \"1996 - 08 - 01 athens , ga start 2 - 1 gold medal match\"\nWait, no, looking closer, the first column of row 11 is \"11\", and then each subsequent cell corresponds to a column.\n\nLooking at the second column (date) for row 11: it's \"1996 - 08 - 01\". That matches the date in the claim.\n\nThird column (location): \"athens , ga\" which also matches.\n\nFourth column (lineup): \"start\" as per the claim.\n\nFifth column (result): \"2 - 1\" which is the same result mentioned.\n\nSixth column (competition): \"gold medal match\", matching the claim's description.\n\nSo, row 11 in the table corresponds exactly to the claim. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should also make sure that there are no other rows that might be a better fit or conflicting information, but upon scanning through all the rows, row 11 seems to be the only one that matches all the specifics of the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is found in row 11 of the table, matching all specified details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"lineup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
