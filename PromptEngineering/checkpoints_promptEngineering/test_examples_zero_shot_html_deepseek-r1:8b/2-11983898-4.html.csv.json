    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nThe claim is: \"tommy robredo be the opponent on the july 28 , 2013 final.\"\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table provided. The table has several columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, and score in the final. Each row represents a different final match with details filled in.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row is from April 29, 2012, where Gilles Simon was the opponent.\n2. The second row is September 23, 2012, against Martin Kli\u017ean.\n3. The third row is July 14, 2013, Philipp Kohlschreiber.\n4. The fourth row is July 21, 2013, Federico Delbonis.\n5. The fifth row is July 28, 2013.\n\nThe claim mentions Tommy Robredo as the opponent in a final that took place on July 28, 2013. So I'll focus on the last row of the table since it's the only one with the date July 28, 2013.\n\nLooking at that specific row:\n\n- Outcome: runner - up\n- Date: 28 July 2013\n- Tournament: ATP Vegeta Croatia Open Umag, Umag, Croatia\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent in the final: Tommy Robredo\n- Score: 0-6, 3-6\n\nSo, the opponent in the final for that date is indeed Tommy Robedo. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by this row.\n\nI need to check if there are any other relevant cells. The tournament name and surface don't affect the claim, so they aren't relevant. The date matches exactly, which is important. The opponent's name directly supports the claim. So the relevant cells are row_index 4 (since it's the fifth row, index starts at 0) and the column 'opponent in the final'.\n\nI should make sure that I'm correctly identifying the row index. The table has five rows, so the last one is row_index 4. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because Tommy Robredo was indeed the opponent in that final on July 28, 2013.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"on april 29 , 2012 the score in the final be 4 - 6 , 3 - 6\". \n\nI'll start by looking for any rows where the date is April 29, 2012. Scanning through the table, I see that the first row has a date of \"29 april 2012\" which matches the claim's date.\n\nNext, I need to check the score in the final for that specific row. The \"score in the final\" column for the first row lists \"4 - 6 , 3 - 6\", which exactly matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, both the date and the score in the final match the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the game on april 29 , 2012 have opponent as giles simon and the outcome be runner - up.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant rows and columns in the table that correspond to these details. Let's look at the 'date' column because the claim mentions April 29, 2012. Scanning through the dates in the table:\n\n1. Row 0: 29 april 2012\n2. Row 1: 23 september 2012\n3. Row 2: 14 july 2013\n4. Row 3: 21 july 2013\n5. Row 4: 28 july 2013\n\nThe first row (index 0) has the date 29 April 2012, which matches the claim's date. Now, I need to check the 'opponent in the final' column for this row. The opponent listed is Gilles Simon, which aligns with the claim.\n\nNext, verifying the outcome: the table shows 'runner - up' for row 0, matching the claim's description of the outcome being a runner-up.\n\nSince both the date, opponent, and outcome in the first row match the claim, this means the claim is supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and check it against the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"29 april 2012 have an outcome of winner , where tommy robredo be the opponent in the final.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The date mentioned is April 29, 2012.\n2. The outcome should be \"winner.\"\n3. The opponent in the final is Tommy Robredo.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row corresponds to a different tournament with various details like date, outcome, surface, opponent, and score. My task is to find if there's a row that matches all three criteria: April 29, 2012, winner outcome, and Tommy Robredo as the opponent.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Date: April 29, 2012\n  - Outcome: Runner-up\n  - Opponent: Gilles Simon\n  - The outcome is not \"winner,\" so this doesn't match.\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Date: September 23, 2012 (different from April 29)\n  - Outcome: Runner-up\n  - Opponent: Martin Kli\u017ean\n  - Doesn't match the date or opponent.\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Date: July 14, 2013\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Philipp Kohlschreiber\n  - Doesn't match the date or opponent.\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Date: July 21, 2013\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Opponent: Federico Delbonis\n  - Again, doesn't match the given date.\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Date: July 28, 2013\n  - Outcome: Runner-up\n  - Opponent: Tommy Robredo\n  - The date here is in July, which doesn't match April. So, even though the opponent is Tommy Robredo, the outcome and date don't align with the claim.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rows for April 29, 2012 have an outcome of \"winner\" and Tommy Robredo as the opponent. The only time Tommy Robredo was the opponent was on July 28, but that's a different month and the outcome was runner-up, not winner. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim doesn't hold because there's no row in the table where the date is April 29, 2012, the outcome is winner, and Tommy Robedo is the opponent in the final.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that on April 29, 2012, with an outcome of \"winner,\" Tommy Robredo was the opponent in the final. Checking each row:\n\n- **Row 0** matches the date but has a runner-up outcome.\n- No other rows match both the date and the specified opponent with a winner outcome.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"federico delbonis be the opponent in the final of the 28 july 2013 tournament , which do not have a clay surface.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific things:\n\n1. Federico Delbonis was the opponent in the final.\n2. The tournament on 28 July 2013 does not have a clay surface.\n\nI need to verify both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a tournament with various details. The columns relevant here are \"opponent in the final\" and \"surface\". \n\nStarting with the first part: Checking if Federico Delbonis was the opponent in the final on 28 July 2013. I'll look for the row where date is \"28 july 2013\".\n\nIn the table, there's a row with:\n- outcome: runner - up\n- date: 28 july 2013\n- tournament: atp vegeta croatia open umag , umag , croatia\n- surface: clay\n- opponent in the final: tommy robredo\n\nSo Federico Delbonis isn't listed as the opponent here. Therefore, the first part of the claim is FALSE.\n\nNext, checking if the tournament on 28 July 2013 doesn't have a clay surface. From the same row, the surface is clay. So this part is also incorrect.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are false, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the score in the final of 4 - 6 , 3 - 6 be during the stuttgart open , stuttgart germany on clay surface.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three main aspects:\n1. The specific score: \"4 - 6 , 3 - 6.\"\n2. The tournament: \"stuttgart open , stuttgart germany.\"\n3. The surface type: \"clay surface.\"\n\nI need to check if there's an entry in the table that matches all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and see if any match all three points.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: 29 April 2012\n- Tournament: brd n\u0103stase \u0163iriac trophy, Bucharest, Romania\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent in final: Gilles Simon\n- Score: 4 - 6 , 3 - 6\n\nThis row has the score mentioned. However, the tournament is not the Stuttgart Open but another tournament. So, this doesn't match.\n\nSecond row:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: 23 September 2012\n- Tournament: st petersburg open, St Petersburg, Russia\n- Surface: hard (i)\n- Opponent in final: Martin Kli\u017ean\n- Score: 2 - 6 , 3 - 6\n\nHere, the surface is hard, not clay. So, it doesn't match.\n\nThird row:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 14 July 2013\n- Tournament: stuttgart open, Stuttgart, Germany\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent in final: Philipp Kohlschreiber\n- Score: 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4\n\nThis row has the correct tournament and surface. However, the score here is different (5-7, 6-4, 6-4) compared to what's claimed (4-6, 3-6). So, no match.\n\nFourth row:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 21 July 2013\n- Tournament: international german open, Hamburg, Germany\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent in final: Federico Delbonis\n- Score: 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 (10 - 8) , 6 - 2\n\nAgain, the score doesn't match the claim.\n\nFifth row:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: 28 July 2013\n- Tournament: atp vegeta croatia open umag, Umag, Croatia\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent in final: Tommy Robredo\n- Score: 0 - 6 , 3 - 6\n\nThis row has the correct surface but a different tournament and score. Doesn't match.\n\nNow, looking back, none of the rows have all three elements matching exactly as per the claim:\n1. The specific score (4-6, 3-6) only appears in the first row.\n2. That row's tournament is not Stuttgart Open.\n3. The next rows with Stuttgart Open don't have the claimed score.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry that matches all three criteria of the claim: correct score, correct tournament, and correct surface.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the claim isn't fully supported by any single row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"tournament\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
