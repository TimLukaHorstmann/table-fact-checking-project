    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"when the series be 1 - 0 the attendance be 16150 and when the series be 1 - 1 the attendance be 16150.\" So, the claim is saying that whenever the series is 1-0 or 1-1, the attendance is exactly 16,150.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this claim are 'series' and 'attendance'. I need to check each row where either series is 1-0 or 1-1 and verify if the attendance is 16150 in those cases.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Series is 1 - 0. Attendance is 16,150. So this satisfies the condition for the first part of the claim.\n2. **Row 1:** Series is 1 - 1. Attendance is 16,150. This satisfies the second part of the claim.\n3. **Other rows:** For series like 1-2, 2-0, etc., the claim doesn't apply because they don't match 1-0 or 1-1.\n\nSo both instances where series is 1-0 or 1-1 have attendance as 16,150. That means the claim is true.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. Each occurrence of 'series' and 'attendance' in these rows should be noted. \n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The first column is date (index 0).\n- Visitor is index 1.\n- Score is index 2, but not relevant here.\n- Home is index 3.\n- Decision is index 4.\n- Attendance is column 5.\n- Series is column 6.\n\nSo for Row 0:\n- series is at column 6 (index 6)\n- attendance is at column 5 (index 5)\n\nFor Row 1:\n- series is again at column 6 (index 6)\n- attendance is still column 5 (index 5)\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0: columns 5 and 6\n- Row 1: columns 5 and 6\n\nI think that's all. I don't need to check other rows because they don't meet the series conditions mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the highest attendance be 16150 and it happen 3 times and the lowest attendance 16005 and it happen 3 times.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and check against the table. Let me start by identifying the highest and lowest attendances in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' column:\n- The entries are: 16150, 16150, 16005, 16005, 16150, 16005.\nSo, the highest attendance is 16150, which appears multiple times. I need to count how many times it occurs. From the list above, it happens on May 2, May 5, and May 11. That's three times. So the first part of the claim about the highest attendance seems correct.\n\nNow, for the lowest attendance: The entries are also 16150, so I think I might have misread earlier. Wait no, looking again: the attendances are 16150, 16150, 16005, 16005, 16150, 16005. So the lowest is 16005. How many times does 16005 occur? It's on May 7, May 9, and May 13\u2014three times as well.\n\nSo both highest (16150) and lowest (16005) attendances happen three times each. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should also check which cells are relevant for this verification. Each occurrence of attendance needs to be checked. So for 16150, they're at row indices 0,1,4. For 16005, they're at rows 2,3,5. \n\nSo I'll list all these as the relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the decision be mclean with the series at 2 - 4 and the home team be los angeles be the score be 3 - 5 with a date of may 13\"\n\nBreaking this down, I need to check if there's a row in the table where several conditions are met. Let me list out the conditions:\n\n1. The decision is by \"mclean\".\n2. The series is at \"2 - 4\".\n3. The home team is \"los angeles\".\n4. The score is \"3 - 5\".\n5. The date is \"may 13\".\n\nI should go through each row of the table and check if any row satisfies all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several rows with different dates. I'll start from the top:\n\n- First row: May 2. Home team is Los Angeles, but series is 1 - 0, score is 2 - 5, decision by McLean. Doesn't meet all criteria.\n  \n- Second row: May 5. Home team Los Angeles again, series 1 - 1, score 6 - 3. Not matching.\n\n- Third row: May 7. Now the home team is Vancouver. Series is 1 - 2, score 4 - 7. Decision by McLean. Doesn't fit because home team is Vancouver and series isn't 2 - 4.\n\nWait, I think I missed the \"decision\" part in my initial breakdown. Let me correct that: the claim mentions the decision is by McLean. So I need to ensure that the 'decision' column in the row matches \"mclean\".\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Fourth row: May 9. Home team Vancouver, series 2 - 2. Doesn't match.\n\n- Fifth row: May 11. Home team Los Angeles, series 2 - 3, score 4 - 3. Decision by McLean. Not matching the required series and score.\n\nWait, the claim says the series is at \"2 - 4\". So I need to look for a series that's exactly \"2 - 4\".\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- Sixth row: May 13. Home team Los Angeles. Series is 2 - 4. Decision by McLean. Score is 3 - 5.\n\nSo this row seems to meet all the criteria:\n\n- Date: May 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Home team: Los Angeles \u2714\ufe0f\n- Series: 2 - 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Score: 3 - 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Decision: McLean \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for this verification.\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nThe row index starts from 0. May 13 is the sixth row, so row_index 6? Wait, no, let me count:\n\n1. May 2: row_index 0\n2. May 5: row_index 1\n3. May 7: row_index 2\n4. May 9: row_index 3\n5. May 11: row_index 4\n6. May 13: row_index 5\n\nWait, no. The first row is index 0 (May 2), then second is 1 (May 5), third 2 (May 7), fourth 3 (May 9), fifth 4 (May 11), sixth 5 (May 13). So the May 13 row is index 5.\n\nNow, the columns relevant are:\n\n- date: to check if it's May 13.\n- home: Los Angeles.\n- series: 2 - 4.\n- score: 3 - 5.\n- decision: McLean.\n\nWait, but in the table, the 'series' column is listed first as \"series\", then 'decision'. So for row_index 5, let me check each cell:\n\ndate: may 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nvisitor: vancouver (but that's not needed)\nscore: 3 - 5 \u2714\ufe0f\nhome: los angeles \u2714\ufe0f\ndecision: mclean \u2714\ufe0f\nseries: 2 - 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo all these columns are relevant. Therefore, the relevant cells are for row_index 5 and each of the corresponding column names.\n\nI think I should list each cell that is relevant to verify the claim. So the relevant_cells would include each column checked in that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"the highest score between vancouver and los angeles be 7 - 2 and 6 - 3 and it occur on may 9 and may 5 with attendance of 16005 and 16150.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim is saying. The key elements are:\n\n1. Highest scores: 7 - 2 and 6 - 3\n2. Occurred on May 9 and May 5\n3. Attendance at those games was 16005 and 16150 respectively.\n\nNow, I'll go through each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the highest scores. In the table, each row has a 'score' column which seems to represent the score of one team against the other. The claim specifies two high scores: 7 - 2 and 6 - 3. I need to check if these scores exist in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- May 9: Vancouver 7 - 2 vs Los Angeles\n- May 5: Los Angeles 6 - 3 vs Vancouver\n\nYes, both scores are present. So the highest scores part checks out.\n\nNext, checking when these games occurred. The claim mentions May 9 and May 5. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- May 9 is row index 3 (0-based) or 4 (1-based). Wait, in the table, the first row is may 2 as row 0, then may 5, etc. So May 9 is the fourth row, which is row_index=3.\n\nMay 5 is the second row, so row_index=1.\n\nSo both dates are present and correct.\n\nNow, checking the attendance for each game:\n\n- For May 9 (7 - 2), the attendance is 16005.\n- For May 5 (6 - 3), the attendance is 16150.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor May 9: The row has attendance 16005. Correct.\n\nFor May 5: The row also shows attendance 16150. That's correct as well.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that these are indeed the highest scores and that no higher score exists elsewhere in the table.\n\nLooking at all the score cells:\n\nLos Angeles games:\n- May 2: 2 - 5\n- May 5: 6 - 3\n- May 11: 4 - 3\n\nVancouver games:\n- May 7: 4 - 7 (so Vancouver scored 4)\n- May 9: 7 - 2 (Vancouver scored 7)\n- May 13: 3 - 5\n\nSo the highest score by Vancouver is 7, which happened on May 9. The next highest for Los Angeles is 6, which was on May 5.\n\nWait a minute, does that mean that 7 and 6 are indeed the highest scores between the two teams? Yes, because all other scores are lower than these. So the claim's points about the highest scores being those two games with their respective attendances seems accurate.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim states that these two scores exist on those dates with specific attendances, and checking each part against the table confirms they do. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a claim about the given table is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table data and then identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly. The user wrote: \"the decision be always mclean in the 1992 - 93 vancouver canuck season and all date take place in may.\" \n\nSo, breaking it down, there are two main parts to the claim:\n1. **Decision is always 'mclean'**: This suggests that every game in the season had a decision made by McLean.\n2. **All dates take place in May**: This implies that every game occurred in May.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided to see if these conditions hold true or not.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several games with dates ranging from May 2 to May 13. So, all the dates are indeed in May, which supports the second part of the claim. \n\nFor the first part, the 'decision' column has entries like 'mclean', but I notice that in some rows, such as row indices 0 and 1, the decision is 'mclean'. However, in other rows like index 2 and 3, the decisions are also 'mclean'. Wait, no, actually upon closer inspection, all decisions seem to be 'mclean'\u2014no, wait, let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Decision = mclean\n- Row 1: Decision = mclean\n- Row 2: Decision = mclean? No, looking again, the fourth row's decision is 'mclean'. Wait, no, in row 3 (index 3), the decision is 'mclean', and so on.\n\nWait a second, actually, looking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Decision = mclean\nRow 1: Decision = mclean\nRow 2: Decision = mclean? No, wait, let me check again. The table shows that in row 2 (May 7), the decision is 'mclean'? Wait no, the fourth column is 'decision', which for May 7 is 'mclean'. Hmm, actually, all decisions are 'mclean'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Decision = mclean\n- Row 1: Decision = mclean\n- Row 2: Decision = mclean? Wait, looking at the table, in May 7, the decision is 'mclean'? No, no, actually, I think I'm confusing columns. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table, each row has 'decision' as one of the cells. Specifically:\n\n- First row (May 2): Decision = mclean\n- Second row (May 5): Decision = mclean\n- Third row (May 7): Decision = los angeles? Wait no, the fifth column is 'decision', so for May 7, decision is 'mclean'?\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look again:\n\nIn the third row (May 7), the fourth column is 'home' which is 'los angeles'. The fifth column is 'decision' which I think is 'mclean'? Or wait, maybe it's different.\n\nWait no, the table shows that in May 7, the decision is 'mclean'? Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Decision = mclean\n- Row 1: Decision = mclean\n- Row 2: Decision = mclean? No, looking at the fifth column for May 7, it's 'mclean'?\nWait no, the fifth column is 'decision', and in May 7, it's 'mclean'? Or perhaps not. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 0:\n- date: may 2\n- visitor: los angeles\n- score: 2 -5\n- home: vancouver\n- decision: mclean\n\nRow1:\n- date: may5\n- visitor: los angeles\n- score:6-3\n- home:vancouver\n- decision:mclean\n\nRow2:\n- date:may7\n- visitor:vancouver\n- score:4-7\n- home:los angeles\n- decision:mclean? Wait, no, looking at the table, in row 2, the 'decision' column is 'mclean'? Or is it something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again:\n\nIn May 7 (row 2), the decision is listed as 'mclean', right?\n\nSimilarly, for May 9 (row3), decision is mclean.\n\nMay11: decision is mclean.\n\nMay13: decision is mclean.\n\nWait, so all decisions are indeed 'mclean'. Therefore, both parts of the claim seem to be true. But wait, looking back at the table, I might have misread some cells.\n\nWait no, in May 7 (row2), the visitor is vancouver, home is los angeles, score is 4-7. The decision is mclean? Or is it 'los angeles'?\n\nWait, no, the fifth column is 'decision', so for row2, it's 'mclean'. Similarly, in row3 (May9), decision is 'mclean'.\n\nTherefore, all decisions are indeed made by McLean.\n\nAdditionally, all dates are in May: May 2,5,7,9,11,13. So the second part of the claim also holds.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table again, I realize that the series column indicates something else. Wait, but the claim is about the decision being always McLean and all dates taking place in May. The series seems to be a separate piece of information, perhaps indicating the outcome of the series, but it's not relevant to the decision maker or date.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, both parts of the claim are true: all decisions are made by McLean, and all dates are in May. Therefore, the entire claim is correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because when I look at the table, the 'decision' column might actually be indicating something else, perhaps the winner or the referee? Or maybe it's a typo.\n\nWait no, according to the problem statement, each row has 'visitor', 'score', 'home', and 'decision'. So the decision is likely referring to who made the call or decided the outcome. Therefore, if all decisions are McLean, then the first part holds.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct, so the entire statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether two claims hold based on data presented in a table. The claims are:\n\n1. All game outcomes were decided by McLean.\n2. All games took place in May.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim 1:** The 'decision' column for each game lists the name \"mclean\" as the decision-maker. This is evident across all six rows, confirming that every game's outcome was decided by McLean.\n\n- **Claim 2:** Reviewing the 'date' column shows that all games indeed occurred in May (May 2, May 5, May 7, May 9, May 11, and May 13).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth claims are supported by the data. Therefore, both statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBoth claims hold true based on the provided data. \\boxed{\\text{All games were decided by McLean and all took place in May}}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the series be 1 - 1 the attendance be 16150 and when the series be 1 - 1 the attendance be 16005.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. It looks like it's trying to say that whenever the series is 1-1, the attendance is both 16150 and 16005, which doesn't make much sense because attendance can't be two different numbers at the same time. So my initial thought is that this claim might not hold true because attendance should have a consistent value when the series is a specific score.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to check each row where the \"series\" column has the value \"1 - 1\". According to the table, let's identify those rows.\n\nRow 0: date may 2, visitor los angeles, score 2-5, home vancouver, decision mclean, attendance 16150, series 1-0. So the series here is not 1-1.\n\nRow 1: date may 5, visitor los angeles, score 6-3, home vancouver, decision mclean, attendance 16150, series 1-1. This row has a series of 1-1 and an attendance of 16150.\n\nRow 2: series is 1-2, so not relevant.\n\nRow 3: series is 2-2, not 1-1.\n\nRow 4: series is 2-3, not 1-1.\n\nRow 5: series is 2-4, also not 1-1.\n\nWait a minute, so the only row where the series is 1-1 is Row 1. In that row, the attendance is 16150. Now, the claim says when the series is 1-1, the attendance is both 16150 and 16005. But in reality, from the table, there's only one instance where series is 1-1 with attendance being 16150.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that the claim seems to have a contradiction because it's stating two different attendances (16150 and 16005) for the same series outcome. That doesn't align with how data should be presented\u2014each row should represent a single game, so each row can only have one attendance number.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim is not supported by the table because it's asserting two different attendances when there's actually only one instance of 1-1 series with an attendance of 16150. There's no row where series is 1-1 and attendance is 16005. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"the highest attendance be 16150 and it happen 2 time and the lowest attendance 16005 and it happen 4 time.\" So, breaking this down, there are two parts:\n\n1. There should be a maximum attendance of 16150 which occurred twice.\n2. There should be a minimum attendance of 16005 which occurred four times.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided to check if these conditions hold true.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' column in the table:\n\n- Row 0: 16150\n- Row 1: 16150\n- Row 2: 16005\n- Row 3: 16005\n- Row 4: 16150\n- Row 5: 16005\n\nFrom this, I can see that 16150 appears three times (rows 0, 1, and 4), not two times as the claim suggests. The minimum attendance is indeed 16005, which occurs four times (rows 2, 3, 5, and another one, but wait, in the table provided, row indices go from 0 to 5. Let me recount:\n\nRows with 16005 are rows 2, 3, and 5. That's three instances, not four as claimed.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here. The claim states that 16150 happens twice, but in reality, it happens three times. Similarly, the lowest attendance of 16005 is mentioned to occur four times, but it only occurs three times based on the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because both conditions are not fully met. The highest attendance occurs more than two times, and the lowest attendance doesn't reach four instances.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. I need to find the rows where the attendance values are 16150 (for the highest) and 16005 (for the lowest), as these will be the ones used to verify the claim's conditions.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Attendance is 16150 \u2192 relevant.\n- Row 1: Attendance is 16150 \u2192 relevant.\n- Row 2: Attendance is 16005 \u2192 relevant.\n- Row 3: Attendance is 16005 \u2192 relevant.\n- Row 4: Attendance is 16150 \u2192 relevant.\n- Row 5: Attendance is 16005 \u2192 relevant.\n\nBut since the claim states that 16150 happens twice, only two of these should be considered. However, in reality, there are three instances where attendance is 16150. Therefore, all rows with 16150 and 16005 are relevant because they show the actual counts, which differ from what's stated in the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are those where the attendance is either 16150 or 16005, as these are the ones that disprove the claim by showing higher occurrences than stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance was 16150 occurring twice and the lowest attendance 16005 occurring four times. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- **Highest Attendance (16150)** occurs three times (rows 0, 1, 4), not two.\n- **Lowest Attendance (16005)** occurs three times (rows 2, 3, 5), not four.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are not met. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nThese cells show the highest and lowest attendance values which disprove the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the decision be always mclean in the 1992 - 93 vancouver canuck season and only few date take place in may.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand each part of the claim. It mentions two main points:\n\n1. The decision is always McLean during the 1992-93 Vancouver Canucks season.\n2. Only a few dates take place in May.\n\nI need to verify these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists several games with details including date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. The dates range from May 2 to May 13, which are all in May. So the second part of the claim seems accurate\u2014most games are in May, but the exact wording is \"few dates,\" which might imply a small number. However, there are six games listed, so it's not exactly few.\n\nNow, for the first part: were all decisions made by McLean? The table has a column called 'decision' and another named 'home'. Wait, that could be confusing. Let me check each row:\n\n- May 2: Decision is mclean.\n- May 5: Decision is mclean.\n- May 7: Decision is los angeles (since home is Vancouver).\nWait, no, the decision column shows for May 7 as 1 - 2, which I think refers to series. Wait, maybe the 'decision' column indicates who won or made the call. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at each row's 'decision' column:\n- May 2: mclean\n- May 5: mclean\n- May 7: los angeles (but home is Vancouver; perhaps McLean made a decision against Vancouver)\n- May 9: mclean\n- May 11: vancouver (so not McLean)\n- May 13: los angeles\n\nWait, so the decisions alternate between McLean and others. So it's not always McLean. Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlso, the series column shows the series status, which might relate to the decision, but I think the key point is whether all decisions are by McLean. Since May 11's decision was Vancouver and May 13's was Los Angeles (or maybe it's a different type of decision), it varies.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because not all decisions were made by McLean.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that McLean always made the decision during the 1992-93 season, but the table shows varying decisions. The dates are all in May, so the second part is technically true, but the first part is false. However, since the overall claim includes both parts, it's considered false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"when the decision be mclean with the series at 2 - 3 and the home team be vancouver be the score be 3 - 5 with a date of may 13\".\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the provided HTML table. The relevant columns in the table are 'date', 'visitor', 'score', 'home', 'decision', and 'series'. \n\nLet me parse the claim into specific conditions:\n\n1. **Decision is mclean**: So, I should look for rows where 'decision' equals 'mclean'.\n2. **Series at 2 - 3**: This refers to the 'series' column, so I need to find a row where series is \"2 - 3\".\n3. **Home team is vancouver**: The 'home' column should be 'vancouver' in this case.\n4. **Score is 3 - 5**: Looking at the 'score' column for \"3 - 5\".\n5. **Date is May 13**: Check the 'date' cell for May 13.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if any match all these conditions.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Decision: mclean (yes)\n- Series: 1 - 0 (no)\n\nRow 1:\n- Decision: mclean (yes)\n- Series: 1 - 1 (no)\n\nRow 2:\n- Decision: mclean (yes)\n- Series: 1 - 2 (no)\n- Home: los angeles (no, needs to be vancouver)\n  \nWait, actually, row 2's home is 'los angeles', which doesn't match. So this row isn't a candidate.\n\nRow 3:\n- Decision: mclean (yes)\n- Series: 2 - 2 (no)\n\nRow 4:\n- Decision: mclean (yes)\n- Series: 2 - 3 (yes)\n- Home: vancouver (yes)\n- Score: 4 - 3 (no, needs to be 3 - 5)\n  \nSo this row doesn't match the score condition.\n\nRow 5:\n- Decision: mclean (yes)\n- Series: 2 - 4 (no)\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. The series in row 4 is \"2 - 3\", which matches one of the conditions. Let me recheck each column for that row.\n\nRow 4:\n- date: may 11\n- visitor: los angeles\n- score: 4 - 3\n- home: vancouver\n- decision: mclean\n- series: 2 - 3\n\nSo, this row has the correct 'home' (vancouver), series \"2 - 3\", but the score is 4 - 3 instead of 3 - 5. Therefore, it doesn't fully satisfy all conditions.\n\nContinuing to the last row:\n\nRow 5:\n- date: may 13\n- visitor: vancouver\n- score: 3 - 5 (yes)\n- home: los angeles (no, needs to be vancouver)\n  \nSo this row has the correct date and score but the wrong home team. Therefore, it doesn't meet all conditions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misassigned the rows. Let me list them again with their indices:\n\nRow 0:\n- may 2\n- los angeles\n- 2 - 5\n- vancouver\n- mclean\n- 16150\n- 1 - 0\n\nRow 1:\n- may 5\n- los angeles\n- 6 - 3\n- vancouver\n- mclean\n- 16150\n- 1 - 1\n\nRow 2:\n- may 7\n- vancouver\n- 4 - 7\n- los angeles\n- mclean\n- 16005\n- 1 - 2\n\nRow 3:\n- may 9\n- vancouver\n- 7 - 2\n- los angeles\n- mclean\n- 16005\n- 2 - 2\n\nRow 4:\n- may 11\n- los angeles\n- 4 - 3\n- vancouver\n- mclean\n- 16150\n- 2 - 3\n\nRow 5:\n- may 13\n- vancouver\n- 3 - 5\n- los angeles\n- mclean\n- 16005\n- 2 - 4\n\nWait, in row 5, the series is \"2 - 4\", not \"2 - 3\". So none of the rows have all conditions met.\n\nBut let me check again. The claim says when decision is mclean, series at 2 - 3, home team vancouver, score 3 - 5, and date may 13.\n\nLooking for a row where:\n\n- 'decision' = mclean\n- 'series' = 2 - 3\n- 'home' = vancouver\n- 'score' = 3 - 5\n- 'date' = May 13\n\nChecking each row:\n\nRow 0: series=1-0, score=2-5 \u2192 no.\nRow 1: series=1-1 \u2192 no.\nRow 2: home=los angeles \u2192 no.\nRow 3: series=2-2 \u2192 no.\nRow 4: series=2-3 (yes), home=vancouver (yes), but score=4-3 \u2192 no.\nRow 5: date=may13, score=3-5, home=los angeles \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the rows satisfy all these conditions. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check row indices again. \n\nWait, in row 4, series=2-3, which matches. But the score is 4-3, not 3-5. So no match.\n\nIn row 5, date is May13, but home is los angeles. If it were vancouver, then with series and all else, maybe. But it's not.\n\nSo, indeed, no such row exists that meets all criteria.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires a match in 'decision' (mc), 'series' (2-3), 'home' (vancouver), 'score' (3-5), and 'date' (May13). Upon reviewing each row, none satisfy all these conditions. Therefore, the claim is **false**.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{False}",

The table has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, series.\n\nThe claim mentions two scores: 7 - 2 and 4 - 3. It also specifies that these occur on May 9 and May 13 with attendances of 16005 and 16150 respectively.\n\nLet me go through the table row by row to find the relevant data.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. May 2: Los Angeles scored 6-3 against Vancouver. Attendance was 16150.\n2. May 5: Los Angeles scored 6-3 against Vancouver again. Attendance same as above.\n3. May 7: Vancouver scored 4-7 against Los Angeles. Attendance was lower at 16005.\n4. May 9: Vancouver scored 7-2 against Los Angeles. Attendance was 16005.\n5. May 11: Los Angeles scored 4-3 against Vancouver. Attendance was 16150.\n6. May 13: Vancouver scored 3-5 against Los Angeles. Attendance was again 16005.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim:\n\n- The highest scores between Vancouver and Los Angeles are mentioned as 7 - 2 and 4 - 3.\n\nLooking at the table, on May 9, Vancouver (away) had a score of 7 - 2 against Los Angeles. On May 11, Los Angeles scored 4 - 3 against Vancouver. So both these scores exist in the table.\n\n- The claim says these occurred on May 9 and May 13. Wait, May 13 was when Vancouver scored 3 - 5, not 7 - 2 or 4 - 3. So that seems off. It should be May 9 for 7 - 2 and May 11 for 4 - 3.\n\n- Attendance: For the 7 - 2 game on May 9, attendance was 16005. For the 4 - 3 game on May 11, attendance was 16150. So that matches.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's stated as occurring on May 9 and May 13. But the 4 - 3 game is on May 11, not May 13. Therefore, the dates don't match correctly. The claim says May 9 and May 13, but the actual games are on May 9 and May 11.\n\nSo this discrepancy makes part of the claim incorrect because May 13 doesn't have either of those scores. Instead, May 11 has the 4 - 3 score with a higher attendance.\n\nThus, the dates in the claim don't align perfectly with the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's highest scores and their dates partially match the table, but there's an error regarding May 13.
