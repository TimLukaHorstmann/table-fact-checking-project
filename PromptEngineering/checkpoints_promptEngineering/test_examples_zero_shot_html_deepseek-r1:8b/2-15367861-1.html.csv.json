    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 point.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts. It mentions Corinthians amassing 22 points and having less than 11 losses. So, I need to check two things from the table: their total points and their number of losses.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team. I should find the row where the team is Corinthians. Scanning through the 'team' column, I see \"corinthians\" in row 6.\n\nIn that row, the points column has 22. That matches the condition of amassing 22 points. Now, checking the losses. The 'lost' column for Corinthians shows 10 losses. \n\nThe claim states less than 11 losses, and since 10 is less than 11, this condition is met. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need the row index where Corinthians are located (which is row 6) and the column for points and losses. The columns are 'points' and 'lost'. So, the relevant_cells should include row 6 with both these columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to say that Corinthians didn't lose any games when they scored more than 25 points. So, I need to find all instances where Corinthians scored over 25 points and check their loss column for those specific rows.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a team's performance. For Corinthians, I'll look for their name in the 'team' column. Scanning through the list, I find that Corinthians are in row 6 (row_index: 5 if we start counting from 0) because the 'position' goes from 1 to 12, so row indices would be 0 to 11. Wait, no, in the HTML table, each <tr> is a row starting with position 1 as the first row, which is index 0 or 1? Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the first row has position 1, so if I'm considering the rows starting from 0, then Corinthians are at row_index 5. But for the purpose of this task, I'll consider each row's position as given and map their indices accordingly.\n\nIn row 6 (position 6), the team is Corinthians. Let me check their points: it says 22 points. The claim mentions scoring over 25 points, so 22 isn't over 25. Therefore, this row doesn't apply because they didn't score more than 25.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I misread. Let me recheck. The claim is about when Corinthians scored over 25 points. So, looking for rows where the 'points' column is above 25.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: palestra it\u00e1lia - sp has 36 points.\n- Row 1: s\u00e3o paulo has 34 points.\n- Row 2: portuguesa has 30 points.\n- Row 3: bangu has 29 points.\n- Row 4: vasco da gama has 24 points.\n- Row 5: corinthians have 22 points.\n- Row 6: fluminense has 20 points.\n- Row 7: Am\u00e9rica has 18 points.\n- Row 8: santos has 17 points.\n- Row 9: bonsucesso has 16 points.\n- Row 10: aa s\u00e3o bento has 13 points.\n- Row 11: ypiranga - sp has 5 points.\n\nWait, none of the teams scored over 25 points except maybe palestra it\u00e1lia and s\u00e3o paulo. Let me check those.\n\nRow 0: palestra it\u00e1lia - sp, points 36. But their team isn't Corinthians. Their position is 1. So they scored 36 when they played, but that's not Corinthians.\n\nRow 1: s\u00e3o paulo, points 34. Not Corinthians either.\n\nSo, wait, looking through all the rows, no team named Corinthians has points over 25. The closest is Corinthians at row 5 with 22 points. Therefore, there are zero games where Corinthians scored over 25 points because they never did in this table. So the claim might be true because they didn't have any such cases to lose.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point.\" So if Corinthians never scored over 25, then there are zero losses related to that scenario. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the condition doesn't occur, so the number of losses (which would be zero) matches.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim had said \"Corinthians have zero losses when they score over 25 points,\" and if Corinthians never scored over 25, then their losses in those hypothetical games are also zero. So it's TRUE because the condition is met trivially.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that in all cases where a team scores more than 25, they didn't lose. But since no Corinthians have ever scored above 25, there's nothing to check. Therefore, the claim holds as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point,\" we need to examine the table for any instances where Corinthians scored more than 25 points and check their loss column in those rows.\n\n1. **Identify Corinthians' Rows**: Look through each row's 'team' column for Corinthians. They are found in row 6 (row_index: 5 if counting from 0) with 22 points.\n2. **Check Points vs. Threshold**: Compare the points scored by Corinthians to the threshold of 25. Their score is 22, which does not exceed 25.\n3. **Conclusion on Losses**: Since Corinthians never scored over 25 points in this table, there are no rows where their loss status is relevant. Thus, the condition in the claim is trivially satisfied as zero losses occurred in scenarios that didn't happen.\n\nThe claim holds true because Corinthians never had a game where they scored more than 25 points, making the number of losses in such cases zero.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
