    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"french and portuguese be the language for the film title use in nomination for elles.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that both French and Portuguese are the languages used for the film title in the nomination for \"elles.\" So I need to check if these languages match the information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, and result. The relevant parts here are the \"languages\" column and the \"film title used in nomination.\"\n\nI should find the row where the film title is \"elles.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: film title is \"elles.\"\n- Rows 1 to others have different titles.\n\nSo, for the first row (row_index 0), the film title is \"elles,\" and under the \"languages\" column, it says \"french , portuguese.\" \n\nThe claim states that French and Portuguese are the languages. So this row has exactly those two languages listed. There's a space before \"portuguese,\" but I think that's just formatting, so it doesn't affect the content.\n\nNow, to verify if this supports the claim fully. Since in the relevant row (row 0), under \"languages,\" French and Portuguese are indeed mentioned, the claim is supported by this data. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the one for languages in row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: year, film title used in nomination, original title, languages, director, and result. The claim is specifically about French being the language used for the film title when it was nominated for \"r\u00e9fractaire\". \n\nSo, I should start by finding the relevant row in the table. The film title is \"refractaire\", so I'll search each row's 'film title used in nomination' column to find a match. Scanning through, I see that in 2009 (82nd), the film title used is \"refractaire\". That seems to be the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, for this particular row, I need to check if French was indeed the language used for the film title in its nomination. Looking at the 'languages' column for this row, it says \"french\". So that's a match.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The claim is about the language used in the film title during the nomination. In this case, the film title is \"refractaire\", and according to the table, under 'film title used in nomination', it's spelled as \"refractaire\". The 'languages' column lists French for this entry.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information here. Both the film title and the language listed are French. So, the claim holds true based on this row.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are other relevant cells beyond the obvious ones. But in this case, since the claim is directly about the language used for the film title \"r\u00e9fractaire\", only the 'languages' column of that specific row (2009) is relevant. There's no need to consider other columns like director or result unless they might affect the nomination process, but the table doesn't provide such information, so it's best to stick with what's given.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each part of the claim against the table, I can confidently say that French was indeed used as the language for the film title in the nomination of \"r\u00e9fractaire\".\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2009 (82nd), \"column_name\": \"languages\"}]}",

The claim says, \"the original title le roman de renart has 1 language.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table to find where this original title appears. Let me scan each row's \"original title\" column.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- 1997: elles\n- 1998: back in trouble\n- 2003: j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\n- 2005: le roman de renart\n- 2006: your name is justine\n- 2007: perl oder pica\n- 2008: nuits d'arabie\n- 2009: r\u00e9fractaire\n\nI see that in the 2005 row, the original title is \"le roman de renart.\" That's the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, I need to check how many languages this film was submitted in. The table has a column called \"languages,\" so I'll look at that for the same row.\n\nIn the 2005 row, under \"languages,\" it says \"french.\" So there's only one language listed: French.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the original title \"le roman de renart\" having 1 language.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two things: the director's name and the original title. The claim says that Pol Cruchten was the director for the film \"perl oder pica.\" So, I need to verify if in the table, there's an entry where the director is Pol Cruchten and the original title is \"perl oder pica.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and provides information about the film used in the nomination, the original title, languages, director, and the result. I'll need to find the row where these two specific pieces of information match.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Year 1997, film \"elles,\" original title \"elles.\" Director is Lu\u00eds Galv\u00e3o Teles, not Pol Cruchten. So this isn't it.\n\nRow 1: Year 1998, film \"back in trouble,\" original title same. Director Andy Bausch. Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: 2003, film \"i always wanted to be a saint,\" original French. Director Genevi\u00e8ve Mersch. No match.\n\nRow 3: 2005, \"renart the fox,\" original French. Director Thierry Schiel. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4: 2006, \"your name is justine,\" same title in Polish and English. Director Franco De Penha. Not matching.\n\nRow 5: 2007, film \"little secrets,\" original German as \"perl oder pica.\" Director Pol Cruchten. Wait, here's a match. The director for the original title \"perl oder pica\" is indeed Pol Cruchten. So this row has the information we need.\n\nRow 6: 2008, \"nuits d'arabie,\" French and Arabic. Director Paul Kieffer. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: 2009, \"refractaire,\" French. Director Nicolas Steil. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, in Row 5 (index 5), the director is Pol Cruchten for the original title \"perl oder pica.\" That matches exactly what the claim states.

Each cell's relevance is determined by whether they contain information that supports the claim.

The table seems to be related to film nominations or something like that, with various details including the year, film titles, original titles, languages, directors, and results.\n\nThe specific claim given is: \"renart the fox be in polish and english.\" My job is to check each condition against the table and figure out which cells are relevant. If all conditions are met, I have to say TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that the film titled \"Renart the Fox\" was available in both Polish and English languages. So, I need to look for this specific film title in the table and then verify if its languages include Polish and English.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different film and year. Let me go through each row one by one until I find the film titled \"Renart the Fox.\"\n\nStarting from the first row: 1997, \"Elles,\" \"elles\" \u2013 not matching.\n\nSecond row: 1998, \"Back in Trouble,\" \"back in trouble\" \u2013 nope.\n\nThird row: 2003, \"I Always Wanted to Be a Saint,\" French \u2013 doesn't match.\n\nFourth row: 2005, \"Renart the Fox,\" French \u2013 close, but language is only French. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The fourth row says:\n\n- Year: 2005 (78th)\n- Film title used in nomination: renart the fox\n- Original title: le roman de renart\n- Languages: french\n- Director: thierry schiel\n- Result: not nominated\n\nSo, the film's nomination title is \"renart the fox,\" but under languages, it's only French. No mention of Polish or English here. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row. Let me continue.\n\nFifth row: 2006 (79th), \"Your Name Is Justine,\" Polish and English \u2013 not relevant to Renart.\n\nSixth row: 2007 (80th), \"Little Secrets\" (Perl oder Pica), Luxembourgish \u2013 nope.\n\nSeventh row: 2008, \"Nuits d'Arabie,\" French and Arabic.\n\nEighth row: 2009, \"R\u00e9fractaire,\" French again.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me list all the films:\n\n1. Elles\n2. Back in Trouble\n3. I Always Wanted to Be a Saint\n4. Renart the Fox\n5. Your Name Is Justine\n6. Little Secrets\n7. Nuits d'Arabie\n8. Refractaire\n\nSo, \"Renart the Fox\" is row 4. But in that row, languages are French only. There's no Polish or English mentioned.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"renart the fox be in polish and english.\" So, it's asserting that both languages were present for this film. Since the table shows only French, does that mean the claim is false?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should check if any other row has \"Renart the Fox\" with different languages. But from the table provided, there's only one occurrence of \"renart the fox\" in the 'film title used in nomination' column.\n\nBut maybe I should also consider the original title or other columns. For example, sometimes films might have alternative titles that are in different languages. However, the claim specifically mentions \"Renart the Fox,\" so it's about the film's nomination title, not necessarily the original one. Let me check row 4 again.\n\nOriginal title for Renart is \"le roman de renart,\" which is French. So even if I look at that, it's still only French.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting the table. Maybe the languages are listed as multiple options, so in row 6: \"perl oder pica\" (Luxembourgish), but that's for another film.\n\nAlternatively, could \"renart the fox\" have different language versions elsewhere? But looking at the table, only the fourth row matches the film title exactly.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any other row has \"Renart the Fox.\" Let me scan again: no, it seems unique to row 4. So, in that case, the languages for Renart are only French.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"renart the fox be in polish and english\" is false because the table shows only French language for that film.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}]}",

Let me start by carefully examining the table and understanding each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It says that \"your name is justine\" is in French. So I should look for a row where the film title used in nomination is \"your name is justine,\" specifically check the language column to see if it mentions French.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows. Each row has several columns: year, film title, original title, languages, director, and result.\n\nI'll scan each row for the film title \"your name is justine.\" Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1.

Fourth row: \"renart the fox\" \u2013 still no.\n5. Fifth row: \"your name is justine\" \u2013 yes, this matches.\n\nNow, focusing on this fifth row, let's check the languages column. The entry here says \"polish , english.\" Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, the claim is about being in French, but according to the table, it's listed as Polish and English.\n\nSo, does this mean the claim is false? Because the film's original title is in French, but in the languages column, it's mentioned as \"polish , english.\" Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused between the film title used in nomination and the original title. In the row for 2006, the film title used in nomination is \"your name is justine,\" but the original title is \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte,\" which translates to \"I Always Wanted to Be a Saint.\" The languages column lists both Polish and English, not French.\n\nSo, the claim says that \"your name is justine\" is in French. However, according to the table, the film's original title is in French, but when it was nominated, the film title used was \"your name is justine,\" which might have been in another language. The languages listed for this entry include Polish and English, not French.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let me clarify:\n\n- \"film title used in nomination\" vs. \"original title.\" In the 2006 row, both are \"your name is justine,\" but wait no\u2014looking again: no, the original title for that row is actually \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte,\" which is French, while the film title used in nomination is also \"your name is justine.\"\n\nSo the languages column lists \"polish , english.\" So perhaps the claim is incorrect because the film's original title is in French, but the entry for languages might refer to the version submitted or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim specifically says that \"your name is justine\" is in French. Looking at the table, the film title used in nomination for 2006 is indeed \"your name is justine,\" and the original title is also \"your name is justine.\" Wait no\u2014wait, in the row, the first two columns are the same: \"your name is justine\" in both. So perhaps that's a typo or maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nIn the 2006 row, \"film title used in nomination\" is \"your name is justine,\" and \"original title\" is \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte.\" So they're different titles but with similar meanings. The languages column lists \"polish , english.\"\n\nSo the claim says that \"your name is justine\" is in French. However, according to the table, that film's original title is in French, but the film title used for nomination is also \"your name is justine,\" which is listed as being in Polish and English.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the columns. Let me make sure:\n\nIn the 2006 row:\n\n- year: 2006 (79th)\n- film title: your name is justine\n- original title: j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte\n- languages: polish , english\n- director: franco de pena\n- result: disqualified\n\nSo, the claim is about \"your name is justine\" being in French. But according to the table, the film's language is listed as Polish and English. Therefore, the claim that it's in French would be false.\n\nBut wait, the original title is in French. Does that matter? The claim specifically refers to the film title used in nomination. So if the film title \"your name is justine\" is in Polish and English, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"your name is justine\" is in French.

Maybe also include the result column to see if there was a disqualification or not, but in this case, it's \"not nominated\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row 4, columns \"film title used in nomination\", \"original title\", and possibly others like director or result for context.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the original title of \"renart the fox\" is \"le roman de renart\", not \"perl oder pica\". \n\nRelevant cells: \n- row 4, \"film title used in nomination\"\n- row 4, \"original title\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the original title for refractaire be back in trouble\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions two titles, \"refractaire\" and \"back in trouble.\" The claim seems to state that the original title of \"refractaire\" is \"back in trouble.\" So, I need to find out if this is accurate based on the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and film. The relevant columns here are \"film title used in nomination,\" \"original title,\" and perhaps others, but mainly these two titles.\n\nI'll start by searching for the term \"refractaire\" in the table. Scanning through each row's \"film title used in nomination\" column:\n\n- 1997: elles\n- 1998: back in trouble\n- 2003: i always wanted to be a saint\n- 2005: renart the fox\n- 2006: your name is justine\n- 2007: little secrets\n- 2008: nuits d'arabie\n- 2009: refractaire\n\nAh, here it is. In 2009 (82nd), the \"film title used in nomination\" is \"refractaire,\" and the \"original title\" is also \"r\u00e9fractaire.\" So, the original title for \"refractaire\" is indeed \"r\u00e9fractaire.\"\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the original title for refractaire be back in trouble.\" That would mean that the original title of \"refractaire\" is \"back in trouble,\" which doesn't align with what's in the table. The original title is \"r\u00e9fractaire,\" not \"back in trouble.\"\n\nNow, I should check if there's a film titled \"back in trouble\" whose original title might be \"refractaire.\" Looking at 1998 (71st), the film title used is \"back in trouble,\" and the original title is \"l\u00ebtzebuergesch , german,\" which translates to Luxembourgish or German. So, \"back in trouble\" was originally in those languages but not necessarily \"refractaire.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly attributes the original title of \"refractaire\" to \"back in trouble.\" The correct original title is \"r\u00e9fractaire.\" Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: the claim refers to two elements\u2014the original titles for both films. So, I need to identify which rows and columns are relevant. For \"refractaire,\" it's in 2009, row index 8 (since it starts from 0), column \"original title.\" For \"back in trouble,\" it's in 1998, row index 1, same column.\n\nWait, the claim is specifically about the original title of refractaire being back in trouble. So, perhaps only the relevant cells are for refractaire's original title and the other film's details? Or maybe just the ones that directly relate to the claim.\n\nIn this case, since the claim states that the original title of \"refractaire\" is \"back in trouble,\" I need to check both films. So, I'll include the row where refractaire is listed (row 8) and the row where back in trouble is listed (row 1). Also, for each of those, their \"original title\" column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For refractaire: row 8, column \"original title\"\n- For back in trouble: row 1, column \"original title\"\n\nThese are the cells that directly relate to the claim's assertion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"original title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"original title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
