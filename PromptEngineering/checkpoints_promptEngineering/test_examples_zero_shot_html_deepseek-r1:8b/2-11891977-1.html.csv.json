    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula be the nominee for best lead actress\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various awards from 2001, including categories like Best Telenovela, Best Lead Actress, and so on. Each row has details about the nominee and whether they won or were nominated.\n\nThe claim mentions \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula\" as a nominee for \"best lead actress.\" So I need to check if there's a row in the table where the nominee is \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula\" and the category is \"best lead actress.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has \"abr\u00e1zame muy fuerte\" as the nominee for Best Telenovela, which isn't relevant.\n2. The second row has \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula\" as the nominee for Best Lead Actress and the result is \"nominated.\" That matches the claim exactly.\n3. The third row is about the lead actor, so not relevant here.\n4. Subsequent rows don't mention anything about aracely ar\u00e1mbula again.\n\nSo, there's at least one row where she was nominated for Best Lead Actress. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"row_index\" is based on their position in the table body. The second row (index 1) has the category \"best lead actress\" and the nominee \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula.\"\n\nWait, but in programming, rows are often zero-indexed. So the first row is index 0, the second is index 1, etc. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row_index 1 and column_name \"best lead actress.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"best lead actress\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim is: \"in 2001 there be a category of best support actress.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table for the year 2001. The relevant column here is 'category'. I'm specifically looking for any entry that mentions \"best support actress.\"\n\nLooking through the categories:\n- best telenovela\n- best lead actress\n- best lead actor\n- best female villain\n- best male villain\n- best supporting actress\n- best supporting actor\n- best first actress\n- best first actor\n- best song for a telenovela\n\nI see that there's a category called \"best supporting actress.\" This matches the claim exactly. So, this cell directly supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there is a category named \"best support actress\" in 2001 as per the table, the claim must be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the presence of the \"best supporting actress\" category in the 2001 tvynovelas awards. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"nailea norvind be the nominee who win for best male villain.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find where \"nailea norvind\" is mentioned. Scanning each row, I see that in row 4, the nominee is \"nailea norvind,\" and under the category \"best female villain,\" the result is \"won.\" So she won in the best female villain category.\n\nBut the claim mentions her being a nominee who won for best male villain. That seems off because the category for her was female. Also, looking at the table, in row 5, the best male villain was won by c\u00e9sar \u00e9vora, not nailea norvind.\n\nSo, the claim is mixing up categories and genders. Nailea won as a female villain, not as a male villain. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"there was a tie for best support actress in 2001.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to see which rows might be relevant. The claim mentions \"best support actress,\" so I should focus on the 'category' column for that. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 0: best telenovela\n- Row 1: best lead actress\n- Row 2: best lead actor\n- Row 3: best female villain\n- Row 4: best male villain\n- Row 5: best supporting actress (Carmen Salinas, nominated)\n- Row 6: best supporting actor\n- Row 7: best first actress\n- Row 8: best first actor\n- Row 9: best song for a telenovela\n\nOnly row 5 pertains to 'best supporting actress.' Looking at the 'result' column for that row, it says \"nominated.\" There's no indication of a tie because only Carmen Salinas was nominated; there's no other name listed in that category. Therefore, the claim about a tie is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Carmen Salinas was nominated for best supporting actress in 2001 but there's no evidence of a tie.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"best supporting actress\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
