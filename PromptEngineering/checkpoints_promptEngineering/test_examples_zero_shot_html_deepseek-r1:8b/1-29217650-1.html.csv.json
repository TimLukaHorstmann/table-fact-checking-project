    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 28 be p13.6 million.\" So I need to check if the movie \"ang tanging ina mo\" had a revenue of P13.6 million on December 28.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different movie, and the columns correspond to specific dates: december 25, 26, 27, 28, and then two additional columns for totals over those five days and the total over two weeks.\n\nSo I need to locate \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that it's the first row under the header. The relevant data is in the \"december 28\" column for this movie.\n\nLooking at the specific cell: In the tbody section, the first row has \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" as the movies, and the numbers are p20 million on dec25, p18 million on dec26, p16.5 million on dec27, and p13.6 million on dec28.\n\nSo the figure for December 28 is indeed P13.6 million. That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant cell, but since the claim only refers to one specific date and movie, I think just that one cell is needed. So the relevant cells are row 0 (since it's the first data row) and the column \"december 28\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december 28\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 27 be p16.5 million.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has headers like \"movies,\" dates from December 25 to 28, and two additional columns: \"december 25 - 28 total\" and \"total 2 - week gross.\" Each row represents a movie with its daily revenues for those four days and the total.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" on December 27. So I need to find the correct row for this movie. Scanning through the rows, I see that the first row after the headers is ang tanging ina mo with revenues p16.5 million on December 27. \n\nI should verify each part of the claim against the table. The date is December 27, which matches the fourth column (december 28) in the table? Wait, no. The columns are december 25, 26, 27, 28. So December 27 would be the third column. Let me check: for ang tanging ina mo, on December 27, it's p16.5 million. Yes, that matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december 27\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a film's box office performance is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let me restate the claim in my own words: \"The film for December 25 with a figure of P5.1 million total P15.3 million for the December 25-28 total.\" So, I'm looking for a movie that was released on December 25th, and its box office performance from that day through December 28th is P5.1 million daily and P15.3 million overall for those four days.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it's an HTML table with columns: movies, december 25, december 26, december 27, december 28, dec25-28 total, and total 2-week gross.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the film that matches December 25th box office of P5.1 million and a total from Dec25-28 of P15.3 million.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" has p5.1 million on Dec25, but its total for those four days is p67.9 million, which doesn't match 15.3 million. So that's not it.\n\nSecond row: \"dalaw\" has p12.5 million on Dec25, so that's higher than the claim's 5.1 million. So this isn't matching either.\n\nThird row: \"father jejemon\" starts with p1.4 million on Dec25, which is lower than the claimed 5.1. Not a match.\n\nFourth row: \"rosario\" has p3.2 million on Dec25, still not 5.1. So not relevant here.\n\nFifth row: \"rpg : metanoia\" shows p5.1 million on Dec25 and a total of P15.3 million for the four days (p15.3 million). Wait, looking at the table, under \"december 25 -28 total,\" it's p15.3 million. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the fifth row is the film in question: \"rpg : metanoia.\" It has Dec25 box office of P5.1 million and a four-day total of P15.3 million, which exactly matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this data. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row_index 4 (since it's zero-based) for both \"movies\" and the specific columns mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"movies\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"december 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"december 25 - 28 total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the movie 'rosario' earned p3.2 million on december 25.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has headers like movies, each date from December 25 to 28, and two total columns. Each row represents a different movie with their daily revenues for those dates.\n\nI need to find the row corresponding to \"rosario\" because that's the movie in question.

In the table, under \"december 25\", the revenue for \"rosario\" is listed as p3.2 million. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo, the claim is stating that on December 25, \"rosario\" earned p3.2 million.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the film father jejemon earned p1.4 million on december 27.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant. Looking at the table headers, the columns related to the claim would be 'movies' and the specific dates and amounts.\n\nThe film in question is \"father jejemon,\" so that's under the first row (row_index: 0). The columns we need to check are December 25, 26, 27, and 28, as well as the total for those days and the two-week gross. But wait, the claim mentions \"on december 27,\" so I should focus on that specific date.\n\nIn the table, each row has entries under the respective dates. For \"father jejemon,\" the December 25 entry is p1.4 million? Let me check: looking at the first row, yes, the fourth cell (december 28) is p0.6 million, but wait, no, the columns are dec25, dec26, dec27, dec28. So for \"father jejemon,\" the cells would be:\n\n- dec25: p1.4 million\n- dec26: p1.2 million\n- dec27: p0.8 million\n- dec28: p0.6 million\n\nWait, no.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to specific columns and rows in the table. The claim mentions \"father jejemon\" and a specific date, December 25. Looking at the table headers, I see that each row represents a movie title, and the columns are the dates from December 25 to December 28, followed by two additional columns for totals.\n\nSo, the key elements in the claim are:\n1. The movie title: \"father jejemon\"\n2. The date: December 25\n\nI need to find the cell where both of these match in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n- Row 0: ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) \u2013 not father jejemon\n- Row 1: dalaw \u2013 not father jejemon\n- Row 2: father jejemon \u2013 this is the movie we're interested in. Now, let's check December 25 for this row.\n\nIn the columns, the first column after \"december 25\" is \"p1.4 million\". Wait, that doesn't match p2.1 million. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"p2.1 million be the figure for father jejemon in december 25.\" So I need to find if any cell under \"father jejemon\" row and \"december 25\" column has this value.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 2: father jejemon\nDecember 25: p1.4 million\n\nBut the claim says p2.1 million. That doesn't match. Wait, is there another row for father jejemon? Let me check all rows.\n\nNo, there's only one occurrence of \"father jejemon\" in row 2. So the figure under December 25 is p1.4 million, not p2.1 million.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the columns. The first few columns are dates: dec25, dec26, etc., followed by two totals. So, for father jejemon (row 2), the first column (dec25) is p1.4 million. Therefore, the figure for December 25 is indeed p1.4 million.\n\nBut the claim says it's p2.1 million. That doesn't match. So the claim must be FALSE because the actual figure under father jejemon on dec25 is p1.4 million, not p2.1 million.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread something. Let me check again. The row for father jejemon is row 3 (if starting from 0). Wait no, rows are numbered as per HTML, so the first row is index 0: ang tanging ina mo..., second row is dalaw (index1), third is father jejemon (index2). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the figure for dec25 under father jejemon is p1.4 million, not p2.1 million. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"p2.1 million be the figure for father jejemon in december 25.\" Upon examining the table, the movie \"father jejemon\" appears in row index 2 with a December 25 value of p1.4 million, not p2.1 million. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"december 25\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in HTML format, and a claim that says \"p18 million be the figure for rosario on december 27\". I need to check if this is true or false by looking at the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The columns are: movies, december 25, december 26, december 27, december 28, dec25-28 total, and total 2-week gross. Each row represents a different movie.\n\nThe claim is about \"rosario\" on December 27. So I need to find the row where the first cell is \"rosario\" and check the value in the december 27 column.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. The second row has \"dalaw\".\n2. The third row has \"father jejemon\".\n3. The fourth row has \"rosario\". That's the one we need.\n4. The fifth row is \"rpg : metanoia\".\n5. Sixth: \"shake, rattle & roll xii\"\n6. Seventh: \"si agimat at si enteng kabisote\"\n\nSo the relevant row is row index 3 (since it starts counting from 0 or 1? Let me check. The first row after thead is index 0, so the fourth row is index 3). Wait, in JSON example, the first data row was index 0, right? So the rows are:\n\nRow 0: ang tanging ina mo...\nRow 1: dalaw\nRow 2: father jejemon\nRow 3: rosario\nSo yes, row index is 3 for \"rosario\".\n\nNow, looking at the columns. The claim refers to december 27. In the table headers, the columns are:\n\n- movies (index 0)\n- december 25 (1)\n- dec26 (2)\n- dec27 (3)\n- dec28 (4)\n- total (5)\n- 2-week gross (6)\n\nSo the column name is \"december 27\", which in the headers is the fourth column, index 3.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nrow index: 3, column_name: december 27.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says p18 million for rosario on dec27. Looking at row 3 (rosario), under dec27 column, which is the third column in data (index 3). The value is p16.5 million? Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, each row's cells: \n\nRow 3: \n- movies: rosario\n- dec25: p3.2M\n- dec26: p2.5M\n- dec27: p2.1M\n- dec28: p1.4M\nTotal: p9M\n2-week gross: p16M\n\nSo the value for december 27 is p2.1 million, not p18 million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the actual figure is p2.1M, not p18M.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is row index 3 (rosario) and column \"december 27\". The value there is p2.1 million, which does not match the claim of p18 million.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"december 27\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
