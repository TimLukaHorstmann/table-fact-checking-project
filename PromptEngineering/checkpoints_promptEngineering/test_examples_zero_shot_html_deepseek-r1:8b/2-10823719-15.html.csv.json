    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided HTML table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"On July 14, 1979 at VFL Park, the away team Geelong scored 11.12 (78).\" \n\nI should look for rows where the date is July 14, 1979 and the venue is VFL Park. Then, check if the away team is Geelong and their score matches 11.12 (78).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first few rows have the date as \"14 july 1979\" but none mention VFL Park except one row.\n- Row 5 has the venue as \"vfl park\" (lowercase). The date here is also \"15 july 1979,\" which doesn't match July 14th. So, this can't be it.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Melbourne vs South Melbourne at McG \u2013 Date is 14 July, but venue isn't VFL Park.\n2. Footscray vs St Kilda at Western Oval \u2013 Same date, wrong venue.\n3. Collingwood vs North Melbourne at Victoria Park \u2013 Different date (also 14th, but not the right team or score).\n4. Carlton vs Essendon at Princes Park \u2013 Different date and venue.\n5. Hawthorn vs Geelong at VFL Park \u2013 Wait, this row is for Hawthorn as home with Geelong away. The score is Geelong's, which is 11.12 (78). But the date here is \"14 july 1979,\" so that matches.\n\nSo in row 5, the away team is Geelong with the exact score mentioned. However, the claim says July 14 at VFL Park, but according to this, it's correct. Wait, no: The claim's venue is VFL Park, and the date is July 14. In the table, row 5 has both the correct venue and date for Geelong.\n\nWait another moment. Let me check again:\n\nRow indices start at 0. So:\n\n- Row 0: Melbourne vs South Melbourne\n- Row 1: Footscray vs St Kilda\n- Row 2: Collingwood vs North Melbourne\n- Row 3: Carlton vs Essendon\n- Row 4: Hawthorn vs Geelong (home team is Hawthorn, away is Geelong)\n- Row 5: Richmond vs Fitzroy\n\nSo in row 4, the away team is Geelong with a score of 11.12 (78), and the date is \"14 july 1979.\" The venue is VFL Park. So that matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but the claim's date is July 14, which matches row 4. Venue is VFL Park, correct. Team is Geelong as away, score 11.12 (78). All conditions met.\n\nBut wait, looking back at my initial analysis, I thought maybe row 5 was the one, but no. Row 5 is on July 15. So row 4 is the one with all matching details.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a sports event is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"richmond 's play against the away team geelong to a crowd of 20777 at the western oval on july 14 1979.\"\n\nI need to verify each part of this claim against the table. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet me identify the key components of the claim:\n\n1. Home team: Richmond\n2. Away team: Geelong\n3. Venue: Western Oval\n4. Crowd size: 20777\n5. Date: July 14, 1979\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- The first row (row_index 0) is Melbourne vs South Melbourne at McG.\n- Second row (1): Footscray vs St Kilda at Western Oval.\n- Third (2): Collingwood vs North Melbourne at Victoria Park.\n- Fourth (3): Carlton vs Essendon at Princes Park.\n- Fifth (4): Hawthorn vs Geelong at VFL Park.\n- Sixth (5): Richmond vs Fitzroy at SCG.\n\nWait, the claim mentions Richmond playing against Geelong. Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 0: Melbourne\nRow1: Footscray\nRow2: Collingwood\nRow3: Carlton\nRow4: Hawthorn vs Geelong\nRow5: Richmond vs Fitzroy\n\nSo, in row 4, it's Hawthorn (home) against Geelong (away). Therefore, Geelong is the away team in that game. The claim mentions Richmond as home and Geelong as away.\n\nBut looking for Richmond as home team: only found in row 5 where Richmond plays Fitzroy at SCG. So, in the table, on July 15, 1979 (row 5), Richmond is playing Fitzroy, not Geelong.\n\nNow, the claim says the game was on July 14, 1979, but according to the table, Richmond's game against Fitzroy was on July 15, 1979. So the date doesn't match either.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: Date is July 14\nRow1: Same date\nRow2: July14?\nRow3: July14\nRow4: July14\nRow5: July15\n\nSo, the claim's date is July14, but Richmond's game was on July15. So the date in the claim doesn't match the actual date in the table.\n\nAdditionally, the venue in the claim is Western Oval, which is listed for row1 (Footscray vs St Kilda) with a crowd of 13386. But the claim has a crowd size of 20777, which corresponds to row4 (Hawthorn vs Geelong at VFL Park). So the crowd number doesn't match.\n\nAlso, the venue in the claim is Western Oval, but that's where Footscray played, not Richmond. So the venue is incorrect for Richmond's game.\n\nMoreover, the claim says Richmond is playing against Geelong as away team. But looking through all the rows, I don't see a row where Richmond (home) plays Geelong (away). The only Geelong match is in row4 where Hawthorn hosts them. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The home team in the claim is Richmond, but in the table, on July14, Richmond isn't playing. They play on July15 against Fitzroy.\n- The away team is Geelong, which does play against Hawthorn on July14 at VFL Park with a crowd of 20777, but that's not Richmond's game.\n- The venue is Western Oval, but that was Footscray's game.\n- The crowd size is 20777, which matches the Hawthorn vs Geelong game, but again, that's not Richmond.\n\nSo all parts of the claim don't align with the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because none of the elements in the claim match the actual data in the table for that specific date and teams.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Richmond played against Geelong at Western Oval on July 14, 1979. However, based on the table, these details do not align with any single game recorded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
