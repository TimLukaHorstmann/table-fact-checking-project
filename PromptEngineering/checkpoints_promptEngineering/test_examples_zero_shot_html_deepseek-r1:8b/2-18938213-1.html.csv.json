    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"yuri kadenatsy (urs) win silver in 1982\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions Yuri Kadenatsy from the USSR winning silver in 1982. So, I need to check if there's a row for 1982 where he's awarded silver.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, and each column is either gold, silver, or bronze. The years go from 1970 up to 2009. Scanning through the rows, I see that 1982 is one of them. Let me find that specific row.\n\nIn the 1982 row, the place is Caracas. The gold medalist is Nikolai Dedov (urs), silver is Yuri Kadenatsy (urs), and bronze is Jerzy Greszkiewicz (pol). So yes, in 1982, Yuri Kadenatsy won silver.\n\nNow, I need to check if he's indeed listed there with the correct details. The name matches exactly: \"yuri kadenatsy (urs)\". So, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the 1982 row under silver.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"yuri kadenatsy ( urs ) win silver in 1983\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Yuri Kadenatsy from the Soviet Union (urs) won silver in 1983. To verify this, I need to look into the table for the year 1983 and see if there's an entry for someone named Yuri Kadenatsy in the silver column.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for year, place, gold, silver, and bronze. Each row represents a specific year with details about the medals. So, I'll focus on the rows where the year is 1983.\n\nScrolling through the table, I find the row for 1983. The place is Edmonton. In the silver column, the name listed is Nikolai Dedov (urs). Hmm, that's not Yuri Kadenatsy. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. No, it says \"nikolai dedov ( urs )\" in silver and \"jerzy greszkiewicz ( pol )\" in bronze.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the claim has a typo? Because according to the table, in 1983, Yuri Kadenatsy isn't listed as winning silver. Instead, Nikolai Dedov is the silver medalist that year.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misread anything. The row for 1983 shows:\n\n<td>1983</td>\n<td>edmonton</td>\n<td>sergei savostianov ( urs )</td>\n<td>nikolai dedov ( urs )</td>\n<td>jerzy greszkiewicz ( pol )</td>\n\nSo, gold is Sergei Savostianov, silver is Nikolai Dedov, and bronze is Yerzy Greszkiewicz. No Yuri Kadenatsy here.\n\nWait, maybe the claim confused the year? Let me check other years around 1983 to ensure I'm not missing it elsewhere. For example, in 1982, the silver is Yuri Kadenatsy (urs), but that's a different year. So for 1983 specifically, he isn't listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the data doesn't support it. There's no entry for Yuri Kadenatsy winning silver in 1983; instead, Nikolai Dedov won silver that year.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would be the row for 1983 and the silver column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
