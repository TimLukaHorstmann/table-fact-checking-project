Let me break down the claim and analyze each part.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are round, name, position, school, and signed. Each row represents a different individual with their details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the university of michigan have , yes list as signed.\" So I need to find if there's an entry where the school is the University of Michigan and the signed column is 'yes'.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: School is Miami-Dade College, not Michigan.\n- Row 2: School is University of Michigan. Let me check the 'signed' column here. It says 'yes'.\n- Rows 3,4,5: Schools are Trinity University, Gulf Coast Community College, and University of Southern California\u2014none are Michigan.\n\nSo in row 2, the school is University of Michigan and signed is yes. That matches part of the claim. However, the claim also includes a comma before 'yes list as signed.' I'm not sure if that's just a typo or if it's implying something else, like there being a list with 'yes' for Michigan.\n\nBut based on the table alone, row 2 directly supports the part about University of Michigan having 'yes' in the signed column. So the claim is partially true, but maybe the user meant to say that the University of Michigan has a 'signed' status of 'yes,' which it does.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if there's an entry where \"University of Michigan\" is the school and \"signed\" is \"yes\". From the table:\n\n- Row 2: School is University of Michigan, signed is yes.\n\nThis directly supports the claim. Therefore, the answer is TRUE with the relevant cell being row 2 under 'signed'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find out which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the university of southern california have no twin - 1967 list under the signed category.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The table has columns: round, name, position, school, signed. There are five rows, each representing a different person.\n\nThe claim mentions \"university of southern california\" and \"signed category\". So I should find the row where the school is the University of Southern California. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: School is Miami-Dade College\n- Row 2: University of Michigan\n- Row 3: Trinity University\n- Row 4: Gulf Coast Community College\n- Row 5: University of Southern California\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 5.\n\nNext, I need to check the \"signed\" column for this row. According to the table, row 5 has \"no twins - 1967\" in the signed cell. \n\nThe claim says that under the signed category, USC has \"no twin - 1967 list\". So it's checking if the value is present as stated.\n\nWait, but in the table, it's exactly that: \"no twins - 1967\". The claim uses \"have no twin - 1967 list\", which matches the table's wording. So the statement seems to be correct.\n\nBut I need to check each condition. The claim is about having a specific entry under the signed category for USC. Since row 5, column 'signed' has that exact string, it supports the claim.\n\nHowever, let me make sure there are no other relevant cells. The columns are round, name, position, school, signed. For the claim, only the school and the signed column matter here.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be row 5 (index 4 in zero-based or 5 in one-based) and column 'signed'.\n\nWait, the instructions mention row_index as an integer. In the example, they used 0 and 1, which suggests that it's zero-based indexing. So row 5 is index 4.\n\nBut looking back at the table, each row has a 'round' number starting from 1. So in the HTML, the first row is round=1, so the indexes would be 0 to 4 for rows 1-5. Therefore, row 5 corresponds to row_index 4.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row_index 4 and column_name 'signed'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if the University of Southern California has an entry in the 'signed' category that states \"no twin - 1967 list\". According to the table, this is indeed present in row 5. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"the university of southern california show a 5 for it's highest round.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing at first glance. Let me break it down.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a person with details like their round number, name, position, school, and whether they signed. The last few rows are for the University of Southern California (USC). Specifically, row 5 is John Herbst from USC, but his 'signed' status isn't just \"no\" \u2013 it's \"no twins - 1967.\" That seems unusual compared to others.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"highest round.\" The table has a column called 'round', which probably refers to the player's draft round. For example, row 1 is round 1 for Bob Stevenson, and so on. Now, the University of Southern California (USC) players in the table are Richard Schryer (row 2) in round 2, James Carter (row 3) in round 3, John Green (row 4) in round 4, and John Herbst (row 5) in round 5.\n\nSo, for USC, their highest round is 5. The claim says they show a 5 for their highest round, which seems correct because row 5 has the highest 'round' value of 5. \n\nBut wait, the 'signed' column for John Herbst isn't just \"no\"; it's \"no twins - 1967.\" That might be a typo or specific note, but it doesn't affect the 'round' value.\n\nSo, focusing on the 'round' column, USC does have a player in round 5. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE. \n\nNow, for relevant cells: I need to find which rows and columns are relevant. The key is the 'round' column for each row where the school is USC. So rows 2 (Richard Schryer), 3 (James Carter), 4 (John Green), and 5 (John Herbst) have their respective round numbers, but only John Herbst is from USC.\n\nWait, no: looking back, row 2 is University of Michigan, row 3 is Trinity University, row 4 is Gulf Coast Community College, and row 5 is USC. So only row 5 is USC. Therefore, the relevant cells are the 'round' column for row 5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the University of Southern California has a player with the highest round number of 5. Checking the table, row 5 corresponds to John Herbst from USC in round 5, confirming this. The relevant cell is the 'round' value for this row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the university of michigan sign yes when richard schryer be in position of\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: round, name, position, school, and signed. Each row represents a different person.\n\nThe claim mentions the University of Michigan signing \"yes\" when Richard Schryer is in a certain position. So I need to find Richard Schryer in the table and check his details.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that row 2 has the name \"richard schryer\". His school is listed as the University of Michigan. That's relevant because the claim mentions the University of Michigan. \n\nNext, the position column for him says \"of\", which might be a placeholder or abbreviation. The signed column shows \"yes\". So Richard Schryer from the University of Michigan does have a 'signed' status of yes.\n\nNow, the claim is about whether the university signs \"yes\" when he's in a position. I think the key points are that Richard is associated with the University of Michigan and his signed status is yes.\n\nI also need to check other possible relevant cells. The round number for Richard Schryer is 2, but I don't see how that affects the claim directly. His name is in row 2, column 1 (name), school is row 2, column 3, and signed is row 2, column 4.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 2, name; row 2, school; and row 2, signed. Wait, but the claim specifically mentions the University of Michigan and Richard Schryer's position leading to a 'yes' sign. So I should include all these columns related to that row because they directly support the claim.\n\nWait, maybe not. The claim is about whether the university signs yes when he is in position. So perhaps only the signed cell is relevant. But the name and school also tie his identity to the University of Michigan.\n\nI think the relevant cells are: row 2 (since that's Richard Schryer), column name, school, and signed. Because these columns together show that Richard is at the University of Michigan and his signed status is yes, supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the highest a player from the university of southern california be draft be in the fifth round.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's talking about the highest (which probably means the best) player from USC and their draft position, specifically that this player was drafted in the fifth round.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows with data on different players. Each row has details like round, name, position, school, and whether they were signed.\n\nI need to find if any player from USC is drafted in the fifth round. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Bob Stevenson? Wait, no, looking at the table, it's bob stinson, but let me check the details. His position is 'c' and school is miami - dade college. So not from USC.\n\n2. Row 1: Richard Schryer. Position is 'of', school is university of michigan. Not USC either.\n\n3. Row 2: James Carter. Position is '3b', school is trinity university. Not USC.\n\n4. Row 3: John Green. School is gulf coast community college. Not USC.\n\n5. Row 4: John Herbst. His position is 'lhp' and school is university of southern california (USC). Ah, here we go.\n\nNow, looking at the \"signed\" column for this player. It says \"no twins - 1967.\" Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. I think it's indicating he wasn't signed as a twin, or perhaps it's a typo. But regardless of whether he was signed, the main point is his draft round.\n\nIn the row, the 'round' is listed as 5. So his draft position is fifth round. \n\nThe claim states that \"the highest a player from USC be drafted in the fifth round.\" Since John Herbst is a player from USC and he was drafted in the fifth round, this supports the claim. But wait, does \"highest\" mean the highest-ranked or the best? If it's about the best player, we need to see if any higher rounds have a player from USC.\n\nLooking at all players from USC in the table, only John Herbst is present and he's in the fifth round. So there are no players from USC drafted earlier than the fifth round in this table. Therefore, his draft position is indeed the highest for USC in the fifth round.\n\nI should also check if any other columns are relevant. The \"signed\" column mentions 'no twins - 1967' which might indicate something about his status or circumstances, but since the claim is about the draft round and not about whether he was signed or not, this column isn't directly relevant here.\n\nSo, the key cells to check would be row 4 (since it's the fifth row in the table, index starts at 0, so row_index=4) for 'round' and 'school'. Also, since we need to confirm the player is from USC, the 'school' column is important. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 4, column 'round' (value 5)\n- Row 4, column 'school' (USC)\n\nThat's two columns: round and school in row 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"no twin - 1966 be sign by the university of southern california.\" Hmm, that seems a bit off. I think there might be a typo in \"be sign,\" probably meant to say \"signed\" or \"signing.\" Also, the phrase \"no twin\" is interesting. So, the claim is about someone named \"no twin\" from 1966 being signed by USC.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's an HTML table with several columns: round, name, position, school, and signed. The rows are numbered starting from 1 to 5.\n\nI need to check each row to see if any match the claim. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Name is \"bob stinson,\" school is \"miami - dade college.\" Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 2**: Name is \"richard schryer,\" school is \"university of michigan.\" No match.\n3. **Row 3**: Name is \"james carter,\" school is \"trinity university.\" Not a match.\n4. **Row 4**: Name is \"john green,\" school is \"gulf coast community college,\" and signed is \"no.\" Doesn't fit.\n5. **Row 5**: Name is \"john herbst,\" school is \"university of southern california,\" and signed is \"no twins - 1967.\" This seems close, but the claim mentions \"no twin - 1966,\" not 1967.\n\nWait a minute, the fifth row has a signed status that includes \"no twins - 1967.\" The claim refers to 1966. So, it's off by a year. Also, the name in the table is \"john herbst,\" but the claim doesn't specify a name\u2014just mentions \"no twin.\"\n\nSo, let me think about this. The claim says someone named \"no twin\" from 1966 was signed by USC. Looking at the table, there's no such entry. The closest is row 5, which refers to 1967, not 1966, and it's john herbst, not \"no twin.\" \n\nAlso, in the table, the column for 'signed' doesn't have a cell that exactly matches the claim. The fifth row has \"no twins - 1967,\" but the year is off by one year from what's claimed.\n\nTherefore, there's no matching entry in the table that supports the claim. So, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are those where the name or school might have something to do with it, but actually, none of them match perfectly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we checked each row for a match involving \"no twin\" from 1966 signed by USC. None matched exactly; the closest was in 1967 and involved a different name.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"signed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the university of southern california be sign with no twin - 1967\". Hmm, that seems a bit off in terms of grammar and structure. Maybe it should be \"the University of Southern California be signed with no twins - 1967\" or something like that. But I'll proceed as is.\n\nThe table has several columns: round, name, position, school, and signed. The rows are numbered from 1 to 5. Let's go through each row to see if any match the claim.\n\nLooking at the \"school\" column, we have:\n\n1. Miami - Dade College\n2. University of Michigan\n3. Trinity University\n4. Gulf Coast Community College\n5. University of Southern California\n\nSo, in row 5, the school is indeed the University of Southern California. That's relevant because the claim mentions this school.\n\nNext, let's check if there's a \"signed\" status for this particular row that matches the claim. In row 5, the signed column has \"no twins - 1967\". Wait, the claim says \"no twin - 1967\", without the extra text about 'twins'. Is \"no twins - 1967\" equivalent to just \"no twin\"? Maybe not exactly, but perhaps it's a typo or shorthand.\n\nAlso, the term \"be sign\" in the claim seems like a typo. It should probably be \"signed\". So, considering that, we can see if row 5 has a signed status that includes \"no twins - 1967\".\n\nIn row 5, the signed cell says \"no twins - 1967\", which matches the year mentioned in the claim (1967). But does it match exactly what the claim is stating? The claim says \"no twin - 1967\". There's a slight difference in wording: one says \"no twins\" and the other says \"no twin\". Is that significant?\n\nWell, in the table, it's \"no twins - 1967\", so plural. The claim uses singular, which is \"no twin\". So there's a discrepancy in the number of words. That might make them not exactly match.\n\nHowever, sometimes people might abbreviate or use shorthand, so maybe \"no twins\" implies \"no twin\", but it's not exact. I'm not sure if that's considered a full match.\n\nSo, checking the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 5 (index 4 in zero-based, but according to the table, rows are numbered starting from 1)\nWait, actually, looking back, the first row is round 1, which is index 0 or 1? In the JSON example given, the relevant_cells use \"row_index\" as an integer. So for the first row in the HTML, it's round=1, so row_index should be 0 if we're zero-based.\n\nWait no, looking at the table:\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr> ... </tr> (5 times)\n</tbody>\n\nSo in the HTML, each <tr> is a row. The first <tr> has round=1, so that's row index 0 if we count from zero.\n\nBut in the JSON example provided, it shows {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}, which suggests that the first row (HTML <tr> first occurrence) is row_index 0.\n\nSo for the claim, University of Southern California is in row 5 (round=5), which would be row index 4 if zero-based. Wait, no, because the HTML has five <tr> elements, each corresponding to a round from 1 to 5. So the first <tr> is round=1, row index 0; second is round=2, row index 1; and so on up to round=5 as row index 4.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON output, the relevant_cells would be for round 5, which is row_index 4.\n\nSo, the school is \"University of Southern California\" in row 4 (row_index 4) under column \"school\".\n\nAnd the signed cell in that row is \"no twins - 1967\". The claim says \"no twin - 1967\", so the wording doesn't exactly match. But perhaps the key part is the year and the negative sign.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index 4 (since round=5), column_name: school\n- row_index 4, column_name: signed\n\nTherefore, even though there's a slight difference in wording, the claim mentions both the school and the signed status, so it might be considered TRUE if we overlook the plural/singular discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the exact wording is needed.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check each condition against the table. So, let me parse the claim again: \"the university of southern california be sign with no twin - 1967\". It seems like it's stating that USC was signed with a certain status in 1967.\n\nIn row 5 (row index 4), the school is USC and signed is \"no twins - 1967\". So, assuming that the claim is referring to this row, then it would be TRUE. The discrepancy in 'twin' vs 'twins' might not matter because they're both indicating a negative status.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being school and signed for row 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"signed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at row 5, under 'signed', it's listed as \"no twins - 1967.\" That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data in the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"signed\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the university of michigan sign bob stinson\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two things: \"the university of michigan\" and \"sign bob stinson.\" From context, it seems like the claim is suggesting that Bob Stinson has signed with the University of Michigan. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different person with details like their round number, name, position, school, and whether they've been signed. The relevant columns here are \"name,\" \"school,\" and \"signed.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Bob Stevenson (wait, no\u2014wait, the first row is Bob Stinson. Let me double-check:\n   - Round 1: Name is Bob Stinson.\n   - School: Miami-Dade College.\n   - Signed: Yes.\n\nSo, Bob Stinson is listed as having signed with Miami-Dade College. \n\n2. **Row 1**: Richard Schryer\n   - School: University of Michigan.\n   - Position: Of.\n   - Signed: Yes.\n\nBut the claim is about Bob Stinson signing with the University of Michigan. In Row 0, Bob's school is Miami-Dade, not Michigan. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because according to the table, Bob hasn't signed with the University of Michigan\u2014he went to Miami-Dade instead.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misread anything. Maybe I should check if any other rows mention the University of Michigan in the \"school\" column. Looking at Row 1, Richard Schryer is from there, and he's signed as well. But the claim is about Bob Stinson, not Richard.\n\nSo, in the table, Bob Stinson is indeed listed, but his school isn't the University of Michigan\u2014it's Miami-Dade. Therefore, the claim that \"the university of michigan sign bob stinson\" is false because according to the table, Bob signed with a different school.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: Since the claim involves two entities\u2014the University of Michigan and Bob Stinson\u2014we need to check both their respective rows.\n\nFor the University of Michigan, we look at Richard Schryer (Row 1), so his row index is 1, and the columns are \"name,\" \"position,\" \"school,\" and \"signed.\" But since the claim is about signing, the relevant column here would be \"signed.\"\n\nFor Bob Stinson, he's in Row 0. The relevant columns again would be \"name,\" \"school,\" and \"signed\" to verify his details.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Richard Schryer (Row 1): \"signed\" is Yes.\n- Bob Stinson (Row 0): His school is Miami-Dade, not Michigan, so that contradicts the claim. Therefore, the cell for his signed status would also be considered since he did sign, but his school doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should only focus on cells that directly relate to the claim's components. The claim is about Bob Stinson signing with the University of Michigan. So, looking at Bob's row, \"school\" is Miami-Dade, so it doesn't align. Therefore, even though he signed (so \"signed\" column says Yes), his school isn't Michigan.\n\nSo, to confirm the claim, both Bob Stinson should have his school as the University of Michigan and be marked as signed. Since this isn't the case, the claim is false.\n\nIn terms of relevant cells, we need to check:\n- For the University of Michigan: Check if any player is from there and whether they are signed.\n- For Bob Stinson: Check his school and whether he's signed.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be:\n- Row 0 (Bob Stinson): \"name,\" \"school,\" \"signed.\"\n- Row 1 (Richard Schryer): Since he's from Michigan but not the one in the claim, maybe only check if any player is from Michigan? Or perhaps just the first part.\n\nWait, no. The claim is specifically about Bob Stinson and Michigan. So, the relevant cells are:\n- Bob Stinson: his row (Row 0) for school and signed.\n- Richard Schryer: as a player from Michigan, but since he's not in the claim, perhaps only checking if any players from Michigan exist, which they do, so that might support the existence of the university, but not directly the claim about Bob.\n\nBut actually, the claim is about the University of Michigan signing Bob Stinson. So, to check this:\n1. Is there a row for Bob Stinson? Yes (Row 0).\n2. Does his school match University of Michigan? No.\n3. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are Row 0's \"school\" and \"signed,\" because those don't match the claim. Also, to check if the University of Michigan exists in the table as a school: yes, it does (Row 1), but that's for Richard Schryer, not Bob.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0 (Bob Stinson) columns: name, school, signed.\n- Additionally, check if there's a row where \"school\" is University of Michigan and whether they are signed. Since such a row exists (Row 1), but it's not Bob, that doesn't directly support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because Bob Stinson isn't signed by the University of Michigan.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bob Stinson signed with the University of Michigan. However, according to the table, Bob Stinson is listed as attending Miami-Dade College and has indeed signed. The University of Michigan is represented by Richard Schryer in Row 1, who is also signed. Since the claim incorrectly associates Bob Stinson with the University of Michigan, it is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are those in Row 0 (Bob Stinson's details) and Row 1 (Richard Schryer's school), as they provide the necessary information to verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"signed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the university of southern california play a round lower than 5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me carefully analyze each part.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to be about USC playing in rounds lower than 5. Looking at the table, it's a bit unclear what \"round\" refers to here. In sports contexts, rounds can mean different things, but based on the column name \"round\" and the data, it might relate to something like round numbers or specific instances.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a person with details: round number, name, position, school, and whether they were signed. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"round\" and maybe \"signed,\" but I need to focus on what the claim is specifically about.\n\nThe claim mentions USC, so I should look at the rows where the school is \"university of southern california.\" From the table, there's only one such row: row 5. In that row, the round number is 5 and their status is \"no twins - 1967.\"\n\nWait, the claim says \"play a round lower than 5,\" so it's about playing in rounds less than 5. But the round number for USC is exactly 5. So, if the claim is that they play a round lower than 5, then having a round of 5 would mean the claim is false because 5 is not lower than 5.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are other entries for USC in the table. From what's given, only row 5 mentions USC, so that's the only relevant data point.\n\nTherefore, since their round is 5 and not lower, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
