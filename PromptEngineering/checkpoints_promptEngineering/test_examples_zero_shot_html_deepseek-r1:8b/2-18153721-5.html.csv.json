    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 2 player tie for the lead at 1 under par\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a two-way tie for the lead at 1 under par. So I need to check if there are exactly two players who have the same score of 1 under par. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player's performance. The relevant columns here are \"score\" and \"to par\". The \"score\" column shows the total score as the sum of two numbers, like 68 + 71 = 139. The \"to par\" column indicates whether the player is under, at, or above par. \n\nPar is typically defined as a score that matches the course's par, which is usually calculated by adding the par of each hole. If a player scores exactly par, they are considered to be on par. A score lower than par means they're under par, and higher means over.\n\nSo, \"1 under par\" would mean their total score is one less than the par. To find this, I need to look at the \"to par\" column. If a player has \"- 1\", that indicates they are one under par because subtracting 1 from the total score would mean they're under by one stroke.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row and check for players with \"- 1\" in the \"to par\" column and see if exactly two of them have this value.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Row 0: David Graham, Australia, 68 +71=139, to par -1 \u2192 This is one player under by 1.\n- Row 1: Sandy Lyle, Scotland, same score and to par as David. So that's two players with \"-1\".\n\nNext rows:\n- Rows 2,3,4: They have \"e\" in to par, which probably stands for even (on par). So no under par here.\n- Rows 5-10: These are all t6 groups. Each of these players has \"+1\" in to par, meaning they're one over par.\n\nSo, only the first two rows (David Graham and Sandy Lyle) have \"-1\", which is exactly two players tied at 1 under par.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are two players with the same score of 1 under par.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the HTML table provided. The table has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. My focus is on the 'player' column and their respective countries, particularly for the United States.\n\nThe claim states that there's only one player from the United States in the leaderboard. So I need to check how many players have \"united states\" as their country.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Player is David Graham, Country: Australia.\n2. Row 1: Sandy Lyle, Scotland.\n3. Row 2: Tony Johnstone, Zimbabwe.\n4. Row 3: Christy O'Connor Jnr, Ireland.\n5. Row 4: D A Weibring, United States. \u2013 This is one from the US.\n6. Row 5: Howard Clark, England.\n7.

The claim says, \"there be a total of 7 players who be currently tie for 6th.\" Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The claim is about players tying for 6th place, so I'm interested in the \"place\" column, which indicates their standings.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Rows with t1: David Graham and Sandy Lyle are tied at some place, but since they have lower scores (139), they're probably not in the top 6.\n2. Rows with t3: Tony Johnstone, Christy O'Connor Jnr, and D A Weibring all have a score of 140, so they must be tied. Let me check their places. All are t3, which stands for tied for third? Wait, no, actually, the place column shows their positions. So t3 means tied for third, right? So each of these players is tied for third.\n3. Rows with t6: There are multiple players here\u2014Howard Clark, Bernhard Langer, Robert Lee, Wayne Riley, Emilio Rodr\u00edguez, and Peter Senior, Ian Woosnam. Wait, that's six or seven players? Let me count:\n   - Howard Clark\n   - Bernhard Langer\n   - Robert Lee\n   - Wayne Riley\n   - Emilio Rodr\u00edguez\n   - Peter Senior\n   - Ian Woosnam\n\nThat makes seven players tied for sixth place because each is marked as t6. So that's the relevant information.\n\nNow, checking the claim: it says \"7 players who are currently tie for 6th.\" From the table, yes, there are seven players in the t6 group. Each of these players has a score of 141 and a to par of +1, indicating they all tied at sixth place.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly seven players are indeed tied for sixth.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"there be 3 player tie at 3rd at even to par\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions three players tied at the third position with a score that is even (to par). So I need to check if there are exactly three players who are tied for 3rd place and have scores that are exactly equal to an even number (i.e., their total score is even).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player's performance. The columns we're interested in are \"place\", \"player\", \"country\", \"score\", and \"to par\". \n\nI'll start by identifying all players who are in 3rd place. Scanning through the \"place\" column, I see that several rows have \"t3\". Let me list them:\n\n- Row 2: t3, player is Tony Johnstone\n- Row 3: t3, player is Christy O'Connor Jnr\n- Row 4: t3, player is D A Weibring\n\nSo there are three players in the 3rd place category. That's a good start because the claim mentions \"3 player tie at 3rd\".\n\nNext, I need to check their scores to see if they're even (to par). The \"score\" column shows the total points for each player. Let me parse each score:\n\n- Tony Johnstone: 68 + 72 = 140\n- Christy O'Connor Jnr: 64 + 76 = 140\n- D A Weibring: 69 + 71 = 140\n\nAll three players have a total of 140 points. Now, is 140 an even number? Well, yes, because it's divisible by 2 without any remainder (140 \u00f7 2 = 70). Therefore, their scores are even to par.\n\nPutting this together, there are exactly three players tied at 3rd place with even (to par) scores.

The data in each row represents different golfers with their respective scores.\n\nThe claim mentions \"players from the united state.\" So my task is to find out how many players are from the United States in the leaderboard.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and check the 'country' column for each player. \n\n1.

However, the claim specifically mentions \"United States,\" so unless there's another player I missed, it seems only one player from the US is present.\n\nBut wait, in the table provided by the user, I see that D A Weibring is the only one from the United States. Let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't miss any others.\n\nRow 4: D A Weibring - United States\nRows 5-11 don't mention any other players from the US.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"there be 2 player tie for the lead , with a score 2 under par.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two players tied at the lead and their score is two under par. So I need to look into the 'score' and 'to par' columns in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'score' column, each entry shows a number like 68 +71=139 or similar. The 'to par' column has values like -1, e, +1. I think 'e' probably stands for even, which is equivalent to 0 under par. So scores with 'to par' of -1 are one under par, 'e' is 0, and '+1' is one over par.\n\nNow, the claim specifies a score of two under par. That would mean the 'score' should be something like x + y = (total) which results in a 'to par' of -2. But looking at the table, I don't see any entries where 'to par' is -2. The lowest I see is -1 and e (0), so no one has two under par.\n\nAlso, checking the players, none have a score that's two under. For example, t6 players have 141, which is +1, and others like t3 have 140 with 'e' which is 0. So there's no player with a score that's two under par.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any two players are tied for the lead. The highest scores are 139, 140, and 141. Looking at 139, both David Graham and Sandy Lyle have that score, but their 'to par' is -1, which isn't two under. Then there's t3 with 140 (e) and t6 with 141 (+1). So no two players are tied at the same high score. Wait, actually, for t6, multiple players have 141, so they're all tied in that group, but none of them are two under par.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding 'to par'. If 'e' is even, which is 0, then someone with a score like 140 would be 2 over par if their total was 142? Wait no, the way it's written is like \"68 +71=139\", so that's the total. The 'to par' column shows -1, e, +1. So if the score is 138 and to par is -2, but there's no such entry.\n\nSo, in the table, no players have a 'to par' of -2 or any equivalent. Also, no two players are tied for the lead with the same highest score that would make their 'score' two under par. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided HTML table because there are no players with a 'to par' of -2 (two under par), and no two players are tied at the lead with such scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, I need to check if there are six players tied for the 6th position.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The places mentioned in the 'place' column are t1, t3, t6, etc. So, the highest positions seem to be single or grouped as per their letters (like t1 for first place, t3 for third, etc.), but I'm specifically looking for the 6th position.\n\nWait, actually, some rows have 't6' in the place column. For example:\n\n- <tr><td>t6</td>... So, all players with 't6' are tied or grouped at the 6th position. Now, how many players are under t6?\n\nLooking through the table, starting from row 5 (assuming rows start at 0):\n\nWait, no, actually, let me list out all the rows and their places:\n\n1. t1 - David Graham\n2. t1 - Sandy Lyle\n3. t3 - Tony Johnstone\n4. t3 - Christy O'Connor Jnr\n5. t3 - D A Weibring\n6. t6 - Howard Clark\n7. t6 - Bernhard Langer\n8. t6 - Robert Lee\n9. t6 - Wayne Riley\n10. t6 - Emilio Rodr\u00edguez\n11. t6 - Peter Senior\n12. t6 - Ian Woosnam\n\nSo, the rows with 't6' are from row 5 to row 11 (if we index starting at 0). Wait no: the first row is 0: t1, then 1: t1, 2: t3, 3: t3, 4: t3, 5: t6, and so on up to row 12. So rows 5 through 11 (that's 7 players) have 't6' in the place column.\n\nWait, no: the first row is index 0: t1, then 1: t1, 2: t3, 3: t3, 4: t3, 5: t6, 6: t6, 7: t6, 8: t6, 9: t6, 10: t6, 11: t6, 12: t6? Wait no, the table has 13 rows in total. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the tbody section:\n\nThere are 13 <tr> elements, so row indices from 0 to 12.\n\nSo, rows with 't6' are starting from row 5 (index 5) up to row 12 (index 12). Wait no: looking back:\n\nWait the rows for t3 are at indices 2,3,4. Then t6 starts at index 5? Let me recount the rows:\n\n1. t1 - index 0\n2. t1 - index1\n3. t3 - index2\n4. t3 - index3\n5. t3 - index4\n6. t6 - index5\n7. t6 - index6\n8. t6 - index7\n9. t6 - index8\n10. t6 - index9\n11. t6 - index10\n12. t6 - index11\n13. t6 - index12\n\nWait, no, the table has 13 rows in tbody, so indices 0 to 12.\n\nSo rows 5 through 12 have 't6' in the place column? Wait, that's not right because after row4 (index4: t3), row5 is t6. So from index5 to index12, that's 8 rows. Wait, but looking at the table:\n\n- The first group is t1, then t1 again, so same place? Or are they separate players tied for first? Similarly, t3 has three players, and t6 has multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all rows with their 'place' value:\n\nRow 0: t1\nRow1: t1\nRow2: t3\nRow3: t3\nRow4: t3\nRow5: t6\nRow6: t6\nRow7: t6\nRow8: t6\nRow9: t6\nRow10: t6\nRow11: t6\nRow12: t6\n\nWait, that's 13 rows. So from row5 to row12 is 8 players with 't6' in place.\n\nSo the number of players tied for 6th place is 8? Or are they multiple groups?\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nIt seems like all players under 't6' are tied, but perhaps there's a specific group. Wait, no, each row is an individual player with their own place designation. So in this table, all players with 't6' as their place are considered to be in 6th position.\n\nBut the claim is about a 6-way tie for 6th place. That would require exactly six players sharing the same place of 6th. But here, from row5 to row12 (assuming each t6 is a separate entity), that's eight players, which would mean an 8-way tie, not 6.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe some places are tied within their group, but the main point is whether there's a 6-way tie at position six.\n\nLooking back: the rows for t3 (rows2-4) have three players, so that's a three-way tie for third place. Then, t6 (rows5-12) have eight players? Or perhaps each 't' indicates a group; maybe t1 is one player, t3 is three, and t6 is six.\n\nWait, but in the table:\n\nRow0: t1 - David Graham\nRow1: t1 - Sandy Lyle\n\nSo two players tied for first place. Then row2: t3 - Tony Johnstone\nrow3: t3 - Christy O'Connor Jnr\nrow4: t3 - D A Weibring\n\nThat's three players tied for third place.\n\nThen from row5 onwards, it's t6:\n\nRow5: t6 - Howard Clark\nrow6: t6 - Bernhard Langer\nrow7: t6 - Robert Lee\nrow8: t6 - Wayne Riley\nrow9: t6 - Emilio Rodr\u00edguez\nrow10: t6 - Peter Senior\nrow11: t6 - Ian Woosnam\n\nWait, that's seven players with 't6' as their place. But row5 to row12 is 8 rows. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nRow0: t1\nrow1: t1\nrow2: t3\nrow3: t3\nrow4: t3\nrow5: t6\nrow6: t6\nrow7: t6\nrow8: t6\nrow9: t6\nrow10: t6\nrow11: t6\nrow12: t6\n\nSo from row5 to row12, that's 8 players with 't6' as their place. So eight players in sixth place.\n\nBut the claim is about a six-way tie. So does having eight players tied for sixth count as a six-way? No, it would be an eight-way tie, not six. So perhaps the statement is incorrect because there are more than six, or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe each 't' denotes a group, so t1 is one player (two players?), t3 is three, and t6 is six. But in that case, it would be a 6-way tie at sixth place with six players, but from the table, I see more than six.\n\nWait no, perhaps the 'place' designations are like: t1 is first place, then t2 is second, etc., but they didn't include t2 in this table. So maybe t3 and t6 are next.\n\nBut according to the data, t1 is two players (David Graham and Sandy Lyle), so tied for first. Then t3 has three players, so that's third place, all tied. Then t6 starts at row5, but how many players have 't6'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through each row beyond row4: from row5 to row12, the 'place' is t6. So that's 8 players with 't6'. Wait, no, maybe I miscounted because it seems like only seven or eight.\n\nWait let me list them out:\n\n1. t1 - David Graham\n2. t1 - Sandy Lyle\n3. t3 - Tony Johnstone\n4. t3 - Christy O'Connor Jnr\n5. t3 - D A Weibring\n6. t6 - Howard Clark\n7. t6 - Bernhard Langer\n8. t6 - Robert Lee\n9. t6 - Wayne Riley\n10. t6 - Emilio Rodr\u00edguez\n11. t6 - Peter Senior\n12. t6 - Ian Woosnam\n\nWait, that's 12 rows? No, the table has 13 rows in total: from row0 to row12.\n\nSo, the 't6' starts at row5 and goes up to row12, which is 8 players. So eight players tied for sixth place. Therefore, it's an eight-way tie, not a six-way.\n\nBut the claim was about a six-way tie, so that would be incorrect because there are more than six in the tie. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting how many 't6' players there are.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps each 't' group is determined by their performance relative to others, and t6 might not necessarily mean sixth place but a grouping within the same position. But it's more likely that each 'tX' represents a specific place, so t1 is first, t2 second, etc., with t3 as third, t6 as sixth.\n\nSo if two players have t1, then three have t3, and then starting from row5, how many are there? Let me see:\n\nFrom the table provided, the 'place' field for each player is as follows:\n\n1. David Graham - t1\n2. Sandy Lyle - t1\n3. Tony Johnstone - t3\n4. Christy O'Connor Jnr - t3\n5. D A Weiring - t3\n6. Howard Clark - t6\n7. Bernhard Langer - t6\n8. Robert Lee - t6\n9. Wayne Riley - t6\n10. Emilio Rodr\u00edguez - t6\n11. Peter Senior - t6\n12. Ian Woosnam - t6\n\nWait, that's only 12 players listed, but earlier I thought it was 13 rows. Let me double-check the initial data:\n\nIt starts with David Graham (row0) up to Ian Woosnam (row12), which is 13 players in total.\n\nSo for 't6', starting from row5 to row12, that's eight players: Howard Clark (5), Bernhard Langer (6), Robert Lee (7), Wayne Riley (8), Emilio Rodr\u00edguez (9), Peter Senior (10), and Ian Woosnam (11). Wait, no, row5 is player 6? Wait, numbering is from 0 to 12, so that's 13 players.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many 't6' entries there are:\n\nLooking at the list of players and their place field:\n\nPlayer 1: David Graham - t1\nPlayer2: Sandy Lyle - t1\nPlayer3: Tony Johnstone - t3\nPlayer4: Christy O'Connor Jnr - t3\nPlayer5: D A Weiring - t3\nPlayer6: Howard Clark - t6\nPlayer7: Bernhard Langer - t6\nPlayer8: Robert Lee - t6\nPlayer9: Wayne Riley - t6\nPlayer10: Emilio Rodr\u00edguez - t6\nPlayer11: Peter Senior - t6\nPlayer12: Ian Woosnam - t6\n\nWait, that's only 12 players listed, which suggests maybe an error. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the initial problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting, but if we have from row5 (Howard Clark) up to row12 (Ian Woosnam), that's 8 players with 't6' as their place. So eight players tied for sixth place, which would be an eight-way tie.\n\nTherefore, the claim of a six-way tie is incorrect because there are actually eight players sharing the same position.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the 'place' field. Maybe 't3' refers to third place and 't6' as sixth, but if two players have t1 (first), three have t3 (third), and then six have t6 (sixth). That would make sense for a leaderboard with groups of positions.\n\nIn that case, the top two are tied for first, next three for third, and then six tied for sixth. But in this table, from row5 to row12, there are only seven players: starting at row5 (player6) up to row11 (player12), which is 7 players, plus row12 might be a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is whether the number of players tied for sixth place is six or more.\n\nIf from row5 to row12, that's eight players with 't6' as their place, then it's an eight-way tie, not six. Therefore, the statement about a six-way tie would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intends 't6' to mean tied at sixth place, but if there are more than six players, it's not a six-way tie.\n\nSo, in conclusion, based on the data provided, there are eight players tied for sixth place, which is an eight-way tie, not a six-way. Therefore, the statement that it's a six-way tie would be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim of a six-way tie for sixth place is incorrect because the analysis reveals an eight-way tie among eight players who share that position.\n\n**Answer:** The assertion of a six-way tie is incorrect; there is an eight-way tie in sixth place.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 3 player tie at 2nd place be even to par\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a three-way tie at second place and that their scores are even to par. So I need to check if there are any players tied in 2nd place with even to par scores.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a player, including their placement (like t1, t3, t6), country, score, and to par status. The \"place\" column indicates their position, such as t1 for first place, t3 for third, and so on.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to the 2nd place tie. But in the table, I see that most players are placed under t1 or t3 or t6. Wait, let me check each row:\n\n- The first two rows have \"t1\" as their place, meaning they're tied for first.\n- Then there's a group with \"t3\", so three players are tied at third place.\n- There's another group with \"t6\", six players tied at sixth place.\n\nI don't see any row where the place is \"t2\". So perhaps in the table provided, there isn't a group of three players tied at second place. That would mean that the claim about them being even to par might not be applicable here because such a group doesn't exist in the data.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each row for the \"place\" column:\n\n1. t1: David Graham\n2. t1: Sandy Lyle\n3. t3: Tony Johnstone\n4. t3: Christy O'Connor Jnr\n5. t3: D A Weibring\n6. t6: Howard Clark\n7. t6: Bernhard Langer\n8. t6: Robert Lee\n9. t6: Wayne Riley\n10. t6: Emilio Rodr\u00edguez\n11. t6: Peter Senior\n12. t6: Ian Woosnam\n\nNo, I don't see any \"t2\" entries. So there's no group of three players tied at second place in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the 3 player tie at 2nd place be even to par\" is referencing a scenario not present in the provided data. Since there are no players tied for second place, the claim isn't supported by the information given.\n\nAdditionally, even if such a group existed, we would need their scores to determine if they're even to par. But since the table doesn't show any t2 group, this part is irrelevant here.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the answer should be FALSE because there's no relevant data supporting the claim in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
