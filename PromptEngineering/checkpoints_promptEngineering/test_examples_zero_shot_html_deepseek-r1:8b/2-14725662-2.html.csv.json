    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"the game against iowa take place at memorial stadium , minneapolis , mn.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table provided. It's an HTML table with headers: date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different game.\n\nI need to check if any game in the table meets all the conditions stated in the claim. The claim mentions three specific things: that it's a game against Iowa, that it takes place at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row of the table to see if there's a match.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Opponent is \"north dakota state.\" That's not Iowa, so no.\nSecond row: Opponent is \"ripon.\" Also not Iowa. Third row: opponent is \"oklahoma a&m\" \u2013 not Iowa either. Fourth row: \"stanford\" \u2013 nope. Fifth row: \"iowa\" \u2013 yes! This could be the game we're looking for.\n\nLooking at this fifth row, let's check all details:\n- Date: 10/24/1931\n- Opponent: iowa\n- Site: memorial stadium minneapolis , mn\nSo, two out of three conditions are met here. The site is correct as per the claim.\n\nWait, but the result column says \"w34 - 0\" and attendance is 25000. But the claim doesn't mention these details, only that the game took place at a specific stadium against Iowa.\n\nSince the opponent is iowa and the site is Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN, this row satisfies the claim's conditions.\n\nI should also check if there are other rows that might match, just to be thorough. Let's see:\n\nRow 6: Opponent is \"wisconsin\" \u2013 no.\nRow 7: \"northwestern\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 8: \"cornell (ia)\" \u2013 not Iowa as per the claim, maybe? Wait, it says Cornell (IA), which might mean Cornell of Iowa. Hmm, but the opponent in the fifth row is explicitly labeled as \"iowa,\" so that's likely a different team.\nRow 9: Michigan \u2013 nope.\nRow 10: Ohio State \u2013 not relevant.\n\nSo only the fifth row matches both the opponent and the site specified in the claim. Even though it doesn't mention anything about the result or attendance, those aren't part of the claim. The claim is solely about where the game was played against Iowa, which this row fulfills.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"TRUE,\" and the relevant cells are from that fifth row: row index 4 (since we start counting from 0), and the columns 'opponent' and 'site'.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for both the opponent being Iowa and the site being Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN. Only one row matches these conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a game is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the game against michigan take place at memorial stadium , minneapolis , mn.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into key parts. The main points are that the game was against Michigan, it took place at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. My goal is to find the relevant cells that can verify the claim. \n\nI need to check if there's a game where the opponent is Michigan and the site is Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is North Dakota State, Site is Memorial Stadium. Not Michigan.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is Ripon, same site. Not Michigan.\n3. Row 2: Opponent is Oklahoma A&M, different site (Stanford later). Not Michigan.\n4. Row 3: Opponent is Stanford, different site (Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto). Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: Opponent is Iowa, Memorial Stadium again. Not Michigan.\n6. Row 5: Opponent is Wisconsin, same site. Not Michigan.\n7. Row 6: Opponent is Northwestern, different site (Evanston). Not Michigan.\n8. Row 7: Opponent is Cornell (IA), same site. Not Michigan.\n9. Row 8: Opponent is Michigan. Now, looking at the site: Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, MI. So this isn't Minneapolis. Therefore, even though opponent is Michigan, the site doesn't match the claim.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So there is a game against Michigan, but it was played in Ann Arbor, not Minneapolis. The claim says it was at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, which isn't correct for any of the games listed.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Scanning through all the rows again:\n\n- Only row 8 has Michigan as the opponent.\n- Sites for each game: \n  - Most are Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis except row 3 (Stanford) and row 8 (Michigan Stadium).\nSo, no game against Michigan is at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. There's no such game in the table where Michigan played at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
