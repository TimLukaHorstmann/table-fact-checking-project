The name \"zang jialiang\" must appear as a value in the 'lead' column for the row corresponding to the \"2009 - 10\" season.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row where the season is \"2009 - 10\". From the provided data:\n\n- The first row after the header seems to be for \"2002 - 03\".\n- Next is \"2005 - 06\", then \"2007 - 08\", followed by \"2008 - 09\".\n- Finally, there's a row for \"2009 - 10\".\n\nIn that last row:\n- Season: 2009 - 10\n- The 'lead' column has the value \"zang jialiang\".\n\nSo, the claim matches this data point. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant.\n\nThe columns involved are 'season', 'lead'. Each of these corresponds to specific indices and column names in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"Zang Jialiang be the lead in the 2009 - 10 season,\" we look for the row corresponding to the 2009-10 season in the 'lead' column.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n1. The row index is 4 (since there are 5 data rows, starting from 0).\n2. The column name is \"lead\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lead\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in HTML format, and the claim is specific: \"the lead be zang jialiang and an alternate li dongyan at the 2008 wmcc.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"lead\" refers to the person leading in a particular event, and \"alternate\" refers to a substitute or replacement in case the main player can't perform. The event in question is the 2008 World Mathematical Chess Championship (WMCC).\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns that correspond to this claim. Let's break it down.\n\nThe table has headers: season, skip, third, second, lead, alternate, events. Each row represents a different season or event year.\n\nThe claim mentions \"2008 wmcc,\" so I should look for the row where events is \"2008 wmcc.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that this corresponds to the fourth row (row_index 3).\n\nIn this row, let's check each relevant column. The columns we need are 'lead' and 'alternate.' \n\nLooking at the 'lead' column for this row: it says \"zang jialiang.\" That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the 'alternate' column: according to the table, it's \"li dongyan.\" That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both the lead and alternate positions in the 2008 WMCC are correctly stated as zang jialiang and li dongyan, respectively. There's no inconsistency here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lead\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"alternate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Zang Jialiang lead during the 2007 - 08 season's event.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions Zang Jialiang, a specific season (2007-08), and an event. From the table, each row represents a different season with various team members.\n\nLooking at the table columns: season, skip, third, second, lead, alternate, events.\n\nThe key points to check are:\n1. Does Zang Jialiang appear as the 'lead' in the 2007-08 season?\n2. What event does the 2007-08 season correspond to?\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one for the 2007-08 season. The third row (row index 2) has the season 2007-08.\n\nIn that row, under 'lead', the name is Xu Xiaoming. So Zang Jialiang isn't listed as the lead in this season.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Row 3: 2007-08 season, third column is third, fourth is second, fifth is lead. Yes, the lead is Xu Xiaoming. So the claim says Zang Jialiang led during that season's event, but according to the table, he didn't.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other cells relevant. The 'events' column for 2007-08 is 2008 WMCC. So the event was the World Men's Curling Championship in 2008.\n\nSo, Zang Jialiang wasn't the lead during that season's event. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lead\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"liu rui be the lead that have a season of 2007 - 08\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Liu Rui is the lead for a season spanning from 2007 to 2008. So, I should look for entries in the table where Liu Rui is listed as the lead and the corresponding season is 2007-08.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different season, with various columns including 'season' and 'lead'. The 'lead' column seems to indicate who was leading during that season. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row (Season: 2002 - 03):** The lead is Liu Rui. But this isn't the 2007-08 season, so it's not relevant.\n2. **Second Row (Season: 2005 - 06):** Lead is Liu Rui again, but the season is 2005-06, which doesn't match.\n3. **Third Row (Season: 2007 - 08):** Here, the lead is Zang Jialiang. That's not Liu Rui, so this isn't matching.\n4. **Fourth Row (Season: 2008 - 09):** Lead is Zang Jialiang again, same as above.\n5. **Fifth Row (Season: 2009 - 10):** The lead here is Zang Jialiang once more, not Liu Rui.\n\nWait a minute, I'm noticing that in the third row, under 'third' column, it says \"liu rui\". But the 'lead' column for the 2007-08 season is Zang Jialiang. So even though Liu Rui appears elsewhere, he isn't listed as the lead for 2007-08.\n\nI should also check if there's another occurrence where Liu Rui is the lead in that specific season. From the table provided, it doesn't seem like it. Each time Liu Rui is mentioned, it's either in the 'second' or 'third' columns, not in the 'lead' column for 2007-08.\n\nSo, the claim seems to be incorrect because Liu Rui isn't listed as the lead during the 2007-08 season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Liu Rui was the lead for the 2007-08 season. Checking each row:\n\n- For 2007-08 (third row), 'lead' is Zang Jialiang, not Liu Rui.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"lead\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Zang Jialiang be the lead that have a season of 2005 - 06.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Zang Jialiang was the lead during the 2005-06 season. So I need to check if there's any data in the table supporting this.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: season, skip, third, second, lead, alternate, events.\n\nThe rows represent different seasons and list various participants under each category. The 'lead' column seems directly relevant because it lists who was the lead for each season.\n\nSo I should look into the 'lead' column for the 2005-06 season row. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Season is 2002-03, Lead is Liu Rui.\n2. Second row: Season is 2005-06, Lead is Liu Rui.\n3. Third row: 2007-08, Lead is Zang Jialiang.\n4. Fourth row: 2008-09, Lead is Zang Jialiang.\n5. Fifth row: 2009-10, Lead is Zang Jialiang.\n\nWait, the fifth row's lead is Zang Jialiang as well. But the claim is about 2005-06. So I need to check if in the 2005-06 season (second row), the lead is Zang Jialiang or not.\n\nLooking at the second row: The 'lead' cell is Liu Rui, not Zang Jialiang. So this means that for the 2005-06 season, the lead was Liu Rui, not Zang Jialiang.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Zang Jialiang wasn't the lead during the 2005-06 season. He became the lead starting from the 2007-08 season onwards.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: I need to find which cells were used to verify this. So for the 2005-06 season, the 'lead' cell is in row index 1 (since it's zero-based), so row 1, column 'lead'.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, column 'lead'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lead\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
