The claim is: \"the entrant team lotus have 0 point for the year 1963.\" \n\nFirst, I should carefully check each part of the claim against the table. Let me look at the table structure. It has columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points.\n\nThe claim mentions three key things:\n1. The entrant is \"team lotus.\"\n2. The year is 1963.\n3. They have 0 points for that year.\n\nSo I need to find the row where the year is 1963 and the entrant is \"team lotus\" to see what their points were.\n\nLooking at the table, the first row has the year 1963. The entrant is listed as \"team lotus.\" Now, checking the points column for that row, it says \"0.\" That matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's only one such entry. Sometimes tables might have multiple entries for the same team and year, but in this case, 1963 is only listed once with team lotus having 0 points.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are satisfied: the entrant is team lotus, the year is 1963, and their points are indeed 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and HTML data. The claim says, \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 points.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. Each row represents a different entry, probably from racing competitions.\n\nI need to check each year when Team Lotus entered to see if their points were below 10. The claim specifies that 1963 is the only such year, so I should focus on that first.\n\nLooking at 1963: Team Lotus had 0 points. That's definitely less than 10. Now, I'll check other years to see if there are any other instances where their points were below 10.\n\nIn 1964, they have 11 points\u2014so that's above 10 and doesn't affect the claim.\nIn 1966, there are three entries:\n- The first entry for 1966 has 1 point.\n- The second entry also has 1 point.\n- The third entry again has 1 point.\n\nWait, but all these are in 1966. So that's a whole year where Team Lotus earned less than 10 points, specifically 1 each time. That means 1966 also meets the condition of having points below 10.\n\nSo now I have two years: 1963 and 1966 where Team Lotus had less than 10 points. The claim says only 1963 is that year, so it's false because there's another year (1966) that also fits.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 1963 is the only year Team Lotus scored less than 10 points. However, in 1966, they had multiple entries with 1 point each, which is below 10. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
