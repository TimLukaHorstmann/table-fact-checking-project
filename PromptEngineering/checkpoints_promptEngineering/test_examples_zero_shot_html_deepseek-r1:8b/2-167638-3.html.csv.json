    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"France be the first country to open a Carrefour store\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about France being the first country where Carrefour opened a store. So, I need to find information related to France's Carrefour stores in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a country and has columns for 'country', 'first store', 'hypermarkets', 'supermarkets', and 'hard discounters'. The key here is the 'first store' column since it shows when each country first opened a Carrefour store.\n\nI'll locate France's row. Scanning through, I see that France is the 5th row (index 5 if we start counting from 0). The value in the 'first store' column for France is 1960. \n\nNow, I need to check other countries to ensure none have an earlier first store date than France. Let's go through each country:\n\n- Albania: 2011\n- Belgium: 2000\n- Bulgaria: 2009\n- Cyprus: 2006\n- Georgia: 2012\n- Greece: 1991\n- Italy: 1993\n- Macedonia: 2012\n- Monaco: No data, but it's a separate case.\n- Poland: 1997\n- Portugal: 1991\n- Romania: 2001\n- Spain: 1973 (earlier than France)\nWait, Spain's first store is in 1973, which is earlier than France's 1960. That means the claim that France was first is incorrect because Spain actually opened their Carrefour store earlier.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other countries:\n- United Kingdom has a 'first store' date of 1972, but it's marked as '-', so maybe data isn't available or Carrefour didn't open there yet. However, if we consider only the entries with numerical values, Spain is still the earliest.\n\nSo, since France's first store was in 1960, and Spain had theirs earlier in 1973 (wait, no, 1973 is after 1960), I think I made a mistake here. Wait, 1960 is earlier than 1973. So France's first store is indeed before Spain's. Therefore, France would be the first country according to the data.\n\nWait, let me recheck: France's first store is 1960, Spain is 1973, so yes, France is earlier. So perhaps my initial thought was wrong because I misread Spain as being after France.\n\nTherefore, looking back at other countries:\n\nAlbania:2011\nBelgium:2000\nBulgaria:2009\nCyprus:2006\nGeorgia:2012\nGreece:1991\nItaly:1993\nMacedonia:2012\nMonaco:- (no data)\nPoland:1997\nPortugal:1991\nRomania:2001\nSpain:1973\nSlovakia:1998\nSlovenia:1998\nTurkey:1993\nUnited Kingdom: - \n\nSo the earliest is France with 1960. Spain is next at 1973, then Poland in 1997, Belgium in 2000, etc.\n\nWait, but looking again, France's first store was in 1960, which is earlier than all other countries listed except maybe some that are marked as '-'. So, for the countries with available data, France indeed has the earliest 'first store' date.\n\nTherefore, the claim that France is the first country to open a Carrefour store is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"first store\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the most recent market expand into by carrefour be georgia and macedonia.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which countries are mentioned in the claim: Georgia and Macedonia.\n\nNext, I'll look at each of these countries in the table to see if Carrefour has expanded there recently.\n\nStarting with Georgia, I find the row for \"georgia\" (row 6). The columns relevant here are likely 'first store' and possibly 'hypermarkets', as these indicate when Carrefour entered that market. The first store was opened in 2012, which is considered recent based on the other entries. So, Georgia seems to be a relevant cell.\n\nNow for Macedonia, I look at the row for \"macedonia\" (row 9). The 'first store' column shows 2012 as well. This suggests that Carrefour expanded into Macedonia around the same time as Georgia. Therefore, Macedonia is also relevant.\n\nI should check if there's any indication in the table that Carrefour has been involved in these countries more recently than 2012. However, since the data stops at 2023 (e.g., Monaco and Poland have - for hypermarkets), I can assume that 2012 is the most recent year provided.\n\nSo, both Georgia and Macedonia's first store entries are relevant to verifying the claim about the most recent market expansions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"first store\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"first store\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about Spain having the most hard discounters compared to other countries in their operations. So I need to look at the \"hard discounters\" column for Spain and compare it with others in that same column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a row for each country, including Spain. The columns relevant here are \"country,\" \"first store,\" \"hypermarkets,\" \"supermarkets,\" and \"hard discounters.\" But since the claim is specifically about hard discounters, I'll focus on that column.\n\nSo, in the \"hard discounters\" column, Spain has a value of 2912. Let me check other countries to see if any have higher numbers. Scanning through the list:\n\n- Albania: -\n- Belgium: -\n- Bulgaria: -\n- Cyprus: -\n- France: 897\n- Georgia: -\n- Greece: 397\n- Italy: -\n- Macedonia: -\n- Monaco: -\n- Poland: -\n- Portugal: 365\n- Romania: -\n- Spain: 2912\n- Turkey: 519\n\nWait, Spain's number is the highest among all the entries that have numbers. Some countries have '-', which I think means data isn't available or they don't have any hard discounters. So comparing only the numerical values, Spain has the highest count.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because Spain does have more hard discounters than other countries listed in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"hard discounters\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says that Carrefour operates the least number of hypermarkets compared to supermarkets and hard discounters.\n\nFirst, I should identify which columns are relevant. The table has 'country', 'first store', 'hypermarkets', 'supermarkets', and 'hard discounters'. The claim mentions hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters, so these columns are definitely relevant. The 'first store' might not be directly relevant unless it affects the count, but I'll focus on the mentioned ones.\n\nNext, I need to look at each country where Carrefour operates and count their hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. But wait, the table doesn't specify which retailers operate in each country. It just lists numbers for each category per country. So, I'm not sure if those numbers are specific to Carrefour or other companies.\n\nFor example, looking at France: under hypermarkets it's 221, supermarkets 1021, and hard discounters 897. If these numbers represent Carrefour's stores, then they have a lot in each category. But if they're for all retailers combined, then I can't directly compare Carrefour's count.\n\nSince the claim is about Carrefour operating the least hypermarkets compared to others, but the table doesn't specify which company owns those numbers, it's unclear. Without knowing that the data is specific to Carrefour, I can't verify the claim accurately.\n\nTherefore, there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup because the table isn't labeled as Carrefour-specific.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about France having the most supermarkets and hypermarkets is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that \"France have the most supermarket and hypermarket out of all the country they operate in.\" So, I need to check if France has more supermarkets and hypermarkets compared to other countries listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's an HTML table with columns: country, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. The rows list various countries along with numerical data for each column.\n\nSince the claim is about supermarkets and hypermarkets, I should focus on the \"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\" columns.\n\nLet me locate France in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see France has a row where the first store is 1960, hypermarkets are 221, supermarkets are 1021, and hard discounters are 897. So, for France, the relevant numbers are 221 hypermarkets and 1021 supermarkets.\n\nNext, I need to compare these numbers with other countries in the table to see if France has the highest counts in both categories.\n\nStarting with hypermarkets: Let's look at each country's hypermarket count. Albania has 1, Belgium has 45, Bulgaria has 5, Cyprus has 7, France has 221, Georgia has 1, Greece has 28, Italy has 45, Macedonia has -, Monaco has -, Poland has 84, Portugal has -, Romania has 25, Spain has 172, Slovakia has 4, Slovenia has 15, Turkey has 73, and the United Kingdom has -.\n\nComparing these numbers, the highest hypermarket count is France's 221. So, no other country listed here has more hypermarkets than France.\n\nNow for supermarkets: Checking each country's supermarket data. Albania has -, Belgium has 370, Bulgaria has 3, Cyprus has 8, France has 1021, Georgia has 1, Greece has 210, Italy has 485, Macedonia has -, Monaco has -, Poland has 277, Portugal has -, Romania has 50, Spain has 115, Slovakia has 0, Slovenia has 12, Turkey has 99, and the United Kingdom has -.\n\nHere, France's supermarkets count is 1021. Looking at other countries: Belgium has 370, which is less than 1021; Italy has 485, still lower; Poland has 277, lower as well. Spain has 115, Greece 210, etc. None of these exceed 1021. So France also has the highest number of supermarkets.\n\nWait a second, I should double-check if all countries have their data filled in correctly. For example, some entries like Albania, Macedonia, Monaco, Portugal, and the United Kingdom have '-', which probably means they don't have any hypermarkets or supermarkets. But for the ones that do have numbers, France is indeed the highest in both categories.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim holds true because France has the most hypermarkets (221) and the most supermarkets (1021) compared to all other countries listed in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"france open a carrefour store after italy\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions France opening a Carrefour store after Italy. So, I need to check two main things: whether France has opened any Carrefour stores and whether this happened after Italy did.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related to each country's retail stores are 'first store', 'hypermarkets', 'supermarkets', and 'hard discounters'. Since Carrefour is a hypermarket chain, I should focus on the 'hypermarkets' column for both countries.\n\nStarting with France: The row for France shows \"1960\" in the 'first store' column. This suggests that France's first store was opened in 1960. For Italy, looking at their row, the 'first store' is listed as 1993.\n\nSo, France's first Carrefour store was opened in 1960, and Italy's was in 1993. The claim says France opened a store after Italy. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1960 is earlier than 1993. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there are any other relevant cells beyond 'hypermarkets' just in case. But since Carrefour is specifically a hypermarket, focusing on that column makes sense for this claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because France opened its first Carrefour store before Italy did.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"first store\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I should understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions Spain having lower discounters than Romania. Looking at the table columns, I see that there are four relevant ones: hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters, and maybe first store. Wait, actually, the columns are country, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters. So, to compare discounters in Spain and Romania, I need to look at the \"hard discounters\" column.\n\nI should locate the rows for Spain and Romania. For Spain, the row is 9th (index starting from 0). The data there says the hard discounters are 2912. Then, looking for Romania, that's row 12 with 50 under hard discounters. \n\nSo, comparing these numbers: Spain has 2912 hard discounters, while Romania has 50. That means Spain has a higher number of hard discounters than Romania. Therefore, the claim stating that Spain has lower discounter stores is incorrect.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other columns that might be relevant. The first store column shows when each country's retail sector started, but since the claim is about the number of stores, not the start year, it's not directly relevant here. So, only the hard discounters column matters for this comparison.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Spain has more hard discounters than Romania.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"Spain have lower discounter store than Romania,\" we compare their respective values in the \"hard discounters\" column of the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Spain's hard discounters: 2912\n   - Romania's hard discounters: 50\n\n2. **Comparison:**\n   - Spain has more hard discounters (2912) than Romania (50).\n\nSince Spain's number is higher, the claim that Spain has lower discounter stores than Romania is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"hard discounters\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"hard discounters\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine if the given claim about Georgia and Macedonia being the first countries to open a Carrefour store is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down how I would approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Georgia and Macedonia were the first countries to open a Carrefour store. So, my goal is to check if both these countries have any relevant data in the table that supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: country, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters. The rows represent different countries with their respective data from certain years.\n\nI need to find the rows for Georgia and Macedonia. Let's locate them:\n\n- For Georgia, the row is where the country is listed as \"georgia.\" The first_store column has 2012.\n- For Macedonia, the row is where the country is listed as \"macedonia.\" However, in the table provided, I don't see a row for Macedonia. Wait, checking again: yes, there's a row for \"macedonia\" but let me confirm.\n\nWait, looking through each <tr> tag:\n\n1. Albania\n2. Belgium\n3. Bulgaria\n4. Cyprus\n5. France\n6. Georgia\n7. Greece\n8. Italy\n9. Macedonia\n10. Monaco\n11. Poland\n12. Portugal\n13. Romania\n14. Spain\n15. Slovakia\n16. Slovenia\n17. Turkey\n18. United Kingdom\n\nYes, there is a row for Macedonia. In that row, the first_store column has 2012, but hypermarkets and supermarkers are '-', indicating perhaps no data or not applicable.\n\nBut the claim is about being the first to open a Carrefour store. So, looking at each country's first_store year:\n\n- Georgia: 2012\n- Macedonia: 2012 (but in their row, hypermarkets and supermarkets are '-', so maybe they didn't have those types of stores yet?)\n\nWait, but the claim is about opening a Carrefour store. The table has columns for hypermarkets, supermarkets, and hard discounters.\n\nSo, for each country, I need to check if they have any data in these columns that would indicate they opened a Carrefour store. However, the term \"first store\" might refer to the first type of store, not necessarily Carrefour.\n\nBut wait, the table's columns are 'first store,' hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters. So, perhaps the 'first store' column indicates when their first store (of any type) opened. But the claim is specifically about Carrefour stores, which might be under one of these categories.\n\nLooking back at the instruction: I need to check if Georgia and Macedonia are the first countries to open a Carrefour store. So, perhaps the relevant columns would be hypermarkets, supermarkets, or hard discounters for each country.\n\nLet me look up whether Carrefour is categorized under any of these columns in the table. Since the table doesn't specify the types beyond what's given, I have to assume that:\n\n- 'hypermarkets' might refer to stores like Carrefour.\n- 'supermarkets' are more general, like Auchan or others.\n- 'hard discounters' are places like Lidl or Aldi.\n\nSo, for each country, if they have a hypermarket count >0 or supermarket count >0 or hard discounter count >0, that might indicate they've opened such stores.\n\nNow, looking at Georgia's row: first_store is 2012, hypermarkets=1, supermarkets=1. So Georgia has both hypermarkets and supermarkets in 2012.\n\nMacedonia's row: first_store=2012, but hypermarkets=- and - for supermarkets and hard discounters (assuming that the \"-\" means no data or zero). If I take \"-\" as zero, then Macedonia doesn't have any stores of those types yet. So, maybe they didn't open Carrefour.\n\nWait, but the claim is about both Georgia and Macedonia being the first to open a Carrefour store. So, if Macedonia didn't open any relevant store in 2012, perhaps only Georgia did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"first store\" refers specifically to Carrefour. But without that information, I have to go by the given columns.\n\nSo, for Georgia, since hypermarkets=1 and supermarkets=1, they have stores of those types. If Carrefour is considered a hypermarket, then their first_store being 2012 would mean they opened it in 2012.\n\nFor Macedonia, hypermarkets=- (maybe zero) and supermarkets=- (zero). So they didn't open any relevant store yet.\n\nTherefore, only Georgia has the data to support having a store (likely Carrefour) in 2012. Since the claim says both Georgia and Macedonia did, this would make the claim FALSE because Macedonia's row doesn't show any stores in the relevant columns.\n\nWait, but I need to be precise. The claim is about opening a Carrefour store, which might specifically be under hypermarkets or another category. If \"first_store\" refers to their first store overall, regardless of type, then both have 2012 as their first store year. But if the specific type (like hypermarket) is what matters for Carrefour, then only Georgia has that.\n\nThe instruction says: check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim. So, I need to see if both countries have data indicating they opened a Carrefour store.\n\nGiven that, perhaps looking at hypermarkets column is key for Carrefour. So, Georgia has 1 (indicating they have hypermarkets), while Macedonia has -, which might mean no hypermarkets yet. Therefore, only Georgia opened a hypermarket in 2012.\n\nThus, the claim that both are the first to open a Carrefour store would be FALSE because only Georgia has the data for opening such a store.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify if both Georgia and Macedonia have relevant data indicating they opened a Carrefour store. \n\n- **Georgia**: Has 1 hypermarket in 2012.\n- **Macedonia**: No data ( '-' ) for hypermarkets, supermarkets, or hard discounters.\n\nSince only Georgia has the necessary information to support opening a Carrefour store, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"france have lower supermarket and hypermarket than turkey\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two things: supermarkets and hypermarkets in France compared to Turkey. So, I should look at those specific columns for both countries. Looking at the table, the relevant columns are \"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\". \n\nLet's locate France and Turkey in the table. For France, they're in row 5 (since the first row is the header). The \"supermarkets\" column for France has a value of 1021, and the \"hypermarkets\" column is 221.\n\nNow, for Turkey, they're in row 13. The \"supermarkets\" column for Turkey shows 99, and the \"hypermarkets\" column is 99 as well.\n\nWait, no, looking again: For Turkey, under \"supermarkets\", it's 99, and \"hypermarkets\" is also 99. So both are higher than France's 221 hypermarkets and 1021 supermarkets. That would mean that France has more supermarkets and hypermarkets than Turkey, which directly contradicts the claim.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. France: super=1021, hyper=221. Turkey: super=99, hyper=99. Yes, so France's numbers are higher in both categories.\n\nSo the claim says France has lower than Turkey, but according to the table, it's the opposite. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. The columns involved are \"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\". Let me get their indices. Looking at the table, the headers are:\n\ncountry, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters.\n\nWait, actually, in the HTML, the headers after country are: first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters. So \"supermarkets\" is column index 3 (if we count from 0). But let me check each row's data.\n\nFor France (row 5), the relevant columns are at positions 3 and 4? Wait no, looking again:\n\nIn the table, after country, it's first store, then hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters. So for each row, after country comes first store, then hypermarkets (column 2 if starting from 0), supermarkets is column 3, and hard discounters is column 4.\n\nWait no, actually, in the HTML table, the columns are:\n\n- country\n- first store\n- hypermarkets\n- supermarkets\n- hard discounters\n\nSo each row's data is: country, first store, hypermarkets, supermarkets, hard discounters.\n\nTherefore, for France (row index 5), the \"supermarkets\" column is at position 3 and \"hypermarkets\" is at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, for Turkey (row index 13), \"supermarkets\" is at position 3 with value 99, and \"hypermarkets\" at position 2 with value 99.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nFor France: row_index=5, column_name=\"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\".\n\nFor Turkey: row_index=13, same columns.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include these four cells.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about both supermarkets and hypermarkets in France being lower than Turkey. So we need to check each of those two columns for both countries.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For France: row 5, \"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\".\n- For Turkey: row 13, same columns.\n\nSo the list includes four objects, each with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we check the relevant cells in the table for both countries and their corresponding categories. France has higher values in both \"supermarkets\" and \"hypermarkets\" compared to Turkey, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"hypermarkets\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Carrefour operates more supermarket than hypermarket\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Carrefour has more supermarkets than hypermarkets in their stores.\n\nFirst, I should look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The table has \"country,\" \"first store,\" \"hypermarkets,\" \"supermarkets,\" and \"hard discounters.\" Since the claim is comparing hypermarkets and supermarkets, those two columns seem directly related to the claim. So, I'll focus on the \"hypermarkets\" and \"supermarkets\" columns.\n\nNext, I need to check for each country listed in the table if Carrefour has more supermarkets than hypermarkets there. However, looking at the data, most countries have either a dash (\"-\") or a number for hypermarkets and supermarkets. The dashes probably mean that Carrefour doesn't operate those types of stores in that country.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Albania: Both hypermarkets and supermarkets are 1. So equal.\n2. Belgium: Hypermarkets is 45, supermarkets 370. Supermarkets more.\n3. Bulgaria: 5 vs. 3. Supermarkets more.\n4. Cyprus: 7 vs. 8. Hypermarkets more.\n5. France: 221 vs. 1021. Supermarkets way more.\n6. Georgia: 1 vs. 1. Equal.\n7. Greece: 28 vs. 210. Supermarkets more.\n8. Italy: 45 vs. 485. Supermarkets more.\n9. Macedonia: Both are \"-\". Doesn't apply.\n10. Monaco: Hypermarket is 1, supermarket \"-\", so likely only hypermarket exists.\n11. Poland: 84 vs. 277. Supermarkets more.\n12. Portugal: \"-\" vs. 365. Only supermarkets in Portugal? Or does it mean Carrefour has no hypermarkets there?\n13. Romania: 25 vs. 50. Supermarkets more.\n14. Spain: 172 vs. 115. Supermarkets more, but wait, the \"hard discounters\" are higher here, but not relevant for this claim.\n15. Slovakia: 4 vs. 0. Supermarkets more? Wait, 4 hypermarkets and 0 supermarkets. So actually, Carrefour has more hypermarkets than supermarkets in Slovakia?\n16. Slovenia: 15 vs. 12. Supermarkets more.\n17. Turkey: 73 vs. 99. Hypermarkets more.\n18. United Kingdom: All \"-\", so doesn't apply.\n\nWait a minute, for some countries like Slovakia and Turkey, Carrefour has more hypermarkets than supermarkets. But the claim is about Carrefour in general. It's possible that globally, Carrefour has more supermarkets overall, but the claim might be making a specific comparison between hypermarkets and supermarkets across all their stores.\n\nLooking at each country:\n\n- In most countries except Turkey and possibly Slovakia (if we consider only those two where hypermarkets > supermarkets), Carrefour has more supermarkets than hypermarkets. But in those specific countries, it's the opposite. However, I need to see if the claim is making a general statement or perhaps a comparison based on total stores.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify the country; they just said Carrefour operates more supermarket than hypermarket. So maybe globally, across all their stores in the listed countries, do they have more supermarkets?\n\nLooking at each column:\n\n\"supermarkets\" total count: Let's sum up the numbers where available.\n\n- Albania: 1\n- Belgium: 370\n- Bulgaria:3\n- Cyprus:8\n- France:1021\n- Georgia:1\n- Greece:210\n- Italy:485\n- Macedonia:-\n- Monaco: -\n- Poland:277\n- Portugal:365 (but does that mean Carrefour has 365 supermarkets? Or total in Portugal?\nWait, each row represents a country. So for each country, the number of supermarkets Carrefour operates is in that row.\n\nSo let's sum up all the \"supermarkets\" columns where there are numbers:\n\n1 + 370 +3 +8 +1021 +1 +210 +485 +277 +365\n\nThat's a lot. Let me add them step by step:\n\n1 (Albania) =1\n+370 (Belgium)=371\n+3 (Bulgaria)=374\n+8 (Cyprus)=382\n+1021 (France)=1403\n+1 (Georgia)=1404\n+210 (Greece)=1614\n+485 (Italy)=2099\n+277 (Poland)=2376\n+365 (Portugal)=2741\n\nSo total supermarkets are 2741. Now, let's do the same for hypermarkets.\n\n\"hypermarkets\": sum where available:\n\n- Albania:1\n- Belgium:45\n- Bulgaria:5\n- Cyprus:7\n- France:221\n- Georgia:1\n- Greece:28\n- Italy:45\n- Macedonia:-\n- Monaco:1\n- Poland:84\n- Portugal:-\n- Romania:25\n- Spain:172\n- Slovakia:4\n- Slovenia:15\n- Turkey:73\n\nAdding these:\n\n1 +45=46\n+5=51\n+7=58\n+221=279\n+1=280\n+28=308\n+45=353\n+1=354\n+84=438\n+25=463\n+172=635\n+4=639\n+15=654\n+73=727\n\nSo total hypermarkets are 727.\n\nComparing the two totals: Supermarkets (2741) vs Hypermarkets (727). So overall, Carrefour has way more supermarkets than hypermarkets across all these countries. Therefore, the claim that \"Carrefour operates more supermarket than hypermarket\" is true because when you sum up all their stores in the listed countries, they have significantly more supermarkets.\n\nBut wait, the table might only include stores where they have at least one of either, so I'm assuming this is correct. Also, some countries like Turkey have more hypermarkets than supermarkets, but globally, it's not affecting the overall total.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all \"supermarkets\" column across all rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"supermarkets\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
