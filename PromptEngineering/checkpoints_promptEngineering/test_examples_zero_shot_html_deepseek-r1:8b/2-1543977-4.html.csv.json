    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1999.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts. It mentions two individuals: Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin. They are supposed to be the runners-up, finishing second, behind Tiger Wood in the year 1999.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year. For 1999, the relevant row is index 0. The columns I need to check are \"year,\" \"country,\" \"team,\" \"individual,\" and \"runners - up.\"\n\nStarting with the year: 1999 matches the first data row, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the country for 1999 is the United States. Checking the table, yes, it aligns with the claim.\n\nLooking at the individual column in 1999, it says Tiger Woods. That's consistent with the claim stating he was the winner.\n\nNow, the runners-up column for 1999 lists Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin. The claim names both as runners-up, but I notice that the claim uses \"santiago luna miguel angel martin\" without an ampersand. However, in the table, it's \"santiago luna &amp; miguel angel martin.\" So the names match, just formatted slightly differently with an HTML entity for the ampersand.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data: correct year, country, Tiger Woods as individual, and Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as runners-up. There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy in the information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data, confirming that both Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were indeed the runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1999.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"tiger wood have only win 1 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions \"Tiger Wood\" winning only once. Now, I'll examine the table to find any relevant information about Tiger Woods' victories.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with details about the country, team, individual, location, and runners-up. My focus is on finding rows where Tiger Woods is listed as either part of the team or the individual winner.\n\nStarting from 1999, the first row shows that Tiger Woods was part of the team along with Mark O'Meara. However, the individual winner is listed as Tiger Woods. So this row indicates a win in 1999.\n\nNext, checking subsequent years: 1998 doesn't mention Tiger Woods at all. In 1997, Colin Montgomerie is the individual winner. For 1996, Ernie Els won, not Tiger Woods. The years 1995 to 1994 also don't list Tiger Woods as the winner; Fred Couples and Davis Love III are mentioned.\n\nLooking specifically for Tiger Woods in the 'individual' column: only the 1999 row shows him as the individual winner. None of the other rows have him winning any other years. Therefore, based on the table, Tiger Woods has only won once in 1999.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because the table supports that Tiger Woods has only won one year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts: location (Cape Town) and year (1996). The claim suggests that the tournament's first occurrence happened in Cape Town during 1996.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, country, team, individual, location, and runners-up. My task is to find if there's any row where both the year is 1996 AND the location is Cape Town.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **1999**: Location is Kuala Lumpur, not Cape Town.\n2. **1998**: Auckland, not Cape Town.\n3. **1997**: Kiawah Island, nope.\n4. **1996**: Cape Town, South Africa. That's the location for 1996. So this row matches both the year and location.\n5. **1995** and **1994**, **1993**: All these years are before or after 1996, so they don't apply.\n\nSince there's a row where year is 1996 and location is Cape Town, the claim seems to be TRUE. But wait, I should check if it's the first time. The 1996 row doesn't mention being the first, but since the claim says \"first hold,\" we need to ensure that 1996 was indeed the initial occurrence in Cape Town.\n\nLooking further, I see that the tournament didn't take place in Cape Town before 1996 according to the table data provided. So, it's reasonable to conclude that 1996 was the first time it was held there.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1997\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has several columns: year, country, team, individual, location, and runners-up. Each row represents a different year, from 1993 to 1999.\n\nThe claim mentions 1997, so I should focus on that year. Looking at the 1997 row, the relevant information is:\n\n- Year: 1997\n- Country: Ireland\n- Team: P\u00e1draig Harrington & Paul McGinley\n- Individual: Colin Montgomerie\n- Location: Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA\n- Runners-up: Colin Montgomerie & Raymond Russell\n\nWait, the claim says that Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin are the runners-up behind Tiger Woods. But in the 1997 row, the runners-up are listed as Colin Montgomerie and Raymond Russell. There's no mention of Santiago Luna or Miguel Angel Martin.\n\nI need to check if there's a possibility I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the claim is referring to another year? Let me see other rows where Tiger Woods might be involved. \n\nLooking at the 1999 row, Tiger Woods is part of the team along with Mark O'Meara, and the runners-up are Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin. So in 1999, that's true.\n\nBut the claim specifies 1997. In 1997, Tiger Woods isn't listed as the individual winner. Wait, actually, looking at the table again: in 1997, the individual is Colin Montgomerie, not Tiger Woods. So Tiger Woods wasn't even the winner in 1997, which means the claim about him having runners-up Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin in 1997 is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"be the runner up behind tiger wood\". Maybe it's implying that Tiger Woods was the winner, and the runner-up is someone else. But in 1997, Tiger Woods wasn't the winner. So the runners-up can't be linked to him in that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because in 1997, the runners-up are Colin Montgomerie and Raymond Russell, not Santiago Luna or Miguel Angel Martin.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tiger wood have win several year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Tiger Woods has won several years. So, I'm looking for information in the table related to Tiger Woods' victories over the years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, from 1993 to 1999. Each row includes details about the country, team, individual, location, and runners-up.\n\nI need to scan through each row's \"individual\" column because that's where the winner is listed. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1999: Individual is Tiger Woods.\n- 1998: Individual is Scott Verplank.\n- 1997: Individual is Colin Montgomerie.\n- 1996: Individual is Ernie Els.\n- 1995: Individual is Davis Love III.\n- 1994: Individual is Fred Couples.\n- 1993: Individual is Bernhard Langer.\n\nFrom this, I see that Tiger Woods only won in 1999. So he has at least one victory, not several. The term \"several\" implies more than one, but based on the table, he only won once.\n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant information that might support the claim. Maybe the \"runners-up\" column? But Tiger Woods was a runner-up in 1998 and 1993, not a winner. So that doesn't help.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because it only shows Tiger Woods winning once, not several times.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1998. So, I'm looking for a row where the year is 1998 and the location is Cape Town, South Africa. That should be the relevant data point to check.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. I'll go through each row one by one until I find the one that matches both the year 1998 and the location Cape Town.\n\nStarting with the first row: It's for 1999, so not our target year. The location is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2014doesn't match.\n\nNext, the 1998 row: Let's see. The year is correct\u2014it\u2019s 1998. Now, what about the location? The cell says \"auckland , new zealand.\" Hmm, that's Auckland in New Zealand, not Cape Town. So this doesn't fit the claim.\n\nMoving on to 1997: Year is 1997, which isn't our target. Location is Kiawah Island in South Carolina, USA\u2014no match.\n\nFor 1996: Again, not the right year and the location is Cape Town, but the year is 1996, not 1998. So that's a close one but doesn't fit the claim exactly.\n\nThen, looking at the rows for 1995 and 1994, those are earlier years, so they can't be the first in 1998.\n\nWait, actually, the 1993 row is for 1993, which is before 1998, so that's not relevant either.\n\nNow, after checking all rows, I realize there's no entry for 1998 where the location is Cape Town. Instead, the 1996 row does mention Cape Town, but it's in 1996, making it the second time, not the first. So the claim is saying that it was first in 1998, which doesn't align with any data here.\n\nTherefore, since there\u2019s no matching row for 1998 with Cape Town as the location, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1998\" is true, we need to check the table for a tournament occurring in Cape Town in the year 1998. After reviewing each row, there's no entry for Cape Town in 1998.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
