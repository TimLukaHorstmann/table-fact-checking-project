    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the term start for bashkim fino be after the term start for vilson ahmeti.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. It's about the term start dates of two individuals: Bashkim Fino and Vilson Ahmeti. So, I should look into their respective rows in the table to find when their terms started.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different leader with details like name, birth-death years, term start, term end, and political party. I'm particularly interested in the 'term start' column for both individuals.\n\nI need to locate Vilson Ahmeti's term start date and Bashkim Fino's term start date. Scanning through the rows, Vilson Ahmeti is listed in row 4 with a term start of \"10 december 1991.\" Now, looking for Bashkim Fino, he's in row 6, and his term start is \"11 march 1997.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right because if I'm comparing the two, Vilson Ahmeti started his term on December 10, 1991, and Bashkim Fino started much later on March 11, 1997. That means Bashkim Fino's term start is indeed after Vilson Ahmeti's.\n\nSo, the claim says that Bashkim Fino's term start is after Vilson Ahmeti's, which seems to be correct based on the dates provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"the term start for bashkim fino be after the term start for vilson ahmeti\" is true, we need to compare their respective 'term start' values.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For **Vilson Ahmeti**, his 'term start' is in row 4.\n   - For **Bashkim Fino**, his 'term start' is in row 6.\n\n2. **Extract Data**:\n   - Vilson Ahmeti's term start: \"10 december 1991\".\n   - Bashkim Fino's term start: \"11 march 1997\".\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - \"10 december 1991\" (Vilson) is earlier than \"11 march 1997\" (Bashkim).\n   - Therefore, Bashkim's term starts after Vilson's.\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"ilir meta , bashkim fino , ylli bufi and pandeli majko (1st time) be all member of the socialist party of albania political party.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at each person mentioned in the claim and verify their affiliation with the Socialist Party of Albania from the table.\n\nStarting with ilir meta. Scanning through the table rows, I find ilir meta in row 10 (assuming rows start from index 0). His term end date is 22 February 2002, but more importantly, his political party is listed as \"socialist party of albania.\" So that's correct.\n\nNext, bashkim fino. He's in row 9. His term starts on 11 March 1997 and ends on 24 July 1997, and his political party is also the Socialist Party of Albania. So he's a member too.\n\nThen ylli bufi is in row 2.

The table has a <thead> with headers: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party. Then there's a <tbody> with multiple rows, each representing different individuals.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find the relevant names. I notice that Vilson Ahmeti is listed in row 4 (row_index: 3 if we count from 0) and Ylli Bufi is in row 2 (row_index: 1). \n\nNext, I need to compare their term end dates. Vilson Ahmeti's term end is on \"13 april 1992\" as per row 4. Ylli Bufi's term end is listed as \"10 december 1991\" in row 2.\n\nSo, comparing these two dates: 10 December 1991 (Ylli Bufi) and 13 April 1992 (Vilson Ahmeti). Since April 1992 comes after December 1991, Vilson Ahmeti's term end is indeed after Ylli Bufi's. \n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It says that Sali Berisha was elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania and that she's the first person after Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i to do so. So, I need to check if there are any other members from the same party after Me\u00e7i until Berisha.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various political figures along with their term details. I should focus on the 'political party' column and see who else was part of the Democratic Party of Albania (DPA) between Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i's term and Sali Berisha's term.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u0161i served from 13 April 1992 to 11 March 1997, and his political party is listed as the Democratic Party of Albania. He was the last DPA Prime Minister before the socialist takeover in 1997.\n  \n- Sali Berisha is next, starting her term on 11 September 2005, also with the DPA.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other DPA members served between Me\u0161i's term end and Berisha's start. Let's look at the 'term end' dates for each DPA member:\n\n- Pandeli Majko (1st time): ended on 29 October 1999.\n- Ilir Meta: ended on 22 February 2002.\n- Pandeli Majko (2nd time): ended on 31 July 2002.\n- Fatos Nano (3rd time): ended on 11 September 2005.\n\nWait, but Sali Berisha started her term in September 2005. So between Me\u0161i's end in March 1997 and Berisha's start in 2005, there were several DPA members: Majko (1st), Meta, Majko (2nd), and Nano (3rd). All these individuals are from the DPA.\n\nSo, if the claim is that Sali Berisha is the first after Me\u00e7i to be elected as a DPA member, this would be false because there were others who held DPA positions before her.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"only 1 person have be a member of the party of labour of albania political party and be elect\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that there's only one person who has been a member of the Party of Labour of Albania and also served in an elected position. So, my task is to check the table and see if this condition holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different person with their relevant details. The columns include name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. \n\nI should focus on the 'political party' column specifically because the claim mentions the Party of Labour of Albania. I'll go through each row to see which individuals are part of this party.\n\nStarting from the top, most rows have \"prime ministers 1991 onwards\" or similar text in their name and other columns. But looking at the 'political party' column, those rows might not be relevant because they don't specify a party name. For example, one row says \"party of labour of albania\", which seems to match, but another row says \"socialist party of albania\" or others.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking closely, the first data row under 'political party' is \"party of labour of albania\". Then, later rows have \"socialist party of albania\", \"non - party\", etc. So I need to identify all individuals who are in the Party of Labour of Albania.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The second row (fatos nano) has political party as \"party of labour of albania\".\n- The fourth row (vilson ahmeti) is \"non - party\".\n- Other rows have either \"socialist party of albania\" or \"democratic party of albania\".\n\nSo, only Fatos Nano seems to be a member of the Party of Labour of Albania. Now, I need to check if he was elected. Looking at his term start and end: 22 Feb 1991 to 5 June 1991. So, he served as Prime Minister during that period.\n\nNow, the claim says \"only 1 person have be a member... and be elect\". Since there's only one person (Fatos Nano) who was a member of the Party of Labour of Albania and was elected, this should make the claim TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Are there any other members of the Party of Labour of Albania in the table? Let me scan through all rows again.\n\nLooking at each row's political party:\n- Row 0: prime ministers... (doesn't specify a party)\n- Row 1: Party of Labour\n- Row 2: Socialist Party\n- Row 3: non-party\n- Row 4: Socialist Party\n- Row 5: Democratic Party\n- Row 6: Socialist Party\n- Row 7: Socialist Party\n- Row 8: Socialist Party\n- Row 9: Democratic Party\n- Row 10: Socialist Party\n- Row 11: Incumbent, Socialist Party\n\nSo yes, only Fatos Nano is in the Party of Labour. Therefore, the claim that only one person from this party was elected seems to hold true.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table and identify individuals who are members of the \"Party of Labour of Albania\" and held an elected position.\n\n1. **Identify Members of the Party**: \n   - Only Fatos Nano (2nd row) is listed under \"party of labour of albania\".\n\n2. **Check if Elected**:\n   - Fatos Nano served as Prime Minister from 22 Feb 1991 to 5 June 1991, indicating an elected position.\n\nSince there's only one such individual, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the term start for ylli bufi be after the term start for vilson ahmeti\". \n\nFirst, I should identify where in the table the relevant information is located. Let's look at the table structure. It has a header with columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party.\n\nI need to find the rows for Ylli Bufi and Vilson Ahmeti. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Ylli Bufi is in row 2 (since the first data row is index 1 if we consider the header as row 0). Wait, no, the first row after <thead> is row 1. Let me count properly.\n\nLooking at the tbody, each tr is a row. The first tr after thead is for \"fatos nano (1st time)\", which would be row index 1. Then Ylli Bufi is in row 2: yes, row 2 is his row. Vilson Ahmeti is in row 3.\n\nNow, the columns we need are 'term start'. So for each of these individuals, I should extract their term start date.\n\nFor Ylli Bufi, looking at column 'term start', it's \"5 june 1991\". For Vilson Ahmeti, his term start is also \"5 june 1991\".\n\nWait a minute. Both have the same term start date: June 5, 1991. So, if the claim says that Ylli Bufi's term start is after Vilson Ahmeti's, but both are on the same date, then it's not true because one isn't after the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. \n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nYlli Bufi's row: term start is 5 June 1991.\nVilson Ahmeti's row: term start is 10 December 1991? Wait no, let me check again. \n\nWait, in the table provided, for Vilson Ahmeti, the term end is 13 April 1992, but looking at his 'term start', it's \"5 june 1991\"? No, wait:\n\nNo, the table shows that Ylli Bufi has a term start of \"5 June 1991\" and ends on \"10 December 1991\". Vilson Ahmeti's term starts on \"10 December 1991\" as well? Wait no, let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row for Ylli Bufi: term start is 5 June 1991.\n- Row for Vilson Ahmeti: looking at his row, it's row index 3. The 'term start' is \"10 december 1991\".\n\nWait no, let me check again because I might be mixing up the rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2 (Ylli Bufi): term start 5 June 1991.\nRow 3 (Vilson Ahmeti): term start 10 December 1991.\n\nSo Ylli started in June 1991, Vilson started in December 1991. Therefore, Vilson's term start is after Ylli's.\n\nBut the claim says that Ylli's term start is after Vilson's. That would be false because Ylli started earlier.\n\nWait no, the claim is: \"the term start for ylli bufi be after the term start for vilson ahmeti\". So it's claiming that Ylli's term start is later than Vilson's. But from the table, Vilson's term start is 10 December 1991, which is after Ylli's 5 June 1991.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Ylli started before Vilson, not after.\n\nWait no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nYlli Bufi: term start is 5 June 1991.\nVilson Ahmeti: term start is 10 December 1991.\n\nSo Vilson's term starts later than Ylli's. Therefore, the claim that Ylli's term start is after Vilson's is false because it's the other way around.\n\nWait no, the claim says Ylli's term start is after Vilson's. So since Vilson started in December 1991 and Ylli in June, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ylli Bufi's term start is after Vilson Ahmeti's. However, based on the table, Vilson Ahmeti started his term on 10 December 1991, which is after Ylli Bufi's term start on 5 June 1991. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. Identify rows for Ylli Bufi and Vilson Ahmeti.\n2. Extract their respective 'term start' dates from the table.\n3. Compare the dates to determine if Ylli's is after Vilson's.\n4.

The claim states: \"ilir meta be the first person since aleksand\u00ebr meksi , to be elect as a member of the democratic party of albania political party.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns in the table that could help verify this claim. From the table headers, the columns are name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party.\n\nThe key points in the claim are:\n1. ilir meta is elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.\n2. ilir meta is the first person after Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i to do this.\n\nSo I need to check the 'political party' column for both ilir meta and Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i, as well as any other individuals who might have been members of the Democratic Party around their terms.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u0161i is listed under the Democratic Party of Albania. His term started on 13 April 1992 and ended in March 1997.\n- ilir meta's political party is also listed as the Socialist Party of Albania, not the Democratic Party. This is a problem because the claim says he joined the Democratic Party.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. If ilir meta is part of the Socialist Party, then he can't be a member of the Democratic Party as per the table. That would make the claim false because he isn't in the right party.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if any other individuals after Me\u0161i also joined the Democratic Party before ilir meta. The next person after Me\u0161i is Bashkim Fino, who's part of the Socialist Party. Then Pandeli Majko and others are also in the Socialist Party, not the Democratic Party. Sali Berisha is in the Democratic Party but she comes after ilir meta. \n\nSo since ilir meta isn't in the Democratic Party, he can't be the first after Me\u0161i to join that party. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, I checked if \"ilir meta\" is a member of the Democratic Party of Albania and whether he was the first after \"Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u0161i.\" The table shows ilir meta belongs to the Socialist Party, not the Democratic one, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"only 1 person have been a member of the socialist party of albania.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check if the political party column mentions \"socialist party of albania.\" Starting from row 2:\n\n- Row 2: \"party of labour of albania\" \u2013 not the same as socialist.\n- Row 3: \"socialist party of albania\" \u2013 this is relevant.\n- Row 4: \"non - party\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 5: \"democratic party of albania\" \u2013 different from socialist.\n- Rows 6 to 10: Most have \"socialist party of albania.\"\n- Row 12: \"socialist party of albania\" \u2013 relevant again.\n- Row 13: \"non - party\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Rows 14,15,16,17: All have \"socialist party of albania.\"\n\nCounting the number of times \"socialist party of albania\" appears in the 'political party' column.
