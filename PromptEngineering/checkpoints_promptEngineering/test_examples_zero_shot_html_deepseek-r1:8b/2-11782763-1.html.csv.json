    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"William Adelin be the only 1 who became heir due to birth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and see if William Adelin was indeed the only one who became heir because of his birth. The table has several rows with different heirs and their statuses.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about Robert Curthose, who became heir presumptive in 1066 but ceased in 1077 due to his father becoming king.\n2. The second row seems to be a confusing one about succession uncertainty from 1077-1087, so I'll skip that for now.\n3. The third row again mentions Robert Curthose as the heir presumptive, this time an elder brother in 1087, ceasing in 1088.\n4. The fourth row discusses Henry Beauclerc becoming heir presumptive in 1088 due to Robert's rebellion.\n5. The fifth row is about succession uncertainty from 1100-1103.\n6. The sixth row is about William Adelin, who became heir apparent in 1103 because he was the only son.\n7. The seventh row talks about Empress Matilda, who became heiress presumptive in 1120 and was declared so in 1127.\n\nNow, focusing on William Adelin's case: he was born in 1103, and it says \"born\" as his reason for becoming heir apparent. He was the only son of Henry I, which makes him the direct heir by birth. So, he did become heir due to his own birth.\n\nI need to check if there are any other heirs who became so purely because they were born. Let's see:\n\n- Robert Curthose and Henry Beauclerc both became heirs through rebellion or agreements, not solely due to their births.\n- Empress Matilda was declared heiress presumptive after her brother died, but she was the only child, so her position might be considered a result of birth as well.\n\nWait, in the table, for William Adelin (row 6), the \"reason\" column is \"born\", and he's the only son. So that seems straightforward.\n\nLooking at other entries: Robert Curthose was heir presumptive but his status changed due to his father becoming king, so it wasn't solely because of birth but also due to succession. Similarly, Henry Beauclerc took over after a rebellion, so not purely by birth. Empress Matilda's case is a bit tricky because she was the only child, so her position might be considered an heir presumptive by birth, but in this table, her status is \"heiress presumptive\" and it seems she became so after her brother died, which complicates things.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions William Adelin as the \"only 1\" who became heir due to birth. Based on the table, William Adelin's case fits that. Are there any others?\n\nLooking through all the heirs:\n\n- Robert Curthose: became heir but then lost it.\n- Henry Beauclerc: became heir after a rebellion.\n- Empress Matilda: became heiress presumptive after her brother died, so not directly because of her birth.\n\nSo, William Adelin seems to be the only one who became heir due solely to his birth as the only son. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there aren't other entries where the reason for becoming heir is stated as \"born.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- For William Adelin: yes, it's explicitly stated as \"born.\"\n- Others don't mention \"born\" in the reason. They have reasons like \"father became king,\" \"by agreement,\" \"rebellion,\" etc.\n\nSo, only William Adelin's case directly mentions \"born\" as the reason for becoming heir. Therefore, he is indeed the only one in this table who became heir due to birth.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze each relevant row and column in the provided HTML table. The claim states that William Adelin was the only one who became heir due to being born. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We focus on rows where William Adelin is listed as an heir.\n2. **Check 'Reason' Column**: For William Adelin's row, the reason for becoming heir is explicitly stated as \"born.\"\n3. **Compare with Other Heirs**: Other heirs became heirs due to reasons like rebellion, succession uncertainty, or their father becoming king, not solely because of their birth.\n\nSince William Adelin is the only heir in the table where the reason is directly linked to his birth, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"reason\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This will help me identify which heirs are sons of the monarch.\n\n1. **Row 0**: Robert Curthose, described as a son. So this is one heir who is a son.\n2. **Row 2**: Robert Curthose again, mentioned as an elder brother. That doesn't count as a son.\n3. **Row 4**: Henry Beauclerc, referred to as a younger brother. Not a son.\n4. **Row 6**: William Adelin, described as the only son. This is another heir who is a son.\n5. **Row 8**: Empress Matilda, called the only child. Since she's female, being an only child doesn't make her a son in this context.\n\nSo far, I see two heirs\u2014Robert Curthose and William Adelin\u2014who have 'son' as their relationship to the monarch. \n\nWait, but Robert Curthose appears twice: once in Row 0 and again in Row 2. However, Row 2 mentions him as an elder brother, which might indicate a different relationship, so maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nLooking at each entry where 'relationship to monarch' is 'son', only two heirs fit that description: Robert Curthose (Row 0) and William Adelin (Row 6). \n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported by these two instances. However, I should double-check if any other rows might have been missed.\n\nUpon reviewing all rows again, there are no others where 'relationship to monarch' is explicitly stated as 'son'. So it looks like only two heirs meet this criterion.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088. The second part is that this happened a year after Robert Curthose.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where either Henry or Robert are involved as heirs and check their relevant details. \n\nStarting with Robert Curthose: In row 0, Robert is listed as the heir presumptive who became heir in 1066. Then, in row 2, he's again an heir presumptive but this time as the elder brother, becoming heir in 1087. So, Robert became heir before 1088.\n\nHenry Beauclerc is mentioned in row 3. He became heir in 1088, which matches the first part of the claim. The second part says that this happened a year after Robert. However, from the table, Robert became heir in 1087 (row 2) and Henry in 1088. So, 1088 is indeed one year after 1087. Therefore, both parts of the claim seem to be supported by the table.\n\nI need to verify this by checking the relevant cells. For Robert Curthose, his row index is 0 or 2. The column for becoming heir is 'became heir', which has values like 1066 and 1087. Henry's row is 3, and his 'became heir' is 1088.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, column 'became heir'\n- Row 2, column 'became heir' (for Robert)\n- Row 3, column 'became heir' (for Henry)\n\nThis supports both parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"henry beauclerc cease to be heir on 2 august 1100 , follow by william adelin 20 year later.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two people: Henry Beauclerc and William Adelin. The claim states that Henry Beauclerc ceased to be heir on August 2, 1100, and then William Adelin became heir 20 years later.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each part of this statement against the data in the HTML table. Let me start by identifying the relevant rows and columns.\n\nThe table has several columns: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, and monarch.\n\nI'll look for Henry Beauclerc first. Scanning through the 'heir' column, I find Henry Beauclerc in row 4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). The 'ceased to be heir' cell is empty or not applicable here, but since he was an heir presumptive, perhaps his status changed.\n\nWait, in row 4, Henry Beauclerc is listed as the heir presumptive, became heir in 1088, and then ceased in 1100. So he did cease in 1100. That part of the claim matches because it says he ceased on August 2, 1100.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that William Adelin became heir after Henry Beauclerc. Looking at the table, William Adelin is in row 5 and row 6. In row 5, he's the heir apparent, becoming heir in 1103. So there's a gap of about 23 years, not 20, between August 2, 1100, and when William Adelin became heir in 1103.\n\nWait, the claim says \"follow by william adelin 20 year later.\" That would mean 20 years after 1100 is 1120. But according to the table, William Adelin became heir in 1103, which is only three years later, not 20. So that part seems incorrect.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there's another instance of William Adelin becoming heir. In row 6, William Adelin is again listed but with a different date. It seems like each occurrence might be referring to different points in time or perhaps confusion in the table structure. But in this case, the key point is that Henry Beauclerc ceased being heir in 1100, and William Adelin became heir later, though not exactly 20 years after.\n\nSo, focusing on whether Henry Beauclerc did indeed cease to be heir on August 2, 1100. Looking at row 4: The 'ceased to be heir' cell is empty or perhaps filled with '2 august 1100'? Let me check the table again.\n\nWait, in the table provided, I see that for row 4 (Henry Beauclerc), the 'ceased to be heir' cell is blank. However, there's another row, row 5, which is about William Adelin becoming heir in 1103. So maybe the claim is trying to say that Henry Beauclerc ceased in 1100 and was succeeded by William Adelin in 1103.\n\nIn that case, the timing isn't exactly 20 years apart but a 23-year gap from 1100 to 1103. So the claim's assertion about the 20-year difference is incorrect. However, the first part of the claim about Henry Beauclerc ceasing in 1100 is correct based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially accurate, but the second part (the 20 years) is not. Since the claim includes an incorrect statement about the timeframe, it's not fully supported. Thus, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc ceased to be heir in 1100 and William Adelin became heir 20 years later. The table confirms Henry Beauclerc did indeed cease in 1100 but shows William Adelin becoming heir in 1103, not 20 years later. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"heir apparent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time , in 1066 and 1087.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for Robert Curthose in the 'heir' column of the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Robert Curthose is listed as the heir.\n- Rows 1, 2, etc., don't seem to mention him again except in row 2, but that's a different context.\n\nWait, actually, looking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Heir is Robert Curthose. Status is 'heir presumptive'. Became heir in 1066.\nRow 2: Heir is Robert Curthose again, but this time as the elder brother. Became heir in 1087.\n\nSo he became heir in both 1066 and 1087, making it two times.\n\nNext, I should check if these are the only instances or if there's any other relevant information that might affect the claim.\n\nLooking at row 0: In 1066, Robert Curthose was the heir presumptive because his father became king. He ceased to be heir in 1077.\nRow 2: In 1087, he became heir again by agreement and then ceased in 1088.\n\nSo yes, he took on the role twice: first in 1066 and again in 1087. No other instances are mentioned where Robert Curthose is an heir besides these two times.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct based on the table data. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be where Robert Curthose is listed as heir for both 1066 and 1087.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning down, I find that Henry Beauclerc is indeed listed as an heir in row number 4 (row_index: 3, since we start from 0).\n\nNext, I'll check the 'relationship to monarch' and 'became heir' columns for this entry. The relationship is noted as \"younger brother,\" which suggests he was a sibling of the monarch. The 'became heir' column shows the year 1088. The reason provided is \"robert 's rebellion.\" This indicates that Henry became heir not necessarily because of his own birth, but due to a political situation after Robert's rebellion against William II.\n\nNow, I'll consider the claim itself. It states that Henry Beauclerc was the only one who became heir due to birth. However, looking at other entries in the 'heir' column:\n\n- Robert Curthose became heir as the son (1066) and later as the elder brother (1087).\n- Succession unclear periods don't indicate a single individual becoming heir by birth.\n- William Adelin was the only son but died young, so he didn't succeed.\n- Empress Matilda was declared heiress presumptive after her brother's death.\n\nNone of these entries suggest that Henry Beauclerc was uniquely the only one who became heir solely due to his own birth.

The claim states that Robert Curthose became heir in 1094 and that this happened a year after Empress Matilda.\n\nLooking at the table, I'm searching for rows where the \"heir\" is Robert Curthose. There are two such rows: row index 0 and row index 2.\n\nIn row 0, under the column \"became heir,\" the value is \"1066.\" The reason given is that his father became king in 1066, so he became heir then. In row 2, Robert Curthose became heir in 1087, with the reason being by agreement, and it ended in 1088 when he ceased to be heir.\n\nNow, checking the claim: the user says Robert became heir in 1094. But according to the table, both entries for Robert show that he became heir much earlier\u20141066 and 1087. Therefore, the claim's assertion about 1094 is incorrect.\n\nNext, looking at Empress Matilda. Her row is index 5, where she was heir presumptive from 1120, declared in 1127, and she became heir upon her brother's death in 1135. The claim mentions \"a year after empress matilda,\" implying that Robert became heir the following year after her, but according to the table, Robert became heir much earlier than Matilda, who was born in 1100.\n\nAdditionally, the table shows that Robert Curthose was an heir during William II's reign, while Empress Matilda became heir later under Henry I. There is no indication that Robert became heir in 1094 related to Empress Matilda's succession.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Robert Curthose didn't become heir in 1094 and there's no evidence connecting his inheritance to a year after Empress Matilda.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Robert Curthose became heir in 1094.

Looking for 'daughter' in the 'relationship to monarch' column.\n\nLooking at each entry:\n\n- Robert Curthose: Son \u2192 Not a daughter.\n- Succession unclear...: No.\n- Elder brother: Brother \u2192 Not a daughter.\n- Younger brother: Brother \u2192 Not a daughter.\n- Only son: Son \u2192 Not a daughter.\n- Heiress presumptive: She is the daughter, but her relationship is to the monarch as a child, not necessarily an heir with a daughter.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"heir have daughter as their relationship to monarch.\" So, looking for heirs whose relationship to the monarch is that they are daughters.\n\nLooking at each 'relationship to monarch' entry:\n\n- Row 0: Son \u2192 Not a daughter.\n- Row 1: No relevant info.\n- Row 2: Elder brother \u2192 Brother, not daughter.\n- Row 3: Younger brother \u2192 Brother.\n- Row 4: Succession unclear.\n- Row 5: Only son \u2192 Son.\n- Row 6: Heiress presumptive, only child. So her relationship is as a daughter.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"heir have daughter...\". So maybe we're looking for heirs who themselves are daughters of the monarch. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the heir being someone who has a daughter in their relationship to the monarch.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about the heir having a daughter as their relationship. Hmm, that might not make sense. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, maybe the 'relationship to monarch' refers to how the heir relates to the monarch. So, if an heir's relationship is that they are a daughter of the monarch, then the claim would be about such heirs having a daughter as part of their role.\n\nBut the table might not have information on whether these heirs themselves have daughters. It only shows their own relationship to the monarch.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider each 'heir' and see if they are daughters, which would mean that the 'relationship to monarch' is as a daughter.\n\nSo let's list all heirs where 'relationship to monarch' indicates they're daughters:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Son\n- Row 1: Succession unclear (probably not)\n- Row 2: Elder brother\n- Row 3: Younger brother\n- Row 4: Succession unclear\n- Row 5: Only son\n- Row 6: Heiress presumptive, only child \u2192 So her relationship is as a daughter.\n\nSo in the table, only Empress Matilda's row indicates she is a daughter of Henry I. So that's one heir who is a daughter.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 3 heirs have daughter...\". But from the table, it seems only Empress Matilda is listed as an heir with a daughter relationship. Unless I'm missing others.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: Robert Curthose: Son\n- Row 1: Succession unclear\n- Row 2: Robert again: Elder brother\n- Row 3: Henry Beauclerc: Younger brother\n- Row 4: Succession unclear\n- Row 5: William Adelin: Only son\n- Row 6: Matilda: Heiress presumptive, only child (so daughter)\n\nSo that's one heir who is a daughter. Are there others?\n\nWait, perhaps in the earlier rows, when succession was unclear, maybe they were daughters? But I don't think so; it's more about the status.\n\nAlternatively, if 'heir' refers to someone who could be female and thus have a daughter, but that's not directly indicated here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe the claim is saying that only three heirs have a daughter as part of their relationship to the monarch. But in the table, looking at each heir:\n\n- Robert Curthose: Son \u2192 No.\n- Succession unclear...: Not applicable.\n- Elder brother: Brother \u2192 No.\n- Younger brother: Brother \u2192 No.\n- Only son: Son \u2192 No.\n- Heiress presumptive: Daughter \u2192 Yes.\n\nSo only one such heir. So the claim that \"only three\" would be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I misread some rows. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's 'relationship to monarch':\n\n1. Robert Curthose: Son\n2. Succession unclear...: Not applicable.\n3. Robert again: Elder brother\n4. Henry Beauclerc: Younger brother\n5. Succession unclear...: Not applicable.\n6. William Adelin: Only son\n7. Empress Matilda: Heiress presumptive, only child \u2192 Daughter.\n\nSo only one heir who is a daughter. Therefore, the claim that \"only three heirs have daughter as their relationship...\" would be incorrect because there's only one.\n\nWait, but maybe in the table, 'heir' refers to someone who could be either male or female, and if they are a daughter, then they can have daughters themselves. But I think the question is about the heir having a daughter as part of their role, which might not directly tie here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the heirs themselves being daughters (i.e., female), which would be only Empress Matilda in the table. So again, one.\n\nBut the claim says \"only three\". So either I'm missing something or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the original task: The user wrote:\n\n\"You are tasked with determining whether the statement is true based on the given data.\"\n\nSo perhaps I need to count how many times 'daughter' appears in the 'relationship to monarch' column. From the table provided, it seems only once.\n\nBut maybe the data includes more heirs where their relationship is daughter. Wait, let me check again.\n\nThe table as per user's message:\n\n| heir | ... | relationship to monarch |\n|------|-----|-------------------------|\n| Robert Curthose | ... | Son                    |\n| [Succession unclear] | ... | Succession unclear       |\n| Robert Curthose | ... | Elder brother            |\n| Henry Beauclerc | ... | Younger brother          |\n| [Succession unclear] | ... | Succession unclear       |\n| William Adelin | ... | Only son                 |\n| Empress Matilda | ... | Heiress presumptive, only child |\n\nSo in the 'relationship to monarch' column, the only entry where it's a daughter is for Empress Matilda. So that's one.\n\nThus, if the statement says \"only three heirs have daughter as their relationship...\", then it's false because there's only one.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread other rows. Let me check again:\n\n- First Robert Curthose: Son\n- Second row: Succession unclear \u2192 Not applicable\n- Third row: Elder brother\n- Fourth: Younger brother\n- Fifth: Succession unclear\n- Sixth: Only son\n- Seventh: Daughter.\n\nSo yes, only one. So the statement is false.\n\nBut the user says \"you are tasked with determining whether the statement is true based on the given data.\" So if the statement claims only three heirs have daughter as their relationship to the monarch, but in reality, it's only one, then the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is false. Based on the provided data, only Empress Matilda has a 'daughter' listed in her relationship to the monarch. Therefore, the claim that \"only three heirs\" have a daughter as their relationship is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because there is only one heir (Empress Matilda) whose relationship to the monarch is described as a daughter.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time , in 1082 and 1094\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It says Robert Curthose was an heir twice: once in 1082 and again in 1094. So, I need to check if there are two separate instances where Robert Curthose became an heir for each of these years.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"heir,\" \"became heir,\" and \"monarch.\" Each row represents a different instance of someone becoming an heir.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about Robert Curthose as heir presumptive in 1066 under William I. This doesn't mention 1082 or 1094, so it's not relevant.\n\n2. The second row talks about succession uncertainty from 1077-1087 under William I. Not directly about Robert Curthose in those years, but he is mentioned later.\n\n3. The third row again mentions Robert Curthose as heir presumptive in 1087 under William II. Wait, the claim says 1082 and 1094. So this seems off because it's in 1087, not 1082. Hmm, maybe a typo or I'm missing something. Let me check.\n\nWait, no. The third row is from 1087, but the claim mentions 1082. There's a possibility that there was another instance where Robert Curthose became heir around 1082. But looking at the table, the first occurrence of Robert Curthose is in 1066 (row 0), and then again in 1087 (row 2). So between 1066 and 1087, was there a 1082? The table doesn't show any row with \"robert curthose\" as heir in 1082.\n\nThe fourth row is about Henry Beauclerc in 1088 under William II. Not relevant to Robert.\n\nFifth row is about succession uncertainty from 1100-1103 under Henry I, so that's later and not our focus.\n\nSixth row mentions William Adelin in 1103 under Henry I.\n\nSeventh row about Empress Matilda, which is a female, so not Robert.\n\nWait, but the claim says Robert Curthose was heir twice: in 1082 and 1094. According to the table, Robert was heir in 1066 (row 0) and then again in 1087 (row 2). So he became heir in 1066 and again in 1087. The claim mentions 1082 and 1094, which don't align with these dates.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\nRow 0: Robert Curthose became heir in 1066 under William I.\n\nRow 1: Succession unclear from 1077-1087, not directly about Robert.\n\nRow 2: Robert Curthose becomes heir presumptive in 1087 under William II. So that's the second time as heir in 1087, not 1082 or 1094.\n\nSo the claim says he became heir in 1082 and 1094. The table shows 1066 and 1087. There is a discrepancy here because 1082 isn't listed for Robert. However, the claim might be referring to two instances: once when he was the presumptive heir and another time.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time , in 1082 and 1094.\" So perhaps it's implying that he became heir in both those years.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- Robert Curthose is in row 0 (1066) and row 2 (1087). The claim mentions 1082, which isn't present. However, row 2 says he became heir in 1087. So there's no 1082 entry for him.\n\nAdditionally, the claim also mentions 1094. Checking the table, I don't see any row where Robert Curthose becomes heir in 1094. The last relevant rows are about Empress Matilda in 1120 and 1135 under Henry I, which doesn't relate to Robert.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because the table shows Robert as heir in 1066 and 1087, not in 1082 or 1094. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Robert Curthose was heir twice in 1082 and 1094, but according to the table, he became heir in 1066 and again in 1087. There is no record of him becoming heir in either 1082 or 1094.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir presumptive\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
