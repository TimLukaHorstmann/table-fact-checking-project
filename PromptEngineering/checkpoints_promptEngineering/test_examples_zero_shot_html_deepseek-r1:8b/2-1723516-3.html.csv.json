    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a tennis match is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"clay be not the surface of the court in the match with a score of 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing. The user is probably trying to say that clay was not the surface for a specific match where the score was 4-6, 6-4, 3-6. So I need to find in the table if there's a match with this exact score on a non-clay court.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: outcome, year, tournament, surface, partner, opponents, and score. Each row represents a different match with details filled in those columns.\n\nMy task is to check each condition in the claim against the table. The relevant cells would be where the score matches 4-6, 6-4, 3-6 and the surface isn't clay.\n\nSo, I should go through each row of the table and look for the score \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6.\" If such a row exists, then check what the surface was. If it's not clay, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me scan each row:\n\n1. The first row has a score of 5-7, 7-6, 6-2 \u2013 not matching.\n2. Second: 4-6, 6-3, 1-6 \u2013 no.\n3. Third: 4-6, 6-7 \u2013 doesn't include the third set score, so not a full match? Or maybe incomplete data. Maybe this isn't the right one.\n4. Fourth: 1-6, 5-7 \u2013 only two sets.\n5. Fifth: 7-6, 3-6, 2-6 \u2013 not matching.\n6. Sixth: 6-1, 7-6 \u2013 only two sets.\n7. Seventh: 6-7, 4-6 \u2013 again, incomplete.\n8. Eighth: 4-6, 6-4, 3-6 \u2013 here's the score! Now check the surface. The surface for this row is clay? Wait, let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the eighth row: outcome is runner-up, year 1999, tournament Canada, surface hard. Oh, wait, the surface is \"hard,\" not clay. So in this match, the surface was hard, and the score is exactly 4-6, 6-4, 3-6.\n\nThe claim says that clay was not the surface in the match with that specific score. Since this match has a score of 4-6, 6-4, 3-6 and the surface is hard (not clay), the claim should be TRUE.\n\nSo, I need to find the relevant cells. The relevant cells would be the row where the score matches exactly and the surface is checked. So for that specific row (row_index 8, since counting starts at 0, so it's actually row 7 if we start from 0), columns \"score\" and \"surface.\"\n\nWait, no, the row indices are 0-based. Let me count again:\n\nRow 0: score 5-7,7-6,6-2\nRow 1: 4-6,6-3,1-6\nRow 2: 4-6,6-7 (no third set)\nRow 3: 1-6,5-7\nRow 4: 7-6,3-6,2-6\nRow 5: 6-1,7-6\nRow 6:6-7,4-6\nRow 7:4-6,6-4,3-6 \u2013 this is the eighth row in the table, which would be row_index 7.\nColumns involved are \"score\" and \"surface.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 7 (row_index: 7)\n  - column_name: \"score\"\n  - value: \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\"\n- Row 7\n  - column_name: \"surface\"\n  - value: \"hard\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row 7 for both columns. That makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since in that match, clay was not the surface (it's hard), the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a specific match where the score matches and the surface is not clay. The relevant cells are identified as such.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim about a tennis match is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"clay be the surface of the court in the match with a score of 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three specific things:\n\n1. The surface is clay.\n2. There's a match with a specific score: 4-6, 6-4, 3-6.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to find a row in the table that matches both the surface being clay and has the exact score mentioned.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. Each row has several columns:\n\n- outcome\n- year\n- tournament\n- surface\n- partner\n- opponents\n- score\n\nI'll go through each row to check for a match where the surface is clay and the score is 4-6, 6-4, 3-6.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. First row: surface is hard. Score doesn't match.\n2. Second row: surface is clay. Let's check the score here: \"4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6\". Doesn't match.\n3. Third row: same as second, but opponents are different. Surface is clay again, but score is \"4 - 6 , 6 - 7\", not matching.\n4. Fourth row: surface is clay. Score is \"1 - 6 , 5 - 7\" \u2013 no match.\n5. Fifth row: surface is hard. Not matching.\n6. Sixth row: surface is clay, but score is \"6 - 1 , 7 - 6\". Doesn't match.\n7. Seventh row: surface is hard. No.\n8. Eighth row: surface is clay. Let's check the score: it's \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\" \u2013 yes, that matches both conditions.\n\nSo, there is a match in row 8 (assuming rows are zero-indexed or not). Wait, looking back, the rows start from 0. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: winner, 1991, miami, hard\n- Row 1: runner-up, 1992, rome, clay\n- Row 2: runner-up, 1993, rome, clay\n- Row 3: runner-up, 1994, rome, clay\n- Row 4: runner-up, 1994, cincinnati, hard\n- Row 5: winner, 1995, hamburg, clay\n- Row 6: runner-up, 1999, canada, hard\n- Row 7: runner-up, 2000, rome, clay\n- Row 8: winner, 2000, monte carlo, clay\n- Row 9: winner, 2001, rome, clay\n- Row 10: winner, 2003, indian wells, hard\n\nSo, the row with surface \"clay\" and score \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\" is row 7? Let's check row 7:\n\nLooking at row 7 (row_index=7): tournament is rome, surface clay. Score is \"6 - 4 , 7 - 6\". No, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through each row again carefully.\n\nRow 0: surface hard\nRow 1: surface clay, score 4-6, 6-3, 1-6 \u2192 not matching\nRow 2: surface clay, score 4-6, 6-7 \u2192 no\nRow 3: surface clay, score 1-6,5-7 \u2192 no\nRow 4: hard, so skip\nRow 5: surface clay, but score is 6-1,7-6 \u2192 no\nRow 6: hard, skip\nRow 7: surface clay. Score is \"6 - 4 , 7 - 6\" \u2192 nope\nRow 8: winner, 2000, monte carlo, clay. Score is 6-4,7-6? No, wait the claim's score is 4-6,6-4,3-6.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed row 9? Let me check again.\n\nWait no, the table has rows from 0 to 12, I think. Wait let me count:\n\nLooking at the table provided in the question, the tbody has multiple <tr> elements. Let me try to list them with their indices and details.\n\nRow 0:\n- outcome: winner\n- year: 1991\n- tournament: miami\n- surface: hard\n- partner: (not shown)\n- opponents: (not shown)\n- score: 6-3,7-5\n\nWait no, in the table provided, it's:\n\nLooking at the initial HTML table, each row is a match. The first few rows are:\n\n1. 1991, miami, hard, ... score not given? Wait wait, actually in the table, the 'score' column has data like \"3 - 6 , 7 - 5\" etc.\n\nWait, let me re-express each row with their indices and details.\n\nRow 0 (first row):\n- outcome: winner\n- year: 1991\n- tournament: miami\n- surface: hard\n- partner: not provided here; but in the table it's under 'partner' column.\n- opponents: same as above.\n- score: \"3 - 6 , 7 - 5\"\n\nRow 1:\n- outcome: runner-up\n- year: 1992\n- tournament: rome\n- surface: clay\n- partner: not provided here; in the table it's under 'partner' column.\n- opponents: same.\n- score: \"4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6\"\n\nRow 2:\n- outcome: runner-up\n- year: 1993\n- tournament: rome\n- surface: clay\n- partners and opponents not shown here, but in the table.\n- score: \"4 - 6 , 6 - 7\" (wait, no, looking at the table, row 2's score is \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\". Wait, maybe I misread earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse each row correctly. Let me list all rows with their details as per the table:\n\nHere's the table structure:\n\n| outcome | year | tournament | surface | partner | opponents | score |\n|---------|------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|\n| winner  | 1991 | miami       | hard    |         |           | 3-6,7-5  |\n| runner-up | 1992 | rome        | clay    |         |           |4-6,6-3,1-6|\n| runner-up | 1993 | rome        | clay    |         |           |4-6,6-4,3-6|\nWait no, let me check the exact scores from the table.\n\nLooking at the table as provided:\n\nFirst row: score is \"3 - 6 , 7 - 5\"\n\nSecond row: \"4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6\"\n\nThird row: \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\"\n\nFourth row: \"1 - 6 , 5 - 7\"\n\nFifth row: ?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all rows with their indices and data:\n\nRow 0:\n- outcome: winner\n- year: 1991\n- tournament: miami\n- surface: hard\n- score: 3-6,7-5\n\nRow 1:\n- outcome: runner-up\n- year: 1992\n- tournament: rome\n- surface: clay\n- score:4-6,6-3,1-6\n\nRow 2:\n- outcome: runner-up\n- year: 1993\n- tournament: rome\n- surface: clay\n- score:4-6,6-4,3-6\n\nRow 3:\n- outcome: ?\n- year: 1994?\nWait no, maybe it's better to go step by step.\n\nLooking at the table in the question:\n\nThe table starts with:\n\n| outcome | year | tournament | surface | partner | opponents | score |\n|---------|------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|\n| winner  | 1991 | miami       | hard    |         |           |3-6,7-5  |\n| runner-up | 1992 | rome        | clay    |         |           |4-6,6-3,1-6|\n| runner-up | 1993 | rome        | clay    |         |           |4-6,6-4,3-6|\n| ... and so on.\n\nWait no, perhaps the initial rows are:\n\nLooking at the HTML in the question: It starts with:\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>winner</td><td>1991</td><td>miami</td><td>hard</td><td></td><td></td><td>3-6,7-5</td></tr>\n<tr><td>runner-up</td><td>1992</td><td>rome</td><td>clay</td><td></td><td></td><td>4-6,6-3,1-6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>runner-up</td><td>1993</td><td>rome</td><td>clay</td><td></td><td></td><td>4-6,6-4,3-6</td></tr>\n... and so on.\n\nSo for Row 0 (index 0):\nsurface: hard\nscore: 3-6,7-5\n\nRow 1 (index 1):\nsurface: clay\nscore: 4-6,6-3,1-6\n\nRow 2 (index 2):\nsurface: clay\nscore:4-6,6-4,3-6 \u2192 This matches the claim's score.\n\nSo in row 2, surface is clay and score is exactly \"4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6\".\n\nTherefore, the match where player won runner-up had tournament rome, surface clay, and that particular score. So this would be the correct row.\n\nThus, to answer the question: The task is to identify which of the provided matches has the same surface (clay) and the exact score of \"4-6,6-4,3-6\". From the table, that's row 2 (row index 2).\n\nTherefore, the required data is:\n\noutcome: runner-up\nyear: 1993\ntournament: rome\nsurface: clay\npartner: not provided in the table\nopponents: not provided in the table\nscore:4-6,6-4,3-6\n\nBut wait, the question isn't explicitly asking for outcome, etc., but perhaps just confirming whether a match exists with those conditions. Alternatively, if it's asking to find the match where player X had these stats, but as per current task description, I think the answer is that row 2 (index 2) has surface clay and score matching.\n</think>\n\nThe match in question is the one played in 1993 at the Rome tournament on a clay court with a score of \"4-6,6-4,3-6\".\n\nAnswer:\nThe match is the 1993 Rome tournament runner-up match on clay, resulting in a score of 4-6,6-4,3-6.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Surface: Clay; Score: 4-6, 6-4, 3-6}}$",
