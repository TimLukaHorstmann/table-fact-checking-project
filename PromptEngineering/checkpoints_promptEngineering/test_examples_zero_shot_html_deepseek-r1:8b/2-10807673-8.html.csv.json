    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"On 21 June 1941, the crowd was 5000 for 2 matches during the 1941 VFL season.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'date' column in the table to see if there are any matches on 21 June 1941. Scanning through each row's date, I notice that every row has \"21 june 1941\" as the date. So all six matches were played on that day.\n\nNext, the claim mentions a crowd of 5000 for two matches. Looking at the 'crowd' column, I see varying numbers: 6000, 2000, 4000, 5000, and 5000. The maximum crowd was 6000, but some matches had 5000 attendees.\n\nNow, focusing on which matches might have had 5000 people. In the table, two teams (South Melbourne vs North Melbourne) and Geelong vs Footscray both have a crowd of 5000. So there are indeed two matches with exactly 5000 attendees on that date.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"the crowd was 5000 for 2 match,\" which is a bit unclear if it means exactly 5000 or at least 5000. Since the table shows exactly 5000 for those two matches, the claim holds true based on those specific games.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the rows where crowd is 5000, which are row indexes 4 and 5 (since indexing starts from 0). The columns involved are 'crowd'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that \"south melbourne outscore north melbourne by 22 points on 21 june 1941.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nSince the claim is about scoring between two teams, the relevant columns should be 'home team score' and 'away team score'. I need to find the row where south melbourne is the home team and north melbourne is the away team. That way, I can compare their scores.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n1. The first row is about richmond as the home team against st kilda.\n2. The second row is hawthorn vs melbourne.\n3. Third is collingwood vs essendon.\n4. Fourth row: carlton vs fitzroy.\n5. Fifth row: south melbourne (home) vs north melbourne (away).\n6. Sixth row: geelong vs footscray.\n\nSo the fifth row is where south melbourne and north melbourne play each other. Now, checking their scores:\n\nSouth Melbourne's score is 8.16 (64) and North Melbourne scored 6.6 (42). \n\nTo find out by how much south melbourne outscored, I need to subtract north melbourne's total from south melbourne's total.\n\nCalculating the scores:\n- South Melbourne: 8 goals and 16 behinds. In Australian rules, a goal is worth 6 points and a behind is worth 1 point. So 8 goals = 48 points, plus 16 behinds = 16 points. Total is 64 points.\n- North Melbourne: 6 goals and 6 behinds. That's 6*6 + 6*1 = 36 + 6 = 42 points.\n\nThe difference is 64 - 42 = 22 points. So south melbourne indeed outscored north melbourne by 22 points.\n\nAlso, the date in that row is 21 june 1941, which matches the claim's date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim states: \"the total score for the home team in 6 matches be 396.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has a column called \"home team\" and another called \"home team score.\" So, these are the two columns that matter here.\n\nNext, I need to go through each row of the table to extract the home team scores. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Richmond: 10.13 (73)\n2. Hawthorn: 6.8 (44)\n3. Collingwood: 8.12 (60)\n4. Carlton: 10.17 (77)\n5. South Melbourne: 8.16 (64)\n6. Geelong: 10.18 (78)\n\nWait, that's six home teams, which matches the claim's \"6 match.\" Now, I need to sum up their scores.\n\nAdding them step by step:\n\n- Richmond: 73\n- Hawthorn: 44 \u2192 Total so far: 73 + 44 = 117\n- Collingwood: 60 \u2192 Total: 117 + 60 = 177\n- Carlton: 77 \u2192 Total: 177 + 77 = 254\n- South Melbourne: 64 \u2192 Total: 254 + 64 = 318\n- Geelong: 78 \u2192 Final total: 318 + 78 = 396\n\nYes, the total adds up to exactly 396. So the claim is true.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. Each row has a home team and their score, so both columns are involved. There are six rows, so each row's \"home team score\" column is relevant. Also, each row's \"row_index\" corresponds to which match it is, but since the claim just refers to 6 matches in general, all six rows' scores are needed.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the \"home team score\" for each of the six rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The specific claim I'm evaluating is: \"the venue be different in all 6 match in the 1941 vfl season.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that every single match played in the 1941 VFL season had a unique venue; no two matches were held at the same location. So my job is to check each of these six matches and see if all venues are distinct.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different match. The relevant column here is \"venue.\" My plan is to list out all the venues from each row and then check for duplicates.\n\nLet me extract the venue names:\n\n1. Punt Road Oval\n2. Glenferrie Oval\n3. Victoria Park\n4. Princes Park\n5. Lake Oval\n6. Kardinia Park\n\nNow, I'll compare these to see if any are repeated.

It has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows, each representing a different match.\n\nThe claim is specifically about footscray being the away team that scored the most points, which is 93 in all six matches. So I need to check if footscray appears as an away team in each of the six matches and their score is 93 each time.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n1. First row: away team is st kilda with a score of 6.11 (47). Not footscray.\n2. Second row: away team is melbourne, score 12.12 (84). Not footscray.\n3. Third row: away team is essendon, score 7.10 (52). No match.\n4. Fourth row: away team is fitzroy with a score of 12.13 (85). Still not footscray.\n5. Fifth row: away team is north melbourne, score 6.6 (42). Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: away team is footscray with a score of 13.15 (93). This matches the claim for one match.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"in all 6 match,\" which implies that footscray was the away team in each of the six matches and scored 93 each time. But looking at the table, footscray is only listed once as the away team, on the sixth row. The other rows don't have footscray as an away team.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because footscray wasn't the away team in all six matches; they were only in one match. Also, their score was 93 only once.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"footscray while playing as the away team scored the most points (93) in all 6 matches,\" we need to check each of the six rows for footscray's presence as the away team and their corresponding scores.\n\n- **Check each row:**\n  - Row 0: Away team is st kilda. Not footscray.\n  - Row 1: Away team is melbourne. Not footscray.\n  - Row 2: Away team is essendon. Not footscray.\n  - Row 3: Away team is fitzroy. Not footscray.\n  - Row 4: Away team is north melbourne. Not footscray.\n  - Row 5: Away team is footscray with a score of 13.15 (93).\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  Footscray only appears once as the away team in row 5, scoring 93 points that match.

The claim says: \"On 21 June 1941, the crowd was 5000 for three matches during the 1941 VFL season.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant columns in the table. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim mentions the date \"21 June 1941,\" so I'll focus on that row.\n\nLooking through each row in the tbody, I see that all matches were played on \"21 june 1941.\" So, there are six rows, each representing a different match between two teams. \n\nNow, checking for the crowd numbers: \n\n- First row (row index 0): crowd is 6000\n- Second row (index 1): 2000\n- Third row (2): 6000\n- Fourth row (3): 4000\n- Fifth row (4): 5000\n- Sixth row (5): 5000\n\nThe claim says the crowd was 5000 for three matches.

The claim says three matches had a crowd of 5000. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there are only two matches where the crowd was 5000.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all six matches were part of the same season and day.

Each row represents a match.\n\nThe claim is about Fitzroy playing as the away team and scoring the most points (93) in all 6 matches. So I need to find the rows where Fitzroy is the away team and check their scores.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. First row: Richmond vs. St Kilda. Fitzroy isn't here.\n2. Second row: Hawthorn vs. Melbourne. No Fitzroy.\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs. Essendon. Not Fitzroy.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs. Fitzroy. Here, Fitzroy is the away team with a score of 10.17 (77). That's not 93.\n5. Fifth row: South Melbourne vs. North Melbourne. No Fitzroy.\n6. Sixth row: Geelong vs. Footscray. No Fitzroy.\n\nWait, in the fourth row, Fitzroy is the away team but their score is 77. The claim says they scored 93 as the highest. But looking at all the away scores:\n\n- St Kilda: 47\n- Melbourne: 84\n- Essendon: 52\n- Fitzroy: 77\n- North Melbourne: 42\n- Footscray: 93\n\nWait, in the sixth row, Footscray is the away team with a score of 13.15 (93). So it's Footscray, not Fitzroy, that scored 93.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because Fitzroy didn't score 93 as an away team. Instead, Footscray did. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the 1941 VFL season is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the venue be the same for 3 matches and different for the other 3 in the 1941 VFL season.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It lists several matches with details like home team, scores, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The date for all these matches is \"21 june 1941,\" so they are all from that season.\n\nThe key here is to check how many unique venues there are in the table. If three matches were at one venue and the remaining three at different ones, then the claim holds true.\n\nLooking at the 'venue' column:\n\n- The first match is at Punt Road Oval.\n- The second is at Glenferrie Oval.\n- The third is at Victoria Park.\n- The fourth is at Princes Park.\n- The fifth is at Lake Oval.\n- The sixth is at Kardinia Park.\n\nWait, that's six matches. But the claim mentions three same venues and three different ones. However, in the table, each venue seems to be unique for each match except... Let me recount:\n\n1. Punt Road Oval\n2. Glenferrie Oval\n3. Victoria Park\n4. Princes Park\n5. Lake Oval\n6. Kardinia Park\n\nSo that's six different venues. But the claim says three same and three different. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is that three matches were at the same venue, and the other three were at different ones. So perhaps one venue hosts three matches, and each of the remaining three matches are at separate unique venues.\n\nLooking again:\n\nEach match in the table has a different venue. There's no repetition of venue here. That would mean all six matches took place at six different venues. Therefore, there isn't a single venue hosting three matches as per the claim.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because there are six unique venues, not one with three and others with three different each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 1941 VFL season, three matches were held at the same venue and the other three at different venues. However, examining the table reveals all matches occurred at distinct venues (Punt Road Oval, Glenferrie Oval, Victoria Park, Princes Park, Lake Oval, Kardinia Park), each hosting one match. Thus, there's no venue with three matches as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
