    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Bobby Hull scoring the most playoff goals among all Chicago Blackhawks players is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"Bobby Hull have score the most playoff goal of all chicago blackhawk player.\" The key points here are that the claim is about Bobby Hull having the highest number of playoff goals compared to other Blackhawks players.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several players with their names, years, regular season stats, playoff stats, and total career stats. Each row represents a different player. My task is to check whether Bobby Hull's playoff goal count is higher than all others listed in the table.\n\nFrom the table, I can see that there are multiple players mentioned, including Bobby Hull. Let me locate Bobby Hull in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find him as the first entry:\n\n- Name: Bobby Hull\n- Years: 1957 - 1972\n- Regular Season: 604\n- Playoffs: 62\n- Total: 666\n\nSo his playoff goals are listed as 62.\n\nNext, I need to check if any other players in the table have a higher number of playoff goals than Bobby Hull. Let's go through each player one by one:\n\n1. **Stan Mikita**: Playoffs = 59\n2. **Steve Larmer**: Playoffs = 45\n3. **Denis Savard**: Playoffs = 61\n4. **Dennis Hull**: Playoffs = 33\n5. **Jeremy Roenick**: Playoffs = 35\n6. **Tony Amonte**: Playoffs = 13\n7. **Hubert Pit Martin**: Playoffs = 26\n8. **Bill Mosienko**: Playoffs = 10\n9. **Ken Wharram**: Playoffs = 16\n\nComparing each of these to Bobby Hull's 62, none of them reach or exceed that number. The highest among the others is Stan Mikita with 59 and Denis Savard with 61, but both are still below Bobby Hull's 62.\n\nWait a second\u2014Denis Savard has 61 playoff goals, which is just one less than Bobby Hull's 62. That's quite close. I need to make sure there isn't any other player in the table who might have higher numbers. Let me double-check:\n\n- Is there another row beyond what's shown? The table has nine rows in total. Bobby Hull is first, and Denis Savard is fourth. So yes, among all listed players, Bobby Hull's 62 is the highest.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data provided, Bobby Hull does have the most playoff goals compared to all the other Chicago Blackhawks players listed. No other player in the table has a higher number than 62 in the playoffs column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether Bobby Hull indeed has the most playoff goals among all listed Chicago Blackhawks players, we need to compare his playoff goal count with others. According to the table:\n\n- **Bobby Hull**: Playoffs = 62\n- **Denis Savard**: Playoffs = 61 (closest to Bobby's total)\n\nOther players have lower numbers, confirming that Bobby Hull has the highest playoff goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"bill mosienko have score the fewest number of postseason goal\". \n\nFirst, I should locate Bill Mosienko in the table. Scanning through each row's 'name' column, I see that Bill Mosienko is listed in row 8 (since it's a zero-based index or maybe one-based depending on how we count). Let me confirm: looking at the table, yes, Bill Mosienko is in the 9th row when counting from top, which would be row_index 8.\n\nNext, I need to check his postseason goals. The relevant column for this claim is \"playoffs\". Looking at the data, Bill Mosienko has 10 playoff goals. Now, the claim says he has the fewest number of postseason goals. To verify this, I should check all other players' playoff goal numbers.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nNow, counting the playoff goals:\n\nThe lowest is Bill Mosienko with 10. Next is Hubert Pit Martin at 26, then Steve Larmer's 45, but no, wait, Steve Larmer has 45, which is higher. Let me list them in order from lowest to highest:\n\n1. Bill Mosienko: 10\n2. Tony Amonte:13\n3. Jeremy Roenick:35\n4. Hubert Pit Martin:26\n5. Dennis Hull:33\n6. Ken Wharram:16\n7. Steve Larmer:45\n8. Denis Savard:61\n9. Stan Mikita:59\n10. Bobby Hull:62\n\nSo Bill Mosienko indeed has the fewest with 10.\n\nNow, I need to check if the claim refers to this correctly. The claim says \"fewest number of postseason goal\". Looking at the table, the 'playoffs' column shows the exact numbers, so yes, 10 is correct for Bill Mosienko.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true, and the relevant cells are in row_index 8 (Bill Mosienko's row) under the 'playoffs' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 398 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Hmm, first, let me understand what the claim means. It seems like it's saying that there are 398 goals separating the highest scorer and the lowest scorer in terms of total goals. So I need to check if this difference exists in the 'total' column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'total' column which represents the total number of goals scored by each player. My task is to identify the maximum value in the 'total' column and subtract it by the minimum value to see if that difference equals 398.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row's 'total' to find the highest and lowest values. Let me list them out:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nSo the highest total is 666 by Bobby Hull, and the lowest is 268 shared by Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram. The difference between the highest (666) and the lowest (268) is 666 - 268 = 398. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the total goals separation is indeed 398.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking through the 'name' column, I find Bill Mosienko in row 8. His total goals are listed under the 'total' column, which is 268.\n\nNext, I'll look for Ken Wharram's information. He's also in the 'name' column, specifically in row 9.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and HTML structure. The claim says, \"in the regular season, only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at what each column represents. The table has columns for name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The relevant part here is the 'regular season' column because that's where we're focusing.\n\nSo, I need to check how many players have a score over 300 in their regular season. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 604 goals. That's way more than 300.\n2. Stan Mikita: 541 goals. Also above 300.\n3. Steve Larmer: 406. Yeah, that's over 300 too.\n4. Denis Savard: 377. Still above 300.\n5. Dennis Hull: 298. Hmm, just below 300 because 298 is less than 300.\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 267. That's below 300.\n7. Tony Amonte: 268. Also below 300.\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 243. Below as well.\n9. Bill Mosienko: 258. Still under 300.\n10. Ken Wharram: 252. Below.\n\nNow, let me count how many have over 300. The first four players (Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, Steve Larmer, Denis Savard) all have scores above 300. That makes four players. Dennis Hull is at 298, which is just under, so he doesn't count.\n\nSo the claim says only four players scored more than 300 in the regular season. From my analysis, that's correct\u2014four players: Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, Steve Larmer, Denis Savard. The rest have scores below 300.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Bobby Hull is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Bobby Hull has scored the least playoff goal of all Chicago Blackhawks players.\" So, I'm looking for information about Bobby Hull's playoff goals and compare them to others in the Blackhawks team.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a player, their years, regular season stats, playoff stats, and total. The relevant column here is \"playoffs\" because the claim is about playoff goals.\n\nI see that Bobby Hull is listed as the first row (row_index: 0) with his playoff goals being 62. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the least among all Blackhawks players in the table.\n\nLet me go through each player's playoff goals:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62\n2. Stan Mikita: 59\n3. Steve Larmer: 45\n4. Denis Savard: 61\n5. Dennis Hull: 33\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 35\n7. Tony Amonte: 13\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n9. Bill Mosienko: 10\n10. Ken Wharram: 16\n\nNow, let's list these numbers to see the order:\n\n- Bill Mosienko: 10 (lowest)\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n\nSo, the order from least to greatest is:\n\n1. Bill Mosienko (10)\n2. Tony Amonte (13)\n3. Ken Wharram (16)\n4. Hubert Pit Martin (26)\n5. Jeremy Roenick (35)\n6. Dennis Hull (33)\n7. Steve Larmer (45)\n8. Denis Savard (61)\n9. Stan Mikita (59)\n10. Bobby Hull (62)\n\nWait, that's not correct because 33 is less than 35 but greater than 26 and 13. So actually, the order should be:\n\nAfter Bill Mosienko (10) and Tony Amonte (13), comes Ken Wharram (16), then Hubert Pit Martin (26). After that, Jeremy Roenick at 35, Dennis Hull at 33, Steve Larmer at 45, Denis Savard at 61, Stan Mikita at 59, and Bobby Hull at 62.\n\nSo, the lowest is Bill Mosienko with 10, then Tony Amonte with 13, etc. The second-lowest is Ken Wharram with 16, and so on.\n\nThe claim says Bobby Hull has the least playoff goals. But looking at the data, Bobby Hull actually has the highest playoff goals (62) among those listed. The lowest is Bill Mosienko with 10, then Tony Amonte with 13, and others follow. So Bobby Hull's 62 isn't the least; it's the most in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Let me double-check: \"Bobby hull have score the least playoff goal of all chicago blackhawk player.\" So the claim is that Bobby has the least. But from the table, he actually has the highest among those listed here. The lowest are Bill Mosienko and Tony Amonte.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Bobby Hull does not have the least playoff goals; others do. So the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would include all the players with lower playoff goals than Bobby to show that his 62 isn't the least.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Bobby Hull's playoff goals are not the least among all Chicago Blackhawks players listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"Bill Mosienko has scored the most number of postseason goal with 33 goals.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. Each row represents a different player.\n\nI should focus on Bill Mosienko's row. Let me find his entry in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see \"bill mosienko\" is the 9th row. So his row index is 8 because it's zero-indexed, but I need to confirm that.\n\nLooking at his data: regular season is 258 goals, playoff is 10 goals, and total is 268. The claim mentions \"postseason goal with 33 goals.\" Wait a second, in the table, under the 'playoffs' column for Bill Mosienko, it's 10. That doesn't match the 33 mentioned in the claim.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"postseason.\" In hockey, playoffs are often referred to as the postseason. So if the claim is saying he scored 33 goals in the playoffs, but according to the table, he only scored 10, that would make the claim false.\n\nI should check other players' playoff numbers to ensure I'm not missing anything. For example, Bobby Hull has 62 playoff goals, Steve Larmer 45, Denis Savard 61, Dennis Hull 33, Jeremy Roenick 35, Tony Amonte 13, Hubert Pit Martin 26, and Ken Wharram 16. None of these have more than, say, 61 or so, but Bill Mosienko is way behind with only 10.\n\nSo the claim's number, 33, doesn't align with the data. In fact, Dennis Hull has 33 playoff goals, which might be a common name confusion, but since the table clearly states Bill Mosienko has 10, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" The relevant cells are Bill Mosienko's row and specifically the 'playoffs' column to check his goal count.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about Bill Mosienko scoring 33 postseason goals is true, we need to verify his playoff goals in the table. \n\n1. **Identify Bill Mosienko's Row**: He is found in row index 8 (0-based) under \"bill mosienko\".\n2. **Check Playoffs Column**: His value is 10, not 33.\n\nSince the claimed number of goals doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"there be only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim is saying. It's about goals separated by a specific number of points, which in sports like hockey, points are scored as goals and assists, with each goal contributing to the total points. So, the term \"goals\" here probably refers to points.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various players with their names, years, regular season games, playoff games, and total games. The columns related to scoring would likely be the \"regular season\" and \"playoffs,\" but the key figure seems to be the total games each player has played, which is under the \"total\" column.\n\nThe claim mentions \"only 20 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer.\" So I need to check if the difference between the highest total games and the lowest total games in the table is exactly 20. If that's true, then the claim holds; otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow, looking at the \"total\" column:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nFirst, I'll identify the highest and lowest totals. The highest is Bobby Hull with 666 games. The lowest seems to be either Denis Savard or Hubert Pit Martin or Bill Mosienko or Ken Wharram. Looking closely:\n\nDenis Savard's total is 438.\nHubert Pit Martin: 269\nBill Mosienko: 268\nKen Wharram: 268\n\nSo the lowest is 268, but there are two players with that number. However, since we're looking for a difference between the highest and the lowest, it's between 666 and 268.\n\nCalculating the difference: 666 - 268 = 398. That's way more than 20. Therefore, the claim is false because the separation isn't just 20 goals; it's much larger.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"goals\" here. If \"goals\" refer to points, then total games might not be directly equivalent. However, in many sports contexts, especially hockey, a goal is a point, so total games could represent total points. So my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"goal separate\" refers to assists or some other stat, but given that there's no such column in the table, I have to assume it's about total games played, which are represented as numbers under \"total.\"\n\nSince 666 - 268 is 398, not 20, the claim is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where the total games for each player are located. The highest scorer has 666 games, and the lowest have 268, resulting in a difference of 398, which does not support the claim of only a 20-goal separation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Denis Savard has 377, which is over 300.\n5. Dennis Hull with 298 is below 300.\n6. Jeremy Roenick's regular season goals are 267, so that's under.\n7. Tony Amonte has 268, also under.\n8. Hubert Pit Martin with 243 is definitely below.\n9. Bill Mosienko at 258 is under as well.\n10. Ken Wharram ends with 252, which is less than 300.\n\nSo, from this analysis, most players scored above 300 in the regular season except for Dennis Hull, Jeremy Roenick, Tony Amonte, Hubert Pit Martin, Bill Mosienko, and Ken Wharram. That's six players who have scores below 300.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"all players have scored less than 300 goals\" is false because not every player meets this condition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because some players scored above 300 in the regular season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"no 2 players have the same total number of goals\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim suggests that in this table, there are no two players who have the exact same total number of goals across their entire careers. So I need to check each player's \"total\" column and see if any two share the same value.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the \"total\" column for each row:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 666\n2. Stan Mikita: 600\n3. Steve Larmer: 451\n4. Denis Savard: 438\n5. Dennis Hull: 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 302\n7. Tony Amonte: 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n9. Bill Mosienko: 268\n10. Ken Wharram: 268\n\nNow, I'll go through each total to see if any duplicates exist.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Bobby Hull has 666. No one else in the list has 666.\n- Stan Mikita with 600; no other 600.\n- Steve Larmer at 451; unique so far.\n- Denis Savard: 438, no match yet.\n- Dennis Hull: 331, still no duplicates.\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302, unique.\n- Tony Amonte: 281, unique.\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269, no duplicate.\n- Bill Mosienko: 268. Hmm, Ken Wharram also has 268.\n\nAh, here's a pair: Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram both have totals of 268. That means two players share the same total number of goals. Therefore, the claim that \"no 2 players have the same total number of goals\" is false.\n\nSo, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each player's row has a \"total\" value. For Bill Mosienko (row_index 8) and Ken Wharram (row_index 9), their \"total\" column values are both 268. These are the cells that support the claim being false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram both have a total of 268 goals, making two players with the same total.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
