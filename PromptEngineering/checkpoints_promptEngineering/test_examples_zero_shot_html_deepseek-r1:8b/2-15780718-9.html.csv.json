    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two players: Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy, who together had 14 rebounds. The claim states that they have the highest rebound against Miami. So, I need to find out if in any game where these two played against Miami, their total rebounds were higher than any other player's rebounds in that same game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details. The relevant columns for this analysis are \"high rebounds\" and \"score\". Specifically, the \"high rebounds\" column will tell me who had the most rebounds in that game.\n\nI should go through each game where Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy played against Miami. From the table:\n\n- Game 74: April 2 vs Detroit\n- Game 75: April 4 vs San Antonio\n- Game 76: April 6 vs New Jersey\n- Game 77: April 8 vs Miami\n- Game 78: April 9 vs Orlando\n- Game 79: April 11 vs Milwaukee\n- Game 80: April 12 vs New Jersey\n- Game 81: April 15 vs Miami\n- Game 82: April 16 vs Cleveland\n\nWait, the claim is against Miami. So I need to find games where the opponent is Miami and check if Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy had the highest rebounds there.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nGame 77: April 8 vs Miami. The high rebounds are listed as \"michael bradley (8)\" and \"jerome williams (16)\". So total rebounds for Michael and Jelani would be 8 + any other? Wait, no, in this row, it's \"michael bradley , jerome williams (16)\", so perhaps Michael has 8 and Jerome has 16. So the high rebounds are Jerome with 16.\n\nIn the claim, Michael and Jelani have 14 together. But in Game 77, their total is 8+... Wait, no, in that row, it's \"michael bradley (8)\" and \"jerome williams (16)\". So Michael has 8, Jerome has 16. There's no mention of Jelani McCoy in that game. So maybe the claim refers to a different game.\n\nLooking for another game where they play Miami. Game 81 is April 15 vs Miami again. In this game, \"high rebounds\" are \"michael bradley (10)\" and \"jerome williams (17)\". Again, no mention of Jelani McCoy here. So Michael has 10 rebounds.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Michael Bradley Jelani McCoy (14)\", implying both had some rebounds adding up to 14. But in the table, I don't see a game where both are mentioned together against Miami.\n\nPerhaps I need to check each game where they played against Miami and see if their combined rebounds exceed others.\n\nIn Game 77: Michael has 8, but Jelani isn't listed, so maybe not relevant here.\n\nIn Game 81: Michael has 10, but again, no mention of Jelani.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all games against Miami:\n\n- Game 77: Opponent is Miami. High rebounds: Michael (8), Jerome (16)\n- Game 81: Opponent is Miami. High rebounds: Michael (10), Jerome (17)\n\nNeither game shows Jelani McCoy's rebounds, so maybe the claim refers to a different game where both are involved against Miami.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, I don't see any other games against Miami except 77 and 81. So in those games, Jelani isn't listed as having rebounds. Therefore, it's possible that the claim is incorrect because there's no evidence of them playing against Miami with combined rebounds of 14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a game where both are involved, but in the table, they might be in different rows. For example, in Game 74: opponent Detroit, high rebounds: Michael (10), Jelani (4). But that's against Detroit, not Miami.\n\nWait, in Game 74, which is April 2 vs Detroit, the high rebounds are \"michael bradley (10)\" and \"jelani mccoy (4)\". So together, they have 14 rebounds. The claim says they have the highest rebound against Miami, but this game is against Detroit.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because in the games where they played against Miami, their combined rebounds don't exceed others.\n\nIn Game 77: Michael has 8, no Jelani. So total from Michael is 8, which is less than Jerome's 16.\n\nIn Game 81: Michael has 10, but again, no Jelani mentioned.\n\nTherefore, there's no game where both Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy play against Miami with their combined rebounds exceeding others. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a situation where Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy together have the highest rebounds in a game against Miami. Upon reviewing the table, no such game exists where both players are listed against Miami with combined rebounds of 14 or higher. Therefore, the claim lacks support from the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 77, \"column_name\": \"high_rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 81, \"column_name\": \"high_rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
