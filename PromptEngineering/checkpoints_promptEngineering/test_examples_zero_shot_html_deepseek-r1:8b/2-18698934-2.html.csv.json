    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim states: \"the result be better in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau than in sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: date, venue, result, scored, and competition. The relevant part of the claim is about two venues: \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\" and \"sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong.\" \n\nI need to find the corresponding rows for these venues in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: venue is \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau.\" The result here is 5 - 1.\n2. **Second Row**: venue is \"siu sai wan sports ground , hong kong.\" Not relevant since it's a different venue from the one in the claim.\n3. **Third Row**: venue is \"sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong.\" This matches the second part of the claim. The result here is 1 - 0.\n4. The other rows don't match either of the specified venues.\n\nNow, comparing the results: \n- At \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau,\" the result was a win (5 - 1).\n- At \"sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong,\" the result was also a win (1 - 0).\n\nThe claim suggests that the result in Macau is better than in Hong Kong. However, both results are wins, so it's unclear if one is considered better than the other. Typically, when comparing sports results, higher scores or more significant victories might be considered better. \n\nIn the first case, the score was 5-1, which is a more decisive victory compared to 1-0. Therefore, the result in Macau might be considered better. So, the claim seems to hold true based on this comparison.\n\nBut wait, I should check if all relevant data points are considered. The \"scored\" column shows whether goals were scored, but in both cases, it's 0 or 1. Since both venues have a positive result, and Macau's score is higher, the claim appears to be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"} ] }",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about an HTML table is true or false. The claim is: \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong be the venue after it be hold in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It seems to suggest that there's a change in venues from one place to another, specifically from Macau's stadium to Hong Kong's siu sai wan sport ground.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents an event with details like date, venue, result, scored, and competition. I need to find if any of these rows mention both venues: \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong\" as the new venue and \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau\" as the previous one.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row (index 0):** \n   - Date: 20 June 2010\n   - Venue: est\u00e1dio campo desportivo, Macau\n   - Result: 5-1\n   - Scored: 0\n   - Competition: Hong Kong-Macau interport\n\nHere, the venue is the one in Macau. So this could be the starting point of the claim.\n\n2. **Second Row (index 1):**\n   - Venue: siu sai wan sports ground, Hong Kong\n   - Result: 0-4\n   - Scored: 0\n   - Competition: Friendly\n\nThis is the venue mentioned in the claim as the new location. So this row is relevant.\n\n3. **Third Row (index 2):**\n   - Venue: sai tso wan recreation ground, Hong Kong\n   - This isn't the same as either venue mentioned, so probably not relevant unless there's a connection I'm missing, but it seems unrelated.\n\n4. **Fourth Row (index 3):**\n   - Venue: po kong village park, Hong Kong\n   - Again, different from the claim's venues, so likely irrelevant.\n\n5. **Fifth Row (index 4):**\n   - Venue: xianghe sports center, Beijing\n   - Definitely not related to either venue in the claim, so not relevant.\n\nNext, I check if there's a row where \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong\" comes after \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau.\" Looking at the first two rows:\n\n- First row: Macau stadium\n- Second row: Hong Kong's siu sai wan\n\nSo yes, it seems like the claim is suggesting that an event was held in Macau and then moved to Hong Kong. From the table, the second event is indeed in Hong Kong's venue after the first.\n\nBut wait, does the claim say \"after it be hold\"? That might mean \"after it was held.\" So the next row after Macau should have the new venue. Since row 0 is Macau and row 1 is Hong Kong, that fits. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by these two rows.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other data that contradicts or supports this further. The rest of the rows don't mention either venue, so they're irrelevant.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the relevant cells are row 0 (Macau) and row 1 (Hong Kong). They show a change in venues as per the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that after an event was held at \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau,\" another event occurred at \"siu sai wan sport ground , hong kong.\" Checking the table, the first row is the Macau venue (index 0), and the second row is Hong Kong's siu sai wan (index 1). This supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "only the 26 january 2011 game in sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong score more than 0",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"only the 26 january 2011 game in sai tso wan recreation ground , hong kong score more than 0.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's stating that among all the games listed in the table, only the one on January 26, 2011, at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground in Hong Kong scored more than 0. That means no other game in the table should have a score higher than 0.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different match with details like date, venue, result (score), scored, and competition. My task is to check each relevant cell related to the claim and verify if only the specified game meets the condition.\n\nSo, I'll start by identifying which rows are relevant. The claim mentions a specific date, venue, and result. Therefore, I need to find the row for 26 January 2011 at Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- First row: 20 June 2010, Est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo, Macau, result 5 - 1, scored 0, competition friendly.\nWait, that's a positive score (5-1), but the claim says only the specified game scores more than 0. So this might be relevant if it contradicts the claim.\n\n- Second row: 2 November 2010, Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground, Hong Kong, result 0 - 4, scored 0. That's a loss; score is 0, so not relevant for scoring over 0.\n\n- Third row: 26 January 2011, Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground, Hong Kong, result 1 - 0, scored 1. This matches the claim exactly. So this is definitely relevant.\n\n- Fourth row: 9 February 2011, Po Kong Village Park, Hong Kong, result 1 - 4, scored 0. That's a loss; score is 0, so not relevant.\n\n- Fifth row: 3 June 2010, Xianghe Sports Center, Beijing, result 2 - 2, scored 0. That's a draw; score is 0, so not relevant.\n\nSo from the table, I can see that besides the specified game on January 26, there are other games with scores over 0. Specifically, the first row has a result of 5-1, which means they scored more than 0 (since it's 5 points for one team and 1 for the other). Wait, but in football terms, usually, the score is the total goals, so 5-1 means one team scored 5, the other 1. So both teams have scored, but I'm not sure if \"scored\" refers to the total or per team. Looking at the table, the column is called \"scored,\" and in this case, it's 0 for that row, which probably indicates that the home team didn't score.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check the columns again. The table has a column called \"result\" which shows the score, like \"5 - 1\", and another column called \"scored\" with numbers: 0 or 1. So for the first row, the result is 5-1, but \"scored\" is 0. That might mean that the home team didn't score, but the away team did, so the result would be a win for the away team with 5 goals.\n\nBut regardless of which team scored, in terms of points or goals, 5-1 means one team scored more than 0. So this row has a game where the result is over 0, meaning it's a goal-scoring match. Therefore, according to the claim, only the specified game should have a score over 0. But here, there's another game that does.\n\nWait, but in the \"scored\" column, it's showing 0 for the first row. Maybe I'm misunderstanding which score is being referred to. Let me read the columns again:\n\nThe table has:\n- date\n- venue\n- result (which shows scores like 5-1)\n- scored (maybe goals by the home team?)\n- competition.\n\nSo in the first row, the \"scored\" column is 0. So if that's the case, then the home team didn't score any goals. But the result is 5-1, so the away team scored 5 and the home scored 1? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nBut regardless of how it's interpreted, the fact remains that in the first row, there was a game where the result (goals) are more than 0, even though the \"scored\" column shows 0. So that contradicts the claim because the claim says only the specified game scores over 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about whether any other games scored more than 0. If in another row, the result is a score of 5-1, which is greater than 0 for at least one team, then that makes the claim false because that game also scored more than 0.\n\nAlternatively, if \"scored\" refers to the total goals scored by one team, but in any case, a 5-1 result means that goals were scored beyond 0. So regardless of which team scored it, it's still a positive score.\n\nTherefore, since there are other games with scores over 0 (like 5-1), the claim is false because not only the specified game, but others also have scores more than 0.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\nRelevant cells: rows where either the date, venue, or result could be relevant. But specifically, looking for any row that has a score >0 besides the specified one.\n\nThe specified game is in row 2 (if we index from 0). The first row also has a score of 5-1, which is over 0. So both rows are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's another game that meets the condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific game is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the 9 february 2011 game be the last game list , and it score 1 - 4.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The first part mentions that the game on 9 February 2011 is the last one listed in the table. The second part says that the score for this game was 1-4.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, I notice there are five rows, each representing a different game or event. Each row has several columns: date, venue, result, scored, and competition. My task is to verify if the claim's assertion about the 9 February 2011 game is correct.\n\nTo do this, I'll identify which cells in the table are relevant to checking both parts of the claim. For the first part, I need to check if the 9 February 2011 game is indeed listed as the last entry. The \"date\" column seems relevant here because each row's date must be cross-referenced with the 9 February 2011 date.\n\nNext, for the score part of the claim, the \"result\" and \"scored\" columns are important. The result should show that the game ended with a score of 1-4, so I need to check both the \"result\" (which shows the overall match outcome) and the \"scored\" column (which indicates the number of goals scored by the team in question, perhaps).\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one with the date 9 February 2011. Scanning the dates: June 2010, November 2010, January 2011, February 2011, and another game in June 2010. The third row is January 2011, the fourth is February 2011. Specifically, the fourth row has the date 9 February 2011.\n\nNow, checking the \"result\" for this row: it's listed as 1 - 4. That matches the score part of the claim. So the result column confirms the score.\n\nRegarding whether this is the last game in the list, since there are five rows and the fourth row is 9 February 2011, that would mean it's actually the third last entry, not the last. Wait, no\u2014rows are numbered starting from 0 or 1? In programming, indexes often start at 0, but sometimes people count from 1. The table has five rows, so if row indices start at 0, then 9 February is at index 4 (if we consider zero-based). But in a list, the last item would be the fifth one, which isn't present here; there are only five entries. Wait, let me clarify: the first row is index 0 or 1? It depends on how the data is structured.\n\nWait, in the table provided, the rows are:\n\n1. June 2010\n2. November 2010\n3. January 2011\n4. February 2011 (9th)\n5. June 2010 again\n\nSo if we're considering the order as listed, the last row is the fifth one, which is another game on 3 June 2010. Therefore, the claim says that the 9 February 2011 game is the last in the list, but according to the table, it's actually the fourth entry, and the fifth (last) entry is a different date.\n\nThis means the first part of the claim is incorrect because the 9 February 2011 game isn't the last one listed. However, the second part about the score (1-4) is correct as per the \"result\" column.\n\nBut the claim's first assertion is wrong. So does that mean the entire claim is false? Because it's making two claims: being the last game and having a 1-4 score. Since one part is incorrect, the overall answer should be false.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the claim says \"the last game list.\" If the table has five games, then the last one is the fifth row. The fourth row is 9 February 2011, and the fifth is another game on 3 June 2010. So the 9th of February isn't the last in the list; it's actually the third or fourth entry.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim is false, but the second part is true. However, since the claim combines both assertions as a single statement (\"the 9 february 2011 game be the last game list , and it score 1 - 4\"), both parts need to be correct for the entire claim to be true.\n\nSince the first part is incorrect, the overall answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we checked each relevant cell in the table. The claim states that the 9 February 2011 game is the last listed and scores 1-4. By examining the \"date\" column, we found that the 9 February 2011 entry is not the final one but the fourth of five. However, the \"result\" for this date correctly shows a score of 1-4. Since both parts of the claim are not entirely accurate, the overall answer is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what's being claimed here.\n\nThe claim says: \"4 of 5 competition be friendly, with only 1 2010 hong kong - macau interport.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Out of the 5 competitions listed, 4 should be friendly.\n2. There's only one competition that is \"2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport.\"\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different competition with various details like date, venue, result, etc.\n\nI need to check two things: \n- How many competitions in total are there? It seems there are 5, as per the claim.\n- Out of these 5, how many are classified as \"friendly\"?\n\nFrom the table:\n- The first row (index 0) is for the 2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport competition. The result is \"5 - 1,\" and it's under the 'competition' column.\n- The second row (index 1): It says \"friendly.\"\n- Third row (index 2): Also \"friendly.\"\n- Fourth row (index 3): Friendly again.\n- Fifth row (index 4): Friendly as well.\n\nWait, so out of 5 competitions:\n- Only the first one is not friendly. The other four are friendly.\n\nSo the claim says 4 of 5 are friendly, which matches the table. Additionally, there's only one competition that isn't friendly, which is the Hong Kong - Macau Interport match in 2010. That also aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim seem to be true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that out of five competitions, four are friendly, and only one is the specific \"2010 Hong Kong - Macau Interport\" competition.

The claim says: \"the result be the same in est\u00e1dio campo desportivo as xianghe sport center.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"result\" likely refers to the score from the match, which is in the 'result' column of the table. The venues mentioned are \"est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo\" and \"xianghe sports center.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to see if there's a match between these two venues.\n\nStarting with the first row: 20 June 2010, venue is \"est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo , macau.\" So this seems to be the first venue in question. The result here is 5 - 1. \n\nNext, I need to find any rows where the venue is \"xianghe sports center.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: venue is \"est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo...\"\n- Row 1: venue is \"siu sai wan sports ground\"\n- Row 2: venue is \"sai tso wan recreation ground\"\n- Row 3: venue is \"po kong village park\"\n- Row 4: venue is \"xianghe sports center , beijing.\"\n\nAh, so row 4 is the xianghe sports center. The result for that row is 2 - 2.\n\nNow, the claim is comparing the result at \"est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo\" (which is in row 0) to \"xianghe sports center\" (row 4). So I need to check if their results are the same.\n\nRow 0's result: 5 - 1\nRow 4's result: 2 - 2\n\nThese are different. Therefore, the claim that the results are the same is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is trying to compare the two venues regardless of their row positions? Or perhaps I should consider if there are any other instances where both venues appear in the same context.\n\nLooking back, only row 0 is \"est\u00e1dio Campo Desportivo\" and row 4 is \"xianghe sports center.\" So they don't appear together. Therefore, to evaluate the claim, we just need to check these two cells for their results.\n\nSince the results differ (5-1 vs 2-2), the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant_cells part: I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant to verify the claim.

Each relevant cell should specify which column it's in, which is 'result' in both cases.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- From row 0, column 'result': {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n- From row 4, column 'result': {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n\nI should list these two as the relevant_cells in the JSON response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Then row 0 is Macau's stadium.\n\nBut the claim says that siu sai wan was the venue before it was held at Macau's stadium. So does the table show that siu sai wan was used before Macau?\n\nLooking at the dates: row 0 is June 2010, row 1 is November 2010. So Macau's stadium was first used in June 2010, then Hong Kong's siu sai wan was used in November 2010.\n\nSo actually, the order is that Macau's venue was held before Hong Kong's siu sai wan. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it suggests that Hong Kong's venue was before Macau's, which isn't the case based on their dates.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify date order; it just states that siu sai wan was the venue before Macau. So regardless of the order in the table, if both venues are present and one is before the other, but the actual data shows Macau's venue was first, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is suggesting that in Hong Kong, it was held at siu sai wan before moving to Macau. But according to the table, the first event was in Macau, then later in Hong Kong. So the sequence is Macau first, then Hong Kong. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the order is incorrect.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the venue in Hong Kong (siu sai wan) wasn't used before Macau's stadium; it was used after.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"siu sai wan sport ground\" was used before \"est\u00e1dio campo desportivo , macau,\" but based on the table, the Macau venue was first. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"hong kong score more than 1 on 26 january 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand what each column represents. The table has columns: date, venue, result, scored, and competition. Each row corresponds to a specific event.\n\nThe claim mentions \"hong kong score more than 1 on 26 january 2011.\" So I need to find the row where the date is January 26, 2011, and check the 'scored' column for Hong Kong's score in that match.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 0: 20 June 2010\nRow 1: 2 November 2010\nRow 2: 26 January 2011\nRow 3: 9 February 2011\nRow 4: 3 June 2010\n\nThe date in question is January 26, 2011, which corresponds to row index 2.\n\nNow, check the 'scored' column for that row. The 'result' column shows \"1 - 0\" and the 'scored' column has a value of 1.\n\nSo Hong Kong scored 1 point in that match. The claim says they scored more than 1, which would be 2 or higher. Since it's only 1, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, I need to mark the answer as FALSE and identify the relevant cells. The relevant cells are row index 2 (since it's the specific row) and both 'result' and 'scored' columns because they contain data used to evaluate the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"scored\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a game is true or false based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"the game play 9 february 2011 finish with a score 2 - 2.\" So, the key points here are the date of the game (9 February 2011), the result (score of 2-2), and that it's a game play.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row to see if any match this information. The table has several columns: date, venue, result, scored, competition. \n\nI'll start by locating the row where the date is 9 February 2011. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. First row: 20 June 2010 \u2013 doesn't match.\n2. Second row: 2 November 2010 \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: 26 January 2011 \u2013 not February, so skip.\n4. Fourth row: 9 February 2011 \u2013 this seems relevant because the date matches part of the claim.\n\nNow, focusing on this fourth row, I check the result column. The score listed is \"1 - 4\". That doesn't match the claimed 2-2 score. \n\nNext, I'll look at other columns to see if any additional information might support or contradict the claim. The 'competition' column for this row says 'friendly', which just indicates it's a type of game but doesn't affect the score.\n\nSince the result (score) in the table doesn't match the claimed 2-2, the claim is false. \n\nTo be thorough, I'll ensure there are no other rows that might somehow relate, but none have the date or score as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"none of the competition be friendly\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: date, venue, result, scored, and competition. The claim is about competitions being friendly, so I should focus on the \"competition\" column to see what each entry says.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First row (row 0):** Competition is \"2010 hong kong - macau interport\". It doesn't specify if it's a friendly match.\n2. **Second row (row 1):** Competition is \"friendly\". This directly states that the competition is friendly.\n3. **Third row (row 2):** Competition is \"friendly\". Another instance where the competition is labeled as friendly.\n4. **Fourth row (row 3):** Competition is \"friendly\". Again, it's a friendly match.\n5. **Fifth row (row 4):** Competition is \"friendly\". This one is also friendly.\n\nSo, looking at the data, there are multiple competitions where the type is explicitly stated as \"friendly\". That means the claim that none of the competitions are friendly isn't true because some are indeed friendly.\n\nI need to check which cells are relevant. The column in question here is \"competition\", so for each row where competition is 'friendly', I should note their row indices and column name.\n\nRelevant rows are rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 (since they all have \"friendly\" in the competition column). Each of these corresponds to the same column, \"competition\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 1: competition\n- Row 2: competition\n- Row 3: competition\n- Row 4: competition\n\nPutting this together, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because not all competitions are friendly\u2014specifically, some are friendly. The relevant cells are those in column \"competition\" for rows 1 through 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check each row's competition type.\n\n- **Row 0:** Competition: \"2010 hong kong - macau interport\" \u2192 Not friendly\n- **Row 1:** Competition: \"friendly\" \u2192 Friendly\n- **Row 2:** Competition: \"friendly\" \u2192 Friendly\n- **Row 3:** Competition: \"friendly\" \u2192 Friendly\n- **Row 4:** Competition: \"friendly\" \u2192 Friendly\n\nSince some competitions are friendly, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
