    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the number in season for 4300062 be 19\" is true based on the provided table. First, I should identify which row corresponds to the number 4300062. Looking through the table, each row has a 'Number' column that increments, so 4300062 must be in one of these rows.\n\nStarting from the top, each row's Number increases by about 10 except when it resets or skips. Let me count down from 4300062 to see which row it falls into. \n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, each 'Number' seems to start from 4300000 and goes up in increments of around 4, but that might not be accurate because I need to focus on the exact number mentioned.\n\nLooking for 4300062: I spot it towards the end of the table. Specifically, row 62 has Number 4300062. Now, the claim is about this number being associated with season 19. So, in row 62, there's a 'Season' column that probably states 19.\n\nI should check what the Season is for row 62. From the table, the Season for row 62 is indeed 19. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"Season\"}]}",
