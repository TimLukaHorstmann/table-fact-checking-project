    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"all of the mascot except west washington's be base on animal.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that all mascots in the table are based on animals, except for the one associated with West Washington, which might not be. However, the wording is a bit unclear. It could mean that all mascots except West Washington's are animal-based, or perhaps that only West Washington's is not.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different school with details like location, mascot, size, and others. My task is to check each mascot cell in the 'mascot' column to see if they are based on animals, except possibly for West Washington.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Crawford County**: Mascot is \"wolfpack.\" Wolves are animals, so this fits.\n2. **Mitchell**: \"bluejackets.\" Bluejackets might be related to the color blue, not an animal. This seems like it doesn't fit if we're considering whether mascots are based on animals.\n3. **Orleans**: \"bulldogs.\" Bulldogs are a type of dog, so that's an animal.\n4. **Paoli**: \"rams.\" Rams refer to sheep or the team name, which is often used for animals in sports, like the Ram.\n5. **Perry Central**: \"commodores.\" Commodores usually relate to ships or naval terms, not an animal.\n6. **Springs Valley**: \"blackhawks.\" Blackhawks are a reference to birds, specifically a type of bird, so that's an animal.\n7. **West Washington**: \"senators.\" Senators typically refer to political positions or legislative bodies, which aren't animals.\n\nWait, the claim says except West Washington's. So if all except West Washington have mascots based on animals, then the claim would be true. But let's check each mascot:\n\n- Crawford: Wolfpack - animal\n- Mitchell: Bluejackets - not an animal\n- Orleans: Bulldogs - animal\n- Paoli: Rams - animal (sheep)\n- Perry Central: Commodores - not an animal\n- Springs Valley: Blackhawk - bird, so animal\n- West Washington: Senators - not animal\n\nSo the mascots that are based on animals are Crawford, Orleans, Paoli, and Springs Valley. The ones that aren't are Mitchell, Perry Central, and West Washington.\n\nBut the claim says \"all of the mascot except west washington's be base on animal.\" Hmm, perhaps it's worded as all except West Washington's being based on animals. So if the claim is asserting that only West Washington's mascot isn't an animal, but others are, then the statement would be true because Mitchell and Perry Central also have mascots not based on animals.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"all of the mascot except west washington's be base on animal.\" That wording suggests that all other mascots (except West Washington) are based on animals. But in reality, Mitchell and Perry Central's mascots aren't based on animals either.\n\nSo the statement is not entirely true because there are other mascots besides West Washington that don't fit. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Orleans be less than half the size of Mitchell\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions two schools: Orleans and Mitchell. Looking at the table, both Orleans and Mitchell have entries.\n\nFor Orleans, I need to find its size. Looking through the table, Orleans is in row 2 (since it's the third entry, but indexing starts at 0). The size column for Orleans shows 258. So, Orleans has a size of 258.\n\nNext, for Mitchell, I check its size as well. Mitchell is in row 1, and its size is listed as 620. \n\nNow, the claim says Orleans should be less than half the size of Mitchell. To check this, I'll compute half of Mitchell's size. Half of 620 is 310. Since Orleans has a size of 258, which is less than 310, it meets the condition.\n\nWait, no, actually, wait: 258 divided by 620 equals approximately 0.415, which is just under half. So yes, 258 is indeed less than half of 620.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"Orleans be less than half the size of Mitchell,\" we need to compare their sizes directly from the table. Orleans has a size of 258, while Mitchell's size is 620. Calculating half of Mitchell's size (620 / 2 = 310) shows that Orleans (258) is indeed less than half. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Mitchell be the only school with an aaa ihsaa class.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of this claim means. It's saying that Mitchell is the sole school that has an \"aaa\" classification under IHSAA. So my task is to look through the table and check if any other schools have \"aaa\" in their IHSAA class.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related to this are \"school,\" \"location,\" \"mascot,\" \"size,\" \"ihsaa class,\" and \"county.\" The relevant column here is \"ihsaa class.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to check the \"ihsaa class\" column. \n\n1. First row: school is Crawford County, ihsaa class is aa.\n2. Second row: Mitchell has aaa as its ihsaa class.\n3. Third row: Orleans has a.\n4. Fourth row: Paoli also has aa.\n5. Fifth row: Perry Central is aa.\n6. Sixth row: Springs Valley is a.\n7. Seventh row: West Washington is a.\n\nSo, from this, I can see that Mitchell is the only school with an aaa classification. The other schools have either aa or a. No one else has aaa. Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on the table provided.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. Since the claim mentions \"ihsaa class,\" I need to look at that column for each row. So all rows' ihsaa class entries might be relevant if they have a value, but in this case, only Mitchell's is aaa. Wait, no\u2014the claim says it's the only one with aaa, so any other rows that have aaa would make the statement false. But here, only Mitchell has aaa.\n\nWait, but do I need to include all rows or just the ones relevant? The instruction says to list the cells that are relevant to verify the claim. So for this claim, I should look at the \"ihsaa class\" column because it's directly related. Therefore, every row's ihsaa class cell is potentially relevant, but in reality, only Mitchell's aaa entry is critical.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since the claim is about whether Mitchell is the only one with aaa, the relevant cells would be all the \"ihsaa class\" entries because each could potentially have aaa. So I should list each row's ihsaa class cell if they might affect the claim.\n\nHowever, to make it precise, perhaps only the rows where ihsaa class is aaa are relevant because that's what Mitchell has and others don't. But actually, no\u2014since we need to check all schools, every row's ihsaa class is a potential counterexample if another school also has aaa. So in this case, all \"ihsaa class\" cells are relevant.\n\nBut maybe the instruction expects only the specific column and rows that could affect the claim. Since Mitchell is the one with aaa, and others don't, perhaps listing all ihsaa class cells as relevant makes sense.\n\nWait, but looking back at the example provided: in their sample JSON, they listed two revenue and employees from different rows. So for each row, if a cell is relevant, it's included. So here, since the claim is about whether Mitchell is the only one with aaa, I need to check all schools' ihsaa class.\n\nTherefore, every \"ihsaa class\" cell in every row could be relevant because they might have aaa. But actually, in this table, only Mitchell has aaa, so other cells don't affect it unless another school also has aaa.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include each row's ihsaa class column.\n\nWait, but that would mean all 7 rows' \"ihsaa class\" are relevant because they show whether any other school has aaa. Since only Mitchell does, the claim is true, and others don't have it.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since the claim is about Mitchell being the only one with aaa, the relevant cells are all the ihsaa class entries across all rows. So each row's \"ihsaa class\" cell needs to be checked to see if any other school has aaa besides Mitchell.\n\nIn this case, none do, so the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Mitchell be the only school with an aaa ihsaa class\" is **TRUE** because after examining each row in the table, only Mitchell's entry for \"ihsaa class\" is 'aaa'. No other schools have 'aaa' in their respective \"ihsaa class\" column. Therefore, the statement holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the team be from different country\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that every team listed in the table comes from a unique country, meaning no two teams are from the same country.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and identify which column is relevant here. The columns given are school, location, mascot, size, ihsaa class, and county. Since the claim is about countries, I think \"location\" might refer to the country, but I'm not entirely sure because sometimes location could be a city or state. However, looking at the data, each \"location\" seems to correspond to a place that's either a town or part of a larger area.\n\nI should check how the locations are named in the table. For example, one row has \"marengo\" as the location, another has \"mitchell,\" and so on. These don't seem like countries; they look more like cities or towns within counties. The county column might give more context about which actual country these locations are in, but I need to see if that's provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"county\" column with names like \"crawford,\" \"mitchell,\" etc. These seem to be counties within states or regions, but they don't specify countries. For instance, there's a county called \"orange\" and \"perry.\" I'm not sure if these are country names or part of U.S. states.\n\nWait, maybe the \"location\" refers to the actual country? Let me check that again. If \"location\" is the country, then all teams would have unique countries. But looking at the data, multiple rows have the same \"county.\" For example, two teams are from \"orange\" county and another has \"59 orange,\" which might indicate something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"county\" column refers to the state or region within a country. So, each team is in a different U.S. state or county, but not necessarily a different country. The original claim says \"different country,\" implying that all teams are from unique countries globally. If that's the case, then I need to see if any two teams share the same country.\n\nBut since all the locations listed like marengo, mitchell, etc., don't look like country names, and the counties mentioned are likely U.S. counties, it seems that the teams are from different states or regions within the same country, not necessarily different countries.\n\nTherefore, the claim is probably false because all the teams are from the same country (the U.S.), so they aren't from different countries.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"all of the team be from different country,\" we need to check each row for unique countries.

The relevant column here is \"mascot.\" To check the claim, I need to verify if each mascot in the table is derived from an animal and also confirm that west washington's mascot meets this criteria.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Crawford County**: Mascot is Wolfpack. Wolves are animals, so that's good.\n2. **Mitchell**: Bluejackets. The name suggests it's related to bluejacket fish, which are indeed animals.\n3. **Orleans**: Bulldogs. That's clearly an animal (bulldog).\n4. **Paoli**: Rams. Rams are animals.\n5. **Perry Central**: Commodores. This is a personification of a ship or something, but not necessarily an animal. Wait, actually, \"commodore\" is a title, not an animal. So this might be a problem because the claim says all mascots should be based on animals.\n6. **Springs Valley**: Blackhawk. That's a bird, so that's fine.\n7. **West Washington**: Mascot is Senators. Hmm, \"senators\" sounds like a title or position rather than an animal. This could be an issue because the claim says it should be based on an animal.\n\nSo, two issues: Perry Central and West Washington have mascots that aren't clearly animals. However, the claim only mentions west washington specifically, so maybe the rest can be considered okay? Wait, no\u2014the claim states \"all of the mascot,\" meaning every single one should follow the rule. If even one fails, the entire statement is false.\n\nTherefore, since Perry Central's mascot isn't based on an animal and West Washington's also isn't, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: I need to check each school's mascot column. Since both Perry Central and West Washington are problematic, their rows and \"mascot\" column entries are relevant.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, with the relevant cells being row 4 (Perry Central) and row 6 (West Washington), under the \"mascot\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"Mitchell be 1 of the 2 school list with an aaa ihsaa class.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that Mitchell is one of two schools listed that have an AAA IHSA class. So I need to find out if Mitchell has an AAA classification and then check how many other schools also have AAA.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various attributes. The relevant columns here are \"school\" and \"ihsaa class\". \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Crawford County: ihsaa class is AA.\n2. Mitchell: ihsaa class is AAA.\n3. Orleans: ihsaa class is A.\n4. Paoli: ihsaa class is AA.\n5. Perry Central: ihsaa class is AA.\n6. Springs Valley: ihsaa class is A.\n7. West Washington: ihsaa class is A.\n\nFrom this, only Mitchell has an AAA classification. So there's only one school with AAA. The claim says there are two such schools, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, but the claim also mentions \"1 of the 2.\" Maybe it's implying that Mitchell is one, and another is missing. But in the table, only Mitchell has AAA. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's not a second school with AAA.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only Mitchell has an AAA IHSA class, making it just one school instead of two.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Orleans be exactly less than half the size of Mitchell\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"school\", \"location\", \"size\", and maybe others, but especially focusing on the sizes of Orleans and Mitchell schools.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find the rows corresponding to Orleans and Mitchell. \n\n- Orleans is in row index 2 (since the first row is index 0). Its size is 258.\n- Mitchell is in row index 1. Its size is 620.\n\nThe claim states that Orleans's size should be exactly less than half of Mitchell's size. So, I need to calculate if 258 is less than half of 620.\n\nCalculating half of 620: 620 divided by 2 equals 310. Since 258 is less than 310, this condition holds true.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported and should be marked as TRUE. The relevant cells are Orleans's size (row index 2, column \"size\") and Mitchell's size (row index 1, column \"size\").\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
