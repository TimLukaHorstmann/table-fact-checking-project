    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 8 games at the boston garden , all before december 17.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. It's saying that there are exactly 8 games played at the Boston Garden, and all these games occurred before December 17. So my task is to check two things: the number of games at Boston Garden and whether they all happened before December 17.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a game with details like date and location. The \"location / attendance\" column seems to include the venue where the game was played. So I need to filter the rows where the location is \"boston garden.\"\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: game 20, December 3 vs Philadelphia 76ers, location Boston Garden. So that's one.\n2. Row 4: game 24, December 8 vs Lakers, location Boston Garden. That's two.\n3. Row 5: game 25, December 11 vs Warriors, location Boston Garden. Three.\n4. Row 9: game 26, December 15 vs Cincinnati Royals, Boston Garden. Four.\n5. Row 12: game 27, December 17 vs Pistons, location Detroit. Wait, this is on December 17, which is the date in question. The claim says \"all before december 17.\" So if a game is on December 17, it's not before that date. So this one doesn't count.\n6. Row 13: game 28, December 22, location Boston Garden. Wait, December 22 is after December 17, so this shouldn't be counted because the claim says all games should be before December 17.\n\nWait a minute, looking again, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: game 20 - yes\nRow 4: game 24 - yes\nRow 5: game 25 - yes\nRow 9: game 26 - yes (December 15 is before December 17)\nRows beyond that, like row 12 is December 17, which is the same date. So does the claim include games on December 17? The claim says \"all before december 17,\" so December 17 would not be included. Therefore, game 27 on Dec 17 shouldn't count.\n\nSo up to row 9, that's four games at Boston Garden before Dec 17. Then, looking further:\n\nRow 13: game 28 is Dec 22, which is after Dec 17, so it doesn't count.\nRows beyond that are also after Dec 17 except for row 12 (game 27 on Dec 17).\n\nWait, let me check the rows properly. Maybe I misnumbered them.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row indices: starts from 0 to 14? Wait, the table has 14 rows because it goes up to game 33. Let me list all games with location Boston Garden and their dates.\n\nRow 0: Dec 3 - yes\nRow 4: Dec 8 - yes\nRow 5: Dec 11 - yes\nRow 9: Dec 15 - yes\nThen, row 13: Dec 22 is after Dec 17, so no.\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me go step by step:\n\nLooking through each row's location column:\n\n- Row 0: Boston Garden (Dec 3) - count 1\n- Row 4: Boston Garden (Dec 8) - count 2\n- Row 5: Boston Garden (Dec 11) - count 3\n- Row 9: Boston Garden (Dec 15) - count 4\n- Then, looking for more Boston Garden games after that. Let's see:\n\nAfter row 9, next is row 12: location Providence, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Wait the table has 14 rows, but I think only up to game 33. Let me list all with Boston Garden and their dates:\n\n1. Row 0: Dec 3\n2. Row 4: Dec 8\n3. Row 5: Dec 11\n4. Row 9: Dec 15\n\nWait, that's four games before Dec 17. Then, is there another one? Let me check beyond row 9.\n\nLooking at rows beyond 9:\n\n- Row 10: Providence - no\n- Row 11: San Francisco Warriors on Dec 30 - no\n- Row 12: Detroit (Dec 17) - no\n- Row 13: Boston Garden on Dec 22 - which is after Dec 17, so doesn't count\n- Row 14: Providence - no\n\nSo only four games at Boston Garden before Dec 17. The claim says there are eight such games. That's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each game:\n\nLooking for location \"boston garden\":\n\n- Game 20 (row 0): yes\n- Game 24 (row 4): yes\n- Game 25 (row 5): yes\n- Game 26 (row 9): yes (Dec 15)\n- Then, looking further: \n  - Game 28 (row 13): Dec 22 - after Dec17, so no.\n  - Game 33 (row 14? Wait, the table goes up to row 14? Wait, the last row is row 14 with game 33 on Dec 30.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rows. Let me count again:\n\nLooking at each row's location column:\n\nRow 0: Boston Garden\nRow 1: Providence\nRow 2: San Francisco\nRow 3: Providence\nRow 4: Boston Garden\nRow 5: Boston Garden\nRow 6: San Francisco\nRow 7: San Francisco\nRow 8: San Francisco\nRow 9: Boston Garden\nRow 10: Providence\nRow 11: San Francisco\nRow 12: Detroit\nRow 13: Boston Garden\nRow 14: Providence\n\nSo, in rows 0,4,5,9, and 13 have Boston Garden. But wait, row 13 is Dec 22, which is after Dec17, so only four games before Dec17.\n\nThus, the claim says there are eight such games, but I count only four. So the claim is FALSE because there aren't eight games at Boston Garden before Dec17.\n\nWait, but let me double-check in case I missed any. Maybe I overlooked some rows.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: Dec3\n- Row4: Dec8\n- Row5: Dec11\n- Row9: Dec15\n- Then, row13 is Dec22 after Dec17, so not counted.\nSo only four games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are only four games at Boston Garden before Dec17, not eight.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are 8 games at the Boston Garden all before December 17. By examining each row of the table, only four games meet this criteria:\n\n1. Game 20 on December 3\n2. Game 24 on December 8\n3. Game 25 on December 11\n4. Game 26 on December 15\n\nGame 28 on December 22 and others either do not occur before December 17 or are at different locations.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The claim focuses on two criteria - location (Boston Garden) and date (before December 17).\n\n2. **Filter Rows by Location:** From the table, select rows where \"location / attendance\" is \"boston garden\".\n\n3. **Check Each Filtered Row's Date:**\n   - Game 20: Dec 3 \u2192 before Dec 17\n   - Game 24: Dec 8 \u2192 before Dec 17\n   - Game 25: Dec 11 \u2192 before Dec 17\n   - Game 26: Dec 15 \u2192 before Dec 17\n   - Game 28: Dec 22 \u2192 after Dec 17 (excluded)\n   - No more games at Boston Garden before Dec 17.\n\n4. **Count Valid Games:** Only four games meet both criteria.\n\nSince there are not eight such games, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
