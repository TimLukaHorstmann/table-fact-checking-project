The claim is: \"September 22, 2004 season premiere has a rank of 21.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and data. The table has columns: season, episodes, time slot (est), season premiere, season finale, tv season, rank, viewers.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific date for the season premiere: September 22, 2004. So I need to find the row where the \"season premiere\" column matches this date.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Season premiere is September 22, 2004. That's the one we're interested in.\n- Other rows have different dates, so they don't apply here.\n\nNext, check the rank for that specific row. In row 0, the \"rank\" column has a value of 21. The claim states that this rank is 21, which matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify the relevant cells. Since the relevant information is in row 0 and the \"rank\" column, those are the only two cells needed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is specifically about the season finale for season 4 being May 21, 2008. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant information in the table. The table has several columns: season, episodes, time slot (est), season premiere, season finale, tv season, rank, and viewers (in millions). Since the claim is about the season finale, I'll focus on the \"season finale\" column.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one to find where season 4 is. The seasons go from 1 to 8. Season 4 should be the fourth row, which is index 3 if we start counting from 0, but sometimes people count starting from 1. Wait, in the table, each <tr> represents a row, so the first row is season 1, second is season 2, and so on. So, season 4 would be the fourth row, which is index 3 (since it's zero-based). \n\nNow, for that specific row, I need to check the \"season finale\" column. The cell in question should have May 21, 2008 as per the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, the fourth row has the season number 4. Let me verify:\n\n- Season: 4\n- Episodes: 21\n- Time slot: Wednesday 10 pm / 9c\n- Season premiere: September 26, 2007\n- Season finale: May 21, 2008\n- TV season: 2007 - 2008\n- Rank: 28\n- Viewers: 11.71 million\n\nYes, the \"season finale\" for season 4 is indeed May 21, 2008. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo, to confirm, I need to locate which cells are relevant. The row index is 3 because it's the fourth row (0-based). The column name is \"season finale\". Therefore, the relevant cell is at row index 3 and column \"season finale\".\n\nI don't see any other columns that would affect this check. It's straightforward as the claim directly references the season finale date for season 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches exactly with the data in the table for season 4's season finale.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"season finale\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"2007 - 2008 be the season where september 26 , 2007 have the season premier.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be verified.\n\nThe claim mentions two things:\n1. It refers to the season \"2007 - 2008.\"\n2. Within that season, there should be a season premiere on September 26, 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different TV season with various details including season premier date. So I need to find the row where the season is \"2007 - 2008\" and check if the season premiere date matches September 26, 2007.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\nRow 0: Season 1, premiere Sept 22, 2004 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 1: Season 2, premiere Sept 28, 2005 \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: Season 3, premiere Sept 20, 2006 \u2013 no.\nRow 3: Season 4, premiere Sept 26, 2007. Wait, this is the season \"2007 - 2008\" and the premiere date matches September 26, 2007.\n\nSo Row 3 (index 3) has column 'season premiere' which matches the claim's criteria.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row_index 3 and column_name 'season premiere'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because season 4 (2007-2008) has a season premiere on September 26, 2007. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season premiere\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be more than 1 season finale on may 26 , 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again. It says that there are more than one season finale on May 26, 2010. So, I need to check if there's only one season finale on that date or multiple.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different season, from season 1 up to season 8. Each row has several columns: season number, episodes, time slot, season premiere, season finale, TV season, rank, and viewers.\n\nMy focus is on the \"season finale\" column because that's what the claim is about. I need to find out if any of the seasons had their finale on May 26, 2010.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Season 1 ended on May 18, 2005.\nRow 2: Season 2 ended on May 17, 2006.\nRow 3: Season 3 ended on May 16, 2007.\nRow 4: Season 4 ended on May 21, 2008.\nRow 5: Season 5 ended on May 14, 2009.\nRow 6: Season 6 ended on May 26, 2010. That's the date mentioned in the claim.\nRow 7: Season 7 ended on May 13, 2011.\nRow 8: Season 8 ended on May 11, 2012.\n\nFrom this, I can see that only season 6 has its finale on May 26, 2010. There's no other row where the season finale is on that date. So, there's only one season finale on May 26, 2010.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 1,\" which would be false because there's exactly one. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. The key column here is \"season finale.\" So, for each row where the season finale date is May 26, 2010, I can include those cells.\n\nLooking again, only row 6 has the season finale on May 26, 2010. So, the relevant_cells should point to that specific row and column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether there are more than one season finale on May 26, 2010, we check each row's \"season finale\" date.\n\n- Only **Season 6** has its finale on May 26, 2010. No other seasons have their finale on this date.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season finale\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"there be more than 23 episode where the season premier be september 23 , 2009.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's saying that there are more than 23 episodes where the season premiere was on September 23, 2009. So I need to check each row in the table and see how many times the season premiere date matches this specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, it has 8 rows, each representing a different season from 1 to 8. Each row has several columns, including \"season\", \"episodes\", \"time slot (est)\", \"season premiere\", etc.\n\nI'll focus on the \"season premiere\" column because that's what the claim is referring to. I need to count how many times \"september 23 , 2009\" appears in this column across all rows.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Season premiere is September 22, 2004 \u2013 not matching.\n2. Row 1: September 28, 2005 \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: September 20, 2006 \u2013 no.\n4. Row 3: September 26, 2007 \u2013 still no.\n5. Row 4: September 24, 2008 \u2013 not it.\n6. Row 5: September 23, 2009 \u2013 this matches! So that's one episode.\n7. Row 6: September 24, 2010 \u2013 doesn't match.\n8. Row 7: September 23, 2011 \u2013 nope.\n\nWait, row 6 is September 24, 2010, and row 7 is September 23, 2011. So only one season premiere matches September 23, 2009, which is in row 5.\n\nSo there's only 1 episode where the season premiered on that date. The claim says \"more than 23 episodes,\" which clearly isn't true because it's way less. \n\nI should also check if I missed any rows or misread the dates. Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 0: Sept 22, 2004\n- Row1: Sept28,05\n- Row2: Sept20,06\n- Row3: Sept26,07\n- Row4:Sept24,08\n- Row5:Sept23,09 \u2013 yes\n- Row6:Sept24,10\n- Row7:Sept23,11\n\nNope, only row5 matches. So the count is 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are not more than 23 episodes; in fact, there's just one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are more than 23 episodes where the season premiere was on September 23, 2009. Upon examining each row of the table, only one episode matches this condition. Since 1 is less than 23, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season premiere\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 4: Season 4, which spans from September 26, 2007, to May 21, 2008. This matches the time frame of the claim.\nOther rows don't match this specific season.\n\nNext, I check the 'season finale' column for season 4. The data says \"may 21 , 2008.\" The claim states that September 26, 2007, is the season finale. However, the season finale in the table is May 21, 2008, not September 26, 2007.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion about the season finale date being September 26, 2007, doesn't align with the data in the table.
