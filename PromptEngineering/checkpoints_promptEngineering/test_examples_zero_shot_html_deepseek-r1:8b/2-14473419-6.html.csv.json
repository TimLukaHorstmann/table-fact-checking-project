    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the 48th game for the boston bruins record be 27 - 11 - 10\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has a few columns: game, march, opponent, score, and record. Each row represents a different game with specific details.\n\nThe claim is about the 48th game of the Boston Bruins. So I need to find the row where \"game\" is 48. Let's scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: game 44\n- Row 1: game 45\n- Row 2: game 46\n- Row 3: game 47\n- Row 4: game 48\n\nGot it, the relevant row is row index 4 (since rows are zero-indexed). Now, within that row, I need to check which columns are relevant. The claim talks about the \"record\" being a specific value.\n\nLooking at the row for game 48:\n\n- game: 48\n- march:14\n- opponent:boston bruins\n- score:0 - 0 ot\n- record:27 - 11 - 10\n\nThe claim is specifically about the record, so the \"record\" column in this row is what we need to verify. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. The row where game=48 (row index 4).\n2. The \"record\" column in that row.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because the record matches the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"game 44 on March 2, Toronto Maple Leafs have a record of 25 - 10 - 9.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure and see what each column represents. The table has columns for game number, march (which I assume is the date), opponent, score, and record. Each row corresponds to a specific game.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game 44 on March 2.\" Looking at the table, I need to find the row where the game number is 44 and the month is March, which is represented by the column named \"march\". \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Game 44, March 2. Opponent is Toronto Maple Leafs. Score is 1 - 1 ot. Record is 25 - 10 -9.\n- Row 1: Game 45, March 3. Opponent is Chicago Black Hawks. Score is 2 -1. Record is 26 -10 -9.\n- And so on.\n\nSo, game 44 is indeed in row 0 of the table. The opponent listed there is Toronto Maple Leafs, which matches the claim. The date (march) is 2, as given.\n\nNext, I check the score and record columns. The claim states that their record after this game was 25 -10 -9. Looking at row 0, the record column shows exactly that: 25 -10 -9.\n\nWait a minute, but in another part of the table, there's another entry for game 48 where the record becomes 27 -11 -10. That means as more games are played, the record changes. So, for game 44, the record is still 25-10-9 after that game, which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim check out based on the table data provided. The relevant cells are row 0's \"record\" column and also possibly the opponent if needed, but since the opponent isn't part of the claim's record statement, maybe only the record is necessary.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that after game 44 on March 2 against the Toronto Maple Leafs, their record was 25-10-9. Checking the table, game 44 on March 2 has a record of 25-10-9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim: \"27 - 11 - 9 record be on march of 14.\" I need to determine if this is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a \"record\" which in the context of sports likely refers to the team's win-loss-tie record. The specific numbers are 27-11-9. Then it says this record is \"on march of 14.\" I think that means on March 14th or during March, but since dates aren't provided in the table, maybe it refers to the month's progression.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with columns: game number, date (march), opponent, score, and record. The 'record' column shows the team's wins, losses, and ties up to that point. So for each game, we can track how many wins, losses, and ties they have accumulated.\n\nThe claim is specifically about a 27-11-9 record on March 14. Wait, looking at the table, I see several games:\n\n- Game 44: March 2 vs Toronto, score 1-1 OT. Record after this game was 25-10-9.\n- Game 45: March 3 vs Chicago, score 2-1. Record becomes 26-10-9.\n- Game 46: March 10 vs NY Americans, score 4-2. Record now 27-10-9.\n- Game 47: March 12 vs Boston, score 2-1. Record is 27-11-9.\n- Game 48: March 14 vs Boston, score 0-0 OT. Record becomes 27-11-10.\n\nSo the record of 27-11-9 occurred after game 47 on March 12th, not on March 14th. After game 48, which is on March 14th, the record increases to 27-11-10, meaning they have another tie. Therefore, by March 14, the record isn't still 27-11-9 but has moved to 27-11-10.\n\nThe claim states that the 27-11-9 record is on March 14th, which is not accurate because after game 48 on March 14th, the record changes. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the 48th game having a record of 27 - 11 - 10 on March 2 is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has columns: game, march, opponent, score, and record. Each row represents a different game with specific details. \n\nThe claim mentions \"48th game,\" so I need to find that in the table. Scanning through the 'game' column, I see the numbers 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. So, the 48th game is indeed present.\n\nNext, the claim states the record for this game was 27 - 11 - 10 on March 2. Let's check the corresponding row. For game 48, the 'march' column shows 14 and the 'score' column shows '0 - 0 ot'. The 'record' for game 48 is listed as 27 - 11 - 10.\n\nNow, I need to verify if the date in the table matches March 2. The 'march' column only has the day number, not the full date. So, it's stated as 14 in game 48. But the claim says March 2. Since there's no year mentioned and the table doesn't provide the exact date beyond the day, I can't confirm that March 14 is March 2 unless it's a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The 'march' column for game 48 shows 14. So if it's March 14th, then the claim saying March 2 is incorrect. Therefore, the date in the table doesn't match the claim's date.\n\nSo, the record part matches, but the date does not. Since the claim includes both the record and the specific date, and only the record matches, the entire statement isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 48th game had a record of 27 - 11 - 10 on March 2. The table confirms the record but shows the game was played on March 14, not March 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"march\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
