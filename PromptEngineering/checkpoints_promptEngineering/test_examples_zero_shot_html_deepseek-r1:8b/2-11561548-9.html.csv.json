    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license, 2 of which run on window.\" So I need to verify two main points here:\n\n1. Corn is one of three emulators with a proprietary license.\n2. Out of these three, two run on Windows.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should focus on the relevant columns: 'name', 'license', and 'platform'.\n\nStarting with the first part: Are there exactly three emulators listed in the table that have a proprietary license? Let me scan through each row's 'license' column.\n\n- 1964: GPL v2\n- 1964js: GPL v2\n- cen64: BSD 3 - clause\n- corn: Proprietary\n- daedalusx64: GPL v2\n- mupen64: GPL v2\n- mupen64plus: GPL v2\n- mupen64plus , android edition (ae): GPL v3\n- n64js: expat\n- project64: GPL v2\n- sixtyforce: Proprietary\n- ultrahle: Proprietary\n\nSo, the emulators with a proprietary license are corn and sixtyforce. Wait, that's only two, not three. Hmm, maybe I missed one? Let me check again. No, looking at each row, only corn and sixtyforce have 'proprietary' listed under license. So there are only two, not three. That might be an issue because the claim says \"1 of 3.\" If that's incorrect, then the entire claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread some entries. Let me double-check:\n\n- corn: Proprietary\n- sixtyforce: Proprietary\n- ultrahle: Proprietary\n\nOh, wait! Ultrahle also has 'proprietary' as its license. So that's three: corn, sixtyforce, and ultrahle. That makes sense now.\n\nSo the first part of the claim is correct: there are three emulators with proprietary licenses (corn, sixtyforce, ultrahle). Now, moving on to the second part: of these three, how many run on Windows?\n\nLooking at each emulator's platform:\n\n- corn: windows\n- sixtyforce: os x\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox\n\nSo, corn runs on Windows. Ultrahle also runs on Windows and Xbox. Sixtyforce runs only on OS X.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"2 of which run on window.\" So does 'window' refer to Windows? I think so. So corn runs on Windows, ultrahle runs on Windows as well. That's two. But wait, in the table, ultrahle is listed under platform as windows and xbox, so it does indeed run on Windows. Therefore, out of the three, two (corn and ultrahle) run on Windows.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are true: there are three emulators with proprietary licenses, and two of them (corn and ultrahle) run on Windows. \n\nWait a second, but in the table, ultrahle's row is listed as:\n\n<td>ultrahle</td>\n<td>1.0.0</td>\n<td>nintendo 64</td>\n<td>windows , xbox</td>\n<td>proprietary</td>\n\nSo yes, it runs on Windows and Xbox. So that makes two emulators (corn and ultrahle) running on Windows among the three with proprietary licenses.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license, 2 of which run on window.\" \n\nUpon analyzing the table:\n\n- **Proprietary Licenses**: There are three emulators (corn, sixtyforce, ultrahle) with proprietary licenses.\n- **Windows Platforms**: Out of these three, corn and ultrahle run on Windows.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator\" is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to mupen64. Scanning through the rows, I see that mupen64 is listed as one of the emulators. Specifically, it's at row index 5 and 6. \n\nLooking at column 'platform' for these rows:\n- For mupen64 (row 5), the platforms are windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd, qnx beos.\n- For mupen64plus (row 6), the platforms include windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd.\n- Then there's mupen64plus , android edition (ae) at row 7, with platform 'android'.\n\nNow, I need to check other emulators in the table to see how many unique platforms they support. Let me go through each one:\n\n1. **1964**: Platforms - windows, xbox. That's 2.\n2. **1964js**: JavaScript only. So that's 1.\n3. **cen64**: Windows, OS X, Linux. 3 platforms.\n4. **corn**: Only windows. 1.\n5. **daedalusx64**: Windows, PSP. 2.\n6. **mupen64plus , android edition (ae)**: Android only. 1.\n7. **n64js**: JavaScript only. 1.\n8. **project64**: Windows, Xbox. 2.\n9. **sixtyforce**: OS X only. 1.\n10. **ultrahle**: Windows, Xbox. 2.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed some entries. Let me check each row again:\n\n- **1964js**: platforms are JavaScript. So just 1.\n- **mupen64plus , android edition (ae)**: Android only. So 1.\n- **n64js**: JavaScript. 1.\n\nNow, looking at mupen64 and its variants:\n- mupen64 has 5 platforms: windows, os x, linux, freebsd, qnx beos.\n- mupen64plus has 4 platforms: windows, os x, linux, freebsd.\n- mupen64plus , android edition (ae) adds Android. So that's another platform.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator\". So does mupen64 support more platforms than others? Let me count all emulators:\n\nLooking at each row's 'platform' column for all emulators:\n\n- 1964: 2\n- 1964js: 1\n- cen64: 3 (windows, os x, linux)\n- corn: 1\n- daedalusx64: 2 (windows, psp)\n- mupen64:5\n- mupen64plus:4\n- mupen64plus , android edition (ae):1\n- n64js:1\n- project64:2\n- sixtyforce:1\n- ultrahle:2\n\nSo, the maximum number of platforms is 5, which is mupen64. Wait, no, mupen64plus has 4, and the Android edition adds 1 more platform. But the row for mupen64plus , android edition (ae) says 'android', so it's only one platform. So that doesn't add to the total.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator\". So does mupen64 have more platforms than all others? Let me check each emulator:\n\n- 1964:2\n- 1964js:1\n- cen64:3\n- corn:1\n- daedalusx64:2\n- mupen64:5\n- mupen64plus:4\n- mupen64plus , android edition (ae):1\n- n64js:1\n- project64:2\n- sixtyforce:1\n- ultrahle:2\n\nYes, mupen64 has the highest number of platforms at 5. Now, are there any other emulators with more? No, all others have less.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"run 1 more platform than any other emulator\". So does that mean mupen64 supports one additional platform compared to each of them? Let me check:\n\nCompare mupen64 (5) to each other emulator:\n- 1964:2 \u2192 difference is 3\n- 1964js:1 \u2192 difference is 4\n- cen64:3 \u2192 difference is 2\n- corn:1 \u2192 difference is 4\n- daedalusx64:2 \u2192 difference is 3\n- mupen64plus:4 \u2192 difference is 1 (since it's one less)\nWait, no. The claim says \"run 1 more platform than any other emulator\". So does that mean each of them has n platforms, and mupen64 has n+1?\n\nBut looking at the table, none of the other emulators have 5 platforms. Only mupen64 does. So the claim would be correct because it has one more than all others.\n\nWait, but in the row for mupen64plus , android edition (ae), is that a separate emulator? Yes, each row represents an emulator. So mupen64 has 5, which is higher than any other. Therefore, the claim seems true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator\" is **false** because multiple emulators support the same or fewer platforms as mupen64.\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluation:\n\n- The maximum number of platforms among emulators is indeed held by mupen64 with 5.\n- No other emulator supports 5 or more platforms.\n\nTherefore, mupen64 does not have exactly one more platform than any other emulator; it has the highest count. Hence, the claim's wording might be misleading.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe claim is false as no other emulator supports as many platforms as mupen64.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"emulator\": \"mupen64\",\n  \"platforms\": [\"windows\", \"os x\", \"gnu / linux\", \"freebsd\", \"qnx beos\"]\n}\n```",

It lists various emulators along with details like their current version, system, platform, and license. My goal is to count how many entries are under GPL v2 and GPL v3 licenses.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row (row 0) has a license of GPL v2.\n2. Row 1 also has GPL v2.\n3.

The table lists several emulators with their platforms they support.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. 1964: Runs on Windows and Xbox.\n2. 1964js: Also runs on JavaScript.\n3. cen64: Supports multiple systems including Windows, OS X, Linux, etc., but not specifically Android.\n4. corn: Only Windows.\n5. daedalusx64: Windows and PSP.\n6. mupen64: Various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS.\n7. mupen64plus: Similar to above, supports Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD.\n8. mupen64plus, Android Edition (ae): Specifically for Android.\n9. n64js: Runs in JavaScript.\n10. project64: Windows and Xbox.\n11. sixtyforce: OS X only.\n12. ultrahle: Windows and Xbox.\n\nFrom this, I notice that none of the other entries are specifically designed to run on Android except mupen64plus, Android Edition (ae).

Looking at the 'platform' column for each row:\n\n- Only the last row mentions Android in its platform support.\n- The other entries either don't mention Android or have broader platforms like Windows, JavaScript, etc.\n\nSo, based on the table, mupen64plus, Android Edition is the only one explicitly listed to run on Android.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim again: it says that only three emulators run on both Windows and Xbox. So, my task is to check how many emulators in the table have versions that support both platforms.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an emulator with its details. The columns relevant here are \"name\" (the emulator), \"current version\", \"system\", \"platform\", and \"license\". But since the claim mentions running on both Windows and Xbox, I should focus on the \"platform\" column to see which emulators support both.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **1964**: Platforms are Windows and Xbox. So this is one.\n2. **1964js**: Only JavaScript, so probably not relevant for Windows or Xbox.\n3. **cen64**: Supports multiple platforms including Windows, OS X, and Linux. No mention of Xbox here.\n4. **corn**: Only Windows.\n5. **daedalusx64**: Supports Windows and PSP. Not Xbox.\n6. **mupen64**: Multiple platforms: Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, QNX BeOS.

Wait, no\u20141964 is one, project64 is two, ultrahle is three. Let me recount:\n\n- 1964: Windows & Xbox \u2192 counts as 1\n- project64: Windows & Xbox \u2192 2\n- ultrahle: Windows & Xbox \u2192 3\n\nWait, that's only three. Did I miss any?

But wait, let's make sure there aren't more. I'll check all rows.\n\nLooking through the \"platform\" column:\n\n- Only 1964, project64, and ultrahle have platforms that include both Windows and Xbox.\n- The others either don't support both (like mupen64 which is on many OSes but not Xbox) or are for other systems like PSP, OS X, etc.\n\nSo the count is three. Thus, the claim says \"only 3 emulator run on both window and xbox,\" which seems to be TRUE based on the table.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if any other emulators support both. Let me look again:\n\n- 1964: Windows, Xbox \u2192 yes\n- project64: same\n- ultrahle: same\n\nNo others in the list.

The claim says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license and 1 of 2 which run on window, and also be compatible with javascript.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. \n\nThe first part mentions \"corn\" being one of three emulators with a proprietary license. Looking at the table, I need to find out how many emulators have a proprietary license. From the table:\n\n- corn: Proprietary\n- sixtyforce: Proprietary\n- ultrahle: Proprietary\n\nThat's three emulators. So, \"corn\" is indeed one of three with a proprietary license.\n\nNext, the claim states that \"corn be 1 of 2 which run on window.\" Wait, I think there might be a typo here\u2014should it be \"windows\"? Anyway, checking the table for corn's platform: It runs on Windows. Now, looking at other emulators:\n\n- project64: Runs on Windows and Xbox\n- sixtyforce: Runs on OS X\n- ultrahle: Runs on Windows and Xbox\n\nSo, which emulators run on Windows? corn, project64, and ultrahle. That's three, not two. Hmm, the claim says \"1 of 2,\" but according to the table, there are more than two that run on Windows. This might be an issue.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions \"be compatible with javascript.\" Looking at corn in the table, under license it's proprietary, and I don't see a compatibility with JavaScript mentioned in any column except perhaps the 'system' or 'platform.' Wait, the columns are name, current version, system, platform, license. There's no specific mention of compatibility with JavaScript. \n\nWait, in the table, the 'system' column for corn is \"windows,\" and another emulator like n64js runs on javascript. But since corn's row doesn't have a JavaScript-related entry, maybe the claim about compatibility with JavaScript isn't supported.\n\nSo, putting it together: The first part of the claim is correct\u2014corn is one of three with proprietary licenses. However, the second part says corn is one of two running on Windows, which is incorrect because there are actually three (corn, project64, ultrahle).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator, include javascript.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of the claim means and check it against the table.\n\nLet me start by understanding the claim in two parts:\n1. \"run 1 more platform than any other emulator\" \n2. \", include javascript\"\n\nI think this is saying that mupen64 supports more platforms than any other emulator listed in the table, and specifically includes JavaScript as one of those platforms.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant information about each emulator's supported platforms. The key column here is \"platform\". So I should focus on the \"platform\" column for each emulator.\n\nI'll go through each row in the \"platform\" column and see which ones are relevant.\n\nStarting with mupen64:\n- Row index: 5\n- Platform: windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd, qnx beos\n\nNext, mupen64plus:\n- Row index: 6\n- Platform: windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd\n\nThen, mupen64plus , android edition (ae):\n- Row index: 7\n- Platform: android\n\nNow, checking other emulators for their platform support to see if any have more than mupen64.\n\nLooking at the other rows:\n- 1964: windows, xbox\n- 1964js: javascript\n- cen64: windows, os x, gnu / linux\n- corn: windows\n- daedalusx64: windows, psp\n- n64js: javascript\n- project64: windows, xbox\n- sixtyforce: os x\n- ultrahle: windows, xbox\n\nNow, let's count the number of platforms each supports. For mupen64 and related:\n\n- mupen64: 5 platforms (windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd, qnx beos)\n- mupen64plus: 4 platforms\n- mupen64plus , android edition: 1 platform (android)\n\nSo mupen64 supports the most with 5 platforms. \n\nNow, checking if any other emulator supports more than that. From the table, no other emulator has more than 5 platforms listed. For example, cen64 supports windows, os x, gnu / linux (3), which is less than 5. The others have fewer.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions including JavaScript. Looking at mupen64's platform list, it doesn't include JavaScript. However, there are two other emulators that do: 1964js and n64js, both listed under \"javascript\". But the claim specifically talks about mupen64, so their support for JavaScript isn't relevant here.\n\nWait, but the second part of the claim is \", include javascript.\" So does this mean that mupen64 includes JavaScript as one of its platforms? From the table, it doesn't. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect on this point.\n\nSo putting it together: mupen64 does run more platforms than any other emulator (5), but it doesn't support JavaScript. However, the claim says both \"run 1 more platform\" and includes JavaScript. Since mupen64 doesn't include JavaScript, the second part is false, making the entire claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Perhaps the claim means that mupen64 runs on one additional platform beyond what others do, which would be true since it has 5 platforms, more than any other. But then the \", include javascript\" part might be a separate point, saying that mupen64 includes JavaScript as an extra. Since it doesn't, this part is false.\n\nTherefore, since both parts must be correct for the claim to hold, and one part is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator , include javascript.\" \n\n- **Platform Support**: mupen64 supports 5 platforms, which is indeed more than any other emulator listed in the table. \n- **JavaScript Support**: However, mupen64 does not support JavaScript as per the table.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect (lack of JavaScript support), the overall claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"platform\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"there be 6 emulator release under the gpl v2 license , but only sixtyforce be release under the gpl v3 license.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns in the table. The columns are name, current version, system, platform, and license. Since the claim is about licenses (gpl v2 and gpl v3), I should focus on the \"license\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones have either GPL v2 or GPL v3 licenses.\n\nStarting with GPL v2:\n\n1. 1964 - GPL v2\n2. 1964js - GPL v2\n3. cen64 - BSD 3 - clause (not GPL)\n4. corn - Proprietary (not GPL)\n5. daedalusx64 - GPL v2\n6. mupen64 - GPL v2\n7. mupen64plus - GPL v2\n8. mupen64plus, Android Edition (ae) - GPL v3\n9. n64js - Expat (not GPL)\n10. project64 - GPL v2\n11. sixtyforce - Proprietary (not GPL)\n12. ultrahle - Proprietary (not GPL)\n\nSo, the emulators under GPL v2 are: 1964, 1964js, daedalusx64, mupen64, mupen64plus, and project64. That's six emulators.\n\nNow, looking for GPL v3: Only sixtyforce is listed as Proprietary, not GPL. Wait, in the table, I see that mupen64plus, Android Edition (ae) has GPL v3. So that's one emulator under GPL v3.\n\nWait, let me check again. Row 8: \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" - license is GPL v3. So that's one emulator under GPL v3.\n\nThe claim says only sixtyforce is released under GPL v3. But in reality, mupen64plus Android Edition is also under GPL v3. So the claim is incorrect on this part.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 8: license is GPL v3.\n- Row 11: sixtyforce is proprietary.\nSo, only one emulator (mupen64plus ae) is under GPL v3, not sixtyforce.\n\nThus, the claim says six under GPL v2 and only sixtyforce under GPL v3. But since mupen64plus Android Edition is under GPL v3, the second part of the claim is wrong. So the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are six emulators under GPL v2 and only sixtyforce under GPL v3. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- Six emulators (1964, 1964js, daedalusx64, mupen64, mupen64plus, project64) are indeed under GPL v2.\n- Only \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" is listed as being under GPL v3, not sixtyforce.\n\nThus, the claim's assertion about sixtyforce being the only one under GPL v3 is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"only 3 emulator run on both window and xbox , corn , daedalusx64 , and mupen64\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions that only three emulators run on both Windows and Xbox. These three are Corn, DaedalusX64, and Mupen64.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an emulator with details like name, current version, system, platform, and license. My task is to find out which of these three emulators have a platform that includes both Windows and Xbox.\n\nStarting with Corn: The row for Corn shows the platform as \"windows\". There's no mention of Xbox here, so it only runs on Windows, not both.\n\nNext, DaedalusX64: This emulator's platform is listed as \"windows , psp\". Again, no Xbox mentioned. So it doesn't run on both.\n\nThen, Mupen64: The platform includes \"windows , os x , gnu / linux , freebsd , qnx beos\" but also \"windows , xbox\" in another row? Wait, no. Actually, each row's platform is for the specific version. For example, Mupen64 has platforms including Windows and others, but does it specifically include Xbox?\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\n- Corn: windows\n- DaedalusX64: windows, psp\n- Mupen64: multiple platforms, including Windows, but not explicitly mentioning Xbox in its platform column.\n- Mupen64plus includes Windows and others, not Xbox.\n\nLooking for any emulator that runs on both Windows and Xbox. Project64 has platform as \"windows , xbox\". But the claim only mentions Corn, DaedalusX64, and Mupen64, not Project64.\n\nSo, in the table:\n\n- Project64 runs on both Windows and Xbox.\n- The claim doesn't include Project64 but includes Corn, DaedalusX64, and Mupen64, which don't run on Xbox.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false because only one emulator (Project64) runs on both Windows and Xbox, not three as claimed. Also, the relevant cells are where each of these three emulators' platform columns are located to verify their support for both platforms.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only three emulators run on both Windows and Xbox: Corn, DaedalusX64, and Mupen64. However, upon examining the table, only Project64 runs on both platforms, not the listed ones.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae) be the only emulator that runs on android and javascript.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant rows in the table. The name column has entries like 'mupen64plus' which is under Android Edition (AE). So this row is definitely relevant because it's about mupen64plus AE.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are any other emulators that run on Android and JavaScript. Looking through the platform column, I see some options: Javascript, Windows, OS X, Xbox, etc. The 'n64js' emulator runs on javascript, but does it run on Android? Let me check its row. Yes, n64js is in the table with the platform as Javascript, so that's another relevant cell.\n\nSo, besides mupen64plus AE, n64js also runs on JavaScript and Android.
