    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"player nick rimando , kyle beckerman , chris wingert , and nat borchers be from the usa\". \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is asking. It's stating that four specific players\u2014Nick Rimando, Kyle Beckerman, Chris Wingert, and Nat Borchers\u2014are from the USA. My task is to verify this by checking each player's information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: rank, player, nation, caps, goals, years. Since the claim is about the nationality of each player, I need to focus on the \"nation\" column for each of them.\n\nI'll start with Nick Rimando. His row is the first one (row_index 0). The \"nation\" column says \"usa\". So that checks out\u2014he's from the USA.\n\nNext, Kyle Beckerman is in row 2 (row_index 3 because indexing starts at 0? Wait, no, let me recount. The table has rows from 1 to 10, but the indices are probably 0-based. So row 0: Nick Rimando, row 1: Andy Williams, row 2: Kyle Beckerman, and so on. So for Kyle Beckerman, his \"nation\" is also \"usa\". That's correct.\n\nChris Wingert is in row 3 (index 3). His nation is \"usa\", so he's from the USA as well.\n\nNat Borchers is in row 4 (index 4). His nation is listed as \"usa\". So all four players are indeed from the USA based on the table data.\n\nI should also make sure I'm checking each player individually to avoid missing any. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Nick Rimando: usa \u2013 correct.\n2. Kyle Beckerman: usa \u2013 correct.\n3. Chris Wingert: usa \u2013 correct.\n4. Nat Borchers: usa \u2013 correct.\n\nSince all four players have their \"nation\" column as \"usa\", the claim holds true. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For each player, I'll note their row index and the \"nation\" column. So:\n\n- Nick Rimando: row 0, nation.\n- Kyle Beckerman: row 2, nation.\n- Chris Wingert: row 3, nation.\n- Nat Borchers: row 4, nation.\n\nThese are the relevant cells that support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

In the table, there's a row where rank is 9. The player's name matches, so that's correct. His years are listed as 2007 - 2012, which aligns with what the claim says. \n\nNext, checking his nation. In the table, under the 'nation' column for this row, it shows \"arg\". So Fabi\u00e1n is from Argentina. That part checks out.\n\nNow, moving on to Javier Morales. The claim mentions him as well, so I'll find his row in the table. His rank is 6, and his name matches. His years are listed as 2007 - present, which matches the claim's description.\n\nLooking at his nation column for Javier Morales, it says \"arg\".

The claim states: \"player kyle beckerman from the usa have 21 goal , but player nat borchers from the usa have only 9 goal.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about Kyle Beckerman having 21 goals, and the second part is about Nat Borchers having 9 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows for both players. \n\nStarting with Kyle Beckerman: his name appears in row index 2 (since rows are zero-indexed? Wait, no, looking back, the first row is rank 1, which would be row_index 0. So, the first row is index 0, second is 1, etc. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\n...\nSo, Kyle Beckerman is in rank 3, so that's row index 2.\n\nIn row 2 (index 2), I see the player is Kyle Beckerman, nation USA, caps 177, goals 21. So his goals are indeed 21. That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, Nat Borchers: looking for him in the table. He's listed as rank 5, so row index 4. Checking row 4 (index 4), player is Nat Borchers, nation USA, caps 173, goals 9. So his goals are 9, which matches the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

The claim says: \"player ned grabavoy from the usa have 8 goal while player tony beltran have 0 goal.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which players are mentioned in the claim. The claim specifically talks about Ned Grabavoy and Tony Beltran. So, I'll need to check their respective data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with various attributes like rank, nation, caps, goals, etc. Let me scan through each row until I find the players mentioned.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 1: Nick Rimando\n- Row 2: Andy Williams\n- Row 3: Kyle Beckerman\n- Row 4: Chris Wingert\n- Row 5: Nat Borchers\n- Row 6: Javier Morales\n- Row 7: Tony Beltran\n- Row 8: Ned Grabavoy\n- Row 9: Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola\n- Row 10: Robbie Findley\n\nSo, Tony Beltran is in row 7 and Ned Grabavoy is in row 8. Now, I need to look at the 'goals' column for both players.\n\nFor Tony Beltran (row 7), the goals column shows '0'. That matches the claim which says he has 0 goals. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, for Ned Grabavoy (row 8), the goals column has '8'. The claim states he has 8 goals, so that also aligns perfectly.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table, the claim should be TRUE. \n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this. For Tony Beltran, his row is index 7 and the column is 'goals'. For Ned Grabavoy, it's row index 8, same 'goals' column.\n\nI think that's all the necessary information.

So, my task is to check each of these four players in the table and see if they are indeed not from the USA.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: rank, player, nation, caps, goals, years.

So that means he is from the USA, which directly contradicts the claim because the claim says he's not from the USA.\n\nNext, Kyle Beckerman is ranked 3, and his nation is also 'usa'. Again, this shows he's from the USA, so the claim about him being not from the USA is false.\n\nChris Wingert, ranked 4, has 'usa' as his nation. So same situation here; he's from the USA, making the claim incorrect for him as well.\n\nLastly, Nat Borchers is ranked 5, and his nation is 'usa'.

Therefore, the answer should be false, and I need to list the relevant cells for both players in their respective rows.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look up the number of goals each player scored from the table.\n\nFor Ned Grabavoy (row 8), the \"goals\" column shows 8, which is not less than 8. For Tony Beltr\u00e1n (row 7), the \"goals\" column shows 0, not 5. Both parts of the claim are false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
