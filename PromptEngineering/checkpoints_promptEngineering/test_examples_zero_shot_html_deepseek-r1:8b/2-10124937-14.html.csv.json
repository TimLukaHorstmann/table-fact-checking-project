    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nThe claim says: \"When Marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3 - 1.\" So I need to check if in the row where the team is Marseille, the first leg score is 3-1.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows. The first thing I'll do is locate the row for Marseille. Scanning through the 'team 1' column, I find that Marseille is listed as one of the teams.\n\nNow, focusing on Marseille's row, I need to check both the 'agg' (aggregate) score and the '1st leg' score. The claim mentions the first leg's score specifically, so I should look at that column.\n\nIn the row for Marseille, under 'team 2', it says zenit st petersburg. But more importantly, under '1st leg', the score is 3-1. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nHowever, there's an asterisk in the aggregate score: \"3 - 3 ( a )\". Does this affect anything? The claim only refers to the first leg, not the aggregate, so maybe it doesn't matter for this check.\n\nSo, Marseille is indeed the first team, and their first leg score against zenit st petersburg is 3-1. That means the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should also ensure that there are no other relevant cells beyond what's checked. The 'row_index' is 7 for Marseille, since counting starts at 0. So row_index=7.\n\nIn summary, the only relevant cell is the '1st leg' column in Marseille's row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data. Marseille's first leg score against zenit st petersburg is indeed 3-1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is true or false. The claim in question is: \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that for Bolton Wanderers, both the first leg and second leg scores are equal. So, I'll have to look into the table provided to find the relevant data.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table: it has columns for team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams. The claim specifically mentions \"bolton wanderer\" as team 1, so I should look for that in the 'team 1' column.\n\nLet me go through each row to find where Bolton Wanderers are:\n\n- Row 0: team 1 is andlerlecht \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 1: team 1 is rangers \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: team 1 is bolton wanderers. Yes, this is the one we need.\n\nNow, for this row, I need to check both the '1st leg' and '2nd leg' columns. Let's see what those scores are:\n\n- 1st leg score: Bolton Wanderers vs. Sporting CP \u2013 according to the table, it's 1 - 1.\n- 2nd leg score: The same teams again? Wait, no. The 2nd leg is between Bolton Wanderers and... looking at 'team 2' column for row 2, it's Sporting CP. So, both legs are against Sporting CP.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says that the first leg and second leg scores are the same. But according to the table, the first leg is 1 - 1, and the second leg is 0 - 1. Those are not equal. So, the claim doesn't hold here.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\n- 1st leg: Bolton Wanderers vs. Sporting CP \u2013 1 - 1.\n- 2nd leg: Same teams? No, wait, looking at 'team 2' in row 2 is Sporting CP. So, both legs are against the same opponent. The scores are different.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the first leg score (1-1) and second leg score (0-1) aren't the same. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other rows where Bolton Wanderers appear as team 1. Scanning through the table again:\n\nRow 2 is the only one where team 1 is Bolton Wanderers. So no, that's the only relevant row.\n\nAdditionally, I should note which columns are relevant for this check. Since the claim refers to both legs, we need to include '1st leg' and '2nd leg' from that specific row.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we locate Bolton Wanderers in the table and compare their first and second leg scores.\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the relevant team: Bolton Wanderers are in **row_index 2** as team 1.\n- **Step 2:** Check the '1st leg' score for this row: 1 - 1.\n- **Step 3:** Check the '2nd leg' score for this row: 0 - 1.\n- **Step 4:** Compare the two scores. Since 1 - 1 \u2260 0 - 1, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is false because the first and second leg scores for Bolton Wanderers are not equal.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
