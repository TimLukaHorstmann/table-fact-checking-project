    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim. The claim is: \"21.16 (142) be the home team score for fitzroy.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table row by row to find any mention of Fitzroy as the home team. The table has a column called 'home team', so that's where I should start.\n\nLooking at the first row, the home team is footscray, which isn't Fitzroy, so I can skip that. Second row: home team is fitzroy. That's relevant because the claim is about Fitzroy. So, this row might have the score we're looking for.\n\nThe third row has north melbourne as the home team, not Fitzroy. Fourth row: hawthorn is the home team. Fifth: essendon, sixth: swans. None of these are Fitzroy except the second row.\n\nNow, focusing on the second row where home team is fitzroy. The 'home team score' column has 21.16 (142). That's exactly what the claim states. So the score matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because in the table, there's a row where the home team is Fitzroy and their score is 21.16 (142).\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the 'home team' and 'home team score' columns for Fitzroy, which matches exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table. The claim says, \"16.22 (118) be the away team score against a home team score of 20.20 (140).\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which parts of the claim correspond to specific cells in the table. The claim mentions two scores: one for the away team and one for the home team. Each score is in the format \"number.number (score)\", so I need to identify these in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a home team, home team score, away team, and away team score. So for the claim, I'm looking for a row where the home team score is 20.20 (140) and the away team score is 16.22 (118). \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is footscray with a score of 7.8 (50), away team is richmond with 16.16 (112). Doesn't match.\n2. Row 1: Fitzroy scored 21.16 (142) as home, St Kilda scored 11.12 (78) away. Not matching.\n3. Row 2: North Melbourne 22.18 (150), Geelong 11.16 (82). No.\n4. Row 3: Hawthorn is home with 20.20 (140), Collingwood away with 16.22 (118). This matches the claim exactly.\n5. The rest of the rows have different scores that don't match.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in row 3. The columns are \"home team score\" and \"away team score\". \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a matching row with those specific scores.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"when 16.22 (118) be the away team score , the home team score be the highest.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any rows where the away team's score is 16.22 (118). Let me scan each row in the 'away team' and 'away team score' columns.\n\nLooking at the first row: away team is Richmond with a score of 16.16 (112) \u2013 that doesn't match.\nSecond row: St Kilda scored 11.12 (78), so no.\nThird: Geelong, 11.16 (82). Nope.\nFourth: Collingwood, 16.22 (118) \u2013 this matches! So the fourth row is where the away team score is 16.22 (118).\n\nNow, I need to check if in that same row, the home team's score is the highest. The home team for that row is Hawthorn with a score of 20.20 (140). Let me compare this with other rows to see if it's indeed the highest.\n\nLooking at all home team scores:\n- Footscray: 7.8 (50)\n- Fitzroy: 21.16 (142)\n- North Melbourne: 22.18 (150)\n- Hawthorn: 20.20 (140)\n- Essendon: 20.17 (137)\n- Swans: 15.16 (106)\n\nSo the highest home team score is North Melbourne with 22.18 (150). Therefore, Hawthorn's 20.20 (140) isn't the highest. The claim says when away is 16.22 (118), home should be the highest, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, does the claim specify only that particular instance? Or does it mean generally? Because if there's a row where away is 16.22 (118) and home isn't the highest, then the claim is false. In this case, the fourth row is such an example, so the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim fails because when the away team scores 16.22 (118), the home team doesn't have the highest score in that instance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"21.16 (142) home team score have a away team of fitzroy.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions a home team score of 21.16 (142) and specifies that the away team is Fitzroy.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between a home team and an away team. The relevant columns are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and \"home team score.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the home team score matches 21.16 (142) and whether the away team is Fitzroy.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Home team: footscray, score: 7.8 (50). Doesn't match.\nSecond row:\n- Home team: fitzroy, score: 21.16 (142). This matches the score mentioned in the claim. Now, check the away team for this row.\nLooking at \"away team\" column: it's st kilda, not Fitzroy. So this doesn't support the claim.\n\nContinuing to the next rows to see if there's another match:\nThird row: north melbourne with a higher score, away team geelong.\nFourth: hawthorn vs collingwood.\nFifth: Essendon vs Melbourne.\nSixth: Swans vs Carlton.\n\nNone of these have the score 21.16 (142) except the second row where home team is Fitzroy but against st kilda. Therefore, there's no match where the away team is Fitzroy with that exact score.\n\nSo the claim seems to be false because although a team scored 21.16 (142), their opponent wasn't Fitzroy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
