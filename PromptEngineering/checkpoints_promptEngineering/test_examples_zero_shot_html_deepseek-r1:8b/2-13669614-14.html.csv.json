    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"jim maloney marshall bridge be the pitcher in the 7th inning of the game.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements are the pitcher's name and the inning. The claim mentions two names: Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridge. It also specifies the 7th inning.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like team, date, opponent, pitcher, inning, and venue. I need to check if any row has both Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridge listed as the pitcher in the 7th inning.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Pitcher is \"Jim Maloney (2) Marshall Bridges\". The inning is 7th. This matches the claim's description of Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridge being the pitchers in the 7th inning.\n   \n   Since there's a match here, I don't need to check further rows because the claim is about a specific game, and if it exists, it's already found.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Pitcher is Paul Foytack, inning 6th. Doesn't match.\n3. **Row 2**: Pitcher Dan Pfister and Vern Handrahan, inning 11th. Doesn't match.\n4. **Row 3**: Pitchers Jon Adkins and Trevor Hoffman, inning 9th. Doesn't match.\n5. **Row 4**: Pitcher Chase Wright, inning 3rd. Doesn't match.\n6. **Row 5**: Pitchers Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda, inning 6th. Doesn't match.\n7. **Row 6**: Pitcher Dave Bush, inning 4th. Doesn't match.\n\nOnly Row 0 has both Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridge as pitchers in the 7th inning. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in the table where Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridge are listed as pitchers in the 7th inning of a game on June 8, 1961.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the pitcher who set a record in the 7th inning be joel peralta robinson tejeda.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about a pitcher named Joel Peralta Robinson Tejeda setting a record in the 7th inning. Looking at the table, I should find any entries where the pitcher is Joel Peralta and the inning is the 7th.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Pitcher is Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridges. Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Pitcher is Paul Foytack. No.\nRow 2: Pitcher is Dan Pfister and Vern Handrahan. Not matching.\nRow 3: Pitcher is Jon Adkins and Trevor Hoffman. No.\nRow 4: Pitcher is Chase Wright. Nope.\nRow 5: Pitcher is Joel Peralta along with Robinson Tejeda, in the 6th inning. Wait, the claim mentions the 7th inning, so this doesn't fit.\nRow 6: Pitchers are Dave Bush. Not matching.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Looking at row 5 again, the pitcher is listed as Joel Peralta (3) and Robinson Tejeda, but the inning is the 6th. The claim says it's in the 7th inning. So there's no entry where the 7th inning and Joel Peralta are together.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if any other rows have Joel Peralta in the 7th inning. From what I see, only row 5 has him, but he was pitching in the 6th. There's no mention of a pitcher named Robinson Tejeda alone either.\n\nSo, it seems the claim is false because there's no evidence of Joel Peralta setting a record in the 7th inning according to the table provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
