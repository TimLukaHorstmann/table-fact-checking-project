The claim is: \"south sydney rabbitohs be the premier team that play in the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any relevant information related to this claim. The table has columns: points, score, premiers, runners up, and details.\n\nI'll start by checking if there's a row for the year 1951 because that's when the grand final supposedly happened according to the claim. Looking at the 'details' column:\n\n- Row 0: 1951 nswrfl grand final\n- Rows 1,2,3,4 are other years: 2008, 1975, 1998, 1994.\n\nSo only row 0 is relevant here because it mentions the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\n\nNow, looking at the 'premiers' column for row 0: south sydney rabbitohs. The claim states that they were the premier team in that final. So this seems to match.\n\nI should check if there's any other relevant cells beyond row 0 and the 'details' and 'premiers' columns, but since the claim is specifically about the 1951 grand final and the premiers, those are the only ones needed.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 0 for both 'details' and 'premiers' because they directly relate to the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The south sydney rabbitohs were indeed the premier team in the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"details\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"premiers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the brisbane bronco score 38 point in the 1998 nrl grand final\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions Brisbane Broncos scoring 38 points in the 1998 NRL Grand Final. So, I need to find a row in the table that matches these details.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: points, score, premiers, runners up, and details. The last column seems to provide additional information about each game.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Points 42, Score 42-14, Premiers South Sydney Rabbitohs, Runners-up Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Details 1951 NSWRFL Grand Final.\n   - Doesn't match the claim since it's about a different year and team.\n\n2. Second row: Points 40, Score 40-0, Premiers Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Runners-up Melbourne Storm, Details 2008 NRL Grand Final.\n   - Year is 2008, not 1998, so no match.\n\n3. Third row: Points 38, Score 38-0, Premiers Eastern Suburbs, Runners-up St George Dragons, Details 1975 NSWRFL Grand Final.\n   - While points are 38 and the year is mentioned as 1975 in details, the team isn't Brisbane Broncos.\n\n4. Fourth row: Points 38, Score 38-12, Premiers Brisbane Broncos, Runners-up Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details 1998 NRL Grand Final.\n   - Here, the points are 38, and the premiers are Brisbane Broncos. The details say it's the 1998 NRL Grand Final. This matches the claim.\n\n5. Fifth row: Points 36, Score 36-12, Premiers Canberra Raiders, Runners-up Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details 1994 NSWRL Grand Final.\n   - Not matching the year or team.\n\nSo, the fourth row is relevant because it has Brisbane Broncos scoring 38 points in the 1998 NRL Grand Final. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are from that row, specifically columns points and details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"details\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the eastern suburb score 38 point , and win 38 - 0.\" So, the claim has two parts\u2014checking that the points are 38 and that they won with a score of 38-0.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should examine each relevant cell. The table has columns: points, score, premiers, runners up, and details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"eastern suburb,\" so I need to find which row corresponds to this. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: south sydney rabbitohs\n2. Row 1: manly - warringah sea eagles\n3. Row 2: eastern suburbs\n4. Row 3: brisbane broncos\n5. Row 4: canberra raiders\n\nRow 2 is about \"eastern suburbs,\" so that's the relevant row.\n\nNext, check the points column for this row. The points are listed as 38, which matches the first part of the claim. So that checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the score column in row 2: it says \"38 - 0.\" That's exactly what the second part of the claim states\u2014winning with a score of 38-0.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are fully supported by the corresponding cells in the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"south sydney rabbitohs score 42 point but lose the game during the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\" So, the claim is making two main points about the South Sydney Rabbitohs in a specific game.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any row that mentions South Sydney Rabbitohs. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: south sydney rabbitohs\n- Row 2: eastern suburbs\n- Row 3: brisbane broncos\n- Row 4: canberra raiders\n\nOnly Row 0 directly refers to South Sydney Rabbitohs, so that's one relevant cell.\n\nNow, the claim says they scored 42 points. Looking at the 'points' column in Row 0, it shows 42. So the points part is confirmed.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that they lost the game. The 'result' isn't explicitly shown in the table, but we can infer it from the structure. In Row 0, under 'score', it's written as \"42 - 14.\" The presence of a subtraction (42-14) suggests that South Sydney Rabbitohs scored more points than their opponents, which typically means they won the game. So if they scored more and the result is implied by the score format, then this would mean they didn't lose; they likely won.\n\nHowever, the claim says they lost. That seems contradictory because a higher score usually indicates a win. Unless in some sports leagues, a lower score could mean something else, but generally, higher points lead to victory. So if South Sydney Rabbitohs scored 42 and their opponents only got 14, they probably won, not lost.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in certain contexts, \"score X - Y\" might indicate the margin of loss. For example, if it's written as \"X - Y\", maybe Y is the points they trailed by but still won. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that South Sydney Rabbitohs scored 42, which is a high number, and in Row 0, their opponents scored 14. That suggests a significant win, not a loss.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that they lost might be false because the score indicates a victory. So, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0, 'points' column: confirms the score.\n- Row 0, 'premiers' column: refers to the team in question.\n\nSo, even though the points show they scored, their result was a win, not a loss, which contradicts the claim. Hence, the answer should be FALSE, with the relevant cells being row 0 for both points and premiers.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the South Sydney Rabbitohs scored 42 points but won the game, not lost it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"premiers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog score 36 point at the 1994 nswrl grand final.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has several columns: points, score, premiers, runners up, and details. My task is to check if any of these rows match all parts of the claim.\n\nStarting with \"canterbury - bankstown bulldog\" as the team name. In the table, I scan through the 'premiers' column because that's where the winning teams are listed. \n\n- Row 4 has premiers as \"canberra raiders\".\n- Row 5 is about \"canterbury - bankstown bulldogs\", so that might be relevant.\n\nWait, looking back, actually, row indices start at 0. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: south sydney rabbitohs\nRow 1: manly - warringah sea eagles\nRow 2: eastern suburbs\nRow 3: brisbane broncos\nRow 4: canberra raiders\nRow 5: canterbury - bankstown bulldogs\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 5. Now, let's check the details column for that row. It says \"1994 nswrl grand final.\" The claim mentions \"1994 nswrl grand final,\" so that matches.\n\nNext, checking the points and score columns. The 'points' in row 5 is 36, which matches the claim stating they scored 36 points. The 'score' column shows \"36 - 12\", which indicates the team's score was 36 against a deficit of 12. That aligns with the claim mentioning a score of 36.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by row 5 in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row 5, 'points' and 'score' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the brisbane bronco score 38 point and win 38 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any entries related to Brisbane Broncos. Scanning each row's 'premiers' column:\n\n1. Row 3: Brisbane Broncos\n2. No others.\n\nSo only Row 3 is relevant for Brisbane Broncos.\n\nNow, checking if this row has a score of 38-0. The 'score' column in Row 3 says \"38 - 12\". That's not 38-0. So the score doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check. The claim says they scored 38 points and won by 38-0. But the table shows their score as 38-12. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the points for, not against. If 'score' refers to total points, then 38 points would match. However, in the context of sports, especially grand finals, the score usually reflects the winning margin (points for minus points against). Since the table shows \"38 - 12\", that means Brisbane scored 38 and their opponents scored 12. So the win was 38-12, not 38-0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states a different score than what's in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the Brisbane Broncos' score and victory doesn't match the information in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Brisbane Broncos scoring 12 points against Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"the brisbane bronco score a total of 12 point against canterbury - bankstown bulldog.\" So the claim states that the Brisbane Broncos scored 12 points in a match against Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns relevant here are 'points', 'score', 'premiers', and 'runners up'. The details column might also be useful to find the specific match.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Points 42, Score 42-14, Premiers South Sydney Rabbitohs, Runners-up Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Details 1951 NSWRFL Grand Final. This doesn't mention Brisbane Broncos or Canterbury Bulldogs.\n\n2. Second row: Points 40, Score 40-0, Premiers Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Runners-up Melbourne Storm, Details 2008 NRL Grand Final. Again, not related to the claim's teams.\n\n3. Third row: Points 38, Score 38-0, Premiers Eastern Suburbs, Runners-up St George Dragons, Details 1975 NSWRFL Grand Final. No match here either.\n\n4. Fourth row: Points 38, Score 38-12, Premiers Brisbane Broncos, Runners-up Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs, Details 1998 NRL Grand Final. This matches the claim's teams and points.\n\n5. Fifth row: Points 36, Score 36-12, Premiers Canberra Raiders, Runners-up Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs, Details 1994 NSWRL Grand Final. Here, Brisbane Broncos aren't involved, so this row doesn't apply to the claim.\n\nSo the relevant row is the fourth one. The columns I need are 'points' and 'runners up', which correspond to the score of 38-12 and showing that the runners-up were Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs. \n\nThe claim says Brisbane Broncos scored 12 points, but looking at the table, their score was 38 points against the Bulldogs in 1998. However, the claim might be referring to the margin of victory, which is 12 points (since it's 38-12). But the wording is a bit ambiguous: \"score a total of 12 point\" could mean the Broncos scored 12 points, but they actually scored 38.\n\nWait, no, in the table, the 'score' column is written as \"38 - 12,\" which likely means Brisbane Broncos scored 38 and runners-up had 12. So the margin is 12, not that they scored 12 total. The claim says \"a total of 12 point,\" so it's a bit unclear if it refers to their own points or the margin.\n\nBut regardless, the key fact is that in that match, Brisbane Broncos did play against Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs, and the score was 38-12. So the claim is partially correct but might be misleading because they scored 38, not 12. However, the main point about facing each other is accurate.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"the brisbane bronco score a total of 12 point against...\" which would mean they scored 12 points. But in reality, they scored 38. So that part is incorrect. However, the runners-up were indeed Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs. \n\nBut does the claim have to be fully correct? The user instructions say if the claim is fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. So since the Brisbane Broncos did not score a total of 12 points but rather 38, the claim is incorrect. However, they did play against the Bulldogs in that match.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key is whether the specific cells in the table support the claim. The relevant cells are where the Brisbane Broncos are the premiers and the Bulldogs are runners-up, which is row 4, columns 'premiers' and 'runners up'. So even if the points don't match exactly, perhaps the main fact is that they played against each other.\n\nBut the claim specifically states their score was 12. Since in reality it's 38-12, maybe the claim is incorrect because it misstates the points. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a different match where Broncos scored 12 points against Bulldogs, but looking at the table, that doesn't happen. The only match involving both teams is row 4, where Broncos scored 38.\n\nSo in conclusion, while they did play each other in 1998, the claim incorrectly states their score as 12 instead of 38. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"runners up\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
