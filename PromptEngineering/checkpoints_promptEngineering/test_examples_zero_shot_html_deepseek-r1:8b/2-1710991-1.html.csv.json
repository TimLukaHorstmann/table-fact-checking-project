    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"2 of Liselotte Neumann's wins be the result of a playoff, in jun 1996 and mar 1998.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions that there are two wins by Liselotte Neumann that were the result of a playoff, occurring in June 1996 and March 1998.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament with details such as date, tournament name, winning score, margin of victory, and the runners-up. The key columns here are \"runner (s) - up\" which lists the players who tied for second place or participated in the playoff.\n\nI need to find rows where Liselotte Neumann is listed as one of the runners-up, specifically around June 1996 and March 1998.\n\nStarting with June 1996. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The row on June 12, 1994: Runner-up is Hiromi Kobayashi.\n- June 6, 1996: Runners-up are Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick. No Liselotte Neumann here.\nWait, perhaps I missed a row for June 1996. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 5 (row_index 6) is June 6, 1996: runners-up are Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick. No Liselotte.\n\nNext, March 1998: Looking at the rows, I see March 22, 1998: Runner-up is Rosie Jones.\n\nWait, there's also a row for March 17, 1996: runners-up are Cathy Johnston-Forbes. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to two tournaments where she was in the playoff, which could be different from being runners-up. The column \"margin of victory\" sometimes says 'playoff', indicating a playoff occurred but not necessarily that she was involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"runner-up\" is used differently here. Sometimes, in golf, a playoff determines the winner, so perhaps the winning score includes a playoff, and the runner-up is someone else. So, if the column says \"playoff\", it might mean that the victory was via a playoff, but not necessarily that she was the one who participated.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nFor example, row 5 (June 6, 1996) has a margin of 'playoff' and runners-up include Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick. So this tournament had a playoff to decide the winner, but Liselotte isn't listed here.\n\nAnother row: March 22, 1998, under \"margin of victory\" it's 'playoff', and runner-up is Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper. Again, no Liselotte.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says that two of her wins were due to a playoff in June 1996 and March 1998. So we need rows where the tournament was won via a playoff, and she was the winner. But looking at the table, the winning score is negative, which probably indicates the total score minus par, not the margin. The \"margin of victory\" column shows if it was a playoff or not.\n\nWait, in row 5 (June 6, 1996), the margin is 'playoff', so that tournament was decided via a playoff. But who won it? The winning score is -15. Looking for the winner's name isn't directly provided; the column only lists runners-up. So if Liselotte Neumann wasn't listed as runner-up here, she might not have been involved in that playoff.\n\nSimilarly, in March 1998, the margin is 'playoff' but again, the runner-up is Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper. So unless Liselotte won those tournaments via a playoff without being listed as runner-up, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't list the winner's name, only runners-up. So without knowing who the actual winners were in those tournaments, I can't confirm if Liselotte Neumann was involved. Therefore, even though the margin says 'playoff' for June 1996 and March 1998, there's no direct link to her being the winner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is based on her participation in a playoff where she might have won, but without her name in the runners-up column, it's uncertain. So I can't confirm that two of her wins were via playoffs in those specific years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that the range of the margin of victory is from a low of 1 stroke to a high of 11 strokes.\n\nFirst, I should identify all relevant information. The table has several columns: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runner-up. The claim is specifically about Liselotte Neumann's tournaments, so I need to look for rows where the tournament name includes her name. Wait, looking at the table, I notice that none of the tournament names mention \"Liselotte Neumann\". Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the table doesn't have any entries for her, which would mean there's no data to support or contradict the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the instruction. The claim is about Liselotte Neumann's winning tournaments, but looking at the table provided, I don't see any rows where she is listed as a runner-up or winner. Let me check each row:\n\n- The first row is Patty Sheehan.\n- Second: Caroline Keggi and Dottie Pepper.\n- Third: Hiromi Kobayashi.\n- Fourth: Dottie Pepper and Annika S\u00f6renstam.\n- Fifth: Elaine Crosby and Pearl Sinn.\n- Sixth: Karrie Webb.\n- Seventh: Cathy Johnston-Forbes.\n- Eighth: Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick.\n- Ninth: Nancy Harvey.\n- Tenth: Lori Kane.\n- Eleventh: Rosie Jones.\n- Twelfth: Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper.\n- Thirteenth: Grace Park.\n\nNone of these are Liselotte Neumann. Therefore, there is no data in the table that relates to her. The claim states a range from 1 to 11 strokes, but without any of her tournaments being present, we can't verify this range. So, the claim isn't supported by the provided information.\n\nWait again, maybe I'm supposed to consider if she exists in another context, but based on the table given, it's clear that none of the tournaments are hers. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no data to support her having a margin of victory within any range.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"between 1998 and 2004, 3 of Liselotte Neumann's final winning scores were under 206.\"\n\nFirst, I should figure out who Liselotte Neumann is. From the table, looking at the 'runner (s) - up' column, I see names like Patty Sheehan, Caroline Keggi, Hiromi Kobayashi, etc. None of these names are Liselotte Neumann. So maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a typo or I misread the name.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't list her because she didn't win any tournaments in this dataset. If that's the case, then the claim about her winning scores is incorrect because she didn't have any final wins in this period.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check all entries between 1998 and 2004 for any possible Liselotte Neumann. Let me go through each row from 1998 onwards.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\n- 22 Mar 1998\n- 26 Apr 1998\n- 10 Oct 2004\n\nWait, but 2004 is included in the timeframe up to 2004. However, looking at the 'runner (s) - up' for these rows:\n\n- 22 Mar 1998: Rosie Jones\n- 26 Apr 1998: Lori Kane\n- 10 Oct 2004: Grace Park\n\nNo Liselotte Neumann here. So she didn't win any tournaments in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is about her winning scores between 1998 and 2004, but since there are no wins by her in that period, the number of final winning scores under 206 would be zero, not three. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: The claim refers to her final winning scores, which would correspond to the 'winning score' column. So I need to look at all rows where she might have won, but since there are none, perhaps no relevant cells? But maybe I should include the columns for any row in 1998-2004, just in case.\n\nAlternatively, since there's no data on her, maybe no relevant cells because she didn't participate. But according to the instructions, if the claim is not fully supported, answer FALSE and provide all rows that might be relevant as per the conditions in the claim.\n\nWait, the claim is about final winning scores under 206 between 1998-2004 for Liselotte Neumann's wins. Since she didn't win any tournaments during that time, the data isn't present here. So perhaps there are no relevant cells because her name doesn't appear in the runner-up column.\n\nBut to be precise, let me check each row from 1998 onwards:\n\n- 22 Mar 1998: Standard Register Ping tournament, Rosie Jones won.\n- 26 Apr 1998: Chick-fil-A charity championship, Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper.\n- 10 Oct 2004: Asahi Ryokuken International Championship, Grace Park.\n\nNone of these winners are Liselotte Neumann. Therefore, she didn't have any wins in this timeframe, so her winning scores aren't present. Thus, the claim is based on non-existent data, making it FALSE.\n\nAs for relevant cells, since the claim refers to her final winning scores, which would be in the 'winning score' column, but since there are no rows where she won, perhaps all these columns from 1998-2004 should be considered. But actually, since the table doesn't have any of her wins, maybe it's better to just indicate that no relevant cells exist because she didn't win any tournaments in this period.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to return a list of objects with row indices and column names that are relevant. Since the claim is about her winning scores, and her wins don't appear in the table, perhaps there's nothing relevant, but maybe we have to include all columns from 1998-2004.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the 'winning score' column is relevant for each row between 1998-2004. So I'll include those rows with their 'winning score' and 'date'.\n\nWait, let me check the exact timeframe: between 1998 and 2004. So any date from 1998/1/1 to 2004/12/31.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe relevant years are 1998 (1998-03-22), 2004 (2004-10-10). So row indices for those rows would be:\n\nFrom the table, the rows after 1997 would be:\n\nRow 24: 1998-03-22\nRow 25: 1998-04-26\n...\nUp to Row 33: 2004-10-10.\n\nSo for each of these rows (indices 24 and beyond up to 33), the 'winning score' column is relevant because that's where her scores would be, but since she didn't win any, it's still necessary to check. So I should include all those rows in the relevant_cells as they are within the timeframe.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Liselotte Neumann's wins, so maybe only the 'winning score' column is relevant because that's where her scores would be listed if she won. However, since she didn't win any tournaments in this dataset, there are no entries for her in the 'runner-up' column either.\n\nI think to cover all bases, I should list all rows from 1998-2004 and their 'winning score' column as relevant, because that's where her scores would be if she had won. Even though she didn't, it's necessary to include them because they are within the timeframe specified in the claim.\n\nSo, for each row between index 24 (1998) and 33 (2004), I'll add their 'winning score' column as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on Liselotte Neumann's winning scores between 1998 and 2004. Since there are no records of her winning any tournaments in this dataset, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells include all 'winning score' entries from 1998 to 2004 as they might contain her scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Liselotte Neumann winning two LPGA Classic tournaments in 1994 and 1996 is true based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"liselotte neumann have win 2 lpga classic tournament , in 1994 and 1996.\" It mentions that she won two tournaments specifically named as the LPGA Classic in those years. \n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row has details about different tournaments with various winners. My task is to find if there are any rows where the winner's name is Liselotte Neumann, and the tournament names include \"LPGA Classic\" for both 1994 and 1996.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row (row 0) mentions Patty Sheehan as the winner in the US Women's Open on September 7, 1988. No match with Liselotte Neumann or LPGA Classic.\n\n2. Row 1 is about Mazda Japan Classic on November 10, 1991, with winners Caroline Keggi and Dottie Pepper. Not relevant.\n\n3. Row 2 is the Minnesota LPGA Classic in June 1994, but the winner is Hiromi Kobayashi. No match.\n\n4. Row 3: Weetabix Women's British Open in August 1994, with winners Dottie Pepper and Annika S\u00f6renstam. Not relevant.\n\n5. Row 4: GHP Heartland Classic in October 1994, won by Elaine Crosby and Pearl Sinn. Still no match.\n\n6. Row 5: Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions in January 1996, won by Karrie Webb. Doesn't fit.\n\n7. Row 6: Ping/Welch's Championship (Tucson) in March 1996, won by Cathy Johnston-Forbes. Not matching.\n\n8. Row 7: Edina Realty LPGA Classic in June 1996, with Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, and Suzanne Strudwick as winners. No match for Liselotte Neumann.\n\n9. Row 8: Welch's Championship in September 1997, won by Nancy Harvey. Not relevant.\n\n10. Row 9: Toray Japan Queens Cup in November 1997, won by Lori Kane. Still no match.\n\n11. Row 10: Standard Register Ping in March 1998, won by Rosie Jones. Doesn't fit.\n\n12. Row 11: Chick-fil-A Charity Championship in April 1998, won by Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper. Not relevant.\n\n13. Row 12: Asahi Ryokuken International Championship in October 2004, won by Grace Park. No match here either.\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, I didn't find any entries where Liselotte Neumann is listed as a winner of an LPGA Classic tournament in both 1994 and 1996. Most of the winners mentioned are different names, and there's no mention of her winning any tournaments at all.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check if Liselotte Neumann is even present in the table. Looking at the 'runner(s) - up' column, I see names like Patty Sheehan, Caroline Keggi, Hiromi Kobayashi, Dottie Pepper, Elaine Crosby, etc., but nowhere does \"Liselotte Neumann\" appear. So that's a red flag\u2014she might not be in there at all.\n\nNext, the claim says she won 6 tournaments. I need to count how many times any runner-up won multiple tournaments. But without her being listed as a winner or runner-up, it's unclear if she has 6 victories. Plus, even if she did, each of these would have to be by more than 2 strokes.\n\nLooking at the 'margin of victory' column: most entries are either 1, 2, or 3 strokes. For example, Patty Sheehan won with 3 strokes, Dottie Pepper in another with 2, and others like Nancy Harvey also have 3 strokes. None of them have more than 2 strokes consistently except maybe a couple, but not enough to reach 6.\n\nAlso, the 'runner(s) - up' column shows co-players who came in second, but since Neumann isn't listed as either winner or runner-up, there's no data supporting her wins. \n\nSo, putting it all together: There's no evidence of Liselotte Neumann winning any tournaments in this table, let alone 6 by more than 2 strokes. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Liselotte Neumann won six tournaments each with a margin greater than two strokes. However:\n\n- **Liselotte Neumann** is not listed as either a winner or runner-up in any row of the table.\n- The data doesn't show six victories by any single player, let alone one with margins exceeding two strokes.\n\nThus, there's insufficient evidence to support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the given claim about Liselotte Neumann's wins is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating.

No.\n3. **June 1994**: Winner is Hiromi Kobayashi. No.\n4. **August 1994**: Winner is Dottie Pepper and Annika S\u00f6renstam. No.\n5. **October 1994**: Winner is Elaine Crosby and Pearl Sinn.

Wait, this row is for the Edina Realty LPGA Classic on June 6, 1996. It's a playoff, as indicated by \"playoff\" in the margin of victory column. But who is the winner? The runners-up include Brandie Burton, so perhaps she won via a playoff.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions Liselotte Neumann. I'm not sure if she's listed here. Let me check other rows:\n\n9. **September 1997**: Winner is Nancy Harvey. No.\n10. **November 1997**: Winner is Lori Kane. No.\n11. **March 1998**: Winner is Rosie Jones. No.\n12. **April 1998**: Winners are Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper. No.\n13. **October 2004**: Winner is Grace Park. No.\n\nLooking at the table, I don't see any row where the winner is Liselotte Neumann. The claim mentions her winning a playoff in June 1996. From the table, the only playoff win I can find in June 1996 is Brandie Burton's victory at the Edina Realty LPGA Classic, but that's not Liselotte Neumann.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could the claim be about a different tournament? Let me double-check if any row has Liselotte Neumann as the winner around June 1996.\n\nLooking again, none of the rows have her name listed as the runner-up or the winner. The closest is Brandie Burton in June 1996, but that's not her.

Let me check that again. The table lists various golf tournaments with details like date, tournament name, winning score, margin of victory, and runners-up. But nowhere in this table is there a reference to Liselotte Neumann.\n\nSo maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps \"Liselotte Neumann\" refers to another golfer, but looking at the table, it lists winners as Patty Sheehan, Caroline Keggi, Hiromi Kobayashi, Dottie Pepper, etc., but none of these names are Liselotte Neumann. Maybe it's a typo or I misread. Let me double-check each row.\n\nLooking through the table, each 'runner-up' column lists different golfers. None of them match \"Liselotte Neumann.\" So maybe the claim is about someone not listed here. That could mean that there's no data to support the claim because she isn't in the table, or perhaps it's a false statement since her scores aren't provided.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifies between 1998 and 2004, so I need to check if any of her performances fall into that timeframe. Since she's not listed at all, there are zero instances where her winning score would be under 212 in that period.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the margin of victory in Liselotte Neumann's winning scores is true or false by analyzing the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the margin of victory in Liselotte Neumann 's winning score range from a low of 1 stroke to a high of 3 stroke.\"\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I notice that the players listed are Patty Sheehan, Caroline Keggi, Hiromi Kobayashi, Dottie Pepper, Annika S\u00f6renstam, Elaine Crosby, Pearl Sinn, Karrie Webb, Cathy Johnston-Forbes, Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick, Nancy Harvey, Lori Kane, Rosie Jones, and Grace Park. None of these names include Liselotte Neumann.\n\nThis raises a red flag because the claim mentions Liselotte Neumann specifically, but she doesn't appear in any row of the table. If there's no data for her in the provided table, then it's impossible to verify whether her margins of victory fall within the stated range.\n\nMoreover, even if I ignore the absence of Neumann's name and focus solely on the margins listed, the claim seems a bit off. The margin of victory is either 1, 2, or 3 strokes in this table, so it doesn't exactly \"range from 1 to 3.\" It's more like the maximum being 3 strokes and sometimes 11 strokes as well, but that's not covered here.\n\nSo, considering both points: the lack of Neumann's data and the potential misstatement of the claim regarding the range, I'm leaning towards the claim being false. There\u2019s no way to confirm it based on the given information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Liselotte Neumann, whose name does not appear in any row of the provided table. Therefore, there is no data to verify the margins of victory for her.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim states that Liselotte Neumann won three LPGA Classic tournaments in 1994, 1996, and 1998.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if any of them mention Liselotte Neumann winning an LPGA Classic in those years. The columns relevant here are \"tournament\" and \"runner-up\". \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0 (7 sep 1988):** Tournament is US Women's Open, winner Patty Sheehan. No mention of Liselotte Neumann.\n2. **Row 1 (10 nov 1991):** Mazda Japan Classic, winners Caroline Keggi and Dottie Pepper. Not Liselotte.\n3. **Row 2 (12 jun 1994):** Minnesota LPGA Classic, winner Hiromi Kobayashi. No.\n4. **Row 3 (12 aug 1994):** Weetabix Women's British Open, winners Dottie Pepper and Annika S\u00f6renstam. Not her.\n5. **Row 4 (2 oct 1994):** GHP Heartland Classic, winners Elaine Crosby and Pearl Sinn. No.\n6. **Row 5 (14 jan 1996):** Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions, winner Karrie Webb. Not her.\n7. **Row 6 (17 mar 1996):** Ping/Welch's Championship, winner Cathy Johnston-Forbes. No.\n8. **Row 7 (6 jun 1996):** Edina Realty LPGA Classic, winners Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick. Not her.\n9. **Row 8 (21 sep 1997):** Welch's Championship, winner Nancy Harvey. No.\n10. **Row 9 (9 nov 1997):** Toray Japan Queens Cup, winner Lori Kane. No.\n11. **Row 10 (22 mar 1998):** Standard Register Ping, winner Rosie Jones. Not her.\n12. **Row 11 (26 apr 1998):** Chick-Fil-A Charity Championship, winners Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper. No mention of Liselotte in this row.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. The claim is about the LPGA Classic tournaments specifically. Looking back at Row 2 (12 jun 1994): Minnesota LPGA Classic, winner Hiromi Kobayashi. Maybe that's the one? But the name isn't Liselotte Neumann.\n\nI should check if there's a row where the tournament is an LPGA Classic and the runner-up or winner is Liselotte Neumann in 1994, 1996, or 1998.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\n- In Row 5 (14 Jan 1996), the tournament is Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions. Not LPGA Classic.\n- Row 10 (22 Mar 1998): Standard Register Ping. Also not an LPGA Classic.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"3 lpga classic tournament in 1994, 1996, and 1998.\" So each year she won one LPGA Classic.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1994: The only LPGA Classic listed is Minnesota LPGA Classic on Row 2, but winner is Hiromi Kobayashi. No mention of Liselotte.\n- In 1996: There's the Edina Realty LPGA Classic on Row 7, winner Brandie Burton, etc. Not her.\n- In 1998: The Chick-Fil-A Charity Championship on Row 11. Winner Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper. No.\n\nI don't see any rows where Liselotte Neumann is the winner of an LPGA Classic in those years. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE because she didn't win those specific tournaments.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runner-up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"runner-up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runner-up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"liselotte neumann have win 5 tournament by more than 2 stroke\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim. It's saying that Liselotte Neumann won 5 tournaments with a margin of more than 2 strokes each. So, to verify this, I need to look for any row in the table where the \"runner-up\" column mentions Liselotte Neumann and check if the margin of victory is greater than 2 strokes.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are 'date', 'tournament', 'winning score', 'margin of victory', and 'runner(s) - up'. But since the claim is about the runner-up and the margin, I'll focus on the 'runner(s) - up' column for Liselotte Neumann and the corresponding 'margin of victory'.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any have Liselotte Neumann in the 'runner(s) - up' column. Let me check:\n\n1. First row: Patty Sheehan, no.\n2. Second row: Caroline Keggi and Dottie Pepper, no.\n3. Third row: Hiromi Kobayashi, no.\n4. Fourth row: Dottie Pepper and Annika S\u00f6renstam, no.\n5. Fifth row: Elaine Crosby and Pearl Sinn, no.\n6. Sixth row: Karrie Webb, no.\n7. Seventh row: Cathy Johnston-Forbes, no.\n8. Eighth row: Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick, no.\n9. Ninth row: Nancy Harvey, no.\n10. Tenth row: Lori Kane, no.\n11. Eleventh row: Rosie Jones, no.\n12. Twelfth row: Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper, no.\n13. Thirteenth row: Grace Park, no.\n\nHmm, I don't see Liselotte Neumann in any of these rows. Wait, maybe I missed her. Let me check again more carefully.\n\nWait, the table has 14 rows (from row_index 0 to 13). Each row lists the runner-up(s) for that tournament. I'll list them out:\n\nRow 0: Patty Sheehan\nRow 1: Caroline Keggi, Dottie Pepper\nRow 2: Hiromi Kobayashi\nRow 3: Dottie Pepper, Annika S\u00f6renstam\nRow 4: Elaine Crosby, Pearl Sinn\nRow 5: Karrie Webb\nRow 6: Cathy Johnston-Forbes\nRow 7: Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, Suzanne Strudwick\nRow 8: Nancy Harvey\nRow 9: Lori Kane\nRow 10: Rosie Jones\nRow 11: Lori Kane, Dottie Pepper\nRow 12: Grace Park\n\nNo Liselotte Neumann here. So, based on the table, she didn't win any tournaments listed. Therefore, the claim is that she won 5 tournaments with more than 2 strokes each, but if she hasn't even won one in the table, the claim must be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check for her as a winner? Let me look at the 'runner(s) - up' column again. It seems like all those listed are runners-up, not winners. So the 'winner' would be the one not mentioned there. But in any case, the claim is about her winning 5 tournaments with more than 2 strokes, which isn't supported by the table since she's never a winner here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and there are no relevant cells because she doesn't appear in the runner-up column either.\n</think>\n\nThe provided HTML table lists various golf tournaments and their results. Each row includes the tournament name, winning score, margin of victory, and the runners-up. The claim in question is that Liselotte Neumann won 5 tournaments each by more than 2 strokes. To verify this, we need to check if there are any rows where she is listed as a runner-up with a margin of victory exceeding 2 strokes.\n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- There are no entries for Liselotte Neumann in either the 'runner(s) - up' column.\n- Therefore, it's impossible to confirm that she has won any tournaments, let alone 5 with more than a 2-stroke margin.\n\nSince there is no evidence supporting the claim, the answer must be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
