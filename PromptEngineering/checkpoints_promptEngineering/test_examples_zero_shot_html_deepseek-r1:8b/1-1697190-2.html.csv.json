    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"this person's lowest yearly earnings between 1998 and 2005 is 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"lowest yearly earnings.\" Looking at the table, the column that likely corresponds to earnings is \"earnings,\" which I can confirm by seeing its header. So, I should focus on the \"earnings\" column for each relevant year: 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, since those fall between 1998 and 2005.\n\nNext, the claim says that this person's lowest earnings in that period is 0. So I need to check if there are any years where their earnings were 0. Let me go through each year one by one.\n\nStarting with 1998: The \"earnings\" column shows $37,221. That's definitely not 0.\n\nMoving on to 2000: Earnings are listed as $143,248. Still nowhere near zero.\n\nThen 2001: The earnings here are 0. That's a significant point. So in 2001, this person didn't earn anything. \n\nSimilarly, in 2002, their earnings are also 0. So another year where earnings are 0.\n\n2003 has the same pattern with earnings of 0.\n\nIn 2004: Earnings are $15,858, which is not zero.\n\n2005 shows earnings of $10,547, again not zero.\n\nSo, from this analysis, the person did have years (specifically 2001, 2002, and 2003) where their yearly earnings were exactly 0. Therefore, the claim that the lowest yearly earnings in that period was 0 is TRUE because there are indeed years with zero earnings.\n\nNow, to map which cells from the table are relevant for this verification. Each row corresponds to a specific year, so I'll list the \"earnings\" column for each of these rows since they directly relate to the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the \"earnings\" column for years 2001, 2002, and 2003 where earnings are listed as 0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Casey Martin never win a tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Casey Martin has never won a tournament. So, I need to check if there's any record in the table where Casey Martin won a tournament.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various years from 1998 to 2005 and includes columns like year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, best finish, earnings, and money list rank.\n\nThe key column here is \"wins\". If the number of wins for Casey Martin is greater than zero in any given year, that would mean they won at least one tournament, which would make the claim FALSE. Conversely, if in all years their wins are zero, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check the \"wins\" column:\n\n- 1998: 0\n- 2000: 0\n- 2001: 0\n- 2002: 0\n- 2003: 0\n- 2004: 0\n- 2005: 0\n\nIn all cases, the wins are zero. There's no row where Casey Martin has a positive number in the \"wins\" column.\n\nTherefore, since there's no evidence of any wins, the claim that Casey Martin never won a tournament is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"wins\" column is the one we're focusing on. So, each row's \"wins\" cell needs to be included in the relevant_cells list with their respective row indices.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the number of tournament plays in 2000 be 2.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key here is \"tournament play\" and specifically in the year 2000. So I need to look at the row for 2000 in the table and check the relevant columns.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, best finish, earnings, money list rank. The claim is about \"tournament plays,\" which should correspond to the column \"tournaments played.\"\n\nNext, I'll locate the 2000 row. Scanning through the rows, I see that the second row (row_index:1) has the year 2000. Now, in that same row, under \"tournaments played,\" the value is 29.\n\nThe claim states that in 2000, the number of tournaments played was 2. But according to the table, it's actually 29. So this doesn't match. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because the actual number of tournaments played in 2000 is higher than what's stated.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other columns that might relate, but in this context, \"tournaments played\" is directly relevant. The other columns like cuts made or wins don't pertain to the total number of tournaments played in a given year. So they aren't necessary for verifying this claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim is incorrect because it doesn't align with the actual number of tournaments played in 2000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2000, the number of tournament plays was 2. However, according to the table, in 2000, 29 tournaments were played. Since this contradicts the claim, it is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournaments played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
