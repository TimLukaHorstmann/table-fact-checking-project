    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto lose to cleveland on november 24 , 108 - 111 (ot)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n- Toronto loses the game.\n- The opponent is Cleveland.\n- The date is November 24.\n- The score is 108 - 111 (OT), which means it's an overtime game.\n\nNow, I'll look at each part of the claim against the table to find relevant cells.\n\nStarting with the date: November 24. Scanning through the table rows, I see that row 13 has the date November 24. So row_index 13 is relevant for the date.\n\nNext, checking the opponent: Toronto vs. Cleveland. In row 13, under \"Opponent,\" it's listed as \"cleveland\". So the column Opponent is also relevant at row 13.\n\nLooking at the result of the game: The claim says Toronto lost. I need to confirm if Toronto indeed lost on that date. From row 13, \"Result\" is \"l\", which stands for loss. Therefore, the Result column is relevant as well.\n\nThe score in the claim is 108 - 111 (OT). In the table, under \"Score,\" row 13 shows \"108 - 111 (ot)\". So the Score column is also relevant at row 13.\n\nPutting it all together, all these cells (row 13, columns Opponent, Result, and Score) are needed to verify the claim. There's no conflicting information in the table that contradicts this claim.\n\nSo, after checking each part against the table, everything aligns with the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is about a specific game: \"the result of the game on november 20 in dallas be w 110 - 101 (ot).\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the date is November 20. Scanning through the rows, I see that row number 11 has the date listed as November 20. Next, I need to check what the result of that game was.\n\nLooking at column \"Result\" in row 11, it says \"l 99 - 105 (ot)\". The claim states the result was a win with the score \"w 110 - 101 (ot)\", which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify relevant cells: I need to find the columns that confirm the game date and the result. The date is in the \"Date\" column at row 11, so that's one relevant cell. The result is in the \"Result\" column at the same row, which also needs to be checked against the claim. So both these cells are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
