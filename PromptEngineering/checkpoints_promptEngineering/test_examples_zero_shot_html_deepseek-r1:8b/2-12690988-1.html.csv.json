The claim is: \"On September 10, 2013, the result was 3 - 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the date in the claim and see which row it matches. In the table, I see a row with date \"10 september 2013\". That's row number 5 because there are five rows in total.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'result' column for that specific row. The result is listed as \"3 - 2\" in the 'score' column, which matches the claim. However, wait\u2014no, looking back, the 'result' column actually shows \"3 - 2\". So both the score and result columns have the same value.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The row for September 10, 2013 has 'score' as \"2 - 1\" but the 'result' is \"3 - 2\"? No, that can't be right. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at row 5: \n- date: 10 september 2013\n- score: 2 - 1\n- result: 3 - 2\nWait, no. The claim says the result was \"3 - 2.\" But in the table, for that row, the 'result' is also \"3 - 2\". So the claim matches both the date and the result.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me make sure. \n\nYes, the date in the table for row 5 is September 10, 2013, which matches the claim's date. The 'result' column for that row is \"3 - 2,\" so it aligns perfectly.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met: correct date and correct result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that in friendly competitions, the goal count is less than 3. So, I'm looking specifically at rows where the competition is \"friendly.\" For those rows, I need to check the 'goal' column and see if it's less than 3.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I can see there are five entries. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: The competition is \"friendly.\" The goal here is 1. Since 1 is less than 3, this row is relevant.\n\nRow 1: Again, competition is \"friendly,\" and the goal is 2. 2 is also less than 3, so this row is relevant too.\n\nRow 2: This one is for the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica. The competition isn't friendly, so it doesn't apply to the claim. I can skip this one.\n\nRow 3: Competition is \"friendly,\" and the goal here is 1. So that's less than 3 as well. Relevant.\n\nRow 4: This row is for a World Cup qualifier, not friendly, so it's irrelevant.\n\nNow, focusing on the relevant rows (0, 1, 3), all of them have goals less than 3. There are no rows in friendly competitions where the goal is 3 or more to disprove the claim. So, the claim holds true for all applicable cases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll break down the claim to understand what it's asking.\n\nThe key parts are:\n- The goal is larger than 4.\n- The result of such a goal should be \"3 - 1\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a goal with details like date, score, result, and competition. My task is to find rows where the goal's score is greater than 4 and check if the result matches \"3 - 1\".\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Goal 1, Score is 3-1 (which isn't larger than 4).\n2. Row 1: Goal 2, Score is 1-2 (not larger than 4).\n3. Row 2: Goal 3, Score is 1-0 (still not over 4).\n4. Row 3: Goal 4, Score is 1-1 and the result is 2-1. Wait, here the score is 1-1, which isn't a goal larger than 4.\n5. Row 4: Goal 5, Score is 2-1 and the result is 3-2. The score here is 2-1, not over 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1.\" So perhaps it's referring to the outcome, not the score. Or does it mean that when a team scores more than 4 goals in a match, their result is 3-1? That doesn't make sense because higher scores usually lead to bigger margins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the score itself being over 4. Looking again, none of the scores in the table are over 4. The highest is 2-1 and 3-2. So there are no rows where the goal (score) is larger than 4. Therefore, the condition doesn't apply to any row.\n\nSince no relevant data exists in the table that meets the condition of a score larger than 4, the claim isn't supported. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
