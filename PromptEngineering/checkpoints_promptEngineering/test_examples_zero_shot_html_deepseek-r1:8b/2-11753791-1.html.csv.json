    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that any team that has 3 losses also has 0 ties. So for each team in the table, I should check if they have exactly 3 losses and then see how many ties they have.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: team name, games played, wins, losses, ties, goals for, and goals against. The relevant columns here are 'losses' and 'ties'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Montreal Hockey Club**: They have 3 losses. According to the table, their ties column is 0. So this team supports the claim because they have exactly 3 losses and 0 ties.\n\n2. **Ottawa Hockey Club**: Also has 3 losses, but looking at 'ties', it's 0 again. This also supports the claim.\n\n3. **Montreal Victorias**: They have 3 losses as well, but their ties are 0 too. So this fits the claim.\n\n4. **Quebec Hockey Club**: Their losses are 3, and ties are 0. So this team matches the condition.\n\n5. **Montreal Crystals**: Here, the losses are listed as 8. That's more than 3, so they don't fall under the condition of having exactly 3 losses. Therefore, their ties (which is 0) aren't relevant to the claim in question because the number of losses doesn't match.\n\nNow, considering all this, every team that has exactly 3 losses indeed has 0 ties. There are no teams with 3 losses that have any ties other than zero. The only team not considered is Montreal Crystals since they don't meet the loss criteria.\n\nSo, the claim holds true for all relevant teams in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ties\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
