    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion.\n\nThe claim is: \"audition be the week the original artist, lionel richie.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, and result. Each row represents a different week with associated data.\n\nI need to find if there's a week named \"audition\" where the original artist is Lionel Richie. So, I'll scan each row for the week \"audition.\"\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. The first row has 'week' as 'audition'. This matches.\n2. In that same row, under 'original artist', it says 'lionel richie'.\n\nSo, both conditions of the claim are met in this row.\n\nI should check if there's another week named 'audition' to ensure it's unique, but from the table, each 'week' name is unique except for some like 'n / a', which don't apply here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the first row of the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"audition be the week the original artist , lionel richie\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check the relevant cells in the provided HTML table. \n\nThe key points are:\n- The week must be named 'audition'.\n- The original artist for that week must be Lionel Richie.\n\nBy examining the table, we find that the first row has a week named 'audition' and lists the original artist as 'lionel richie'. This directly supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"the performance of 'higher and higher' in the top 20 bracket garderned an advancement.\" Wait, there's a typo here\u2014\"garderned\" should probably be \"garnered.\" So, correcting that, it says \"the performance... garnered an advancement.\"\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The relevant columns are 'song choice' and 'result.' I'm interested in rows where 'higher and higher' is the song choice because that's the specific performance mentioned.\n\nScanning through each row:\n\n1. The first row has \"walking on the moon.\" Not our song.\n2. Second row: \"living for the city.\"\n3. Third row: \"higher and higher.\" This matches, so I'll note this row.\n4. Fourth row: \"bring it on home to me.\"\n5. Fifth row: \"easy.\"\n6. Sixth row mentions a duet, not our song.\n7. Seventh row: finale, which is about 'red red wine.'\n\nSo the only relevant row is row 3 (since rows are zero-indexed, but in the table, the first row after <thead> is index 0). Wait, no\u2014the user's example starts indexing from 0 for the first data row. Let me confirm: the table has a header, then each <tr> represents a row starting at index 0.\n\nIn the given table:\n\n- The third <tr> (index 2) corresponds to \"top 20\" week with song \"higher and higher.\"\n- Wait, no\u2014let me recount. The first data row is index 0: audition, then Vegas verdicts as 1, top 20 as 2, top 10 as 3, top 8 as 4, top 4 as 5, finale as 6.\n\nWait, in the table:\n\n- <tr> tags are each for a row. So the first data row after the header is row 0: \"audition\" and so on.\n\nLooking at row 2 (index 2), which is the third row overall, corresponds to week \"top 20,\" song choice \"higher and higher.\" The result column here is \"advanced.\"\n\nSo in this row, 'result' is \"advanced,\" which matches the claim. Therefore, the cell at row_index=2, column_name=\"result\" supports the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where \"higher and higher\" is performed, but from the table, it's only in index 2.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index: 2 (since the third <tr> is index 2)\n- column_name: result\n\nNow, for the claim to be TRUE, the performance of that song must have resulted in \"advanced.\" Since that's exactly what happened here, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant cells where 'higher and higher' was performed and the result was 'advanced'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "higher and higher song garner an advanced result during top 10 week",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"higher and higher song garner an advanced result during top 10 week.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. Let me look for keywords in the claim:\n\n1. \"Higher and Higher\" - This seems to be a specific song.\n2. \"Advanced result\" - The result column indicates whether it's advanced or not.\n3. \"Top 10 week\" - This refers to the 'week' column, specifically the row where 'top 10' is mentioned.\n\nNow, I'll go through each step methodically.\n\nStep 1: Identify which rows and columns are relevant based on the claim.\n\n- The song in question is \"Higher and Higher.\" So I need to find the row where this song appears. Looking at the table:\n\n   - Row 2 (index 2): Song is \"higher and higher\" by Jackie Wilson, result is advanced.\n   - So, row index 2 is relevant for the song.\n\n- The week mentioned in the claim is \"top 10.\" Looking at the 'week' column:\n\n   - Row 4 (index 4) has \"top 10\" as the week. However, in that row, the theme is \"n / a,\" but the result is advanced. So, the top 10 week is row index 4.\n\nBut wait, the claim says during \"top 10 week.\" The relevant cells would be where 'week' is 'top 10' and 'song choice' is \"higher and higher.\"\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 2: Week is not mentioned here. Wait, looking back, each row has a 'week' entry. Let me check each row's week column.\n\nWait, the table provided in HTML shows that each row in the tbody has a 'week' as per the <td> entries. So I should list out all rows with their week:\n\nRow 0: audition\nRow 1: vegas verdicts\nRow 2: top 20\nRow 3: top 10\nRow 4: top 8\nRow 5: top 4\nRow 6: finale\n\nSo, the row where 'top 10' is in the week column is row index 3. However, in that row, the song choice is \"bring it on home to me\" by Sam Cooke, which is different from \"higher and higher.\"\n\nWait a minute, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nThe claim mentions \"top 10 week.\" So looking for rows where 'week' is 'top 10.' In the table, row index 3 has 'top 10' as the week. \n\nBut in that same row (row 3), the song choice is \"bring it on home to me,\" not \"higher and higher.\"\n\nTherefore, even though the result is advanced, the song isn't \"higher and higher\" during the top 10 week.\n\nWait, but I have another row, row index 2, where the song is \"higher and higher\" by Jackie Wilson. What's the week for that? Looking back:\n\nRow 0: audition\nRow 1: vegas verdicts\nRow 2: top 20\nRow 3: top 10\nRow 4: top 8\nRow 5: top 4\nRow 6: finale\n\nSo row index 2 has the week as \"top 20,\" not \"top 10.\" Therefore, in the 'top 10' week (row 3), a different song is chosen.\n\nThus, the claim that \"higher and higher\" song garners an advanced result during top 10 week isn't supported because the 'top 10' week has a different song, and when \"higher and higher\" was performed (during top 20), it also had an advanced result. But the claim specifically mentions top 10 week, which is separate.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again.\n\nThe claim says that during the top 10 week, the song \"higher and higher\" resulted in an advanced outcome. So I need to see if there's a row where:\n\n- Week = 'top 10'\n- Song choice = 'higher and higher'\n- Result = 'advanced'\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 0: audition - song: walking on the moon\nRow1: vegas verdicts - song: living for the city\nRow2: top20 - song: higher & higher\nRow3: top10 - song: bring it on home to me\nRow4: top8 - song: easy\nRow5: top4 - song: can't help...\nRow6: finale - red red wine\n\nSo in row 2, the week is 'top20,' not 'top10.' Therefore, there's no row where both 'higher and higher' is the song choice and the week is 'top10.'\n\nHence, the claim is false because during the top10 week, a different song was performed.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could it be that the song \"higher and higher\" was indeed in the top10 week but just not listed? No, looking at the table, row3 (top10) has a different song.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where 'higher and higher' is the song choice during top10 week. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"higher and higher\" song received an advanced result during the top 10 week. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- The row with \"top 10\" as the week (row index 3) features a different song (\"bring it on home to me\").\n- The row where \"higher and higher\" appears is during the \"top20\" week (row index 2), not top10.\n\nThus, there's no evidence supporting the claim. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"song choice\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
