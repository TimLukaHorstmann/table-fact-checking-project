    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nThe claim is: \"the opponent that plays on March 28 be the Colorado Rockies.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the game number corresponds to March 28. Since there's no explicit date column in the table, but each 'march' value might represent a specific month and day, or perhaps it's just the game sequence. Wait, looking closer, the 'march' column is probably indicating the day in March when the game was played. So I need to find the row where 'march' is 28.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: march=1\n- Row 1: march=4\n- ...\n- Up to row 74: march=28\n\nSo, row_index 74 has march=28. That's the relevant row. Now, looking at the opponent for that game. In row 74, the opponent is \"colorado rockies\". So the claim says they play against them on March 28, which matches.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: 'game' and 'opponent'. The 'game' column has the value 74 (since it's a td with value 74). Wait, no, in the HTML table, each <td> for game is numbered starting from 62 up. So row 74 corresponds to game 74. But wait, looking at the first row: game=62 and march=1, so 'march' likely increments by a few days each time.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The 'game' column has values 62,63,...74,... So for row 74, game is 74, which probably isn't the same as March 28. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking at the data again: \n\nIn the table, each row represents a game, and the 'march' value might represent the date in March when the game was played. So, row 74 has march=28, meaning it's on March 28. The opponent is \"colorado rockies\".\n\nSo, the claim says that on March 28, the opponent was Colorado Rockies, which matches row 74.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are: the 'game' column (value 74) and the 'opponent' column (Colorado Rockies). But wait, in the JSON example, they reference the columns by their header names. So for each cell, we need to identify which column it is.\n\nIn row 74:\n\n- game: 74\n- march:28\n- opponent:colorado rockies\n- score:3-4\n- record:42-19-13\n- points:97\n\nSo the 'game' is 74, and the opponent is \"colorado rockies\". Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor game=74: row_index=74, column_name='game'\n\nWait, but in the example, they have columns like 'Revenue', which correspond to the header. So in this case, the 'game' column's value is 74, so that's a cell. And the opponent is \"colorado rockies\", so their column is 'opponent'.\n\nTherefore, relevant_cells should include both these cells.\n\nWait, but looking back at the example given:\n\nThey have two entries: {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"Revenue\"} and another for Employees.\n\nSo in our case, for row 74, we need to check if any of the columns match. The opponent is colorado rockies, so the column is 'opponent', and the game number is 74, which is under the 'game' column.\n\nWait, but does the claim refer to the opponent as the one playing on March 28? So yes, the opponent in that game was Colorado Rockies.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index=74, column_name='opponent'\n- and perhaps also row_index=74, column_name='game'? Because the claim is about who played on a specific game date. But maybe just 'opponent' is enough because it's directly addressing who the opponent was.\n\nBut to be thorough, since the claim refers to \"the opponent that play on march 28\", which is a specific game, we should include both the opponent and perhaps the game number or another identifier.\n\nWait, in the table, each row represents a single game, so 'game' column is unique per row. So if we have to verify the claim, we need to ensure that for the correct game (i.e., March 28), the opponent was Rockies.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index=74, column_name='opponent' (to check who it was)\n- and perhaps 'game' column? Or maybe just 'march'? But 'march' is 28 in that row.\n\nBut the columns we can reference are the ones in the table: game, march, opponent, score, record, points.\n\nSo to verify the claim, we need to check:\n\n1. The correct row is where 'march'=28 (row 74)\n2. In that row, the opponent is \"colorado rockies\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row 74, column 'opponent' (to confirm it's Rockies)\n- For row 74, column 'game' (to ensure it's game 74, but actually, since each game is unique, perhaps just checking 'march'=28 and opponent is Rockies suffices. But the instruction says to check all conditions in the claim.\n\nWait, the claim has two parts: the date March 28 and the opponent being Rockies. So both need to be verified. However, looking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific game with a specific 'march' value and an opponent.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The cell where 'march'=28 (row_index=74, column_name='march')\n2. The cell where in that same row, the opponent is Rockies (row_index=74, column_name='opponent')\n\nSo both are relevant because the claim refers to March 28 and the opponent.\n\nThus, in the JSON response, I should include both these cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the opponent that was present on March 24 be the Colorado Rockies.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which row corresponds to March 24. Looking at the 'march' column in the table, each row has a number indicating the game number and the month they were played. For example, row 62 is March 1, row 63 is March 4, and so on. \n\nI need to find out which game was played on March 24. Let me list out some of the rows:\n\n- Row 62: March 1\n- Row 63: March 4\n- ...\nWait, let's check each row's 'march' value to see when March 24 falls.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 62: march=1 (March 1)\nRow 63: march=4 (March 4)\nRow 64: march=5 (March 5)\n... continuing this way, I need to find the row where 'march' is 24. \n\nBut wait, looking at the table provided, the highest 'march' value is up to 31 (row 75). Let me check each row's 'march' number:\n\nRow 62: 1\nRow 63:4\n64:5\n65:7\n66:11\n67:12\n68:15\n69:16\n70:18\n71:20\n72:23\n73:25\n74:28\n75:31\n\nWait, I don't see a row with 'march' equal to 24. That means there is no game on March 24 in the table provided. Therefore, if the claim says that the opponent on March 24 was the Colorado Rockies, but there's no such game on that date in the table, the claim must be false.\n\nNow, about the opponent: looking for any row where the opponent is the Colorado Rockies. From the table:\n\nRow 64: opponent is St Louis Blues\nRow 67: opponent is Colorado Rockies\nRow 74: opponent is Colorado Rockies\n\nSo, the Colorado Rockies played on game numbers 67 and 74. But since there's no game on March 24, the claim is false regardless of the opponent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's no row for March 24.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
