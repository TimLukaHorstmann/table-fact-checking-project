    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false by checking against the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"the engine alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv have f tyre\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about an engine that's a combination of Alfa Romeo, 3.0 V8, Ford Cosworth DFV, and it's claiming that these engines have 'f' tyres. So, I need to check if any row in the table matches this description.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns: year, chassis, engine (s), tyres, points. The claim is specifically about the engine details. So, I should focus on the 'engine (s)' column and the 'tyres' column for each relevant year.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1970: Engine is Ford Cosworth DFV, Tyres F. Hmm, this matches part of the claim. But wait, the claim mentions \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv\", which isn't exactly what's here. So maybe not.\n\n1971: Engine is Alfa Romeo 3.0 V8 Ford Cosworth DFV, Tyres F. This seems to match exactly. The engine description includes both Alfa Romeo and Ford Cosworth, and the tyres are 'f'. So this row supports the claim.\n\nBut I should check all rows to see if there's any conflicting information or other matches that might affect the claim's validity.\n\n1972: Engine is Ford Cosworth DFV, Tyres G. Doesn't match the claim since the engine isn't Alfa Romeo and tyres aren't F.\n\n1973: Same as 1972. Not a match.\n\n1974-1976: Engines are Ford Cosworth DFV with G tyres. No match.\n\n1981, 1982: Different engines (M.A.), so no.\n\n1987: Engine is Ford Cosworth DFZ, tyres G. No match.\n\n1988: Judd V8 engine, G tyres. Not matching.\n\n1989: Judd V8, G tyres. No.\n\n1992: ILMOR V10, G tyres. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo, the only row where both the engine description and tyre type F align is 1971. Therefore, since there's at least one supporting row, but let me see if any row contradicts or affects this. Since the claim refers to \"the engine\", implying perhaps that all such engines have F tyres, but looking at 1988, for example, it has a different tyre type when another engine is used.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the engine alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv have f tyre\". So it's making a specific statement about this particular combination of engine and tyres. Looking at the table, in 1971, that exact combination exists with F tyres. Therefore, the claim is true based on that row.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are other rows where the same combination appears again. For example, does any other year have Alfa Romeo 3.0 V8 Ford Cosworth DFV engines with F tyres? From the table provided, it seems only 1971 has that exact engine and tyre combination. Therefore, the claim is supported by that row.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the claim correctly. It's saying \"the engine alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv have f tyre\". So it's a specific assertion about those engines having F tyres. Since in 1971, that's exactly what happened, the claim is true.\n\nHowever, I should also check if any other row contradicts this or if there are multiple relevant cells. In this case, only 1971 matches both the engine description and tyre type. So, the answer would be TRUE with the relevant cell pointing to that row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"tyres\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the march 741 chassis have f tyre and 6 point\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two specific attributes: the type of tyre and the points associated with the March 741 chassis. So I should look for rows where the chassis model is March 741 and then check the corresponding tyre and points columns.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and various details about different car models or versions. The key here is to find the exact row that corresponds to the March 741 chassis.\n\nScrolling through the table, I see:\n- In 1974, the chassis listed is \"march 741\".\n- For 1981, it's \"march 811\", which doesn't match.\n- Similarly, other years like 1975 have \"march 751\" and 1976 has \"march 761\", none of which are March 741.\n\nSo the only relevant row is 1974. Now, checking the columns for that year:\n- The 'tyres' column says \"g\".\n- The 'points' column has \"6\".\n\nWait a minute, the claim says they have \"f tyre\" but in the table, it's \"g\". That's different. Also, points are 6 as per the table, which matches.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy in the tyre type. The claim says 'f', but according to the table, it's 'g'. Since one part of the claim doesn't match, I need to consider whether this makes the entire claim false.\n\nI should also check if the March 741 chassis appears anywhere else, but from the table, it only shows up in 1974. So the claim's first part is incorrect about the tyre type, which means the overall statement is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"tyres\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
