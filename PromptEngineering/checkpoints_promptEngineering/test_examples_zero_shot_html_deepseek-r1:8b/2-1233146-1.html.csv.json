    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true based on the provided table and instructions. The claim is: \"When the 1st leg is 1 - 2, the club is paok fc in the 2011 - 12 uefa europa league.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The first leg result being 1-2 and the club being PAOK FC occurred during the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find cells related to this specific match. I'll go through each row and check for the keywords: \"1st leg,\" \"1 - 2,\" \"PAOK FC,\" \"2011 - 12 uefa europa league.\"\n\nStarting from row 0, the first leg might be in the 'First Leg' column, but that row isn't relevant. I'll skip rows until I find a match.\n\nIn row 13, I see \"fk partizan\" with a score of 1-1, which doesn't fit. Row 14 mentions FC Rubin Kazan and a 0-3 loss, not the first leg or PAOK.\n\nRow 15 talks about Tottenham Hotspur, so skip. Rows 16 and 17 mention PAOK FC with different scores: row 16 has a 1-2 result in group stages, which matches. Row 17 also mentions PAOK but with a 1-3 score, so that's the same match.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim says \"when the 1st leg is 1-2,\" so I need to find where PAOK FC had their first leg as 1-2. From the table, it seems that in row 16 (which is the third qualifying round), PAOK's group stage match was 1-2 against someone, but wait, no\u2014looking closer, perhaps I'm mixing up stages.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the columns: each row has different stages like second qualifying round, third qualifying round, group stages. The first leg would be in the first match of a two-legged tie, so maybe in the early rounds.\n\nLooking further down, in rows 18 and 19, I see Tottenham Hotspur's matches, but that's not PAOK. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, looking at row 14: second qualifying round for Rubin Kazan, score 0-1\u2014no. Row 15: third qualifying round for Juventus, 0-1. No match with PAOK there.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me go through each relevant row step by step.\n\nRow 13: Playoff Round, FK Partizan vs someone (1-1). Not the first leg of PAOK's match.\n\nRow 14: Group stages for Rubin Kazan vs someone (0-3). No.\n\nRow 15: Tottenham Hotspur vs someone (1-3). No.\n\nRows 16 and 17: Both are about PAOK FC. \n\nIn row 16, the column is \"group stages\" with a score of 1-2 against Rubin Kazan.\n\nIn row 17, group stages again but 1-3 against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nWait, so in row 16, the first leg would have been the initial match where PAOK scored 1 and conceded 2. So if the claim is about the 1st leg being 1-2, this seems relevant because it's PAOK FC's first leg with that score.\n\nBut I need to check if any cell explicitly mentions \"1st leg.\" Looking through the table, I don't see a column named \"First Leg,\" but maybe the columns refer to stages like second qualifying round, third qualifying, etc. So perhaps the 1st leg is part of a two-legged tie in an earlier stage.\n\nWait, another approach: in each two-legged competition, there's a first and second leg. The claim refers to when PAOK FC had their first leg with a 1-2 result.\n\nLooking for rows where PAOK FC played and the score was 1-2. From row 16, it shows group stages with PAOK FC vs Rubin Kazan, score 1-2. Since this is part of the group stages, perhaps that's considered the first leg if they were in a group format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first leg refers to the initial match of the knockout stage or something else, but without explicit columns for legs, it's tricky.\n\nHowever, based on the table, PAOK FC did have a 1-2 result in their group stage against Rubin Kazan. So if the claim is about that specific first leg result, then it's true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"group stages\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"group stages\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is true or false based on the provided table and instructions. The claim is: \"the largest first leg be 0 - 7 for team g\u00f3rnik zabrze in the 1994 - 95 season.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table to see if there's any relevant information related to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the 1994-95 season. Let me go through each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the rows, the first few entries are from different seasons and competitions. For example, there's a match against Juventus FC in the 2010-11 Europa League with a score of 1-3. Then, moving down, there's a match between Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC and Juventus FC in the third qualifying round of the same season.\n\nContinuing further down, I see rows for the 2011-12 season, both Champions League and Europa League matches. None of these seem to be related to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze or the 1994-95 season.\n\nThen I notice a row where the team is listed as \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league\" and there's a mention of \"bnei yehuda tel aviv fc\" with a score. But that doesn't help either.\n\nWait, here's another row: it says \"2011 - 12 uefa champions league,\" but again, not G\u00f3rnik Zabrze. I'm not finding any entries related to the year 1994-95 or G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in this table.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look more carefully. The team name is spelled as \"g\u00f3rnik zabrze\" in one of the rows? Let me check. Scanning through, yes, there's a row with \"G\u00f3rnik Zabrze\" in the 2010-11 Europa League second qualifying round against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC. But that's for the 2010-11 season, not 1994-95.\n\nWait, the claim mentions the 1994-95 season specifically, so I need to see if G\u00f3rnik Zabrze had a match with a first leg score of 0-7 in that year. Since the table doesn't have any entries for 1994-95 or G\u00f3rnik Zabrze from that time, it's unlikely there's any data here supporting that claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the table, there's no evidence to support the claim about G\u00f3rnik Zabrze having a first leg score of 0-7 in the 1994-95 season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify this claim about Juventus FC and FC Flora Tallinn in the UEFA Europa League seasons. Let me start by breaking down what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"In the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League season, Juventus FC have a 1st leg of 0-1 while in the 2011-12 season, FC Flora Tallinn have a 1st leg of 1-0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the table provided to find any relevant information about these two teams during those seasons.\n\nStarting with Juventus FC in the 2010-11 season. Looking through the table, I see several rows related to the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League. Scanning each row:\n\n1. The first qualifying round is not mentioned here.\n2. The second qualifying round shows a match against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC with a score of 1-1. But that's in August 2010, which might be the second leg or something else.\n3. The third qualifying round against Juventus has a score of 0-1. Wait, no\u2014looking closer, one of the rows says \"third qualifying round\" with Juventus FC as the opponent and the score 0-1. That seems like the match where Juventus lost 0-1.\n\nNext, looking at Flora Tallinn in the 2011-12 season. The claim mentions the first leg having a score of 1-0. Checking the table entries for 2011-12:\n\nThere's a second qualifying round against FC Copenhagen with a score of 0-1, but that's Flora Tallinn on the away leg maybe. Then there's another row in the group stages where they played against Rubin Kazan and lost 0-3, and against Tottenham Hotspur with a 0-4 loss. However, I'm looking for their first match of the season.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if Flora Tallinn had a match in the playoff round or any earlier stage. The playoff round shows FK Partizan Belgrade vs. FC Flora Tallinn with a score of 1-1. But that's not the group stages yet.\n\nIn the group stages, Flora Tallinn played against Rubin Kazan and lost 0-3, and then against Tottenham Hotspur with a 0-4 loss. So their first match in the group stages was against Rubin Kazan where they lost 0-3, but that's not 1-0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"FC Flora Tallinn have a 1st leg of 1-0.\" Perhaps it's referring to an earlier round, like the second qualifying round or another stage before group stages.\n\nLooking back at the table, for the 2011-12 season, there are two relevant entries: one in the third qualifying round against Juventus FC with a score of 1-4 (wait, no, that's for another team). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nFor Juventus FC in 2010-11:\n- They played in the second qualifying round and lost to Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv 1-1.\n- Then they played the third qualifying round against Juventus (opponent?) with a score of 0-1.\n\nWait, that might be Juve playing against another team. Maybe it's a typo, but looking at the table, one row says \"third qualifying round\" with opponent FC Juventus and the result 0-1, which makes sense because they would play each other in qualifying rounds.\n\nSo in 2010-11, their first match was probably the third qualifying round where they lost 0-1. So that's correct.\n\nFor Flora Tallinn in 2011-12:\nLooking through the group stages, their first game was against Rubin Kazan with a score of 0-3, but the claim says 1-0. That doesn't match. However, I see another row where they played against Partizan Belgrade in the playoff round with a 1-1 draw. But that's after the group stages.\n\nWait, perhaps the first leg refers to their initial match in the competition. Let me think about the structure of UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds. The process starts with the second qualifying round, then third, then play-off round, followed by group stages.\n\nSo for 2011-12, FC Flora Tallinn's first match was probably in the second qualifying round or third qualifying round. Let's see:\n\nIn the table, for 2011-12, there are entries like:\n- Second qualifying round: Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv vs. someone else.\n- Third qualifying round: Juventus FC vs. someone with a score.\n\nWait, looking at the relevant cells, in the third qualifying round, it shows FC Flora Tallinn's match against some team. Let me check:\n\nOne row says \"third qualifying round\" with opponent FC Flora Tallinn and the result 0-3. Wait no, that can't be because a team doesn't play against themselves. Maybe I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, looking at another entry: In the second qualifying round, someone played Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC and scored 1-1. Then in the third qualifying round, perhaps Flora Tallinn played against a different opponent with a score of 1-0.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the exact match where they scored 1-0. Let me go through each row:\n\nLooking at the rows again for 2011-12:\n1. Second qualifying round: Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC vs. someone else with a score of 1-1.\n2. Third qualifying round: Juventus FC vs. someone with a score of 0-1 (that's their match).\n3. Play-off round: FK Partizan Belgrade vs. FC Flora Tallinn with a 1-1 draw.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing the first leg where they scored 1-0. Alternatively, perhaps it's not in the qualifying rounds but in the group stages. Wait, their first match in the group stages was against Rubin Kazan with a 0-3 loss. So that can't be it either.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is incorrect because Flora Tallinn didn't have a 1-0 score in any of their initial matches. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which match they are referring to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first leg refers to a different competition or round. But given the context of the table, I need to look for a match where FC Flora Tallinn scored 1-0.\n\nWait, another approach: in the third qualifying round, someone played against FC Flora Tallinn with a score of 1-0. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rows again, there's an entry that says \"third qualifying round\" with opponent FC Flora Tallinn and result 1-0? No, I don't see such a row.\n\nWait, perhaps the match is between another team and Flora Tallinn where they scored 1-0. But according to the table, in the third qualifying round, Flora Tallinn played against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC with a score of 1-1, not 1-0.\n\nWait, no: looking at the entries:\n\nThe second qualifying round is between Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC and someone else (probably not Flora). The third qualifying round has Juventus FC against someone else. Then in the group stages, Flora plays Rubin Kazan and loses 0-3.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the claim is referring to a different stage or a match that isn't detailed in this table. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the first leg of the 2011-12 season for Flora Tallinn was in the second qualifying round. Let me check: they played against someone in the second qualifying round with a score of 2-0. Wait, no, the second qualifying round row says \"third qualifying round\" and opponent FC Flora Tallinn.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the table doesn't list all matches, but based on what's there:\n\nJuventus in 2010-11 had a match where they lost 0-1, which aligns with the claim.\n\nFlora Tallinn in 2011-12 didn't have a first leg score of 1-0; their group stage opener was 0-3 against Rubin Kazan. So perhaps the claim is incorrect about Flora Tallinn's result but correct about Juventus's result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps they had a playoff before the group stages where they scored 1-0, but looking at the table, their playoff match was a 1-1 draw.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not about the first leg in terms of rounds but the first game overall. But in that case, Flora Tallinn played in the third qualifying round against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC with a score of 2-0, but I don't see that in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect about Flora Tallinn's result. They might have lost their first match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should conclude that Juventus's part of the claim is correct (0-1 loss), but Flora Tallinn didn't have a 1-0 score in any listed matches, so the claim may be partially accurate or incorrect.\n\nBut since the user provided the table, I need to rely on it. From the table, Juve had a 0-1 result in their third qualifying round match, which was likely their first significant match of that season. Flora Tallinn's first group stage match was a 0-3 loss, so they didn't have a 1-0 score in any listed match.\n\nTherefore, the claim about Flora Tallinn is incorrect based on the provided table.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n**Juventus' Performance:**\n- In the 2010-11 season, during the third qualifying round, Juventus faced a match where they incurred a 0-1 loss. This aligns with the claim.\n\n**FC Flora Tallinn's Performance:**\n- For FC Flora Tallinn in the 2011-12 season, their initial group stage match resulted in a 0-3 loss against Rubin Kazan. The table does not indicate any matches where they scored a 1-0 victory or drew 1-1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim about Juventus's performance is accurate; however, the assertion regarding FC Flora Tallinn's result appears to be incorrect based on the provided information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe claim that Juventus lost 0-1 in their first match of the 2010-11 season is correct. However, FC Flora Tallinn did not have a 1-0 score in any of their matches during the 2011-12 season as detailed in the table provided.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify a claim about the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup based on the provided table and determine whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The user mentioned: \"in 2003 at the uefa intertoto cup the round be first round and second round when the first leg be 2 - 1 and 0 - 2.\" So, it seems they're referring to specific match outcomes in the first and second rounds where one match had a score of 2-1 and another had 0-2.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. The table lists various matches across different competitions, years, and stages. My goal is to find any relevant cells related to the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup in the first and second rounds with the specified scores.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are two entries for the year 2011-12 and another entry under \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league.\" But where is the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup?\n\nUpon closer inspection, I notice that not all rows specify the competition. For example, one row says: \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league\" but doesn't mention the competition name. However, I'm looking for entries related to the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003.\n\nWait a minute, scanning through the table again, I realize that most of the rows are for either the Champions League or the Europa League, and some specify the year as 2010-11 or 2011-12. There's no row explicitly mentioning the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup with the stages of first round and second round.\n\nGiven this, it seems the table doesn't include any data for the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Therefore, there are no cells in the provided data that match the claim.

Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"Paok FC\" is a specific football club. The claim states that they did not participate in the 2011-12 Europa League. So I need to check if Paok FC was indeed part of that tournament according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows related to the 2011-12 uefa europa league. Specifically, there are multiple entries under the \"uefa europa league\" column. The key here is to find any row where \"paok fc\" is listed as part of that tournament in the relevant year.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if Paok FC appears in 2011-12:\n\n1. I notice a row with \"2011 - 12 uefa europa league\" as the first column, and it mentions Paok FC in two different group stages:\n   - One where the score is 1-2.\n   - Another with a score of 1-3.\n\nThese entries indicate that Paok FC did play in the 2011-12 Europa League. This directly contradicts the claim that they did not participate.\n\nAdditionally, there are other rows for the same tournament involving different teams like Tottenham Hotspur FC and FK Rubin Kazan, but those don't impact this specific check on Paok FC.\n\nSo based on the table, Paok FC was indeed part of the 2011-12 Europa League group stages.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim made is true based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Celtic be the club when the 1st leg be 0 - 1 and AC Omonia be the club when the 1st leg be also 0 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. It seems like it's saying that in two different instances where the first leg of a match resulted in a 0-1 scoreline, Celtic was the home club in one case and AC Omonia was the home club in another.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to scan through each row to find entries where the \"First Leg\" column has a 0-1 result. Each relevant cell should then be checked to see which team was playing as the home team, as that's important for verifying the claim.\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: First leg is 0-1. The away team is Celtic, and the home team is AC Omonia? Wait, no, looking at the table, I need to clarify which columns represent home and away teams. The columns are \"First Leg\", then presumably the scores of both legs. It's a bit unclear, but I think each row represents two legs, with first leg on the left and second leg on the right.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the table seems to have each row as a competition, with details like \"uefa europa league\" etc., then columns for group stages, playoff rounds, etc. The first column is probably the match summary or result, but it's not clear if that's the first leg or something else.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the table, I think each row might represent a competition and various stages within it, with different columns like \"second qualifying round,\" \"third qualifying round,\" etc. But the key is to find rows where the first leg (probably the initial match) resulted in a 0-1 score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first column indicates the stage of the competition or something else, but I'm not entirely sure. It's possible that the columns after \"First Leg\" indicate different stages within a competition.\n\nWait, perhaps each row is a separate match. For example, the first row might be a match where Celtic played against AC Omonia with a scoreline of 0-1 in the first leg, and then another score in the second leg. But I'm not sure because the columns don't clearly state the opponents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is for a different competition, so perhaps I need to look at the specific stages where a 0-1 result occurred.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for any occurrence where \"First Leg\" is 0-1 and which team was the home club in that instance.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nI see rows like:\n- 2010-11 uefa europa league, second qualifying round: Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC vs Juventus. But the first leg result isn't clear here.\n- Another row mentions Celtic: \"First Leg\" column has a score of 0-1 when Celtic was the away team against AC Omonia? Wait, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the table provided, each row seems to represent a different match or stage. For example:\n\nIn the row for \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league\":\n- Second qualifying round: Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC vs Juventus. The first leg result isn't explicitly given here.\n- Third qualifying round: Juventus vs Celtic, with a score of 0-1.\n\nWait, no, looking at the columns after \"First Leg,\" I see entries like \"Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC\" and \"Juventus.\" It might not be the right approach to look for first leg scores. Perhaps the \"First Leg\" column is indicating whether it's the first match in a two-legged tie.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a different competition, and the columns after are stages within that competition. So, for example, the \"group stages\" would have multiple matches for each team, but I'm not sure how to extract the first leg results from that.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the \"First Leg\" column for each entry where it's 0-1 and then see which clubs are involved as home teams.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nIn the row labeled \"2011 - 12 uefa europa league\":\n- Playoff round: FK Partizan vs Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC. First leg result is 1-1.\n- Group stages: Rubin Kazan vs Liverpool, score 0-3 in first leg (not 0-1).\nAnother group stage entry: Tottenham Hotspur vs Inter Milan, first leg 1-3.\n\nIn the same row, FK Partizan and Bnei Yehuda have a playoff round with first leg 1-1. Not helpful.\n\nLooking further down, there's another entry for \"2011 - 12 uefa europa league\":\n- Group stages: AC Omonia vs Liverpool, score 0-1 in first leg.\nSo here, the home team is AC Omonia, and they lost 0-1 to Liverpool in the first leg.\n\nThen, looking elsewhere, I think there's a row for \"2012 - 13 uefa europa league\":\n- Group stages: Celtic vs FC Barcelona. First leg score is 1-1.\nAnother group stage entry: AC Omonia vs Spartak Moscow, first leg 0-1.\n\nWait, so in this row, AC Omonia plays Spartak Moscow, and the first leg result is 0-1 at home for AC Omonia.\n\nSo, to break it down:\n\n- In one case, AC Omonia was the home team and lost 0-1 in the first leg.\n- Is there a case where Celtic was the home team and lost 0-1?\n\nLooking through other rows, I see:\n\nIn the \"2013 - 14 uefa europa league\" row:\n- Group stages: Celtic vs Inter Milan. First leg result is 0-1 for Celtic at home? Wait, no, if it's 0-1, and assuming it's the first leg, then the home team (Celtic) lost 0-1.\n\nWait, that would mean Celtic was the home team and lost 0-1 in the first leg. So yes, that matches part of the claim.\n\nAnother instance: In \"2014 - 15 uefa europa league\":\n- Group stages: AC Omonia vs Inter Milan. First leg result is 0-2 for AC Omonia at home.\n\nWait, so AC Omonia lost 0-2 as home team in the first leg.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n1. Celtic was the home team in a match where the first leg ended with a 0-1 scoreline.\n2. AC Omonia was also the home team in another match where the first leg ended with a 0-1 scoreline.\n\nTherefore, both clubs have been involved as home teams when their respective matches had a first-leg score of 0-1.\n\nHence, the claim seems to hold true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table evidence. Both Celtic and AC Omonia were home teams in separate matches where the first leg resulted in a 0-1 scoreline.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, the claim is correct. Based on the table, Celtic was the home team when their match had a first-leg score of 0-1, and AC Omonia also served as the home team in another match with a first-leg score of 0-1.",

The claim is: \"juventus fc do not score a goal in the first leg of the 2010 - 11 uefa europa league.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look through the table provided and find any cells related to Juventus FC in the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League's first leg.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple entries for \"juventus fc\". Let me scan each row:\n\nRow with index -1: It mentions Juventus FC in group stages. But it doesn't specify if this is the first leg or not. The score is 0-3 against Rubin Kazan. So that's a match they lost.\n\nNext, another entry: same as above, group stages, but different opponents. They scored 1-3 against Tottenham Hotspur FC. That's another loss.\n\nThen, again Juventus in group stages with a score of 1-4 against Rubin Kazan. Another loss.\n\nWait, none of these entries say that they didn't score any goals. All the scores show that they did score goals, just that they lost all their matches.\n\nSo the claim is saying they didn't score any goal in the first leg. But from the table, it seems like they scored goals in multiple legs, even though they lost each time.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because Juventus FC did score goals in those matches.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Juventus FC did not score a goal in the first leg is false because the table shows they scored goals in subsequent matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"fc rubin kazan\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tottenham hotspur fc\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"paok fc\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"no team scored more than 6 goals in the first leg of the 1994-95 season\" is true based on the provided table. First, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in the first leg during the 1994-95 season, no team scored more than six goals.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various matches from different competitions and years, but specifically for the 1994-95 season, I should focus on entries that fall within that year. The claim mentions \"first leg,\" so I need to identify which cells pertain to that.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table related to the 1994-95 season. Let's see:\n\n1. The first entry is under 2010-11 for Europa League, so not relevant.\n2. Next, the rows from 2010-11 onwards are all after the 1994-95 season, except for one row:\n   - There's a row with \"2011-12 uefa champions league\" and \"second qualifying round,\" which is later than 1994-95.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the first leg in 1994-95 would be under the 1994-95 season. But scanning through the table provided, I don't see any entries for 1994-95 specifically. That might mean there's no data here to support or contradict the claim. \n\nBut maybe I missed it. Let me check each row:\n\n- The first entry is about 2010-11 uefa europa league.\n- Next, 2011-12 champions and europa leagues.\n- Then, 2012-13 entries, but not 1994-95.\n\nSo, if the table doesn't have any data for 1994-95, then there's no information to verify whether any team scored more than six goals in that season's first leg. Without data from that specific year, I can't confirm or deny the claim.\n\nHowever, perhaps the user made a mistake in the context of the table. If the relevant data isn't present, then the statement can't be verified as true because there's no evidence supporting it one way or another.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data available to check, the claim can't be fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified due to insufficient data in the provided table for the 1994-95 season. Without relevant entries, we cannot confirm whether any team scored more than six goals during that period.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 2003 at the uefa intertoto cup the first and second round be tie in the first leg.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries in the table related to 2003 and the uefa intertoto cup.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- There's a row labeled \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league\" which is probably not relevant since it's about Europa League.\n- The next one is \"2011 - 12\", so that's after 2003. So, I need to check earlier years.\n\nWait, looking at the table, the rows start from \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league\" and then go into 2011-12. There are no entries before 2010 in the table provided. That means there might not be any data for 2003.\n\nIf that's the case, there's no way to verify if the first and second rounds were tied in the first leg because the relevant data isn't present in the table.

    "claim": "celtic and omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"Celtic and Omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1\" is true or false by checking the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There are multiple rows representing different matches, each with several columns like Match Date, Home Team, Away Team, and Score. The claim mentions \"first leg of 0 - 1,\" which implies a two-legged match where Celtic was the home team in one leg and Omonia was the away team, resulting in a score of 0-1.\n\nI need to search for any matches where Celtic is the home team and Omonia is the away team with a score of 0-1. Alternatively, it could be that Omonia is the home team and Celtic is the away team with the same score.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 6: Home Team - Juventus FC vs. Away Team - Celtic. Score is 0-1 for Celtic, so it's a loss for the home team (Juventus). This doesn't involve Omonia.\n\nRows 10 and 11: These are both in the 2010-11 Europa League. The first row shows Bnei Yehuda vs. Celtic with a score of 1-1. The second row is Juventus vs. Celtic, again 0-1, but that's not Omonia.\n\nRows 12 and 13: These are about the 2011-12 Champions League qualifying rounds. Row 12 shows Flora Tallinn vs. Celtic with a 1-0 score. Row 13 is Copenhagen vs. Celtic, which is 0-1, again not involving Omonia.\n\nRows 14 and 15: These are in the 2011-12 Europa League. The first row is Partizan vs. Celtic, score 1-1. The second row is Rubin Kazan vs. Tottenham with a 0-3 score. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 16: Tottenham vs. Celtic, 1-3. Not Omonia.\n\nRows 17 and 18: Both involve Paok FC and Rubin Kazan against Tottenham. No mention of Omonia.\n\nRow 19: Paok FC vs. Celtic, 1-2. Again, not Omonia.\n\nRow 20: Paok FC vs. Celtic again, 1-3. Still no Omonia.\n\nRows 21 and 22: Both are about Rubin Kazan and Tottenham, so not relevant here.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I don't see any match where both teams are Celtic and Omonia with a score of 0-1 in either leg. Since the claim is about \"never having a first leg\" of that score, I need to check if such a first leg exists.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go back. The rows might not all be unique matches. For example, row 6 is Juventus vs. Celtic (0-1), but Omonia isn't involved there. Similarly, rows involving Celtic and other teams don't mention Omonia.\n\nI should also check if any of the matches involve both Celtic and Omonia with a first leg score of 0-1. Since none of the rows show such a matchup, it seems that such a scenario doesn't exist in the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim is likely true because there are no entries where Celtic plays against Omonia with a first-leg score of 0-1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
