    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the game against washington redskins that result in l 30 - 27 happen in december 7 , 1975.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n\n1. It's a game against the Washington Redskins.\n2. The result of the game is an \"l\" (loss) with a score of 30-27.\n\nSo, I need to find a row in the table where the opponent is the Washington Redskins and the result is \"l 30 - 27.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Let me go through each row to check for these conditions.\n\nStarting from row 1: Opponent is St Louis Cardinals (not Redskins), so skip.\n\nRow 2: Detroit Lions, result is l 17-14. Not matching the score.\n\nRow 3: New Orleans Saints, different opponent. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: San Francisco 49ers, again not the opponent we're looking for.\n\nRow 5: Los Angeles Rams, result is l 22-7. Still not matching.\n\nRow 6: Cincinnati Bengals, result is l 21-14. No match.\n\nRow 7: New Orleans Saints again. Not Redskins.\n\nRow 8: Minnesota Vikings. Opponent is wrong.\n\nRow 9: Los Angeles Rams once more. Not relevant.\n\nRow 10: Denver Broncos, opponent not correct.\n\nRow 11: Oakland Raiders, different game.\n\nRow 12: Now, here's the Washington Redskins as the opponent. The result is l 30-27. That's exactly what the claim mentions.\n\nSo, this row (row 12) has the opponent as Washington Redskins and the result as l 30-27. \n\nNow, looking at the date for row 12: It's December 7, 1975. The claim also specifies that this happened on December 7, 1975.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met in row 12. So, the relevant cells are row_index 12 and column_name \"result.\"\n\nWait, but I should make sure about the dates. Let me check each row's date to confirm:\n\nRow 1: September 21, 1975\nRow 2: September 28, 1975\n...\nRow 12: December 7, 1975. Correct.\n\nSo, all details align in row 12.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the game against at st louis cardinal that result in l 23 - 20 have 42172 as its highest attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions a game against St Louis Cardinals, which resulted in an 'l' (loss) with the score 23-20. The attendance for that game was 42,172, and it's claimed to be the highest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of games. I need to find the row where the opponent is St Louis Cardinals, the result starts with 'l' (loss), and the score is 23-20.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 1: Opponent is St Louis Cardinals. Result is l 23 - 20. Attendance is 42,172. So this matches exactly what the claim is talking about.\n\nNow, I need to check if 42,172 is the highest attendance in that game. Since it's the only relevant row for this specific game, there's no other game against St Louis Cardinals with a higher attendance. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones in week 1: opponent and result columns because those attributes directly relate to the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the l 23 - 20 result be on october 5 , 1975.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that a game with the result \"l 23 - 20\" happened on October 5, 1975.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of games. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. So to check this claim, I need to find any row where the result is \"l 23 - 20\" and see if its date matches October 5, 1975.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Week 1 on September 21, 1975 against St. Louis Cardinals. Result was l 23-20. So the result matches \"l 23 - 20\" and the date is in September, not October. So this doesn't match.\n\nRows 2 to 4: Results are different, so no need to check further for these weeks.\n\nRow 3: Week 3 on October 5, 1975 against New Orleans Saints. The result was w 14-7. Doesn't match \"l 23 -20.\"\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the l 23 -20 result be on october 5 , 1975.\" So I need to check if any row has both the result and date as specified.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 4: Week 4 on October 12. Result is w 17-3.\n\nRows up to week 14 don't show another l 23 -20. Wait, in Row 1, it's l 23-20, but that was on September 21.\n\nSo the only row with result l 23 -20 is Week 1 on September 21, not October 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no game with \"l 23 -20\" on October 5, 1975. The game happened in week 1, which was in September.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check each row of the table for a match where the result is \"l 23 - 20\" and the date is October 5, 1975. \n\nUpon examining the table:\n- Week 1 (September 21, 1975) has the result \"l 23 - 20\".\n- There is no entry in week 3 (October 5, 1975) with that specific result.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the game with \"l 23 - 20\" occurred earlier than October 5, 1975.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the game that result in w 31 - 9 happen on november 9 , 1975.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The key here is \"result in w 31 - 9\" and the date \"november 9 , 1975.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance. Each row represents a game. So I need to find a game where the result is exactly \"w 31 - 9\" and check if it occurred on November 9, 1975.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from row 1: The first game is week 1 on September 21, 1975. The result was l (loss) 23-20. Not the result we're looking for.\n\nRow 2: Week 2 on September 28, 1975. Result was l 17-14. Still not matching.\n\nRow 3: Week 3 on October 5, 1975. The result was w 14-7. So that's a win, but the score isn't 31-9.\n\nRow 4: Week 4 on October 12, 1975. Result was w 17-3. Not matching.\n\nRow 5: Week 5 on October 19, 1975. They lost 22-7. Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Week 6 on October 26, 1975. Lost 21-14. Not our result.\n\nRow 7: Week 7 on November 2, 1975. Result was l 23-7. No match.\n\nRow 8: Week 8 on November 9, 1975. The result is l 38-0. Hmm, a loss but the score doesn't match 31-9.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check further. Let's continue.\n\nRow 9: Week 9 on November 16, 1975. Result was l 16-7. Not it.\n\nRow 10: Week 10 on November 23, 1975. They won 35-21. No match.\n\nRow 11: Week 11 on November 30, 1975. Lost 37-34. Not relevant.\n\nRow 12: Week 12 on December 7, 1975. Lost 30-27. Not it.\n\nRow 13: Week 13 on December 14, 1975. Result was w 31-9. Ah, here we go! So this game took place on December 14, 1975, not November 9th as the claim states.\n\nSo the claim says that the \"w 31 - 9\" result happened on November 9, but according to the table, it actually occurred a month later on December 14. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should also verify if there's any other game with \"w 31-9.\" Scanning through all the results again, only row 13 matches that exact result of a win by 31 points against San Francisco 49ers on December 14th.\n\nThus, since the date in the claim doesn't match the actual date from the table, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
