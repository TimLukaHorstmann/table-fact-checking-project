Benny Friedman is a quarterback for Michigan.\n2. Edward L. McMillan is a center for Princeton.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant cells that support or contradict these statements.\n\nStarting with the first part: Benny Friedman as a quarterback for Michigan. I'll search through each row in the 'name' column to see if \"benny friedman\" appears. Scanning down, in row 4, the name listed is \"benny friedman\" under the 'quarterback' position and his school is Michigan. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow for the second part: Edward L. McMillan as a center for Princeton. I'll look for \"edward l mcmillan\" in the table. In row 3, the name is \"edward l mcmillan,\" and his position is 'center' with school Princeton.

I need to find the row where the name is \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully\" and see what their position is. Scanning through each row: \n\nRow 0 has \"ends\" as the position for that group of players, so that's correct.\n\nNow, checking if they are in the end position. The table lists 'end' as a position, so yes, they play the end.\n\nNext, for the second part, Ed Weir and Ralph Chase should be tackles. I need to find their row. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1 has \"ed weir ralph chase\" listed under the 'tackles' position. So that matches too.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

So Carl Diehl and Ed Hess are indeed listed as playing guard. That part seems correct.\n\n2. **Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play the tackle position.**\n   - In the table, under the \"tackles\" column, the row has \"ed weir ralph chase\".

The claim says: \"Ed Weir Ralph Chase be from Nebraska and Pittsburgh respectively, and Benny Friedman be from Michigan.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nStarting with \"Ed Weir Ralph Chase\" \u2014 looking through the table, I remember that there's a row where the first cell is \"tackles\" and the name is \"ed weir ralph chase\". So this must be the relevant row. The position column here is \"tackles\", so the relevant cells are at row index 1 (since rows start from 0) for the 'position' and 'name' columns.\n\nNext, \"be from Nebraska and Pittsburgh respectively.\" In the table under the 'school' column for that row, it says \"nebraska pittsburgh\". So the schools are Nebraska and Pittsburgh. Therefore, this part is supported by the relevant cells: position (tackles) at row 1 and school at row 1.\n\nNow, moving on to \"Benny Friedman be from Michigan.\" Looking through the table again, I find a row where the first cell is \"quarterback\" and the name is \"benny friedman\". The 'school' column here is \"michigan\", so this is correct. The relevant cells are position (quarterback) at row 5 and school (Michigan) at row 5.\n\nI should also check if there's any contradiction or missing information. For both parts of the claim, the necessary details match the table. There's no indication that Ed Weir and Ralph Chase are not from Nebraska and Pittsburgh, respectively, based on the 'school' column.

It has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. The rows list different positions along with the names of players, their schools, whether they were unanimous selections, and notes about their Hall of Fame profiles.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific players: Ernie Big Dog Nevers from Stanford playing fullback, and Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange playing halfback. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For the \"fullback\" position (row 6), the name listed is \"ernie big dog nevers\" from Stanford. That matches the first part of the claim exactly. So this cell is relevant.\n\n- Next, for the \"halfback\" position (row 7), the name listed is \"andy swede oberlander red grange\" from Dartmouth and Illinois. The claim mentions Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange playing halfback. That also matches. So this cell is relevant as well.\n\nI should check if there are any discrepancies or additional information that might affect the truthfulness of the claim. For example, the school for Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange in the table is Dartmouth and Illinois, while the claim only mentions Stanford and doesn't specify Dartmouth. However, since the claim is about the positions and names, and the schools are just additional info, it doesn't negate the fact that they played those positions.\n\nAlso, looking at the \"unanimous\" and Hall of Fame columns doesn't seem relevant to the claim, which is only about their positions and names.\n\nTherefore, both players are correctly listed in their respective positions as per the table.

The claim states: \"oosterbaan tully both played tackle, and weir and chase play halfback.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. The table has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. Each row represents a different position, with multiple players listed under \"name\" for certain positions.\n\nLooking at the first part of the claim: \"oosterbaan tully both played tackle.\" I need to find these names in the table. Benny Oosterbaan and Mike Tully are mentioned together as a name in the row where position is \"ends.\" However, their position is ends, not tackle. So that doesn't match the claim about tackle.\n\nNext, looking for players who played tackle. The row with position \"tackles\" has two names: Ed Weir and Ralph Chase. Their schools are Nebraska and Pittsburgh. That matches the first part of the claim about playing tackle, but wait, the claim says both Oosterbaan and Tully played tackle, which they didn't\u2014they were ends.\n\nSo the first part is incorrect. Now, moving to the second part: \"weir and chase play halfback.\" In the table, the row for \"halfbacks\" includes Andy Swede, Oberlander, Red Grange, and others. Ed Weir isn't listed here; he's in the tackle position. Ralph Chase is also not listed under halfbacks. The halfbacks are different players.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't align with the table data. The first part incorrectly assigns tackle to Oosterbaan and Tully, who played ends.

The claim is: \"diehl hess both played end , weir and chase play halfback.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. Each row represents a player with their respective details. My task is to verify the claim using this table.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n\n1. \"diehl hess both played end.\" So, I need to check if Diehl and Hess are listed as playing the position of 'end' in the table.\n2. \"weir and chase play halfback.\" I'll need to verify if Weir and Chase are recorded as playing 'halfback'.\n\nI should look for each player's name in the 'name' column and see what their positions are. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with Diehl and Hess: Looking at the table, under position 'guards', I see \"carl diehl ed hess.\" So both Carl Diehl and Ed Hess have the position of guards, not ends. That means the first part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other rows for these names. There's no other row with 'diehl' or 'hess,' so they are only listed as guards. Therefore, they didn't play end.\n\nNext, looking at Weir and Chase: The table has a row where the position is 'tackles' with the name \"ed weir ralph chase.\" So both Ed Weir and Ralph Chase played tackle, not halfback. That contradicts the second part of the claim.\n\nAlso, I should check if any rows have positions that match the claim beyond what's directly named. For example, in the 'halfbacks' row, it mentions Andy Swede Oberlander and Red Grange as halfbacks. But Weir and Chase are under 'tackles,' so they didn't play halfback.\n\nPutting this together, both parts of the claim don't hold true based on the table data.

So, the task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"friedman play fullback and mcmillan play quarterback.\" My goal is to check if each part of this claim matches the information in the provided HTML table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various positions along with names of individuals associated with those positions. The key here is to find out if Friedman plays fullback and McMillan plays quarterback.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"friedman play fullback.\" I'll search the 'name' column for any entry that includes Friedman. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully\n- Row 1: Ed Weir Ralph Chase\n- Row 2: Carl Diehl Ed Hess\n- Row 3: Edward L McMillan\n- Row 4: Benny Friedman\n- Row 5: Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange\n- Row 6: Ernie Big Dog Nevers\n\nIn row 4, we see \"Benny Friedman\" listed under the 'name' column with the position 'quarterback'. Wait a minute, that's not fullback. So there's no entry where Friedman plays fullback. That might mean the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, checking \"mcmillan play quarterback.\" Looking for McMillan in the 'name' column:\n\n- Row 3: Edward L McMillan, position 'center'.\n\nHmm, center isn't quarterback. So McMillan doesn't play quarterback either.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row's name and position to ensure I haven't overlooked any entries. \n\nRow 4 is Benny Friedman as quarterback, not fullback. Row 3 is McMillan as center. No one else seems to match the claim.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't align with the table data. There's no evidence that Friedman plays fullback or McMillan plays quarterback based on this table.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The cells in question are where Friedman and McMillan are mentioned.

So I need to find where in the table it says something about Weir and Chase going to Princeton. \n\nI'll scan through each row to see if either Weir or Chase are listed with Princeton as their school. The relevant columns here would be the 'row_index' for each of them and their respective 'school' column.\n\nFrom the table, I remember that in the second row, under 'tackles', it says 'ed weir ralph chase'. Their schools are listed as 'nebraska pittsburgh'. Wait, that doesn't match Princeton. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps the claim is saying they both attended Princeton, so if the table shows they went to other schools, then the claim would be false.\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows again. Looking for Weir and Chase specifically. Oh, in the 'tackles' row, their schools are Nebraska and Pittsburgh. So that means Weir didn't go to Princeton either. Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect because both Weir and Chase didn't attend Princeton.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The claim says both attended Princeton, but according to the table, they went to Nebraska and Pittsburgh. So that part is false.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the claim: \"whereas Friedman attends Stanford.\" Looking at the 'quarterback' row, under 'school', it's listed as Michigan. So Friedman didn't attend Stanford either; he went to Michigan. Therefore, this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false. That means the overall claim is FALSE. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm checking all relevant cells. The columns involved in verifying this would be 'position' and 'school'.

Nevers from Michigan plays tackle with Swede.\n2. Grange plays fullback.\n\nI need to check each part against the table to see if there's any support for it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a position in football, and each column provides details about that position. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"position\", \"name\", and possibly others like \"unanimous\" or \"college hall of fame\".\n\nStarting with the first part: Nevers from Michigan plays tackle with Swede.\n\nFrom the table, I need to find any players named Nevers who go to Michigan and play Tackle. Looking at the table:\n\n- The fourth row (row_index 3) has position 'center', name 'Edward l mcmillan', school 'Princeton', etc.\n- The fifth row is 'quarterback' with name 'Benny Friedman' from Michigan, but no tackle mentioned here.\n- Wait, looking again: the second row is Tackles, with names 'Ed Weir Ralph Chase'. Their schools are Nebraska and Pittsburgh. No Nevers or Swede there.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each position for players named Nevers or Swede.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1.

Guards: Carl Diehl and Ed Hess from Dartmouth and Ohio State.\n4. Center: Edward L. McMillan from Princeton.\n5. Quarterback: Benny Friedman from Michigan.\n6.

Fullback: Ernie Big Dog Nevers from Stanford.\n\nWait, in the row for 'halfbacks' (row_index 5), one of the names is 'Andy Swede Oberlander', which mentions Swede. But his position is halfback, not tackle. So that's not relevant to the first part of the claim about playing tackle.\n\nLooking at the 'fullback' row (row_index 6): name is Ernie Big Dog Nevers from Stanford. His position is fullback, so he plays fullback, not tackle. \n\nWait, maybe I missed someone else? Let me check each row:\n\n- Ends: no.\n- Tackles: Ed Weir and Ralph Chase; their names don't include Nevers or Swede.\n- Guards: Carl Diehl and Ed Hess; no relevant names.\n- Center: none.\n- Quarterback: Benny Friedman from Michigan, but not tackle or related to Nevers/Swede.\n- Halfbacks: Andy Swede Oberlander. His position is halfback, so he's playing halfback, not tackle.\n- Fullback: Ernie Big Dog Nevers plays fullback.\n\nSo, the claim says Nevers from Michigan play tackle with Swede. But looking at the table, there's no one named Nevers from Michigan who plays tackle. The only Nevers I see is in the fullback position from Stanford. Swede Oberlander is a halfback from Dartmouth and Illinois. So the first part of the claim seems incorrect.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: Grange plays fullback.\n\nLooking through the table for any player named Grange. In the 'halfbacks' row (row_index 5), there's a name 'Red Grange' listed alongside Andy Swede Oberlander. His school is Illinois, and his position is halfback, not fullback. So he doesn't play fullback.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says \"grange play fullback\", so perhaps the claim is incorrect on that point too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if any player named Grange plays fullback elsewhere. Looking at the table:\n\n- The 'fullback' row (row_index 6) has Ernie Big Dog Nevers as the player, not Grange.\n- Other positions don't mention Grange in fullback.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table provided.\n\nWait, but I might have missed something. Let me go through each position again:\n\n- Ends: no relevant names.\n- Tackles: Ed Weir and Ralph Chase; not Nevers or Swede.\n- Guards: no.\n- Center: no.\n- Quarterback: Benny Friedman from Michigan, but he's a quarterback, not tackle.\n- Halfbacks: Andy Swede Oberlander plays halfback.\n- Fullback: Ernie Big Dog Nevers plays fullback.\n\nSo, for the first part of the claim, Nevers from Michigan playing tackle with Swede: No such player exists in the table. The only Nevers is from Stanford and plays fullback. Swede is a halfback. So that part is incorrect.\n\nFor the second part, Grange playing fullback: Looking at 'halfbacks' row, Red Grange plays halfback, not fullback. There's no player named Grange in the fullback position. Therefore, this part is also incorrect.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are false based on the table. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to identify which cells support this conclusion. Since both parts of the claim are incorrect, the relevant cells would be those that show Nevers and Grange are not in the positions stated.\n\nLooking at the 'fullback' row (row_index 6), player is Ernie Big Dog Nevers, position fullback from Stanford. So for the first part, we can point to this cell as showing Nevers doesn't play tackle.\n\nIn the 'halfbacks' row (row_index 5), Red Grange plays halfback. So that cell shows he doesn't play fullback.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index 6, column_name: position (to show Nevers is a fullback, not tackle)\n- row_index 5, column_name: position (to show Grange is a halfback, not fullback)\n\nAlternatively, if I'm only to consider direct contradiction, maybe pointing out the current positions.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to identify the cells that show that Nevers and Swede are not in tackle positions. Alternatively, since both parts of the claim are incorrect, their respective cells should be included.\n\nSo, for part one: looking at who plays fullback, which is row 6.\n\nFor part two: looking at Grange's position, which is row 5.\n\nThus, I'll include those cells.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing the provided table to evaluate the claim. The claim states that Nevers from Michigan play tackle with Swede and that Grange plays fullback. By examining each position in the table:\n\n1. **Nevers as Tackle**: \n   - No player named Nevers is listed as playing tackle. Ernie Big Dog Nevers is a fullback from Stanford.\n\n2. **Swede as Tackle**:\n   - Andy Swede Oberlander plays halfback, not tackle.\n\n3. **Grange as Fullback**:\n   - Red Grange plays halfback, not fullback.\n\nBased on this analysis, both parts of the claim are incorrect. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Players and Positions**:\n   - **Ends**: Bennie Oosterbaan (Michigan), Mike Tully (Dartmouth).\n   - **Tackles**: Ed Weir (Nebraska), Ralph Chase (Pittsburgh).\n   - **Guards**: Carl Diehl (Dartmouth), Ed Hess (Ohio State).\n   - **Center**: Edward L. McMillan (Princeton).\n   - **Quarterback**: Benny Friedman (Michigan).\n   - **Halfbacks**: Andy Swede Oberlander (Dartmouth, Illinois).\n   - **Fullback**: Ernie Big Dog Nevers (Stanford).\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Part of the Claim**:\n   - **Nevers from Michigan playing Tackle with Swede**:\n     - No player named Nevers is listed as a tackle.\n     - Ernie Big Dog Nevers plays fullback, not tackle.\n     - Andy Swede Oberlander is a halfback, not involved in this claim.\n\n   - **Grange playing Fullback**:\n     - Red Grange is a halfback, not a fullback.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. Neither Nevers from Michigan plays tackle with Swede, nor does Grange play fullback as stated. \n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- row 6 (Fullback): Ernie Big Dog Nevers plays fullback, not tackle.\n- row 5 (Halfbacks): Red Grange plays halfback, not fullback.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. The relevant cells in the table show that Ernie Big Dog Nevers plays fullback and Red Grange plays halfback, contradicting the claim. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{Claim is false}}",
