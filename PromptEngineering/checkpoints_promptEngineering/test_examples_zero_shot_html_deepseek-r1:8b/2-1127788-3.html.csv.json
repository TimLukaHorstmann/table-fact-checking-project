    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"2000 be the only year Rafael M\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that in the year 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition, and that no other year had him scoring more than one goal in international competitions.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different event with details like the goal number, date, score, result, and competition. The columns relevant here are 'date' and 'score'. I need to check for the years when M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal and see if 2000 is the only such year.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 2**: Date is 13 February 2000, score is 1-0. That's a goal, but it's just one.\n2. **Row 3**: Date is 3 September 2000, score is 5-1. So M\u00e1rquez scored 5 goals here. This is more than one and happens in 2000.\n3. **Row 12**: Date is 12 June 2011, score is 1-0. That's just one goal.\n\nWait, but the claim is about international competitions. I need to make sure that these competitions are indeed international. Looking at the 'competition' column:\n\n- For row 2: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup \u2013 international.\n- Row 3: 2002 World Cup Qualifier \u2013 international.\n- Row 12: 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup \u2013 international.\n\nSo, in 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal (5 goals) in an international competition. That supports the claim for 2000.\n\nNow, check other years:\n\nLooking through all the rows, I need to find if any year other than 2000 had M\u00e1rquez score more than one goal in an international competition.\n\n- **Row 4**: May 12, 2002: friendly match, scored 2 goals. But 'friendly' might not be considered a competitive international match.\n- **Row 6 and 7**: Both are World Cup Qualifiers in 2004 and 2005 respectively, but his score is 3-0 and 2-0. Wait, what's the 'score' here? For row 6: M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals (since it's 3-0). So that's three goals in a World Cup qualifier in 2004. That would mean he scored more than one goal in 2004.\n- Row 7: He scored 2 goals, so that's also more than one.\n\nSo, M\u00e1rquez scored multiple goals in international competitions in 2004 and 2005 as well, which means the claim is incorrect because those years also had him score more than one goal. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that only in 2000 did M\u00e1rquez score over one goal in an international competition. However, checking the table reveals he scored multiple goals in 2004 and 2005 as well.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says, \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which columns are relevant. The table has 'goal', 'date', 'score', 'result', and 'competition'. Since the claim is about the number of goals scored, the 'goal' column seems important. However, the claim mentions \"in his career at international friendly competitions,\" so I need to check both the 'goal' and 'competition' columns.\n\nLooking through the table, each row has a unique 'row_index', which probably corresponds to each game or event. The 'competition' column indicates the type of match. I'm interested in rows where the competition is \"friendly\" because that's what the claim refers to as international friendly competitions.\n\nNext, for each relevant row (where competition is friendly), I need to check how many goals M\u00e1rquez scored in those games. The claim says he scored 3 goals, so I should look at all friendly matches and sum up his goals there.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 4: Competition is friendly. Score was 2-1 for him, so 1 goal.\nRow 9: Friendly again. He scored 2-2, which might mean he didn't score, but I'm not sure. Wait, the 'score' column shows his team's score and the opponent's. So if it's 2-2, does that mean M\u00e1rquez scored a goal? The 'result' column says \"friendly,\" so maybe he scored once or more. But without exact data, perhaps this row isn't directly relevant.\nRow 12: Competition is friendly. His score was 1-0, so 1 goal.\nRow 13: Friendly again. Score is 1-0, so he scored 1 goal.\n\nWait, in the 'score' column for each row, it's his team's score followed by the opponent's. So if the cell is \"2 - 1\", that means M\u00e1rquez and his team scored 2 goals, opponents scored 1. So the number after the hyphen is his contribution? Or is that the total goals in the match?\n\nWait no, perhaps each cell represents the entire score of the match, not just M\u00e1rquez's goals. For example, row 4 has \"2 - 1\", which might mean M\u00e1rquez scored one goal and the opponent scored one. But I'm not sure if it's the total or his personal contribution.\n\nWait, maybe I need to assume that the 'score' is the total, so for each match, we can count how many goals he scored based on the result. For example, in row 4: \"2 - 1\" could mean M\u00e1rquez and his team scored two, opponents one. If the claim is about his goals, then if he scored once here.\n\nBut this approach might be too unclear. Alternatively, perhaps each 'score' cell directly shows how many goals M\u00e1rquez scored in that match. So for row 4: \"2 - 1\" would mean M\u00e1rquez scored two goals? Or maybe it's the total goals in the match, and I don't know his exact count.\n\nWait, this is a problem because without clear indication of whether 'score' refers to team or individual goals, it's ambiguous. So perhaps the table isn't sufficient for verification, which would mean the claim can't be fully supported.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'score' column does show M\u00e1rquez's goals. Let's check:\n\nRow 4: \"2 - 1\" \u2013 perhaps he scored two.\nRow 9: \"2 - 2\" \u2013 maybe zero.\nRow 12: \"1 - 0\" \u2013 one goal.\nRow 13: \"1 - 0\" \u2013 one goal.\n\nAdding up, in friendly matches, he scored 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4 goals. The claim says he scored three, so that's inconsistent. But wait, maybe the 'score' is total goals, and I can't determine his exact number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't provide enough data to confirm the claim accurately. Without knowing exactly how many goals he scored in each friendly match, it's impossible to verify if he scored three in his career at international friendlies.\n\nWait, but maybe the 'goal' column is his total goals per game. So for example, row 4: goal=1, row 12: goal=1, row 13: goal=1. That sums to 3 in friendly matches, which would align with the claim. But I'm not sure because other rows might have higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'goal' column refers to goals per match, so for each friendly match, M\u00e1rquez scored a certain number of goals, and adding those up across all his friendly games, we'd need to see if any three matches sum to exactly three goals. But without knowing all his goals across all friendlies, it's unclear.\n\nIn the table provided, there are multiple rows where competition is friendly:\n\nRow 4: goal=1\nRow 9: Maybe zero or not clear.\nRow 12: goal=1\nRow 13: goal=1\n\nSo in these, he scored a total of three goals across these four matches (assuming row 9 he didn't score). If the claim is about scoring three in his career at friendlies, but the table doesn't show all his games, it's unclear if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'score' column is his team's total, so for example, in row 4: \"2 - 1\" means he scored two goals. So then:\n\nRow 4: 2\nRow 9: Maybe zero\nRow 12:1\nRow 13:1\n\nThat would sum to four goals, which contradicts the claim of three.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Perhaps without clear data on how many goals he scored in each match, I can't verify the claim accurately.\n\nBut considering that the table only includes some matches and doesn't provide exact numbers beyond 'score', it's possible that the claim can't be fully supported based on this data.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells used for verification.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup.\" \n\nI'll start by understanding each part of this claim. It's about M\u00e1rquez scoring in two specific World Cups: 2006 and 2010.\n\nNext, I should go through the table to find any rows related to these two events and see if there's a goal scored by M\u00e1rquez in each.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The columns are: goal, date, score, result, competition.\n- Each row corresponds to a different match or event.\n\nI'll look for entries where the \"competition\" column mentions either \"2006 FIFA World Cup\" or \"2010 FIFA World Cup.\"\n\nStarting with the 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n- Scanning through the rows, I see row 8: \n  - goal: 1\n  - date: 24 June 2006\n  - score: 1 - 0\n  - result: 1 - 2 (aet)\n  - competition: 2006 FIFA World Cup\n\nSo, M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in this match. That supports the claim for 2006.\n\nNow checking the 2010 FIFA World Cup:\n- Looking through the rows, row 11:\n  - goal: 1\n  - date: 11 June 2010\n  - score: 1 - 1\n  - result: 1 - 1\n  - competition: 2010 FIFA World Cup\n\nM\u00e1rquez scored a goal here as well. So, he scored in both tournaments.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant rows are row 8 (2006) and row 11 (2010). Each of these has the \"score\" column where his goals are recorded. Wait, actually, the goal is a separate column, but in the table, it's under the \"goal\" column. So, for each relevant row, I need to include both the row index and the column name.\n\nWait, no\u2014the \"goal\" column indicates whether he scored. The \"score\" column shows the match result. But in the context of the claim, we're focusing on M\u00e1rquez's goals, so perhaps the \"goal\" column is more relevant? Or maybe the \"score\" column because it reflects his contributions.\n\nWait, no, the \"score\" might be the overall score between both teams. The \"goal\" column here seems to indicate whether he scored or not. For example, row 8 has goal=1, which means M\u00e1rquez scored one goal. Similarly, row 11 also has goal=1, indicating a single goal.\n\nSo for each relevant match (2006 and 2010), the \"goal\" column is where we see if M\u00e1rquez scored. Therefore, for both rows, the \"goal\" column is relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look at the \"result\" or \"score,\" but I think the \"goal\" column directly indicates his scoring. So in row 8, \"goal\" is 1, and in row 11, \"goal\" is 1 as well.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 8: goal column\n- Row 11: goal column\n\nSo, I'll include both of these.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about Mexico only losing once in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It says that Mexico lost only once in an international competition specifically when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. So, I need to find instances where Mexico lost and see if any of those losses occurred when M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a match: goal (probably the score by Mexico), date, actual score (which includes both teams), result, and competition. The 'result' column seems to indicate whether Mexico won or lost that match.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row:\n\n- Row 0: Result is Win. So not a loss.\n- Row 1: Win again.\n- Rows 2-7: Wins except for maybe some, but I need to check the 'result' specifically for losses.\nWait, actually, looking at the table, the 'result' column shows whether Mexico won or lost each match. For example, row 0 has result as '3 - 0', which I think is the actual score against whom? Wait, no, the 'score' column seems to be Mexico's goal, and the 'result' is how they performed. So in row 8, the result is a loss because it says '1 - 2 (aet)', meaning Mexico lost.\n\nWait, let me clarify: In each row, 'goal' might be the score by Mexico, and then the actual score would show both teams. For example, row 0 has '1 - 0' as the goal, but I'm not sure if that's Mexico's score or the opponent's. Looking at other rows, like row 4: '2 - 1' as goal and result also as 2-1 loss, so it seems 'score' is Mexico's score.\n\nWait no, looking again, perhaps each row has two scores. For example, in row 0, '1 - 0' is the score, but I'm not sure which team that represents. The 'result' column might indicate whether Mexico won or lost. So, for instance, in row 8, the result is a loss.\n\nI think the 'result' column directly shows if it's a win or loss for Mexico. So I need to find all rows where the result is Loss and also check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in those matches.\n\nRafael M\u00e1rquez is a Mexican player, so we need to see when he scored goals during Mexico's losses.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 8: Result is Loss. So that's one loss.\nCheck who scored the goals for Mexico. The 'goal' column here says '1 - 0', which might mean M\u00e1rquez scored a goal because it's likely he was part of the team. But I'm not entirely sure if '1 - 0' indicates his scoring or just the overall score.\n\nWait, actually, in each row, the first number is Mexico's goals, and the second number is the opponent's. So for example, row 8: 1 - 2 (aet). So Mexico scored once, opponents scored twice. The goal column here is '1', so that's one goal by Mexico.\n\nIf M\u00e1rquez scored in that match, then it would satisfy the condition of Mexico losing when he scored a goal. But I don't have information about which players scored in each match. The table doesn't provide details on who scored; it only shows the scores.\n\nTherefore, without knowing whether M\u00e1rquez was the scorer in any of Mexico's losses, we can't confirm if the claim is true or false. The only loss in the table is row 8, but without knowing if M\u00e1rquez scored that goal, we can't verify the claim. \n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are other losses beyond row 8. Looking through all the rows:\n\nRows 0-7: Wins.\n\nRow 8: Loss (1 - 2 aet).\n\nRows 9-13: Wins except maybe row 12, which is a win as well.\n\nWait, no, row 13's result is a Win because it shows '4 - 2' in the result column. So only one loss in row 8.\n\nSo the claim says that Mexico lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored. If there was indeed one loss and if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match, then it would be TRUE. But since we don't have data on who scored, we can't confirm. Therefore, the answer is that it's not possible to verify from the table.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The 'result' column might indicate whether Mexico lost or won, but the claim refers specifically to when M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, which might be linked to a loss. However, since there's only one loss and without knowing if he scored in that game, we can't confirm.\n\nBut wait, perhaps all of Mexico's losses are when M\u00e1rquez scored. But given the data, we don't know for sure. So maybe the answer is that it's not possible to confirm from the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mexico lost only once in an international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. To verify this:\n\n1. Identify all instances where Mexico lost (result column indicates loss).\n2. Check if M\u00e1rquez scored in those matches.\n\nFrom the table, there's only one loss in row 8. However, without information on who scored, it's impossible to confirm that M\u00e1rquez was the scorer. Thus, the claim cannot be verified as TRUE based solely on the provided data.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring fewer than 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored fewer than 3 goals in his international friendly matches. So I need to look for information about his goals in such games.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different event with details like goal, date, score, result, and competition. The columns relevant here are \"goal\" and \"competition.\" \n\nI should filter the rows where the competition is \"friendly\" because that's what the claim is about\u2014international friendly competitions. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 4: Competition is \"friendly,\" goals scored by M\u00e1rquez is 2.\n- Row 9: Competition is \"friendly,\" goals scored is also 2.\n\nSo there are two entries where the competition is friendly, and in both cases, M\u00e1rquez scored 2 goals each. \n\nNow, the claim says he scored fewer than 3 goals. Well, 2 is indeed fewer than 3. But wait, I should check if there are any other friendly matches where he might have scored more. From the table, only rows 4 and 9 are marked as \"friendly.\" Neither of these has him scoring 3 or more goals.\n\nI also need to make sure that these are international competitions because the claim specifies \"international friendly competition.\" Since both entries are under the competition column labeled as \"friendly\" without any mention of being national, I can assume they are international.\n\nSo, putting this together: M\u00e1rquez scored 2 goals in two friendly matches. That's fewer than 3, which supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 2 goals in each of the two friendly competitions listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"rafael m\u00e1rquez do not score a goal in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Rafael M\u00e1rquez didn't score any goals in international competitions during the years 2001, 2009, and 2012. My task is to check if this is true by examining the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a goal with details like date, score, result, and competition. The columns relevant here are \"score\" because it shows whether M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in each match. Also, the \"date\" column will help determine if the match was in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nSo I'll need to go through each row and check two things: whether the date falls into those years (2001, 2009, 2012), and whether M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match. If any of these matches in those years show that he scored, then the claim is FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nStarting with each relevant year:\n\n- **2001**: I need to find rows where the date is in 2001. Looking at the table:\n  - Row 3: September 3, 2000 \u2192 not 2001.\n  - Next, row 4: May 12, 2002 \u2192 still not 2001.\n  - Wait, maybe I missed a row between 2000 and 2002. Let me check again. Hmm, no, the next date after September 3, 2000 is May 12, 2002. So actually, there are no matches in 2001 according to this table. If that's the case, then M\u00e1rquez didn't score in 2001 because there were no competitions that year.\n\n- **2009**: Looking for dates around 2009:\n  - Row 13: October 30, 2013 \u2192 not 2009.\n  - Before that, row 12: June 12, 2011 \u2192 not 2009.\n  - Let's see, after row 4 (May 12, 2002), the next relevant date is July 24, 2003; then June 19, 2004; September 7, 2005; June 24, 2006; March 28, 2007; September 10, 2008; June 11, 2010; June 12, 2011; October 30, 2013. So no matches in 2009 are listed here. Therefore, M\u00e1rquez didn't have any competitions in 2009 according to the table.\n\n- **2012**: Checking for 2012:\n  - The latest date is October 30, 2013. Looking through the dates, I don't see a match on or around 2012. The closest is June 12, 2011 and then after that, it's 2013. So no matches in 2012 either.\n\nSince none of these years (2001, 2009, 2012) have any matches where M\u00e1rquez scored, the claim seems to hold true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that there are indeed no matches in those years. Let me double-check the dates:\n\n- 2001: The table goes from February 5, 1999 up, and after 2002, it's May 12, so nothing in 2001.\n- 2009: No rows match around 2009.\n- 2012: No matches in that year.\n\nSo all three years have no competitions where M\u00e1rquez scored. Thus, the claim is supported and should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim: \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\" My task is to determine if this is true or false by checking the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's referring to the year 2000 and stating that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal in an international competition during that year. Specifically, it mentions it's one of two years where he did this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different event with details like date, score, result, and competition. The columns are goal (which I assume is the number of goals scored), date, score against, result, and competition.\n\nI need to check all rows corresponding to 2000 because that's the year mentioned in the claim. From the table, let me look for rows where the 'date' column has \"2000\" as part of it. \n\nScanning through the dates: \n- Row 2: 13 February 2000\n- Any others? No, I don't see another row with date in 2000.\n\nSo only row 2 is relevant for 2000.\n\nNow, looking at that row (row 2), the 'score' column shows \"1 - 0\" and the result is \"4 - 0\". Wait, but the 'goal' column here says \"1\", which might be the team's score against. But in international competitions, goals scored by M\u00e1rquez would be his own contributions.\n\nI think I need to figure out what each column means. The table has a 'score' column that seems to represent the match result, like goals for and against. The 'goal' column is probably how many goals M\u00e1rquez scored. So in row 2, he scored 1 goal, which might be more than zero but not more than one. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the 'score' column again. For row 2, it's \"1 - 0\", so perhaps that's the team's score against their opponents, and M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal. So in this match, he scored at least one goal.\n\nThe claim says he scored more than 1 goal. But according to row 2, he only scored 1 goal. So does \"more than 1\" mean two or more? If that's the case, then in 2000, he didn't score more than one goal.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other rows where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in 2000. From the table, only row 2 is for 2000, and he scored 1 goal there.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is referring to two different years when he scored more than one goal. Let me look for those years elsewhere in the table. \n\nLooking through all the rows, I see that in 1999 (row 1), M\u00e1rquez scored 1-0 but not sure if it's more than one. Then in 2003 (row 5) he scored 1-0 and 2-0, so maybe two goals? But wait, looking at the 'goal' column: for row 5, the goal is 1? Or does that represent something else.\n\nWait no, the columns are:\n- goal: I think it's the team's goal, not M\u00e1rquez's.\n- score: perhaps team's total goals, against each other?\nI'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIn row 2, for example, 'score' is \"1 - 0\", and 'result' is \"4 - 0\". So maybe the first number is the team's goal, the second is the opponents'. But then what's the 'goal' column? Is it M\u00e1rquez's goals?\n\nLooking at row 2 again: 'goal' is 1. So perhaps he scored one goal in that match.\n\nIn other rows like row 5: 'score' is \"1 - 0\", and 'result' is \"2 - 0\". The 'goal' column here is 1, so M\u00e1rquez scored one goal again.\n\nRow 6: score is \"3 - 0\", result is \"3 - 0\", goal is 3. So he scored three goals there.\n\nWait, that's more than one. But the date in row 6 is February 13, 2004. So not relevant for the claim about 2000.\n\nLooking back at the years when M\u00e1rquez might have scored more than one goal: row 6 is 2004, he scored 3 goals. Row 8 (not shown) would be another year.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, I think only row 2 is for 2000, and he scored 1 goal. So that doesn't meet \"more than 1\".\n\nThe claim says it's one of two years when M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal. If 2000 isn't such a year, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me think again: perhaps 'goal' refers to goals for, and the team's total goals are in another column? Or maybe 'score' is the team's score, and 'goal' is M\u00e1rquez's contribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'score' includes both teams, like Team A scored X, Team B scored Y, so the goal column might be M\u00e1rquez's individual goals. But without more context, it's a bit unclear.\n\nAssuming that 'goal' is how many goals M\u00e1rquez scored in each match:\n\n- Row 2: 1 goal\n- Row 5: 1 goal\n- Row 6: 3 goals\n- Etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then in 2000, he scored only one goal. So the claim about 2000 is incorrect because it says more than one.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing another row for 2000 where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal. Let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices are as follows (assuming they start from 0):\n\n- Row 0: 1999\n- Row 1: 2000\n- Row 2: 2003\n- And so on.\n\nSo only row 1 is for 2000, and he scored 1 goal. Therefore, in 2000, he didn't score more than one goal.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that in 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal, which isn't true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition. After analyzing the table, only row 2 corresponds to the year 2000, where he scored 1 goal. Since \"more than one\" implies two or more goals, this makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the claim: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 [World Cup], but remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\"\n\nFirst, I'll analyze each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Scoring in 2006 FIFA World Cup:** The claim states that M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in 2006. Looking at the table, I should find any matches where his team was competing in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Scanning through the 'competition' column, I see \"2006 fifa world cup\" in row 8. Checking the score for that match: M\u00e1rquez scored a goal (1 - 0) as per the 'score' column. So this part seems to be supported.\n\n2. **Remained scoreless in 2010 FIFA World Cup:** The claim says he didn't score in the 2010 World Cup. Looking at the table again, in row 11, the competition is \"2010 fifa world cup.\" M\u00e1rquez's team scored 1-1, but the 'score' column shows both teams had 1-1. Since it's a draw and M\u00e1rquez didn't score any goals, this part also seems to hold.\n\nNow, I need to verify these points by identifying the relevant cells in the table. \n\nFor the 2006 goal, row_index is 8 (since it's the 9th row if we start counting from 0, but looking at the data, it's row 8). The relevant columns are 'score' and 'competition' because these show that he scored a goal in the 2006 World Cup.\n\nFor the 2010 match where he didn't score, it's row 11. Here, the 'score' column is crucial as it shows both teams had the same score without M\u00e1rquez contributing any goals.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 8, columns 'score' and 'competition'.\n- Row 11, columns 'score'.\n\nI should structure this in JSON as specified.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez's performance in the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, I checked each relevant row in the provided table.\n\n1. **2006 FIFA World Cup Goal:**  \n   - In row 8, under 'score', it shows \"1 - 0\", indicating M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n   - The competition is confirmed as the \"2006 fifa world cup\".\n\n2. **2010 FIFA World Cup Scoreless Performance:**  \n   - In row 11, both teams had a score of \"1 - 1\".\n   - M\u00e1rquez did not score any goals in this match.\n\nBoth conditions are supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Mexico losing a match in an international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim: \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 time in international competition when rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal.\" The key points here are that there's a specific situation where Mexico lost one out of two matches in an international competition, and at that time, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like goal (which is 1 or 2), date, score, result, and competition. The columns we need to focus on are 'goal', 'score', 'result', and 'competition'.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row to see if there's a situation where Mexico lost a match in an international competition while M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nStarting from row 0: goal is 1, score is 1-0. Result is 3-0 for Mexico, so they won. Not a loss, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 1: goal 1, score 1-0 again. Result 4-0. Win, not a loss.\n\nRow 2: goal 5-1. Result 7-1. Definitely a win.\n\nRow 3: goal is 2-1, result also 2-1. The competition is 'friendly', which might be a friendly match, not an international competition. So maybe irrelevant unless it's considered international.\n\nRow 4: score 1-0, result 2-0. Win again.\n\nRow 5: score 1-0, result 2-0. Win.\n\nRow 6: 3-0, result 3-0. Win.\n\nRow7: score 2-0, result 5-0. Win.\n\nRow8: The competition is the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Here, the result is 1-2 after extra time, so Mexico lost this match. Now, checking who scored the goal for Mexico. In 'score' column, it's 1-0, meaning Mexico scored first. But the result was a loss because they ended up 1-2. However, M\u00e1rquez is mentioned in the claim as scoring a goal. Looking at the 'result' column, it shows '1 - 2 (aet)', but I think that refers to the final score, not necessarily who scored. So maybe M\u00e1rquez didn't score here.\n\nRow9: friendly match, so probably not an international competition.\n\nRow10: Mexico won 2-0, result 2-1? Wait, no\u2014 looking at row10: goal is 2-0, and the result is 2-1. That can't be right because if it's a win for Mexico, their score should be higher. Maybe I'm misreading. No, in this row, 'score' is 2-0, which means Mexico won. Result column says 2-1, but that might be the aggregate or another format. Not sure, but the result shows a win.\n\nRow11: It's the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The score is 1-1, so it's a draw. So no loss here.\n\nRow12: They won 1-0, result 4-1. Win.\n\nRow13: Friendly match again, so not international.\n\nNow, looking for any instance where Mexico lost in an international competition and M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. The only loss in the table is row8 (2006 World Cup). In that match, did M\u00e1rquez score? Let's check the 'result' column says 1-2 (aet), which is after extra time. But the actual goalscorers aren't explicitly listed in the table. So I can't confirm if M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions when M\u00e1rquez scores a goal, so we need a row where Mexico lost and M\u00e1rquez scored. Since row8's result is a loss, but without knowing who scored, perhaps it's not supported by the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another match? Let me double-check each row for any loss in an international competition.\n\nWait, rows 3 and 4: row3 is 2002 World Cup qualifier (Mexico won 7-1), row4 is friendly, so not international. Row6: 2006 WC qualifier, Mexico won. Row8: lost but unsure if M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nSo maybe the claim isn't supported by the data because there's no instance where Mexico lost in an international competition with M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal as per the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that Rafael M\u00e1rquez didn't stay scoreless in any of those years (2001, 2009, 2012) in international competitions. So I need to check if there are any matches where he scored goals during those specific years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like goal, date, score, result, and competition. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'date' and 'score', particularly to see if M\u00e1rquez scored in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Date is February 5, 1999. No mention of 2001 yet.\nRow 3: May 12, 2002. Not 2001 or 2009/2012.\nRow 4: July 24, 2003. Not relevant years.\nRow 6: June 19, 2004. Still not the target years.\nRow 7: September 7, 2005. Not matching.\nRow 8: June 24, 2006. No.\nRow 10: September 10, 2008. Not in 2001 or 2009/2012.\nRow 11: June 11, 2010. Close to 2012 but not exactly.\nRow 12: June 12, 2011. Still before 2012.\nRow 13: October 30, 2013. After 2012.\n\nWait, I need to check if there are any matches in 2001, 2009, or 2012 where M\u00e1rquez scored. Looking through the dates:\n\nI see row 10 is September 10, 2008, which is after 2006 but not in the target years. There's no row with a date in 2001, so perhaps M\u00e1rquez didn't have any matches listed here that year. For 2009 and 2012, I don't see any entries either.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each date again:\n\nLooking for dates in 2001: No rows match that.\nIn 2009: None of the dates are 2009.\nIn 2012: Also none.\n\nSo M\u00e1rquez didn't score in those specific years as per the table. Therefore, the claim is saying he didn't remain scoreless, but the data shows he might have been scoreless in those years. Wait, no\u2014the claim is that he \"do not remain scoreless,\" meaning he scored at least once.\n\nBut if there's no data for 2001, 2009, or 2012, does that mean he was scoreless? Or maybe he didn't play in those competitions during those years? Hmm, the table doesn't show any matches where he played in 2001, 2009, or 2012. So perhaps he didn't have any international matches in those years where he scored.\n\nWait, but the claim is about whether he remained scoreless. If there's no record of him scoring in those years, does that mean he did remain scoreless? Or maybe it's the opposite\u2014since the table doesn't show him scoring, perhaps he didn't, making the claim TRUE because he didn't remain scoreless.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me rephrase: The claim is stating that M\u00e1rquez did not remain scoreless in 2001, 2009, or 2012. So for each of those years, there should be at least one match where he scored.\n\nIf the table shows any such matches, then the claim is supported; if not, it's false.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For 2001: No relevant rows.\n- For 2009: No relevant rows.\n- For 2012: No relevant rows.\n\nSo in all these years, M\u00e1rquez didn't score according to the table. Therefore, he remained scoreless in those competitions, which contradicts the claim. Wait, but that would make the claim FALSE because the opposite happened\u2014he did remain scoreless.\n\nWait no, the claim is saying he does not remain scoreless, so it's asserting he scored at least once each year. But since the table doesn't show any scoring in 2001, 2009, or 2012, the claim would be false because he remained scoreless.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The column is 'score', which shows the total goals for that match. If M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in any of those years, his name would be in the 'goal' column as 1 or more.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Goal is probably 1? Wait, no\u2014the columns are date, score, result, competition. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the table has columns: Date, Score, Result, Competition. So for each match, 'Score' would be the goals by each team. For example, in row 0, if M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, it might show as 1-0 or something like that.\n\nWait, but looking at the data provided, I don't have access to see the actual scores. The user hasn't provided the 'score' column with numbers, so perhaps I need to assume that 'Score' is not numerical but just descriptive, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'score' refers to whether M\u00e1rquez scored a goal or not. So if 'score' is 1, he scored; 0, he didn't.\n\nBut since the table isn't explicit, perhaps I need another approach. Alternatively, the 'goal' column might be the same as 'score'. Wait, the user's example includes columns like \"Revenue\" and \"Employees\", but in our case, it's date, score, etc., so maybe 'score' is a text column indicating whether M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nBut without knowing exactly how the data is structured, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the 'score' refers to the total goals in the match, and if M\u00e1rquez scored any, it would reflect that.\n\nWait, I think I need to assume that for each row, if M\u00e1rquez played, his score is indicated. So for each year 2001, 2009, 2012, I need to check if he scored a goal in any match during those years.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n- 2001: No rows with date in 2001.\n- 2009: No rows with date in 2009.\n- 2012: No rows with date in 2012.\n\nTherefore, M\u00e1rquez didn't have any matches in those years where he scored. So he remained scoreless in those competitions, which would make the claim false because it states he did not remain scoreless.\n\nWait, but the claim is that he \"do not remain scoreless,\" meaning he scored at least once each year. Since he didn't play or didn't score during those years, he did remain scoreless, making the claim false.\n\nSo the answer would be that the claim is FALSE, and there are no relevant cells because none of the rows in 2001, 2009, or 2012 show M\u00e1rquez scoring.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored at least once in international competitions in 2001, 2009, and 2012. However, examining the table reveals no matches for those years where he scored. Therefore, he remained scoreless, making the claim false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
