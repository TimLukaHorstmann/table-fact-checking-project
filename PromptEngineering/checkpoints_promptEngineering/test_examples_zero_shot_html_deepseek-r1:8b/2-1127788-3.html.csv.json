    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table: goal, date, score, result, competition. The claim mentions three things: the player's name (Rafael M\u00e1rquez), the number of goals scored (3), and the type of competition (international friendly).\n\nI know that Rafael M\u00e1rquez is a former Mexican footballer who played for clubs like Real Madrid and Fiorentina. He also had a long career with the Mexico national team, so I'm guessing his international matches would be in competitions related to World Cups or CONCACAF Gold Cups.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different match. The \"competition\" column might give me clues about which matches were international friendly events. Scanning through the competition names:\n\n- 1999 Carlsberg Cup: This seems like a friendly tournament, not related to FIFA or Confederations.\n- 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup: Yes, this is an international competition.\n- 2002 World Cup Qualifier: That's for qualifying for the World Cup, so international matches.\n- Friendly: Several entries here, which are non-competitive matches, likely friendly.\n- 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup: Another international competition.\n- 2006 World Cup Qualifier: Yes, leading up to the World Cup.\n- 2006 FIFA World Cup: Definitely an international tournament.\n- 2010 World Cup Qualifier: More qualifiers.\n- 2010 FIFA World Cup: International.\n- 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup: Again, international.\n- Friendly again in 2013.\n\nSo, the competitions that are either CONCACAF Gold Cups or FIFA World Cups would be considered international. Friendly matches might also count as international friendly competitions if they're national team games.\n\nNext, I need to check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored any goals in these specific competition types and whether he ever scored exactly 3 goals in one of those matches.\n\nLooking at the \"score\" column: for each row, it shows the score line. For example:\n\n- Row 1: Score is 1-0, result is 3-0 (maybe aggregate? Not sure). But if that's a friendly, and M\u00e1rquez scored once.\n- Row 4: Friendly match, score 2-1 for both teams. So M\u00e1rquez scored once.\n- Row 5: CONCACAF Gold Cup, Mexico won 2-0. If he scored one goal.\n- Row 8: FIFA World Cup match where Mexico lost in extra time. Score was 1-2 (aet). So M\u00e1rquez scored once.\n\nWait, the claim says he scored exactly 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions. I need to see if there's a single match where he scored three goals or if it's cumulative over all friendly matches.\n\nBut looking through each row, the \"score\" column shows that in each of M\u00e1rquez's matches, he scored either 1, 2, or none. For example:\n\n- Row 12: He scored once.\n- Row 13: Friendly match where Mexico won 4-2. If M\u00e1rquez scored one goal.\n\nI don't see any row where he scored three goals in a single friendly match. So maybe the claim is about cumulative goals across his entire international friendly career. But that's tricky because I'd need to know all his friendly matches, not just the ones listed here.\n\nWait, but the table only includes 13 rows of matches from 1999 to 2013. Maybe M\u00e1rquez scored three goals in one of these matches, or if not, he didn't reach three in any single match, making the claim false.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- In Row 12: He scored once.\n- Row 7: Score was 2-0, so maybe he scored once or more? Wait, the score is 2-0. If it's a friendly, but without knowing how many goals M\u00e1rquez contributed, I can't be sure.\n\nWait, no\u2014the \"score\" in the table is likely the overall score of the match, not individual player goals. So for example, if the score is 1-0, that means one goal in total for each team? Or does it mean the away team scored 1 and home 0? Wait, actually, I think in football (soccer), the first number is usually the home team's goals, the second the away. So for example, a score of 1-0 means home scored once, away didn't score.\n\nBut in the context of the table, perhaps it's the total goals by each team, so if a match ended 1-2, that would be home 1, away 2.\n\nBut the problem is, without knowing which team M\u00e1rquez was playing for in each match, I can't determine how many goals he scored individually. For instance, if he was on the home team and they scored one goal, then maybe he scored once, or perhaps more.\n\nHowever, based on the table, it's only showing the total score, not the individual contributions. So unless there's a row where the \"score\" is 3-0 or something indicating three goals by his team in a friendly match, I can't confirm he scored three.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the result might indicate aggregate scores over two legs if it's a qualifier. For example, Row 1: competition is Carlsberg Cup (friendly), score is 1-0, result is 3-0. Maybe that means aggregate or overall after two matches. If M\u00e1rquez scored once in each leg, that would be two goals, but not three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"result\" column shows total goals or aggregate, but it's unclear.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I can't confirm from the table whether M\u00e1rquez ever scored exactly three goals in a single international friendly match. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's no evidence of him scoring three goals in any of these matches.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions cannot be definitively confirmed based on the provided data. The table does not show instances where he scored three goals in a single match or cumulatively across multiple friendly games.\n\nAnswer: \"FALSE\"\n\nRelevant cells:\n- No rows indicate that M\u00e1rquez scored three goals in any single friendly competition. Therefore, there's no evidence to support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"2000 be the only year Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores more than 1 goal in international competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that in the year 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition, and this was the only such occurrence. My job is to verify if this is true by checking the relevant data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various matches with columns for 'goal', 'date', 'score', 'result', and 'competition'. The 'row_index' might not be directly useful here since we're focusing on years rather than specific rows. \n\nI should focus on the 'year' derived from the 'date' column because the claim is about a specific year, 2000. So, for each row where the date includes the year 2000, I'll check the 'score' and 'result' columns to see if M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 3**: Date is \"3 september 2000\". The score is \"5 - 1\" in favor of M\u00e1rquez's team, and the result is \"7 - 1\". This indicates that M\u00e1rquez scored multiple goals (five) in this match.\n\n2. **Other Rows with Year 2000**: I should check if there are any other matches in 2000 where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal. From the table, it seems Row 3 is the only one in 2000.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that no other years have M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in an international competition. To do this, I'll look at each row and note the year when M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal:\n\n- **Row 1**: 1999\n- **Row 2**: 2000\n- **Row 3**: 2000 (same as above)\n- **Row 4**: 2002\n- **Row 5**: 2003\n- **Row 6**: 2004\n- **Row 7**: 2005\n- **Row 8**: 2006\n- **Row 9**: 2007\n- **Row 10**: 2008\n- **Row 11**: 2010\n- **Row 12**: 2011\n- **Row 13**: 2013\n\nLooking at each year, I see that in 1999 and 2002 onwards, M\u00e1rquez scored one or fewer goals except for the two instances in 2000. Wait, no\u2014wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, Row 4 (12 May 2002) has a score of \"2 - 1\", so he scored one goal.\n\nRow 5 (24 July 2003): Score is \"1 - 0\" for M\u00e1rquez's team, meaning he scored one goal.\n\nSimilarly, in Row 6 and 7, scores are \"3-0\" and \"2-0\", so again, only one goal by M\u00e1rquez.\n\nIn Row 8 (24 June 2006), the score is \"1 - 2 (aet)\", which might mean he scored once, but it's a loss. So that's just one goal.\n\nRow 10: Score \"2-0\" for M\u00e1rquez's team\u2014so he scored two goals here in 2010.\n\nWait, this contradicts my initial thought. So in Row 10 (10 September 2008), the date is 2008, but the score is \"2 - 1\". Wait, no\u2014looking again:\n\nWait, let me clarify each row's data accurately.\n\nLet me list all rows with their goals and dates:\n\n- **Row 1**: 5 Feb 1999. Score: 1-0 (M\u00e1rquez scored one goal)\n- **Row 2**: 13 Feb 2000. Score: 1-0\n- **Row 3**: 3 Sep 2000. Score: 5-1 (M\u00e1rquez scored five goals here)\n- **Row 4**: 12 May 2002. Score: 2-1\n- **Row 5**: 24 Jul 2003. Score: 1-0\n- **Row 6**: 9 Sep 2004. Score: 3-0\n- **Row 7**: 22 Oct 2005. Score: 2-0\n- **Row 8**: 24 Jun 2006. Score: 1-2 (aet)\n- **Row 10**: 10 Sep 2008. Score: 2-0\n\nWait, in Row 10, the date is 10 September 2008, but looking back at the table provided, I think there might be a confusion here because the user's initial data might have been misaligned. Let me confirm:\n\nFrom the user's data:\n\nRow indices and their details:\n\n1: 13 Feb 2000, score 1-0\n\n2: 3 Sep 2000, score 5-1\n\n3: 12 May 2002, score 2-1\n\n4: 24 Jul 2003, score 1-0\n\n5: 9 Sep 2004, score 3-0\n\n6: 22 Oct 2005, score 2-0\n\n7: 24 Jun 2006, score 1-2\n\n8: 10 Sep 2008, score 2-0\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned the rows earlier. Let me correct this:\n\nLooking back at the user's table, each row has a date and other info. The 'row_index' goes from 0 to 13.\n\nSo, for each row, the 'date' is as follows (from the user's data):\n\nRow 0: 5 Feb 1999\n\nRow 1: 13 Feb 2000\n\nRow 2: 3 Sep 2000\n\nRow 3: 12 May 2002\n\nRow 4: 24 Jul 2003\n\nRow 5: 9 Sep 2004\n\nRow 6: 22 Oct 2005\n\nRow 7: 24 Jun 2006\n\nRow 8: 10 Sep 2008\n\nSo, in Row 1 (13 Feb 2000), the score is \"1 - 0\"\n\nIn Row 2 (3 Sep 2000), the score is \"5 - 1\"\n\nWait, so that's two separate rows for 2000.\n\nThus:\n\n- **Row 1**: 13 Feb 2000. Score: 1-0 \u2192 M\u00e1rquez scored one goal\n\n- **Row 2**: 3 Sep 2000. Score: 5-1 \u2192 M\u00e1rquez scored five goals\n\nSo in the year 2000, there are two matches where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So the claim says \"2000 be the only year\", but according to this data, in 2000, he had at least two instances of scoring more than one goal.\n\nBut wait, looking at other years:\n\n- **Row 10 (8? No, row 8 is 10 Sep 2008. Score: 2 - 0 \u2192 M\u00e1rquez scored two goals here.\n\nSo that's in 2008.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nIn Row 5 (9 Sep 2004), score \"3 - 0\" \u2192 M\u00e1rquez scored three goals\n\nRow 6 (22 Oct 2005): 2-0 \u2192 one goal?\n\nWait, no: Score is \"2 - 0\". So if it's the same team as M\u00e1rquez, he scored two goals.\n\nSimilarly, in Row 8, score is \"2 - 0\" \u2192 he scored two.\n\nSo, that means:\n\nIn 2004 (Row 5), 2005 (Row6), 2008 (Row8), and others, M\u00e1rquez scored multiple goals.\n\nWait, but the claim says that 2000 was the only year. So clearly, this is not true because he scored more than one goal in multiple years beyond 2000.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me go through each row again:\n\nRow 0: 1999 \u2192 score \"1-0\" \u2192 one goal\n\nRow1: 13 Feb 2000 \u2192 score \"1-0\" \u2192 one goal\n\nWait, no\u2014wait the user's data shows for Row2 as 3 Sep 2000, with score \"5 - 1\"\n\nSo that would mean in 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored five goals in one match (Row2) and perhaps another match in 2000 where he scored one goal (Row1). So total two instances in 2000 where he scored more than one.\n\nBut then in 2004 (Row5: 9 Sep), score \"3-0\" \u2192 three goals\n\nIn 2005 (Row6:22 Oct), score \"2-0\" \u2192 two goals\n\nIn 2008 (Row8:10 Sep), score \"2-0\" \u2192 two goals\n\nSo in each of these years, M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal.\n\nThus, the claim that 2000 was the only year is incorrect because there are multiple other years where he scored more than one.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the statement is false, and it's not just 2000 but also 2004, 2005, etc., where M\u00e1rquez scored multiple goals.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the data. Let me confirm:\n\nFrom the user's initial data:\n\nThe rows are as follows (assuming row indices from 0 to 13):\n\nRow | Date                | ...\n--- | ------------------- | ---\n0   | 5 Feb 1999          | ...\n1   | 13 Feb 2000         | Score: \"1 - 0\"\n2   | 3 Sep 2000          | Score: \"5 - 1\"\n3   | 12 May 2002         | Score: \"2 - 1\"\n4   | 24 Jul 2003        | Score: \"1 - 0\"\n5   | 9 Sep 2004          | Score: \"3 - 0\"\n6   | 22 Oct 2005         | Score: \"2 - 0\"\n7   | 24 Jun 2006         | Score: \"1 - 2\"\n8   | 10 Sep 2008         | Score: \"2 - 0\"\n\nSo, for each row:\n\n- Row1 (13 Feb 2000): Score 1-0 \u2192 one goal\n\n- Row2 (3 Sep 2000): Score 5-1 \u2192 five goals\n\n- Row3: 12 May 2002: 2-1 \u2192 two goals\n\n- Row4:24 Jul 2003:1-0\u2192one goal\n\n- Row5:9 Sep 2004:3-0\u2192three goals\n\n- Row6:22 Oct 2005:2-0\u2192two goals\n\n- Row7:24 Jun 2006:1-2\u2192 one goal (if it's a loss, but M\u00e1rquez scored one)\n\n- Row8:10 Sep 2008:2-0\u2192 two goals\n\nSo in years:\n\n- 1999: only one instance of scoring one goal.\n\n- 2000: two instances where he scored more than once (Rows1 and 2).\n\nWait no\u2014Rows1 is 13 Feb 2000, score 1-0 \u2192 one goal\n\nRow2 is 3 Sep 2000, score5-1 \u2192 five goals.\n\nSo in 2000, he had at least two matches where he scored more than once: one with one goal and another with five.\n\nWait, but \"more than one\" would mean two or more. So only Row2 counts for that.\n\nRow1 is just one goal, so it doesn't count.\n\nTherefore, in 2000, there was one instance of scoring more than once (five goals).\n\nIn 2004: three goals \u2192 more than one.\n\n2005: two goals.\n\n2008: two goals.\n\nSo, the years where he scored more than one are:\n\n- 2000\n\n- 2004\n\n- 2005\n\n- 2008\n\nThus, the original statement that \"2000 was the only year\" is incorrect because there were other years as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the statement is false; M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in multiple years, including but not limited to 2000, 2004, 2005, and 2008.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is incorrect. M\u00e1rcio Amorim (M\u00e1rcio) scored more than one goal in several years, including 2000, 2004, 2005, and 2008. \n\nAnswer: The statement is false; M\u00e1rcio scored more than once in multiple seasons beyond 2000, such as 2004, 2005, and 2008.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez score fewer than 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table. The claim mentions Rafael M\u00e1rquez's scoring in international friendly competitions, so I need to check the 'competition' column for entries labeled as \"friendly.\" Also, the goal count is part of each row, specifically under the 'score' column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Rows 4 and 9 are marked as \"friendly.\"\n- In Row 4, the score is 2 - 1, so M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal.\n- In Row 9, the score is 2 - 2 (so no goals for him) before extra time, but since it's a friendly match, maybe that's all.\n\nI should list which rows are relevant. That would be rows 4 and 9, specifically looking at their 'score' column to see how many goals he scored in friendly competitions.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row indices 3 (since it's zero-indexed) for competition \"friendly\" and the 'score' column, and row index 8 for the same reason.

Wait no, looking back:\n\nNo, in the table, Row 4 is index 3 because the first row is index 0. So let me list out all rows with competition as friendly.\n\nLooking through the 'competition' column:\n\n- Index 3: friendly\n- Index 8: friendly\n\nWait, no.

No mention of 2001 here.\n- **Row 3 (2002):** A friendly match, no goals scored by M\u00e1rquez.\n- **Row 4 (2003):** 2003 Concacaf Gold Cup, M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\n- **Row 5 (2004):** 2006 World Cup qualifier; M\u00e1rquez doesn't score here.\n- **Rows 6 and 7 (2005 and 2006):** 2006 World Cup qualifiers. In row 8, he scored in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nWait, the claim is about not scoring in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n- **2001:** There's no row for 2001 in the table. So I need to check if there was any competition that year where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n- **2009:** The only relevant row is row 12 (2013), which is a friendly match, not related to international competitions in 2009. So I should look for 2009 Concacaf Gold Cup or World Cup qualifiers. There's no such row here, so maybe he didn't score that year.\n- **2012:** The last relevant rows are up to 2013. No entry for 2012 in the table, but I need to check if there was a competition that year where he scored.\n\nSince the claim is about M\u00e1rquez not scoring in those years, I need to verify if he actually did or didn't score. For 2001, since there's no data here, perhaps he didn't play or didn't score. For 2009 and 2012, same situation\u2014no direct evidence from the table.\n\nBut wait, looking back at row 4 (2003), M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in the Concacaf Gold Cup. So he did score in international competitions in some years, but that doesn't directly affect this claim since it's about not scoring in specific other years.\n\nI should focus on whether he scored in 2001, 2009, or 2012. Since there are no rows for these years, I can infer that the table doesn't show any goals by him in those competitions. Therefore, the claim is likely true because there's no evidence of him scoring in those specific years.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if he scored in international competitions during those years but not listed here. But without data from 2001 or 2012, it's safer to assume based on the table that the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez does not score a goal in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012,\" we need to check if there are any entries in the provided table for those specific years where he scored. \n\n1. **2001:** There is no row corresponding to 2001, so it's unclear from the table whether he scored.\n2. **2009:** The only relevant row related to 2009 is row 12 (2013), which isn't about that year.\n3. **2012:** Similarly, there's no row for 2012 in the table.\n\nSince the claim states he did not score in these years and the table provides no evidence of scoring during those periods, the claim holds true based on available data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about different matches, goals, dates, scores, results, and competitions. The claim is that \"mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal.\" My task is to determine whether this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Mexico lost only once in an international competition specifically when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. So, I'm looking for instances where Mexico lost and whether those losses happened when M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nLooking at the table, I should go through each row to find cases where Mexico lost (score shows Mexico losing) and see if in those cases, M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows represent a loss. The 'result' column seems to indicate whether it's a win or loss for Mexico. For example, a result like \"3 - 0\" would be a win if the first number is higher than the second, assuming the format is Mexico's score - opponent's score.\n\nSo I need to look at each row and check two things: whether the result is a loss (opponent's score is higher) and whether Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in those matches.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 8: Result is \"1 - 2 (aet)\", which means Mexico lost. The 'score' column shows Mexico scored 1, so M\u00e1rquez scored here if his name is in that row's score. Wait, but in this case, the goal is from whom? Since it's a loss, maybe M\u00e1rquez didn't score, or did he?\n\nWait, I need to check each match where Mexico lost and see if M\u00e1rquez scored in those matches.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n1. Row 8: result is loss (1-2), so Mexico lost. The 'score' column says 1 - 2 (aet). Since it's a loss, who scored? If the first number is Mexico's score, then M\u00e1rquez might have scored that 1 goal. But I don't know unless his name is mentioned in the table.\n\nWait, looking at the table, the 'score' column shows both teams' scores. So for row 8: Mexico scored 1, opponent scored 2. The claim is about M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal when Mexico loses. So if M\u00e1rquez scored that lone goal, then this would be a case.\n\nBut I don't see any indication in the table that M\u00e1rquez scored in that match. The 'score' column just shows numbers; it doesn't specify who scored them. So maybe I can't confirm whether he scored or not from this table alone.\n\nWait, but the claim is about when M\u00e1rquez scores a goal, so perhaps we need to look for rows where M\u00e1rquez scored and see if Mexico lost in those matches.\n\nAlternatively, looking for rows where Mexico lost (so result is opponent's higher score) AND M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match.\n\nBut the table doesn't specify who scored each goal. So I can't directly check if M\u00e1rquez scored in any of these losses. Therefore, perhaps the claim is not verifiable from this table, meaning it's either false or we don't have enough info.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"Mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\" So it's implying that every time Mexico lost, it was only once when M\u00e1rquez scored. Or perhaps that all of their losses occurred when M\u00e1rquez scored, which isn't the case if there are multiple losses.\n\nBut looking at the table, let's count how many times Mexico lost:\n\nRows where result is a loss (opponent has higher score):\n\n- Row 8: 1 - 2\n\nOthers: I don't see other results where Mexico lost. Let me check all rows:\n\nRow 8: loss\nOther rows: mostly wins or draws.\n\nWait, row 4: result is a draw (2-2), so not a loss.\nRow 11: 1-1, draw.\nRow 12: win.\nSo only row 8 shows Mexico losing. So if Mexico lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored, then the claim would be TRUE if that's the case.\n\nBut again, I don't know who scored in that match because the table doesn't specify. So without knowing whether M\u00e1rquez scored in that loss, I can't confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if in any of Mexico's losses, M\u00e1rquez was on the field and scored. But since the table only shows scores, not goalscorers, maybe it's impossible to confirm from this data.\n\nSo the claim might be impossible to verify based on this table. Therefore, the answer would be that there isn't enough information to confirm or deny the claim.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user provided an example where they identified specific columns as relevant. So maybe in this case, even if we can't confirm M\u00e1rquez scored, but considering the claim says Mexico only lost once when he did score, and from the table, Mexico only lost once (row 8), so perhaps that's the one instance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'score' column indicates that M\u00e1rquez scored, but I don't think so because it's just numbers. So without knowing who scored, we can't say for sure.\n\nTherefore, maybe the answer is that there's only one loss (row 8) and if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match, then the claim is TRUE. But since we don't know from the table, perhaps the answer is it's not verifiable or FALSE because there's no evidence.\n\nBut I think the user wants us to look for rows where Mexico lost and see if M\u00e1rquez scored. Since the table doesn't specify scorers beyond the scores, perhaps we can't confirm, making the claim possibly false or unverifiable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'score' column indicates that M\u00e1rquez scored a goal when Mexico lost in row 8, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, the score is just numbers; it doesn't specify who scored. So without additional info, we can't link M\u00e1rquez to any goals in losses.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is that there's insufficient data to confirm or deny the claim, so the answer would be FALSE because Mexico has lost only once, and we don't know if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants us to count the number of times Mexico lost when M\u00e1rquez scored. Since there's only one loss (row 8), but no way to tell if he scored in it, perhaps the answer is that it's not verifiable or that the claim is false because Mexico could have lost more than once when he scored.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe claim: Mexico only lose once in international competition when M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\n\nSo, first, count how many times Mexico lost (i.e., opponent's score > Mexico's score). From the table:\n\nLooking at each row's result:\n\nRow 0: 3-0 \u2192 win\nRow1: 2-1 \u2192 win\nRow2: 2-0 \u2192 win\nRow3: 1-0 \u2192 win\nRow4: 2-2 \u2192 draw\nRow5: 2-1 \u2192 win\nRow6: 1-0 \u2192 win\nRow7: 1-0 \u2192 win\nRow8: 1-2 \u2192 loss (only one loss)\nRow9 onwards not provided.\n\nSo, only row8 is a loss.\n\nNow, the claim says that when M\u00e1rquez scores a goal, Mexico has lost once. So we need to see if in any of these losses (which is just row8), M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nBut since the table doesn't specify who scored each goal, we can't confirm whether M\u00e1rquez was involved in that loss or not.\n\nTherefore, without knowing who scored in row8, we can't verify if M\u00e1rquez was responsible. Thus, the claim may be incorrect because Mexico could have lost once when someone else scored, making it more than just once when M\u00e1rquez did so (if he didn't score in that match).\n\nAlternatively, if M\u00e1rquez did score in that loss, then the claim would be TRUE because there's only one loss and it was when he scored.\n\nBut without knowing who scored, we can't say for sure. So perhaps the answer is that it's not verifiable from this data, so the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'score' column implies that M\u00e1rquez scored, but I don't think so because it's just numbers.\n\nTherefore, I think the best conclusion is that the claim is FALSE because Mexico lost only once, and there's no evidence in the table linking M\u00e1rquez to a goal in that loss. Or perhaps it's not verifiable, but the answer expects us to identify specific cells as relevant.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that 'result' column indicates loss, and 'score' shows how many goals Mexico scored. If M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match, then the score would be at least 1 for Mexico. But without knowing who scored, perhaps we can't link it to him.\n\nSo, the answer might be that there's only one loss (row8), and if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match, then the claim holds. But since we don't know, perhaps the answer is that we cannot confirm or deny based on the provided data.\n\nBut the user example showed identifying specific columns as relevant. So maybe in this case, 'result' and 'score' are the relevant columns because they indicate Mexico's loss and the number of goals scored, but not necessarily by whom.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is that only row8 (loss) is relevant, so we need to identify that row and the score column.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the case. Alternatively, maybe no, because without knowing who scored, we can't link it to M\u00e1rquez.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the claim is saying that Mexico has only lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored a goal, implying that whenever M\u00e1rquez scores, Mexico loses. But in reality, from the data, Mexico lost only once, but without knowing if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match, we can't say.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that the claim is not verifiable or it's FALSE because there isn't enough information to confirm it.\n\nBut I think the user expects us to identify specific rows and columns as relevant, even if it's only one loss. So maybe the relevant row is row8 (the loss), and the score column indicates Mexico scored 1 goal, but without knowing who scored it.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is that there's only one loss, which is in row8, so the relevant cells are row8 and the score column.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Maybe the user wants us to note that without knowing who scored, we can't confirm M\u00e1rquez was involved, making the claim possibly false or unverifiable.\n\nIn any case, based on this thought process, I think the answer is that only one loss occurred (row8), so the relevant cells are row8 and the score column.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing the provided data to evaluate the claim that Mexico has only lost once in international competitions when Andr\u00e9s Andr\u00e9scu scored a goal. Here's the structured analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Losses**: From the 'result' column, only one loss is recorded (row8).\n2. **Score Column Analysis**: In row8, Mexico scored 1 goal. However, without specific information on who scored the goal, it's impossible to determine if Andr\u00e9s Andr\u00e9scu was the scorer.\n3. **Conclusion**: The data insufficiently links Andr\u00e9s Andr\u00e9scu to a goal in Mexico's only loss. Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed or denied with the provided information.\n\n**Answer**: There is insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the claim based on the given data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I think it's trying to say that in the year 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition, and this was one of two times he did so.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the 'date' is in 2000 and the player is Rafael M\u00e1rquez. The 'score' column will tell me how many goals he scored.\n\nLet's look through each row:\n\n- Row 2: Date is 13 february 2000. Score is 1 - 0, but that's goals for, not goals by M\u00e1rquez. Wait, actually, in the table, the 'score' seems to be written as \"goals - opponent's goals.\" So if it's \"1 - 0\", does that mean M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal and the opponent 0? Yes, I think so.\n\nRow 2: M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal. That's not more than one, so this doesn't count.\n\nRow 3: Date is 3 september 2000. Score is \"5 - 1\". So M\u00e1rquez scored 5 goals, which is definitely more than one.\n\nRow 4: May 2002, but that's two years after 2000, so it's not relevant for the year 2000.\n\nRows beyond row 3 are in 2002 and later, so not applicable to 2000.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The claim is about the year 2000, right? So looking at rows where date is in 2000. Only rows 2 and maybe others?\n\nRow 2: Feb 2000. M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal (from \"1 - 0\"). That's not more than one.\n\nRow 3: Sep 2000. He scored 5 goals, which is definitely more than one.\n\nSo in 2000, he had at least one instance where he scored more than one goal. The claim says it was the first of two such years.\n\nWait, how many times did he score more than one goal in international competitions?\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 2: 1 goal.\n- Row 3: 5 goals.\n- Row 5: Score is \"1 - 0\". So 1 goal.\n- Row 6: 3 goals.\n- Row 7: 2 goals.\n- Row 8: 1 goal in regulation, but 0 in extra time. Total of 1.\n- Row 12: 1 goal.\n\nWait, so in which years did M\u00e1rquez score more than one goal?\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 3 (2000): 5 goals \u2013 yes.\nRow 6 (2004): 3 goals \u2013 yes.\nRow 7 (2005): 2 goals \u2013 yes.\nSo that's three instances where he scored more than one goal. But the claim says \"one of two years.\" So perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, maybe the competition type is considered as well. Let me check:\n\nRow 3: 2002 world cup qualifier \u2013 international.\nRow 6: 2006 world cup qualifier \u2013 international.\nRow 7: Same as above.\nSo three instances where he scored more than one goal.\n\nBut the claim says that in 2000, it was the first of two such years. But from the table, there are at least three instances across different years. So maybe the claim is incorrect because M\u00e1rquez had more than two such years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\" Maybe it's phrased as in 2000, he scored more than one goal, and this was the first of two times.\n\nBut from the table, in 2000 (Row 3), he did have multiple goals. So the claim might be TRUE if it's stating that in 2000, he had such an instance, which was part of two occasions.\n\nWait, but looking at all rows:\n\n- 2000: Row 3 \u2013 5 goals\n- 2004: Row 6 \u2013 3 goals\n- 2005: Row 7 \u2013 2 goals\n\nSo that's three instances, not two. So the claim might be incorrect in stating it was one of two years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the rows. Let me check the exact wording of the score:\n\nIn Row 2: \"1 - 0\" \u2013 so M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal.\nRow 3: \"5 - 1\" \u2013 5 goals.\nRow 6: \"3 - 1\" \u2013 3 goals.\nRow 7: \"2 - 1\" \u2013 2 goals.\n\nSo yes, three instances where he scored more than one goal. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not one of two years but part of multiple years. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all rows with more than one goal:\n\n- Row 3: 5\n- Row 6: 3\n- Row 7: 2\n\nThat's three instances. So it was not just two years, but at least three, so the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that in 2000, he did this once, and overall, there were two such occasions. But from the table, it seems like more than two.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all instances where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 3: Yes\n- Row 6: Yes\n- Row 7: Yes\n\nThat's three instances across different years. So if the claim is that in 2000, it was one of two such years, it's incorrect because there were more than two.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in 2000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition, which was the first of two such instances.

The claim says: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 [World Cup], but remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in the 2006 World Cup.\n2. He remained scoreless in the 2010 World Cup.\n\nI'll need to check both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an event with details like the goal number, date, score, result, and competition. The columns relevant here are 'goal', 'date', 'score', 'result', and 'competition'.\n\nStarting with the 2006 World Cup:\n- In the table, I need to find rows where the competition is \"2006 FIFA World Cup\". Scrolling through, row 8 has that competition and a score of 1 - 0. So, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored here. That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNow for the 2010 World Cup:\n- The same approach applies. Look for rows where the competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup\". I see row 11: date is June 11, 2010, score is 1 - 1. So the result was a draw, and M\u00e1rquez didn't score.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row's 'score' might not directly indicate who scored. However, for the claim to be true, M\u00e1rquez should have scored at least one goal in 2006, which he did, as per row 8, where the score is 1 - 0, likely meaning Mexico scored once.\n\nIn 2010, according to row 11, the score was a draw, so no goals were scored by either side. That means M\u00e1rquez didn't score in 2010.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Rafel M\u00e1rquez scored in the 2006 World Cup and did not score in the 2010 World Cup as per the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"rafael m\u00e1rquez do not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim. It's saying that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not stay scoreless in international competitions during three specific years: 2001, 2009, and 2012. My task is to verify this by looking at the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are goal, date, score, result, competition.\n- Each row represents an event with these details.\n\nI need to identify which rows might be related to Rafael M\u00e1rquez in 2001, 2009, and 2012. \n\nStarting with 2001:\nLooking through the table rows:\n- The earliest dates go up to around 2010 or so. Let's see if there are any competitions in 2001.\n- Scanning each row's 'date' column for 2001: None of the dates in the provided table are from 2001. For example, the first row is Feb 1999, then Feb 2000, Sep 2000, May 2002, etc. There's no 2001 date listed. So perhaps there was a game in 2001 that's not included here? Or maybe M\u00e1rquez didn't play an international match in 2001 that's recorded in this table.\n\nNext, 2009:\nLooking for dates around 2009: The latest row is from March 2007 and September 2008. Wait, the next rows are up to June 2010. So perhaps 2009 isn't covered either? Let me check each row's date:\n\nRow 5: July 24, 2003\nRow 6: June 19, 2004\nRow 7: Sep 7, 2005\nRow 8: June 24, 2006\nRow 9: Mar 28, 2007\nRow10: Sep 10, 2008\nRow11: Jun 11, 2010\nRow12: Jun 12, 2011\nRow13: Oct 30, 2013\n\nSo, the latest date is October 2013. So there's no row with a date in 2009. That means if M\u00e1rquez played an international competition in 2009 that's not listed here, or perhaps he didn't play any, which would mean he was scoreless.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"do not remain scoreless,\" so it implies he scored in those years. If there are no matches in 2001, 2009, or 2012, then perhaps M\u00e1rquez remained scoreless, making the claim FALSE. But I need to check for 2012 as well.\n\nLooking for 2012:\nCheck each row's date for 2012: The latest rows go up to October 2013, but none have a date in 2012. So again, no data on matches in 2012 in the table.\n\nTherefore, if M\u00e1rquez didn't play any international competitions in 2001, 2009, or 2012 (as per this table), then he would remain scoreless in those years, making the claim FALSE. However, I should consider that maybe there are other matches not listed here, but since the data provided doesn't include such rows, we can only go by what's shown.\n\nSo, each of these years (2001, 2009, 2012) don't have any corresponding row in the table. Therefore, M\u00e1rquez didn't score in those competitions according to this data, so he remained scoreless, making the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "mexico lose 1 of 2 time in international competition when rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main points:\n1. Mexico loses once out of two times in international competitions.\n2. When Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal, Mexico loses.\n\nI need to find relevant cells that support these points using the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns for 'goal', 'date', 'score', 'result', and 'competition'. The claim is about when M\u00e1rquez scored a goal leading to a loss. So I should look for rows where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal and the result was a loss.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: M\u00e1rquez isn't mentioned.\n2. Row 1: M\u00e1rquez isn't mentioned.\n3. Row 2: No, score is 5-1, result is win.\n4. Row 3: No, it's a friendly match, and the score is 2-1, but M\u00e1rquez isn't listed here.\nWait, actually, in row 3, the competition is 'friendly', which might not be an international competition. So maybe not relevant for the first part about Mexico losing in international competitions.\n\nRow 4: No mention of M\u00e1rquez.\nRow 5: No, it's a Concacaf Gold Cup win.\nRow 6: No, M\u00e1rquez isn't mentioned here.\nRow 7: No, score is 2-0, result is win.\nRow 8: This row mentions Mexico losing. The score was 1-2 (aet), and the competition is the 2006 FIFA World Cup. However, I don't see M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal here. Wait, actually, in this row, the score for Mexico is 1-0 against Iran, but the result is a loss because they scored again in extra time? No, wait, no, Mexico's score is 1-2. So it's a loss. But was M\u00e1rquez scoring in that game? I think M\u00e1rquez did score in that match. He scored in the round of 16 against Iran.\n\nWait, in row 8: 'result' is 1-2 (aet), so Mexico lost. And since M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in that match, this would be relevant for both parts of the claim.\n\nThen, looking for another instance where Mexico loses in an international competition when M\u00e1rquez scores. Let's see:\n\nRow 12: Competition is 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup. Score is 1-0, result is win.\nRow 13: Friendly match, no international competition.\n\nWait, row 8 is the only one I can find where Mexico lost in an international competition (2006 World Cup) and M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nSo does the claim say \"lose 1 of 2 times\"? Well, from the table, I see only one instance where Mexico lost when M\u00e1rquez scored. Are there two instances? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nOnly row 8 fits both conditions: international competition (World Cup) and a loss after M\u00e1rquez scores. There's no other row that meets both criteria. So the claim says \"lose 1 of 2 times\", but from the table, it seems like Mexico only lost once when M\u00e1rquez scored in an international competition.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another instance. Let me check each match where Mexico lost and see if M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nRow 8: loss, M\u00e1rquez scored.\nIs there another row where Mexico lost in an international competition and M\u00e1rquez scored? Looking at the table:\n\nRow 0: win\nRow1: win\nRow2: win\nRow3: friendly, not international\nRow4: friendly\nRow5: win\nRow6: win\nRow7: win\nRow8: loss, M\u00e1rquez scored.\nRow9: friendly\nRow10: win\nRow11: draw, not a loss\nRow12: win\nRow13: friendly\n\nSo only row 8 meets both conditions. Therefore, the claim says \"lose 1 of 2 times\", but according to the table, it's only once. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpret the claim. The claim could be stating that Mexico has lost once out of two matches where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in international competitions. From the table, there are multiple instances where M\u00e1rquez scored goals, but only one resulted in a loss.\n\nWait, actually, row 8 is the only one where M\u00e1rquez scored and Mexico lost in an international competition. So the claim says \"lose 1 of 2 times\", implying that there should be two such occasions. Since the table only shows one, the claim would be incorrect, making it FALSE.\n\nBut I need to check all relevant cells. The relevant cells are row 8, columns 'result' and perhaps others if M\u00e1rquez is mentioned elsewhere. Wait, in row 8, the competition is FIFA World Cup, so that's international. The score shows a loss, so that's another column. Since M\u00e1rquez scored, that would be part of the goal.\n\nWait, but in the table, the 'goal' column just says '1-0', '2-1', etc., not specifying who scored. So perhaps I can't directly confirm from the table if M\u00e1rquez scored. Therefore, maybe row 8 isn't relevant because we don't know if he scored.\n\nWait no, in the 2006 World Cup match against Iran, M\u00e1rquez did score a goal. So in row 8, it's likely that he scored. But since the 'goal' column just has the score, not who scored, maybe I can't be certain from the table.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Without knowing who scored in each game, I can't confirm if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match. Therefore, row 8's 'result' is a loss, but without knowing if M\u00e1rquez scored, it's not relevant to the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal\". So we need both conditions: M\u00e1rquez scoring and Mexico losing in an international competition.\n\nIf I can't confirm from the table that M\u00e1rquez scored in row 8, then maybe there are zero instances where M\u00e1rquez scored leading to a loss. Therefore, the claim would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another row has M\u00e1rquez scoring and a loss.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\nRow 3: 'result' is 2-1, but it's friendly.\nRow 8: possible, but unsure if he scored.\n\nWait, in row 4, the competition is Concacaf Gold Cup. Score is 1-0, result is win. M\u00e1rquez might have scored, but since it's a win, not relevant for the loss condition.\n\nSimilarly, in other rows where Mexico lost (row 8 only), I need to see if M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nSince the table doesn't specify scorers, perhaps I can't confirm that M\u00e1rquez scored in row 8. Therefore, there might be no instances where M\u00e1rquez scored leading to a loss, making the claim FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I think in the 2006 World Cup match against Iran, M\u00e1rquez did score, so maybe row 8 is relevant despite the table's limitations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user should consider that as relevant because it's known history. But since the task is to use the table data provided, and the 'goal' column doesn't specify scorers, we can't confirm from the table that M\u00e1rquez scored in row 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim may not be supported by the table data, making the answer FALSE, with no relevant cells because none of the rows meet both conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
