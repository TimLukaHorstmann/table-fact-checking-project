    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"helle nielsen marie roepke play together in the women's double 2 year in a row.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim refers to. \"helle nielsen\" and \"marie roepke\" are names, likely of female players, probably in doubles. The term \"play together\" suggests they were partners in a doubles event. The mention of \"2 year in a row\" indicates that they played consecutively for two years.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by searching for these names in the Women's Double column. \n\nStarting from the top, each row has entries for different years. For example, in 2008, under Women's Double, I see \"helle nielsen marie roepke.\" That matches exactly. So that's one relevant cell: row index is probably around 2008. Let me check the exact row. If the first row is 2000 or maybe 2007, but looking at the data, in 2008, it's \"helle nielsen marie roepke.\" So that's a match.\n\nNext, I need to see if they played together again in the following year. The claim says two years in a row. So after 2008, the next year would be 2009. Checking 2009's Women's Double column: it shows \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" as well. Wait, no, looking back, in 2009, I think the entry is different. Let me check:\n\nIn 2009, under Women's Double, it says \"helle nielsen marie roepke.\" Wait, but the claim is about two consecutive years. So if they played together in both 2008 and 2009, that would be two years in a row.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm each year:\n\n- 2008: Yes, helle nielsen marie roepke\n- 2009: I think it's \"helle nielsen marie roepke\" again. Wait no, checking the table, in 2009, under Women's Double, it's actually \"helle nielsen marie roepke.\" So they played together for two consecutive years.\n\nAlternatively, if in 2010, their names are present again but not consecutive to 2008, that wouldn't count. So the key is whether helle and Marie appeared in both 2008 and 2009.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- 2008, Women's Double: found\n- 2009, Women's Double: also found\n\nSo the two relevant cells are these. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because their names appear as partners in women's doubles for two consecutive years.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from 2008 and 2009 where Helle Nielsen Marie Roepke played together in the women's doubles.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Women's Double\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Women's Double\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"xu huaiwen play in the women 's single from 2003 to 2006.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Xu Huaiwen competed in women's singles during those years. So I need to look for her name in the women's singles column for the years 2003 through 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, men's singles, women's singles, etc. The relevant column here is \"women's singles.\" Now, I'll go through each row from 2003 to 2006 and check if Xu Huaiwen is listed there.\n\nStarting with 2003: In row 18 (since rows start at 0), the women's singles column has \"juliane schenk,\" not Xu Huaiwen. So that's a no for 2003.\n\nNext, 2004: The table shows the years in order, so after 2003 comes 2004. Looking at row 19, I see \"xu huaiwen\" under women's singles. That matches, so she played in 2004.\n\n2005: The next year would be row 20. Checking that cell, it's \"ronald susilo,\" which is the men's singles, but for women's singles, looking at row 20's column: It says \"xu huaiwen\" again? Wait, no, let me check again. No, wait, row 20 is 2005, and in that year, under women's singles, it's \"xu huaiwen.\" So she played in 2005 as well.\n\nWait, but the claim says from 2003 to 2006. So I need to check all those years.\n\nFor 2006: Row 21 is 2006. Looking at that row, women's singles have \"wang yihan,\" not Xu Huaiwen. So she didn't play in 2006.\n\nSo she played in 2004 and 2005 but not in 2003 or 2006. The claim says from 2003 to 2006, which includes all those years, so technically, the claim is partially correct but not fully encompassing all four years. However, maybe I should consider whether she was active during any part of that period.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim isn't stating that she played every year but rather that she played within that timeframe. Since 2004 and 2005 are within 2003-2006, the statement might still hold. But the exact wording is important.\n\nThe claim says \"play in the women's single from 2003 to 2006.\" It could be interpreted as playing in any of those years or all of them. If it's any, then yes, she played in 2004 and 2005, so TRUE. But if it means she played every year, then it would be FALSE because she didn't play in 2003 and 2006.\n\nLooking back at the instruction: It says to check each condition against the table. So perhaps the claim is asserting that she played during those consecutive years. Since she did play in two of them but not all four, the answer might be FALSE because it's not fully supported for the entire timeframe.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The instruction says to determine if the claim is fully supported. If the claim is that she played from 2003 to 2006, inclusive, meaning any time during those years, then since she did play in 2004 and 2005, it's TRUE. But if it requires her to have played every year, then it's FALSE.\n\nBut the phrasing isn't clear on whether it's all or some. The claim says \"play in... from 2003 to 2006,\" which could imply participation during any of those years. So if she participated in at least one, it's TRUE. But perhaps the intended meaning is that she was active for all those years, which would require her to be present every year.\n\nGiven that the claim might mean she played each year from 2003 through 2006, since she didn't play in 2003 and 2006, the statement is FALSE.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the user intended it as participating during any of those years. So perhaps the answer should be TRUE because she did participate in some of them within that timeframe.\n\nBut looking back at the example given, when checking conditions, if all are met, it's TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. So if the claim requires her to play each year from 2003-2006, and she didn't do so (she missed 2003 and 2006), then it's not fully supported.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant cells are just where her name appears in women's singles during those years. So the rows would be row 19 (2004) and row 20 (2005). Therefore, the answer is TRUE because she did play in some of those years, even though not all.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Xu Huaiwen played in women's singles from 2003 to 2006. Checking the table, Xu Huaiwen appears in the women's singles column for 2004 and 2005 but not for 2003 or 2006. Therefore, she did play during part of that timeframe.\n\n{\"uri\": \"content://com.android.vcard\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba/1000/ (name=\u5f20\u6653\u6ce2\uff0corg.com.google contacts.name)\uff0c(name=\u9ec4\u5c0f\u534e\uff0corg.com.google.contacts.name)\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"content://com.android.vcard\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba/1000/ (name=\u5f20\u6653\u6ce2\uff0corg.com.google contacts.name)\uff0c(name=\u9ec4\u5c0f\u534e\uff0corg.com.google.contacts.name)\"\n}\n```\n\nThe output above is based on the provided code snippet, which seems to be incomplete or unrelated to the task.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"katrin schmidt and pi hongyan both play 2 time in the women's singles.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this statement means. It seems like it's saying that both Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan have won two titles (probably Grand Slam tournaments) in the women's singles category.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns for 'year', 'men's singles', 'women's singles', etc. So, to verify this claim, I need to check if both these names appear twice in the 'women's singles' column across different years.\n\nStarting with Katrin Schmidt: I'll scan through each row's women's singles entry. Let me go row by row:\n\n- 2007: Wang Yihan\n- 2008: Maria Febe Kusumastuti\n- 2009: Juliane Schenk\n- 2010: Liu Xin\n- 2011: Li Xuerui\n- 2012: Juliane Schenk\n- 2013: Nichaon Jindapon\n\nHmm, I don't see Katrin Schmidt here. Wait, maybe she's in a different row? Let me check again. Maybe I missed her. Scanning all the rows up to 2013, I don't see Katrin Schmidt listed as part of the women's singles winners. So that might mean the claim is incorrect for her.\n\nNow, Pi Hongyan: Checking the same 'women's singles' column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 2007: Wang Yihan\n- 2008: Maria Febe Kusumastuti\n- 2009: Juliane Schenk\n- 2010: Liu Xin\n- 2011: Li Xuerui\n- 2012: Juliane Schenk\n- 2013: Nichaon Jindapon\n\nAgain, Pi Hongyan doesn't appear. So both names aren't present in the table as women's singles champions. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because neither has won two times.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"play 2 time\" refers to participating twice rather than winning twice? But the term \"play 2 time\" is a bit unclear, but given the context of titles or wins, it's more likely referring to winning two times.\n\nSo, since neither Katrin Schmidt nor Pi Hongyan have won two women's singles titles based on the table, the claim isn't supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"michael s\u00f8gaard play in the men's double with both joachim fischer nielsen and michael lamp.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like a history of players in various categories such as men's singles, women's singles, etc., each year from 1988 onwards. The columns are for different types of doubles: men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nThe claim is about Michael S\u00f8gaard playing men's doubles with two specific partners: Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp. So, I need to check if there's a row in the table where Michael S\u00f8gaard is listed as part of the men's doubles pair alongside both of these players.\n\nLooking at the table, each year has entries for different categories. For example, in 2008, under men's doubles, it says \"mathias boe carsten mogensen.\" In 2010, men's doubles include \"mathias boe carsten mogensen\" as well. But where is Michael S\u00f8gaard?\n\nI need to scan each row for the year and see if Michael S\u00f8gaard appears in the men's doubles column with the two mentioned partners.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- 2007: Men's doubles are mathias boe carsten mogensen, but no Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 2008: Same as above.\n- 2009: Rupesh kumar sanave thomas and others, no Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 2010: Mathias boe again, no Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n- 2011: Bodin isara, not relevant.\n- 2012: Ingo kindervater, nope.\n- 2013: Mads conrad-petersen and others.\n\nWait, in the 2007 row, I see \"mathias boe carsten mogensen\" but that's not Michael S\u00f8gaard. Then in 2016 or later, maybe? Wait, let me check if Michael S\u00f8gaard appears anywhere as a men's doubles player with those partners.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the specific combination: Michael S\u00f8gaard paired with Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp in men's doubles.\n\nI need to check each year where men's doubles are mentioned. Let's go through some years:\n\n- 2007: No, just mathias boe and carsten mogensen.\n- 2008: Same as above.\n- 2009: Rupesh kumar sanave thomas and others.\n- 2010: Mathias boe again.\n- 2012: Ingo kindervater and Johannes schoettler.\n\nWait, in the 2007 row, under men's doubles, it says \"mathias boe carsten mogensen.\" That's two players. Maybe Michael S\u00f8gaard isn't there yet.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nIn 2016, perhaps? Wait, the table goes up to 2013. Let me check if Michael S\u00f8gaard appears in any of these years with those partners.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for rows where men's doubles include Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp alongside Michael S\u00f8gaard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Michael S\u00f8gaard is playing with both of them at the same time. So, I'm looking for a row where under men's doubles, it says \"michael s\u00f8gaard\" paired with both \"joachim fischer nielsen\" and \"michael lamp.\"\n\nBut scanning through each year, I don't see Michael S\u00f8gaard listed in any of the men's doubles columns. The only time Michael S\u00f8gaard appears is perhaps in 2007 or later, but not necessarily with those partners.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the row for 2016 (though it's not provided), but since the table ends at 2013, maybe Michael S\u00f8gaard hasn't played with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp together. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is that Michael S\u00f8gaard has played men's doubles with both of them at some point, not necessarily in the same year.\n\nBut regardless, to verify if he played with both, I need to check each row where he is listed as a player and see if he was paired with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp in men's doubles.\n\nIf in any of those rows, under men's doubles, it says michael s\u00f8gaard, joachim fischer nielsen, and michael lamp together, then the claim would be true. Otherwise, false.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nIn 2007: Men's doubles are mathias boe and carsten mogensen.\n2008: Same as above.\n2009: Rupesh kumar sanave thomas and others.\n2010: Mathias boe again.\n2012: Ingo kindervater and Johannes schoettler.\n\nWait, I don't see Michael S\u00f8gaard appearing in any of these. So perhaps he hasn't played men's doubles with those partners yet, or maybe the table doesn't cover that period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each row more carefully.\n\nLooking for \"michael s\u00f8gaard\" anywhere in the table:\n\n- 2007: No.\n- 2008: No.\n- 2009: No.\n- 2010: No.\n- 2011: No.\n- 2012: No.\n- 2013: No.\n\nWait, maybe Michael S\u00f8gaard is not listed here, or the table only covers up to 2013. If that's the case, then perhaps he hasn't played with those partners yet. Therefore, the claim might be false based on the given data.\n\nAlternatively, if the table is only up to 2013 and Michael S\u00f8gaard appears later, but not necessarily with both partners, it would still be false.\n\nSo, considering all that, I don't see Michael S\u00f8gaard paired with Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp in men's doubles. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, there is no evidence to suggest that Michael S\u00f8gaard has played men's doubles with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp. The claim, as stated, does not hold true according to the data given.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false based on the information provided in the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the mixed double\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Katrin Schmidt played doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin. So, I'm looking for rows where Katrin Schmidt is listed in the women's singles column because she's a female player, and then check if she was paired with both Markus Keck (men's singles) and Chen Jin (presumably a male player as well).\n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows where Katrin Schmidt appears in the 'Women's Singles' column. Let me scan through each row:\n\nLooking at the table, Katrin Schmidt appears in a few rows. For example, in row 0, she is listed under Women's Singles. Then, I need to check if in that same row, she was paired with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in Mixed Doubles.\n\nWait, the table structure has columns for Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, and Women's Doubles. Wait, no, actually looking at the columns: each row has Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, and Women's Doubles. So, to check Mixed Doubles, I should look at the Women's Doubles column because Mixed Doubles involves one male and one female player.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row lists four players: Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles (a pair), and Women's Doubles (a pair). So, for Mixed Doubles, it would actually be either Men's or Women's Doubles, depending on which partner is female. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the claim says \"mixed double,\" so that means one male and one female player. Therefore, in the table, the relevant columns are Men's Singles and Women's Singles for individual players, but when it comes to doubles, Mixed Doubles would be a pairing of Men's Singles with Women's Singles in some context.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about Katrin Schmidt playing with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in the mixed double. So, each pair is a mixed double team. That means, for each year, if Katrin Schmidt was part of any Mixed Doubles teams, those would be listed in either Men's or Women's Doubles columns.\n\nWait no, because in doubles, it's either men's, women's, or mixed. So, the \"Mixed Double\" is a specific pairing where one player is male and the other is female. Therefore, in the table, each row lists four individual players: Men's Singles (MS), Women's Singles (WS), Men's Doubles (MD) as a pair, and Women's Doubles (WD) as a pair. But for Mixed Doubles (MX), it would be a pairing of MS and WS players.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't explicitly list MX; maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps in the table, the Mixed Doubles are listed under either MD or WD depending on the gender composition. No, that doesn't make sense because MD is for men's doubles, so it must be two men. Similarly, WD is women's doubles.\n\nTherefore, if Katrin Schmidt was part of a mixed double team, then in that row, she would be paired with someone from Men's Singles in either the Men's or Women's Doubles columns? Wait, no. Let me think again: In the table, each row lists four players:\n\n1. Men's Singles (MS) - individual male player\n2. Women's Singles (WS) - individual female player\n3. Men's Doubles (MD) - pair of two male players\n4. Women's Doubles (WD) - pair of two female players\n\nSo, if Katrin Schmidt was part of a mixed doubles team, that would require her to be paired with a male player in either MD or MX? Wait, but the table doesn't have an MX column for Mixed Doubles, only MD and WD. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the way it's structured is that if Katrin Schmidt is playing mixed doubles, she would be part of a pair where one is male and one is female. But in the given table, each row lists four individual players, not pairs. So perhaps the Mixed Doubles are implied by pairing an MS player with a WS player in the same row.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the columns for doubles would be MD (men's) and WD (women's). Therefore, if Katrin Schmidt is part of a mixed double team, that would mean she is paired with someone in the Men's Singles column. So, I need to look at each row where Katrin Schmidt is listed in WS and check whether in that same row, she is paired with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin.\n\nWait, but in any given year, a player can only be part of one doubles team, right? Because they can't play two different partners in the same year. So, if Katrin Schmidt played mixed doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in the same year, that would mean she was paired with both in the same row, which isn't possible because each row has four players: two singles and two doubles.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look for rows where Katrin Schmidt is in WS and then check if in that row, she is part of a mixed double team. So, perhaps in the same row, there's an MD pair where one of them is her partner, but no, because MD is men's doubles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the WD column, which would be all women, so that can't be a mixed double. Therefore, maybe the way it's structured, if Katrin Schmidt is playing mixed doubles, she must be paired with someone in MS as their partner. So, for example, if in row X, MS is Markus Keck and WS is Katrin Schmidt, then they would form a mixed doubles team.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row has four individual players: MS, WS, MD, WD. So, to form a mixed double, it's either (MS and WS) or perhaps (MD and WS), but that doesn't make sense because MD is two men.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way Katrin Schmidt can be part of a mixed doubles team is by being paired with someone in MS. So, if in any row, she is in WS and her partner is in MS, then they form a mixed double team.\n\nBut the claim says she played with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in mixed doubles, implying that she had two different partners in different years or same year, which would require being part of multiple teams. But since each row represents one year (I assume), so in any given row, Katrin Schmidt could only be paired once.\n\nWait, perhaps the table lists all her partnerships across years. So, maybe she played with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin at different times, each as partners in mixed doubles.\n\nSo, to find this, I need to look for rows where:\n\n1. She is in WS (Women's Singles)\n2. In that same row, there exists either an MD or MX team (but since there's no MX column, perhaps she is part of a WD team with one male and one female? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doubles teams are listed as pairs under the respective columns: Men's Doubles would be two men, Women's Doubles would be two women. So, Katrin Schmidt could not be part of a mixed double in this table because it's only listing MS, WS, MD (men's), WD (women's). Therefore, perhaps there are no mixed doubles listed here.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim is about mixed doubles. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table. Alternatively, perhaps the MD and WD columns list both players in each double, meaning that if Katrin Schmidt was part of a mixed double, it would show under either MD or WD as one of the two.\n\nWait, no. Because MD is Men's Doubles, which are two men. So if she's a woman playing with a man, that wouldn't be listed in MD because that's only for men. Similarly, WD is Women's Doubles, so if she's a woman playing with another woman, but the claim is about mixed doubles, which would require one man and one woman.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the way it's structured, mixed doubles are not explicitly listed as separate columns; instead, they're implied by pairing WS players with MS players in some other context. But that doesn't seem to align with the table structure given.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach: identify all rows where Katrin Schmidt is in WS (Women's Singles) and then check if in those same rows, she is part of any doubles team with either Markus Keck or Chen Jin.\n\nGiven that the claim says she played mixed doubles with both, we need to find at least one row where she is paired with Markus Keck in a mixed double, and another row where she is paired with Chen Jin. But given the structure of the table, it's unclear how mixed doubles are represented.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that for each year, there are two men and two women playing singles, but only one pair plays doubles. Wait no, because if you have four players (two men and two women), then maybe two pairs play doubles: Men's Doubles and Women's Doubles, which would be separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the way it works is that in each year, there are two men playing singles (MS1 and MS2) and two women playing singles (WS1 and WS2). Then, for doubles, they form one Men's Doubles pair and one Women's Doubles pair. So, Katrin Schmidt could be part of a Women's Doubles team with another woman, or maybe she could be paired with a man in a mixed double.\n\nBut the table doesn't list Mixed Doubles; it only lists Men's and Women's doubles as separate pairs. Therefore, perhaps the way to check if she played mixed doubles is by seeing if she's part of any MD or WD team that includes one man and one woman. But given that MD is all men and WD is all women, maybe this isn't possible.\n\nThis suggests that the table might not include mixed doubles at all, which would make the claim impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the data is structured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a year where four people play: two in singles (MS and WS) and two in doubles (MD and WD). But then MD and WD are separate teams of two, so it's possible that the person playing WS could also be part of a mixed double with someone from MD. However, given the way the table is structured, it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe each row includes all four participants: MS1, WS1, MD1 (two men), and WD1 (two women). So if Katrin Schmidt is WS1, then perhaps she could be part of a mixed doubles team with either MD1 or someone else. But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way to find if she played mixed doubles is by seeing if in any row, her WS name is paired with someone from the men's singles as a doubles partner, but again, given the structure of the table, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for rows where both Markus Keck and Chen Jin are present as men, and Katrin Schmidt is present as a woman. Then, check if in any row, she is paired with either of them in doubles. But how? Since MD is two men, maybe if her WS name is linked to an MD team that includes either of the men.\n\nWait, but in each row, we have four individuals: two men (MS and MD) and two women (WS and WD). So perhaps Katrin Schmidt could be paired with a man from the MS or MD group. But how would that look?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doubles teams are formed by pairing singles players across genders, so WS1 plays mixed doubles with either MS1 or MS2, and similarly for WD1.\n\nWait, this is getting too speculative. Maybe I should try to find an example in the table where a woman is paired with a man in doubles. But given that the columns are separate (MS, WS, MD, WD), it's unclear how mixed doubles would be represented.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the answer is that there's no way to determine from the provided data whether Katrin Schmidt played mixed doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin because the structure of the table doesn't include information about mixed doubles teams. Alternatively, if the table does allow for such determination, I would need more specific guidance on how to extract that information.\n\nBut since the user claims she did play mixed doubles with both, perhaps the answer is that there's insufficient data provided in the table to confirm or deny this claim.\n</think>\n\nThe data provided does not include information about mixed doubles teams. The columns represent Men's Singles (MS), Women's Singles (WS), Men's Doubles (MD), and Women's Doubles (WD). Mixed doubles are typically formed by pairing a man from singles with a woman from singles or another woman, but the structure of the table does not explicitly indicate such pairings. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm whether Katrin Schmidt played mixed doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: There is insufficient data provided in the table to determine whether Katrin Schmidt played mixed doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"xu huaiwen plays in the women's singles from 2003 to 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It's saying that Xu Huaiwen competed in women's singles during those years.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the columns are year, men's singles, women's singles, etc. So for each row, which is a year, I can check the women's singles column to see if Xu Huaiwen was there.\n\nI need to find all rows from 2003 to 2009 where the women's singles column has Xu Huaiwen.\n\nLet me go through each relevant year:\n\n- 2003: The women's singles player is listed as \"xu huaiwen.\" So that's a match.\n- 2004: I don't see Xu Huaiwen in the list. It looks like the player for 2004 might be someone else, possibly \"juliane schenk\" or another name.\nWait, no, looking again, maybe it's not her. Let me check each year one by one.\n\nFor each year from 2003 to 2009:\n\n- 2003: Yes, Xu Huaiwen is there.\n- 2004: No, the player is someone else, maybe \"maria febe kusumastuti\" or another name.\nWait, no, in 2004, women's singles are \"maria febe kusumastuti.\" So not Xu.\n- 2005: The player is \"juliane schenk.\" Not Xu.\n- 2006: \"xu huaiwen\" again. So yes.\n- 2007: \"wang yihan.\" No.\n- 2008: \"maria febe kusumastuti\" again. No.\n- 2009: The player is \"juliane schenk.\" Not Xu.\n\nWait, no, in 2006, the women's singles for China might have different names due to translation or spelling variations. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2003: women's singles - xu huaiwen\n- 2004: maria febe kusumastuti\n- 2005: juliane schenk\n- 2006: xulianateng... wait, no. Wait, I think in 2006, the player is listed as \"xu huaiwen.\" Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the table shows for 2006: women's singles - xulianateng? Or is it xu huaiwen? Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking back at the provided table data, here are the years and women's singles players:\n\n- 2003: xu huaiwen\n- 2004: maria febe kusumastuti\n- 2005: juliane schenk\n- 2006: xulianateng? Or perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, in the table for 2006, it's listed as \"xu huaiwen.\" Because looking at the data:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n2003: xu huaiwen\n\n2004: maria febe kusumastuti\n\n2005: juliane schenk\n\n2006: I think in the table it's \"juliane schenk\" again. Wait, no, perhaps I need to check again.\n\nWait, actually, for 2006, the women's singles is listed as:\n\nLooking at the row for 2006:\n\n- 2006: xu huaiwen? Or someone else. Let me check each year:\n\nLooking at the table provided, the years from 2003 to 2009 have these players in women's singles:\n\n2003: xu huaiwen\n\n2004: maria febe kusumastuti\n\n2005: juliane schenk\n\n2006: xu huaiwen again?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me list them out clearly.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 2003: \"xu huaiwen\"\n- 2004: \"maria febe kusumastuti\"\n- 2005: \"juliane schenk\"\n- 2006: \"xu huaiwen\"\n- 2007: \"wang yihan\"\n- 2008: \"maria febe kusumastuti\"\n- 2009: \"juliane schenk\"\n\nSo, Xu Huaiwen plays in 2003 and 2006. So she was there in 2003 and again in 2006, but not from 2003 to 2009 as a continuous stretch.\n\nThe claim says she played from 2003 to 2009. That's six years: '03-'09.\n\nBut according to the table, she only played in two of those years: '03 and '06. She didn't play every year between '03 and '09. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other years where she might have played. For example, perhaps in 2008 or 2009, but according to the table, she's only listed in 2003 and 2006.\n\nSo, Xu Huaiwen did play in women's singles during those years, but not every year from 2003 to 2009. She didn't play in all of them. Therefore, the claim is false because it implies she played each year, which she didn't.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that she only played in some of those years.\n</think>\n\nXu Huaiwen competed in women's singles for China in two matches during the period from 2003 to 2009: in 2003 and again in 2006. She did not participate every year between these dates.\n\n**Answer:** Xu Huaiwen played in women's singles for China in 2003 and 2006, but not every year from 2003 to 2009.",

It mentions two people: Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke. They are supposed to have played together in the women's doubles category for three consecutive years.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where either of these names appears in the 'women's doubles' column. Then, check if they appear together in three different years one after another.\n\nStarting with Helle Nielsen: I'll scan each row under 'women's doubles'. \n\n- In 2008, the women's doubles players are Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke. So that's a pair.\n- Checking subsequent years:\n  - 2009: The women's doubles team includes Helle Nielsen and someone else (Mie Schjoett - Kristensen). So Marie isn't here.\n  - 2010: No Helle Nielsen listed; instead, it's Pan Pan and Tian Qing.\n  - 2011 onwards: No Helle Nielsen.\n\nSo the only year both Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke are together in women's doubles is 2008. That's just one year, not three in a row.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other instances of them playing together elsewhere. Maybe in different years beyond 2008? \n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n- 2008: Both Helle and Marie.\n- After that, in the next few years:\n  - 2010: Neither is listed as women's doubles.\n  - 2012: Helle isn't there; Marie might be, but not together with Helle.\n\nSo they only play together once. That means the claim about three consecutive years is false because it doesn't even happen once, let alone thrice in a row.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread some rows. Let me check each year again quickly.\n\n- 2008: Both present.\n- 2009: Helle with someone else.\n- 2010: Neither.\n- 2012: Marie is there, but not with Helle.\n\nSo no, they don't play together in any consecutive years, let alone three.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim states: \"katrin schmidt and pi hongyan both play 4 time in the women 's single.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two players: Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan, both playing four times in the women's singles category.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find each of these individuals in their respective columns. The relevant column for this analysis is \"women 's singles.\"\n\nStarting with Katrin Schmidt, I'll go through each row to see where she appears. Scanning the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Not Katrin.\n- Row 1: No.\n- Row 2: Yes, Katrin Schmidt is in row 3 (since row indices start at 0). She plays women's singles multiple times, but I need to count how many times she played.\n\nWait, no, the rows are numbered starting from 0. So when I see Katrin Schmidt, her row index is 3. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Row 2: \"katrin schmidt\" appears in the women's singles column at row index 3 (since it's the fourth entry). From the data, she plays women's singles multiple times. The exact number isn't specified, but the claim says four times.\n\nNext, checking for Pi Hongyan. I'll look through each row's women's singles column:\n\n- Row 0: No.\n- Row 1: No.\n- ...\n- Continuing until I find her. Upon scanning, I notice that Pi Hongyan appears in the women's singles column at row index 10 (2010 row). So she is present.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times each plays. For Katrin Schmidt, looking through all rows:\n\nShe's in row 3, which is the 2007 row. The table shows that she plays multiple times. From the data provided, it seems she has played several times, possibly more than four. Similarly, Pi Hongyan appears in row 10 (2010), but I need to see how many times she played.\n\nWait, actually, each entry in the women's singles column represents one appearance. So if Katrin Schmidt has multiple entries, that counts as multiple times. The same goes for Pi Hongyan.\n\nLooking back, the claim says both play four times in women's singles. To verify this, I need to count their respective appearances.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Katrin Schmidt appears at least once (row 3). Wait, no\u2014the table shows she might have played multiple times because each row is a different year. So for example, she plays every year, which would mean many times over four years or more. Alternatively, if she only plays once in the women's singles, then it wouldn't be four.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to count each occurrence. Let me go through each row and check:\n\nKatrin Schmidt:\n- 2007: Yes (row 3)\n- 2012: No\n- 2014: Not sure, but from the table, she might appear in 2010 or another year.\n\nWait, looking again, I see Katrin Schmidt is in the women's singles column at row 3 (2007) and possibly others. For example:\n\n- In row 3: 2007\n- Row 10: Liu Xin is there.\n- Wait, no, perhaps she only appears once. So that would mean she plays once, not four times.\n\nSimilarly, Pi Hongyan appears in the women's singles column at row 10 (2010). Does she play more than once? From the table provided, it seems each player is listed once per year they played in that category. Therefore, if Katrin Schmidt appears once and Pi Hongyan also appears once, they haven't both played four times.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row represents a different year, and under \"women 's singles,\" we see who played that year. So for example, if a player's name appears in multiple rows, it means they played each of those years, thus multiple times. \n\nSo Katrin Schmidt: checking all the women's singles columns:\n\nLooking through the table, Katrin Schmidt is listed at row 3 (2007). She might also be present in other years, but from a quick scan, I don't see her appearing more than once. If that's the case, she played once.\n\nPi Hongyan: Looking for her name in the women's singles column. From the table, she appears at row 10 (2010). She may have played only once there.\n\nSo both of them have appeared once each, not four times. Therefore, the claim that both play four times is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed some rows where they appear multiple times. Let me go through the list again:\n\nFor Katrin Schmidt:\n- 2007: Yes (row 3)\n- Any other years? Checking through all rows, she doesn't seem to appear again in women's singles. So one appearance.\n\nPi Hongyan:\n- 2010: row 10\n- Any others? Looking at the table, no, so one appearance.\n\nThus, both have played once, not four times. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Katrin Schmidt played doubles with two different partners, Markus Keck and Chen Jin, in the same event, probably the men's doubles category.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where \"katrin schmidt\" is listed as a player. The columns relevant here are 'men 's singles', 'women 's singles', 'men 's double', and 'women 's double'. Since the claim is about men's doubles, I should focus on the 'men 's double' column.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where \"katrin schmidt\" appears in the men's double column. \n\nStarting from row 0: The men's double for row 0 is empty or not listed, so probably not relevant. Row 1: No entry. I think the rows are numbered starting at 0, so I'll go up to row 30.\n\nI find that Katrin Schmidt appears in the men's doubles column in row 4. Wait, no, looking more carefully, perhaps I missed it. Let me check each row step by step.\n\nWait, actually, let me look for \"katrin schmidt\" specifically in the 'men 's double' column.

Or maybe row 5.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, actually, Katrin Schmidt appears as a player in the women's singles and women's doubles. But in the men's doubles, she is listed as a partner with Markus Keck in one of the rows. Let me confirm.\n\nUpon checking each row:\n\n- In row 3, the men's doubles are empty.\n- Row 4: Men's doubles has \"Markus Keck\" and another player.\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing rows. Alternatively, maybe she is not a men's doubles player at all.\n\nWait no, upon closer inspection, in the table, Katrin Schmidt is listed under women's singles (column) for some years. But in the men's doubles column, I don't see her name as a partner.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each row represents a year, and each cell within a row shows who played in that category. So for each year, we have entries for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles.\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n- In 1988 (row 0), Katrin Schmidt is listed under women's singles but not men's doubles.\n- In row 1 (1989), she's in women's singles again.\n- Continuing this way until I find a year where she is in men's doubles.\n\nWait, upon reviewing the table, I notice that Katrin Schmidt appears as a player in various years. However, in the 'men 's double' column, her name isn't present as a partner with Markus Keck or Chen Jin.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again for any row where she is paired with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in men's doubles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that she played with both partners in the same event, which might mean the same year. So I need to check if in one particular year, she was playing with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in the men's doubles.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- In 1988: Women's singles.\n- 1989: Women's singles.\n- ...\n- 1996 (row 15): Men's doubles is \"Markus Keck\", but not Katrin Schmidt.\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Alternatively, maybe she was a mixed doubles player, but the claim is specifically about men's doubles.\n\nUpon checking each row again:\n\nLooking for 'men 's double' column entries where Katrin Schmidt is present. If I can't find her in that column, then the claim would be false because she didn't play with those partners in men's doubles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she did play in men's doubles with Markus Keck and also with Chen Jin in different years.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe she was involved with both partners. So if in one year she played men's doubles with Markus Keck, and in another year she played with Chen Jin, then the claim might be true.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the claim says she \"play with both\" in the same event. Or does it? Let me re-read the claim: \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men 's double.\" So does this mean that in one doubles match, she played alongside both Keck and Jin? That's not possible because a doubles match has two players.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is saying she played with each of them in separate doubles matches in men's doubles. So she played with Markus Keck in some year's men's doubles and separately played with Chen Jin in another year's men's doubles. If that's the case, then we need to check if both partnerships exist.\n\nSo I'll need to find rows where 'men 's double' is \"Markus Keck\" and another row where it's \"Chen Jin,\" but with Katrin Schmidt as a partner.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\n- In 1988 (row 0), women's singles: Katrin Schmidt.\n- 1989 (row1): same.\n...\nIn 1996 (row15), men's doubles has \"Markus Keck\" and someone else, not Katrin.\nIn row16 (1997): Men's doubles: maybe different players.\n\nWait, perhaps in some year she was paired with both. But upon scanning the entire table, I don't see her listed as a partner with either Markus Keck or Chen Jin in men's doubles. That would mean the claim is false because she didn't play with them in men's doubles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she played women's doubles and mixed doubles, but not men's doubles. Therefore, the claim that she played with both in men's double is incorrect.\n\nThus, the task is to verify whether Katrin Schmidt participated in men's doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin.\n\nAfter reviewing each row, I don't find her name in the 'men 's double' column as a partner with either of them. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Katrin Schmidt played with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in men's doubles is not supported by the provided data. After examining each year's entries, there is no evidence of her participating in men's doubles with either partner.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false; Katrin Schmidt did not play men's doubles with Markus Keck or Chen Jin.",
