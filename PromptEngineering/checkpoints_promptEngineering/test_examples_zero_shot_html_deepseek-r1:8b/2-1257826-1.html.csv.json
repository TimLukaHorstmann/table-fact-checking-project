    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 3 be january 20 2001.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's about a game where the score was 3 goals, specifically checking if the date for that game was January 20, 2001.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like goal, date, score, result, and competition. My task is to find which rows have a score of 3-1 because that's when there are three goals (assuming \"score\" refers to the team's goals, so 3 indicates the team scored 3 goals). Wait, no, the score format in the table shows something like \"2 - 0\", which probably means the team scored 2 and the opponent scored 0. So for a goal of 3, I'm looking for rows where the first number is 3.\n\nNow, scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Score is 2-0 \u2192 Not 3.\nRow 2: 1-0 \u2192 No.\nRow 3: 2-0 \u2192 No.\nRow 4: 3-1 \u2192 Yes. So this row has a score of 3-1, which means the team scored 3 goals. The date here is March 15, 2001, not January 20, 2001.\n\nWait, so there's no game on January 20, 2001 with a score of 3-1 or any other 3 goals? Let me check again.\n\nLooking for rows where the score starts with 3. Only row 4 has a score of 3-1, and its date is March 15, not January 20. So there's no game on January 20, 2001 with 3 goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the only game with 3 goals happened in March, not January.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 4 be march 15 , 2001.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that there's a game where the score was 4 goals (I think), and the date of that game was March 15, 2001. So, looking at the table, I need to find any row where the goal is 4 and the date is March 15, 2001.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with details like goal, date, score, result, and competition. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Goal is 1, date is January 17, 2001. Not matching.\nRow 2: Goal is 2, date is January 20, 2001. No match.\nRow 3: Goal is 2 again, same date as Row 2. Still no.\nRow 4: Goal is 3, date is March 15, 2001. Hmm, that's close. The goal here is 3, not 4, so it doesn't meet the condition of having a goal of 4.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The claim says \"have a goal of 4.\" So looking for rows where the first column (goal) is 4. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Goal 1\nRow 2: Goal 2\nRow 3: Goal 2\nRow 4: Goal 3\nRow 5: Goal 0\nRow 6: Goal 2\n\nNone of the rows have a goal of 4. So that part is false. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no game in the table with a goal of 4 on March 15, 2001.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"goal.\" Could it mean something else? For example, sometimes in sports, the score can be written as goals plus another statistic. But looking at the score column, it's always something like \"2 - 0\" or \"3 - 1,\" which seems to represent the score of the game, with the first number being the goal count for one team and the second perhaps the opponent's. So if a row has a goal (first column) of 4, that would mean one team scored 4 goals.\n\nIn this table, the maximum goal in the first column is 3 (Row 4). So there's no game where the goal was 4 on March 15, 2001. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a game with a goal of 4 occurred on March 15, 2001. Checking the table, none of the rows have a goal of 4 on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the date of the game with 5 goal be 15 march 2001.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n- The game has a \"goal\" number of 5.\n- The date of this particular game is \"15 March 2001.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with specific details: goal, date, score, result, and competition.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows might have a goal of 5. I'll scan through each row's 'goal' column:\n\n- Row 1: Goal is 1\n- Row 2: Goal is 2\n- Row 3: Goal is 3\n- Row 4: Goal is 4\n- Row 5: Goal is 5\n- Row 6: Goal is 6\n\nSo, the fifth row (row index 4) has a goal of 5. Now, I need to check the date for this specific game. The 'date' in row 5 is \"14 july 2004.\" \n\nThe claim says the date should be \"15 March 2001.\" Comparing these two dates, they are different. Therefore, the date associated with the goal of 5 doesn't match what's stated in the claim.\n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, I'll check if there's any other row that might have a goal of 5 and see if any of those have a date matching \"15 March 2001.\" But from the table provided, only row 5 has a goal of 5, and its date is July 14, 2004, not March 15, 2001.\n\nThus, the claim doesn't hold because the date doesn't align with the stated goal of 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
