    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Michael Schumacher is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"Michael Schumacher be the driver whose constructor be Ferrari have an average grid number of 1 with time / retired of 1:32:35.101.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. I think it means that Michael Schumacher drove for Ferrari, had a grid position of 1, and his time or reason for retirement was exactly \"1:32:35.101\". So I need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows, each representing a driver. The relevant columns here are 'driver', 'constructor', 'laps', 'time / retired', and 'grid'. \n\nLet me locate Michael Schumacher in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find him in row 0 (assuming rows start at 0). His constructor is Ferrari, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the grid number for Michael is column 'grid' in row 0, and it's 1. So that checks out as well.\n\nNow, the time or retirement reason is listed in the 'time / retired' column. For row 0, the value is \"1:32:35.101\", which exactly matches what the claim states.\n\nSo all three parts of the claim are satisfied by Michael Schumacher's data in row 0. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim. Each cell corresponds to a part of the claim:\n\n1. Constructor is Ferrari: Column 'constructor' in row 0.\n2. Grid number is 1: Column 'grid' in row 0.\n3. Time / retired time is \"1:32:35.101\": Column 'time / retired' in row 0.\n\nSo, I should list these three cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
