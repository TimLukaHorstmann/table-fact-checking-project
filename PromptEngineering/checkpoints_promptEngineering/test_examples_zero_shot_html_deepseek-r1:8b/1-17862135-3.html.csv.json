    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"warren kym perform 16 dance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by analyzing each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"warren kym.\" Looking at the table, I see that in row 2, column 'couple' it's written as \"warren &amp; kym\". The &amp; is just an HTML entity for an ampersand, so this refers to the same couple. So far, this part of the claim matches.\n\nNext, the claim says they \"perform 16 dance.\" Looking at the table columns, I need to see which ones are relevant. The 'number of dances' column has values like 16, 16, etc. For warren & kym's row (row index 1), the number of dances is 16. So this matches as well.\n\nNow, let me check if there's any inconsistency. I see that in the table, each row's 'rank by average' and 'place' might not directly relate to the claim, but since the claim is specifically about the number of dances and the couple, those columns are more relevant.\n\nI should also make sure no other rows contradict or support the claim. For example, other rows have different numbers of dances, like 11, 9, etc., but that doesn't affect warren & kym's specific case. The claim is about their performance, so only their row matters.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim says: \"rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance , for an average of 17.8\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. They mention \"Rocco Karina\" scoring 89 points in 5 dances, which would give them an average of 17.8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a couple with their total points, number of dances, and average. So I need to find if there's a couple named \"rocco & karina\" (since in the table it's written as \"rocco &amp; karina\") who has 5 dances, 89 total points, and an average of 17.8.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is Brooke & Derek with 16 dances, 433 points, so not relevant.\n2. Warren & Kym: 16 dances, 397 points. No match.\n3. Lance & Lacey: 16 dances, 392 points. Not matching.\n4. Maurice & Cheryl: 11 dances, 252 points. No.\n5. Cody & Julianne: 13 dances, 292 points. Doesn't fit.\n6. Toni B & Alec: 6 dances, 134 points. Nope.\n7. Susan & Tony D: 9 dances, 192 points. Not matching.\n8. Misty & Maksim: 3 dances, 63 points. No.\n9. Ted & Inna: 2 dances, 37 points. Doesn't fit.\n10. Kim K & Mark: 3 dances, 54 points. No.\n11. Rocco & Karina: Here we go! They have 5 dances and 89 total points. Let me check the average: 89 divided by 5 is indeed 17.8.\n\nSo, Rocco & Karina are in row index 11 (since the table starts at 1). Now, let's verify each part of the claim against the table:\n\n- Name: Yes, it's \"rocco & karina\" but without spaces, so I think that matches.\n- Total points: 89. Correct in the table.\n- Number of dances: 5. Matches.\n- Average: 17.8. Correct as well.\n\nTherefore, all aspects of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"cody & julianne's average score be 22.5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking for.\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim. It mentions \"cody & julianne,\" which refers to a specific couple from the table. The claim states that their average score is exactly 22.5. My task is to verify this by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different couple and contains several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. My focus should be on finding the row where the couple is \"cody & julianne\" and checking their average score.\n\nI'll go through each row to locate \"cody & julianne.\" Scanning the 'couple' column:\n\n1. The first few rows have different couples like \"brooke & derek,\" \"warren & kym,\" etc.\n2. Continuing down, I find a row where the couple is listed as \"cody & julianne.\" Specifically, it's in the 5th row (row index 4 if we start counting from 0).\n\nIn that row, the 'average' column has the value 22.5. This matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The couple's name is in the 'couple' column at row index 4. Therefore, the relevant cell is the one where row_index is 4 and column_name is \"average.\"\n\nI should ensure that there are no other instances of \"cody & julianne\" in the table, but from a quick review, it seems they only appear once. Hence, there's only one relevant cell.\n\nPutting it all together, since the average score for \"cody & julianne\" is indeed 22.5 as per the table, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cell is correctly identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table. The claim is: \"there be more than 20 dance warren & kym have do together.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is asking. It seems like it's about whether Warren & Kym have done more than 20 dances in total. So, I need to find cells related to this couple and specifically their number of dances.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different couple. The relevant columns for this claim are \"couple\" and \"number of dances\". \n\nSo, I'll go through each row to see if Warren & Kym are mentioned as the couple. Scanning the \"couple\" column:\n\n- Row 2: warren & kym \u2013 yes, that's them.\n- Other rows have different names, so we only care about this specific row.\n\nNext, check the \"number of dances\" for this couple. In row 2, the number is 16. \n\nThe claim says more than 20, but 16 is less than 20. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The \"couple\" cell in row 2 and the \"number of dances\" cell in row 2 are the key points.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the number is 16, not more than 20.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
