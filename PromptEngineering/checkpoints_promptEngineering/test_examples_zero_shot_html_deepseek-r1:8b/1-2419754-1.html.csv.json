    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"there be 2 institution locate within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It's about two institutions located in Ohio and their membership status in the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). So, my task is to find out if there are exactly two such institutions in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with various attributes like location, founding year, type, enrollment, etc. I need to focus on the 'location' column to see which institutions are in Ohio and their membership status, but wait\u2014the table doesn't explicitly mention conference memberships. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the term \"Great Midwest Conference\" might be a significant factor here. The user mentioned checking if two institutions in Ohio are members of this conference. So, perhaps I need to look for any clues related to conferences in the table.\n\nHowever, upon examining the table columns, there's no column like 'conference' or 'membership'. The columns provided are institution name, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, and left. None of these directly mention conference affiliations.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the term \"Great Midwest Conference\" is a misnomer, but more accurately, institutions in Ohio might be part of certain conferences like the Big Ten or MAC. But without explicit data on conferences, it's unclear.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the user expects that the 'type' column can indicate conference membership. For example, public vs private universities often have different conference affiliations. However, this isn't a direct indicator either.\n\nLet me look at the table again. The institutions in Ohio listed are:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati - located in Cincinnati, Ohio\n2. University of Dayton - Dayton, Ohio\n\nSo there's two universities in Ohio in the table. Now, do they both belong to the Great Midwest Conference? Since the table doesn't provide conference info, I can't confirm this directly.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the term \"Great Midwest Conference\" is a specific conference. Let me check if these institutions are part of it. From my general knowledge, the University of Cincinnati has been a member of the American Athletic Conference (AAC) since 2014, and before that, they were in different conferences. The University of Dayton is known for its basketball program and competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference.\n\nSo both universities don't belong to the Great Midwest Conference. Therefore, the claim's assertion that there are two institutions in Ohio that are members might be false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Great Midwest Conference\" was intended to refer to a different context or if the table had data on conference memberships, it would affect the answer. But based on the given information, the table doesn't support the claim as both institutions don't belong to the GMC.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe user's claim that there are two Ohio-based institutions in the Great Midwest Conference isn't supported by the provided data. The table lacks explicit conference information, and known conferences for these universities don't align with GMC. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. It seems like the claim is about the Great Midwest Conference and when those universities joined it in 1991. But looking at the table, I don't see any columns related to conferences or joining years beyond \"founded\" and \"joined,\" which refers to when they joined something else, maybe the Big East or another conference.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, there's a column called \"joined\" with years like 1991, 1993, etc. So each row has a year when they joined some group. The claim is about five out of six institutions from the Great Midwest Conference joining in 1991.\n\nI need to identify which institutions are part of the Great Midwest Conference first. But the table doesn't specify that. However, looking at the data, I can list all the universities and their \"joined\" year.\n\nLet me extract each row's information:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: bears nickname \"bearcats.\" Joined in 1991.\n2. University of Dayton: flies, joined 1993.\n3. DePaul University: blue demons, joined 1991.\n4. Marquette University: golden eagles, joined 1991.\n5. University of Memphis: tigers, joined 1991.\n6. Saint Louis University: billikens, joined 1991.\n\nSo all six have \"joined\" year as 1991 except Dayton which is 1993.\n\nWait, but the claim says five out of six in the Great Midwest Conference joined in 1991. But according to this table, all six (excluding Dayton) joined in 1991? Wait no: the table shows that six universities have \"joined\" years as follows:\n\n- Cincinnati: 1991\n- Dayton: 1993\n- DePaul: 1991\n- Marquette: 1991\n- Memphis: 1991\n- Saint Louis: 1991\n\nSo five of them joined in 1991, and one (Dayton) did not\u2014joined in 1993. But the claim says \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the Great Midwest Conference is a specific group. Maybe these six universities are all part of it, and five joined in 1991. But looking at their \"joined\" column, yes, five (Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, Saint Louis) joined in 1991, while Dayton joined in 1993.\n\nSo the claim is saying that five out of six in the Great Midwest Conference joined in 1991, which seems correct based on the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut I need to make sure about the column names and row indices. The relevant columns would be \"nickname\" and \"joined.\" Wait, no: the claim is about when they joined the conference. So the \"joined\" column is relevant, specifically their year.\n\nWait, but the claim is that five of them joined in 1991, so I need to identify which rows have \"joined\" as 1991.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Cincinnati, joined 1991 \u2192 relevant\nRow 1: Dayton, joined 1993 \u2192 not relevant\nRow 2: DePaul, joined 1991 \u2192 relevant\nRow 3: Marquette, joined 1991 \u2192 relevant\nRow 4: Memphis, joined 1991 \u2192 relevant\nRow 5: Saint Louis, joined 1991 \u2192 relevant\n\nSo rows 0,2,3,4,5 have \"joined\" as 1991. That's five institutions.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because exactly five out of six in the Great Midwest Conference joined in 1991.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we first identify which cells are relevant to verifying it. The claim concerns the year each institution joined the conference and specifically focuses on when five out of six institutions joined in 1991.\n\n**Relevant Columns:**\n- **\"joined\"**: This column provides the year each university joined a group, likely the Great Midwest Conference.\n  \n**Relevant Rows:**\n- Each row represents an institution with their respective \"joined\" year. We need to check the \"joined\" value for each row.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Row 0 (University of Cincinnati)**: Joined in 1991 \u2192 Relevant\n2. **Row 1 (University of Dayton)**: Joined in 1993 \u2192 Not relevant (joined later)\n3. **Row 2 (DePaul University)**: Joined in 1991 \u2192 Relevant\n4. **Row 3 (Marquette University)**: Joined in 1991 \u2192 Relevant\n5. **Row 4 (University of Memphis)**: Joined in 1991 \u2192 Relevant\n6. **Row 5 (Saint Louis University)**: Joined in 1991 \u2192 Relevant\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are five institutions (Rows 0,2,3,4,5) that joined the conference in 1991. The claim is therefore TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions provided.\n\nThe claim is: \"3 of the members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the number of universities in the Great Midwest Conference (GMC) that were established before 1860. The task is to check if at least three such institutions existed before this cutoff year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several universities with details like institution name, nickname, location, founding year, type, enrollment, joined, and left. However, I notice that the table doesn't explicitly mention which conference each university belongs to. The term \"Great Midwest Conference\" isn't directly mentioned in any of the cells.\n\nThis is a problem because without knowing which universities are part of the GMC, it's impossible to verify whether three were founded before 1860. The claim assumes these are members, but there's no data in the table to confirm that. Therefore, even if I check each university's founding year, without knowing their conference affiliation, the answer cannot be definitively TRUE or FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, looking at each university's founding year:\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819 (before 1860)\n- University of Dayton: 1850 (after 1860)\n- DePaul University: 1898 (after 1860)\n- Marquette University: 1881 (after 1860)\n- University of Memphis: 1912 (after 1860)\n- Saint Louis University: 1818 (before 1860)\n\nSo, among the listed universities, only two (University of Cincinnati and Saint Louis University) were founded before 1860. This means even if all of them were in the GMC, there are only two, which is less than three.\n\nHowever, since it's unclear whether these are indeed members of the GMC, the claim cannot be fully supported or refuted with the given data.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the University of Cincinnati having 27,572 more student enrollments than Saint Louis University is true. Let me start by carefully looking at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows correspond to the universities mentioned in the claim. The University of Cincinnati is listed as the first row (row_index: 0), and Saint Louis University is the sixth row (row_index: 5). That's important because I need to extract the correct enrollment numbers from these rows.\n\nNext, I'll look at the columns. The relevant column here is \"enrollment\" since the claim is about student enrollments. So for each university, I need to find their respective \"enrollment\" values.\n\nLooking at row 0 for the University of Cincinnati, the enrollment number is 41,357. For Saint Louis University in row 5, the enrollment number is 13,785. \n\nNow, let's do the math. The claim states that Cincinnati has 27,572 more students than Saint Louis. So I'll subtract the enrollment numbers: 41,357 minus 13,785 equals... let me calculate that. 41,357 minus 13,785. Hmm, 41,357 minus 10,000 is 31,357, and then minus another 3,785 would be 27,572 exactly. So the subtraction checks out.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the \"enrollment\" column for both universities:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 41,357\n- Saint Louis University: 13,785\n\nCalculating the difference: 41,357 - 13,785 = 27,572.\n\nThis confirms the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim is: \"only 1 institution in the state of ohio be a member of the great midwest conference.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the 'location' column to see which institutions are based in Ohio. Scanning through each row:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: Cincinnati, Ohio\n- University of Dayton: Dayton, Ohio\n- DePaul University: Chicago, Illinois (not Ohio)\n- Marquette University: Milwaukee, Wisconsin (not Ohio)\n- University of Memphis: Memphis, Tennessee (not Ohio)\n- Saint Louis University: St. Louis, Missouri (not Ohio)\n\nSo, from the table, only two institutions are in Ohio: University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton.\n\nNow, checking their membership in the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). Since the claim specifies that only one institution in Ohio is a member, I need to verify how many GMC members are in Ohio.\n\nLooking at each institution:\n\n1. **University of Cincinnati**: They are listed as Bearcats with an enrollment figure. However, I don't see their conference affiliation directly here. But from general knowledge, I know the University of Cincinnati is part of the American Athletic Conference (AAC), not the Great Midwest Conference.\n\n2. **University of Dayton**: Their nickname is Flyers, and they have been members of the Atlantic 10 Conference since 1991. They were part of the GMC prior to that but switched conferences in 1991.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The table shows both institutions as being founded before 1850, with Dayton being private and Cincinnati public. But I'm not sure about their current conference memberships. \n\nHowever, based on the provided data, the table doesn't explicitly state which conference each institution is part of beyond showing enrollment numbers. So perhaps the claim refers to historical membership.\n\nIf the Great Midwest Conference was active during the time periods when these universities were members, then only one might still be in it now. But I'm not certain without more information.\n\nWait, the table shows that both joined in 1991 and left in 1995. That suggests they were part of a conference during those years. If both left around the same time, perhaps after 1995, they might have switched conferences or dissolved the membership.\n\nBut the key point is whether only one institution from Ohio is currently a member of the Great Midwest Conference. Since both Cincinnati and Dayton left by 1995, if they're still members elsewhere, it's unclear. However, based on current standings, I think neither are part of the GMC anymore, as most universities have moved to other conferences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is reflecting their membership in the early '90s, so during that time, both were part of GMC, which would mean more than one institution from Ohio was a member then. Thus, the claim's assertion that only one is now a member might be incorrect based on historical data.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the table indicates their current status or past membership. The 'joined' and 'left' columns show 1991-1995, which suggests they were part of the conference during that time. If both left, then neither is currently a member. Therefore, maybe the claim is correct because only one (or none) remains in the conference.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 1 institution\" is a member now. So if both left, perhaps another took their place or they're not part of GMC anymore. If no institutions from Ohio are in GMC now, then the claim would be FALSE because it's saying one exists. But if only one remains, it could be TRUE.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me approach this step by step.\n\n1. Identify all Ohio institutions in the table: University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton.\n2. Determine their membership in the Great Midwest Conference (GMC) based on the data provided.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **University of Cincinnati**: Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\n- **University of Dayton**: Also joined in 1991, left in 1995.\n\nSo both were members during that time. However, after leaving, they might have joined other conferences. For example, the University of Cincinnati is now part of the AAC, while the University of Dayton is in the Atlantic 10 Conference.\n\nTherefore, currently, neither institution is part of the Great Midwest Conference anymore. So if the claim says only one is a member now, that's incorrect because neither are. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table might be showing their membership up until 1995 when they left. If the Great Midwest Conference was dissolved or restructured around then, perhaps only one of them stayed, but from what I know, both left, so no institution from Ohio remains in GMC now.\n\nTherefore, the claim that only one institution in Ohio is a member of the GMC is FALSE because currently, neither are members anymore.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists two institutions based in Ohio: University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton. Both joined and later left the Great Midwest Conference between 1991 and 1995. Currently, neither is part of the GMC, making the claim incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It states that all six universities in the table joined the Great Midwest Conference simultaneously in 1991. To verify this, I should check each institution's joining year and see if they all joined in 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with various details, including their \"joined\" year.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim. The claim is: \"only private institutions be member of the great midwest conference.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that only private colleges or universities are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). So, I need to check each institution listed in the table and see if they are part of the GMC and whether they are all private.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several institutions: University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, DePaul University, Marquette University, University of Memphis, and Saint Louis University. Each row has details including their type (public or private).\n\nThe relevant columns here are \"nickname\" and \"type.\" The nickname might be a clue as to whether they're part of a conference, but the important factor is the institution's type\u2014whether it's public or private.\n\nI know that conferences like the GMC often include both public and private institutions. For example, the University of Cincinnati is a public member, while DePaul and Marquette are private. So if the claim says only private institutions are members, that seems incorrect because some public ones are also in the conference.\n\nWait, but I should double-check whether all the listed institutions in the table are indeed part of the GMC. Let's go through each one:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Public. I think they are a member of the American Athletic Conference (AAC) now, not the GMC. So maybe this is an older data point.\n\n2. University of Dayton: Private. They might be in the GMAA or another conference, not sure about GMC.\n\n3. DePaul University: Private. Possibly in the Big East or another conference.\n\n4. Marquette University: Private. They're part of the Big East as well.\n\n5. University of Memphis: Public. Again, probably in the AAC now, not GMC.\n\n6. Saint Louis University: Private. Maybe in the GMAA or somewhere else.\n\nSo, if the claim is that only private institutions are in the GMC, but some public ones like Cincinnati and Memphis might be there too, then the claim is false because it's not true that only private institutions are members.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the 'joined' and 'left' columns, but those seem to refer to the years the institution joined the conference or left, which isn't directly related here.\n\nAnother approach: does the table provide information on which conferences each institution is part of? The 'nickname' might suggest sports teams, but not necessarily the conference. So without that info, I can only rely on 'type.'\n\nSince some institutions in the table are public (Cincinnati, Memphis) and others are private (Dayton, DePaul, Marquette, St. Louis), the claim that only private are members is false because public ones may also be part of the GMC.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would be all rows where 'type' is 'private' or 'public' to show both types exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "more than half of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"More than half of the members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what the Great Midwest Conference consists of. Looking at the table, I see institutions like University of Cincinnati, Dayton, Depaul, Marquette, Memphis, and Saint Louis. So these are likely the members.\n\nNext, the claim is about more than half having been founded before 1860. So I need to check each institution's founding year. Let me list them out:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819\n- University of Dayton: 1850\n- Depaul University: 1898\n- Marquette University: 1881\n- University of Memphis: 1912\n- Saint Louis University: 1818\n\nNow, let's count how many were founded before 1860. \n\n- 1819 (UC) is before.\n- 1850 (UDayton) is just in 1850, which is the year 1860? Wait, 1850 is less than 1860, so yes, it counts.\n- 1898, 1881, 1912, and 1818 are all after or before depending. 1818 (SLU) is before.\n\nSo counting those:\n\nUC: 1819 - before\nUDayton: 1850 - before\nSLU: 1818 - before\n\nThat's three institutions.\n\nNow, how many total members? There are six in the table, assuming these six are all. So half of six is three, and more than half would require four or more. Here we have only three before 1860. \n\nSo the claim says more than half (which would be at least four) were founded before 1860. Since only three did, the statement is false.\n\nNow, to find relevant cells: which columns are needed? The \"founded\" year is in the table as \"founded\" column, so for each row, that cell is relevant. So for each institution, their row index and the 'founded' column name.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be all rows with their respective 'row_index' and 'column_name' set to 'founded'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
