The claim is: \"equestrian at the asian game have been located in a different city every year that it occurs.\"\n\nFirst, I'll examine the table structure. It has columns for year, location, gold, silver, bronze. Each row represents a different year from 1982 to 2010.\n\nThe key point of the claim is whether each occurrence of the Asian Games was held in a different city every year. So, I need to check if each subsequent year's location is unique compared to previous years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nEach of these locations is different from the previous ones. So, every year the Asian Games took place in a new city. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n\nNext, I'll identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim is about the location changing each year, the relevant column is \"location\". The row index starts at 0 for 1982 up to 6 for 2010.\n\nSo, all rows have their location in the second column (index 1).

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Equestrian at the Asian Game happen every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for in 1990.\" Hmm, I need to verify if there's an equestrian event at every Asian Games held every four years starting from 1982 up until 2010, skipping 1990.\n\nFirst, I should check the table provided. The table lists years ranging from 1982 to 2010, with locations and medalists for gold, silver, and bronze. So each row represents an instance of the Asian Games in a particular year.\n\nI need to look at the 'location' column because the claim is about which cities hosted these games. Let me list out the years and their respective locations:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nWait, but according to the table, there's a game in 1990? No, actually, looking at the table, the years listed are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. There is no entry for 1990. So maybe the claim is suggesting that there was a game in 1990 but it's missing from the table.\n\nBut wait, the user provided the table, which goes up to 2010. The claim says \"from 1982 to 2010,\" so perhaps it includes all years between those, every four years. However, looking at the table, the games are in 1982, then next is 1986 (4 years later), but after that, 1994 is 8 years later, which breaks the 4-year cycle. So maybe there's a gap.\n\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\n- 1982\n- Next should be 1986 (correct)\n- Then 1990 would follow, but in the table, it jumps to 1994.\n- So perhaps the Asian Games were held in 1982, 1986, then skipped 1990 and had 1994.\n\nIf that's the case, the claim is saying that they happen every four years except in 1990. But looking at the table, there's no 1990 event. So does that mean it didn't occur? Or maybe it did but isn't listed here?\n\nBut the user provided a specific table from 1982 to 2010. So according to this data, the Asian Games were held in 1982, 1986 (4 years later), then 1994 (8 years later), and so on.\n\nSo the claim is stating that they happen every four years starting from 1982 to 2010, except for 1990. But based on the table, the games didn't occur in 1990 because the next one after 1986 was 1994. So the relevant cells would be those where the year is not 1990 but follows a four-year interval.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim says that equestrian events happen every four years from 1982 to 2010, except in 1990. So they should occur in 1982, 1986, 1990 (skipped), 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nBut according to the table, there's no event in 1990, so that year is skipped. Therefore, the claim is correct because they don't happen in 1990 but continue every four years otherwise.\n\nSo I need to check each row for the relevant columns. The claim refers to the equestrian event, which is likely the gold medalists or perhaps a specific category. But in the table, 'gold' is listed as the name of the athlete who won the gold medal in that year's equestrian event.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all rows where the location corresponds to the claim, specifically for years 1982, 1986, 1994, etc., except 1990. But since 1990 isn't in the table, we can assume it's skipped.\n\nWait, but looking back, the table starts from 1982 and goes up by four years: 1982, 86, then 94 (8 years later). So the event didn't happen in 90, which aligns with the claim that it skips 1990. Therefore, all rows from 1982 to 2010 are relevant except for 1990.\n\nWait no, because the table only includes up to 2010, and each row represents a year where the Asian Games were held. So the equestrian events happened in those years: 82,86,94,98,02,06,10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is saying that they happen every four years from 1982 to 2010 except for 1990. But since 1990 isn't included, the pattern holds as the events are held every four years, skipping 1990.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all rows in the table because each row's location and year are part of the claim's consideration. However, perhaps only the 'location' column is necessary to check if it aligns with the games being held there, but I think the main point is about the years.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about the timing (every four years) except 1990. So the relevant cells would be the ones that confirm that in each of those years, an event occurred, which are all the rows provided because they show that the events happened in 1982,86,94,98,02,06,10, missing only 90.\n\nThus, to verify, we need to check the location and year columns for each relevant row.\n\nSo, I should list all the years from 1982 up to 2010, which are included in the table. Each of these rows represents a year where an equestrian event occurred, so they support the claim that events happened every four years except 1990.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the 'Year' and 'Location' columns because they show that each event was held as per the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to verify that the equestrian events occurred every four years from 1982 to 2010, excluding 1990. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: All rows in the table represent years when an equestrian event took place: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n2. **Exclude 1990**: The absence of a row for 1990 indicates that no event occurred that year.\n3. **Pattern Verification**: The events occur every four years (except in 1990), aligning with the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe equestrian events took place as follows, confirming they occurred every four years except in 1990:\n\n- **1982**: [Year, Location]\n- **1986**: [Year, Location]\n- **1994**: [Year, Location]\n- **1998**: [Year, Location]\n- **2002**: [Year, Location]\n- **2006**: [Year, Location]\n- **2010**: [Year, Location]\n\nEach row supports the claim, with 1990 being the only year skipped.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010}",

The claim is that \"nadia al - moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the asian game.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's any occurrence where Nadia Al-Moutawaa won gold. The table has entries from 1982 to 2010. Let me go row by row.\n\nLooking at the first row (row index 0), under 'gold' column, it says \"nadia al - moutawaa.\" So that's a match\u2014she won gold in 1982. Now I need to check if she was the first person to do so.\n\nI'll continue scanning the other rows to see if any other equestrian gold winners are present before her. Since all other years listed (1986,1994, etc.) come after 1982, there's no one else winning gold in equestrian before her in that column. So she was indeed the first.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have been different in every year they have occurred.\" So, it's stating that each year, a different person won the gold medal in the equestrian event.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns for year, location, gold, silver, bronze. The key here is to check the 'gold' column for each relevant year and see if there are any repetitions.\n\nI should list out all the years provided: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010. Each of these corresponds to a different Asian Games host city.\n\nNow, I'll go through each year and note down the gold medalist:\n\n- 1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa\n- 1986: Takashi Tomura\n- 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- 1998: Jin Kanno\n- 2002: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski\n- 2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi\n- 2010: Ramzy Al-Duhami\n\nLooking at these names, they are all distinct. Each year has a unique gold medalist without any repeats.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that in every year, the gold medalist was different, which is true based on this data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells. The relevant columns are 'year' and 'gold'. For each row, both these columns are important because they tie the specific medalist to that particular year.\n\nSo, for every row (from 0 to 6), both the 'row_index' and the 'column_name' should be included in the relevant_cells list.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul and doha (and incheon , but that be only find elsewhere on the source page).\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim is saying. It's about South Korea hosting the Asian Games with equestrian events more than once\u2014specifically mentioning Seoul and Doha, and also noting Incheon as another location but stating it can only be found elsewhere in the source page.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and location of the Asian Games. The columns are for gold, silver, and bronze medals, which probably relates to participants or winners from specific countries. \n\nI need to check if South Korea is listed as the host country more than once in the given years. From the table:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nI see that in 1986, the location is Seoul. In 2006, it's Doha. There's no South Korea listed as the host beyond these two instances. So, does this mean South Korea hosted twice? Wait, but I thought South Korea hosts more often.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"south korea\" which might be a typo for \"South Korea.\" But in the table, all locations are explicitly given, and I don't see South Korea listed as the host beyond Seoul and Doha. However, Incheon is another city in South Korea, but it's not mentioned here. The claim also says that Incheon can only be found elsewhere on the source page, which might imply that Incheon is a previous host not covered here.\n\nBut in the table provided, South Korea (as Seoul) hosted in 1986 and Doha in 2006. Wait, no\u2014Doha is Qatar, right? So maybe there's confusion here because Doha is a different country from South Korea. So perhaps the claim is mixing up countries with similar-sounding names.\n\nWait, the locations listed are New Delhi (India), Seoul (South Korea), Hiroshima (Japan), Bangkok (Thailand), Busan (South Korea), Doha (Qatar), and Guangzhou (China). So South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul) and again in 2002 (Busan). Wait, no\u2014Busan is also a city in South Korea. So the table shows South Korea hosting in 1986 and 2002.\n\nWait, but looking back: The years are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010. For 1986, it's Seoul; 2002 is Busan (South Korea). So that's two times for South Korea.\n\nBut the claim says \"more than 1 time,\" so twice would qualify. However, the claim also mentions Incheon but notes it can only be found elsewhere on the source page. Since Incheon isn't in this table, perhaps it's referring to previous instances not listed here.\n\nWait, but the user provided a specific table from 1982 to 2010. So within this table, South Korea hosted in Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). That's two times. The claim says \"more than 1 time,\" so technically TRUE because it's twice. However, the claim mentions Incheon as another location but not present here, which might imply that the user is considering other sources beyond this table.\n\nBut according to the table given, South Korea has hosted more than once\u2014specifically in Seoul and Busan. So the claim would be TRUE if it's about hosting more than once in the given context. However, the mention of Incheon adds confusion because Incheon is a city in South Korea but not listed here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:\n\n1. South Korea as host: Yes, in Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). So that's two times.\n2. Locations mentioned: Seoul and Doha. But Doha is Qatar, so maybe the claim is mixing up countries.\n\nWait, the claim says \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul and doha.\" So it's saying South Korea (as Seoul) and Doha (Qatar). But Doha is a different country. That part might be incorrect because Doha is not South Korea.\n\nBut the table shows that South Korea hosted twice, but also other countries like Japan, China, India, Thailand, etc., each hosted once. So the claim's main point is about South Korea hosting more than once, which is TRUE based on the table, despite the mention of Doha which might be a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant to refer only to Seoul and Busan as hosts from South Korea, but included Doha by mistake. So overall, based on the table provided, South Korea has hosted twice, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically in Seoul and Doha (and Incheon, which is elsewhere). \n\nFrom the table:\n- **1986**: Seoul (South Korea)\n- **2002**: Busan (South Korea)\n\nThus, South Korea has indeed hosted twice within the provided data. The mention of Doha might be a mistake as it's a separate country. Therefore, based on the table, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Equestrian at the Asian Game happen every 4 years from 1982 to 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that Equestrian events took place at the Asian Games every four years starting in 1982 and ending in 2010. So, I should check if there are equestrian events listed for each of those years: 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006. Wait, wait, the table goes up to 2010. So actually, it's every four years from 1982 (including that year) through 2010.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has a 'year' column which seems to represent the specific Asian Games year. The relevant columns for the claim are 'gold', 'silver', and 'bronze', as these indicate that there were equestrian events held in those years.\n\nLet me check each of the relevant years:\n\n1982: Yes, the table has a row for 1982 with gold, silver, and bronze medalists. So, equestrian events happened here.\n1986: There's a row for 1986 with gold, silver, bronze. So yes.\n1990: Wait, looking at the table, after 1986 comes 1994. Hmm, there's no row for 1990. That might be a problem because the claim says every four years starting from 1982, which would include 1986, 1990, 1994, etc. So if 1990 isn't in the table, that breaks the continuity.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the table. The rows given are for 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. So from 1982 to 2010, the equestrian events were in these specific years: every four years except for skipping 1990, 1994 is included. Wait, no, it's not every four years because from 1982 to 1986 is four years, but then next would be 1990, which isn't present, so the next is 1994, which is a gap of two years. So that breaks the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. From 1982, adding four years each time: 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, etc. But in the table, after 1986 comes 1994, skipping 1990 and 1991-93. That's a problem because it means there was no Asian Games in those missing years, so equestrian events didn't happen every four years as claimed.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check for each of those years: 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006. Let's list them:\n\n- 1982: Yes\n- 1986: Yes\n- 1990: No row in the table. So no equestrian events that year.\n- 1994: Yes\n- 1998: Yes\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2006: Yes\n- 2010: Yes\n\nSo, the presence of 1990 is missing, which breaks the every-four-year pattern from 1982 onwards. Therefore, the claim that equestrian events happened every four years from 1982 to 2010 is incorrect because there's a gap in 1990.\n\nBut wait another thought: maybe the Asian Games are held every four years, but not necessarily every year with equestrian events. However, the claim specifically says \"equestrian at the asian game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010.\" So it's implying that each of those years had equestrian events.\n\nGiven that 1990 is missing, the claim isn't fully supported because not every four-year interval has an event. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are all the rows where there were equestrian medals (gold, silver, bronze), as they show that the events happened in those years except for 1990.\n\nWait, but I need to check whether each year from 1982 to 2010 has an equestrian event. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1982: Yes\n- 1986: Yes\n- 1994: Yes (next after 1986 is 1994, skipping 1990)\n- 1998: Yes\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2006: Yes\n- 2010: Yes\n\nSo from 1982, the next four years would be 1986, then 1990, but 1990 isn't present. So the pattern is not consistent every four years as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's a missing year (1990) in between.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that equestrian events occurred every four years from 1982 to 2010 is false due to the absence of an event in 1990. The relevant cells are those where equestrian medals were awarded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games have been located in a different city every year that it occurs except 1994 and 1998.\" So, the claim is saying that each year the Asian Games were held, the equestrian events took place in a new city, except for 1994 and 1998, where they stayed in the same city.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I see it lists the years from 1982 to 2010. Each row represents a different year, along with the location of the gold, silver, and bronze medals. Wait, actually, the columns are 'year', 'location', 'gold', 'silver', 'bronze'. So for each year, there's a specific location where the equestrian events (assuming that's what the table is about) took place.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the equestrian events being located in different cities every year except 1994 and 1998. That means I need to check whether, except for those two years, each subsequent event was held in a new city compared to the previous year.\n\nLet me list out the locations with their respective years:\n\n1982 - New Delhi\n1986 - Seoul\n1994 - Hiroshima\n1998 - Bangkok\n2002 - Busan\n2006 - Doha\n2010 - Guangzhou\n\nNow, I'll compare each consecutive pair to see if they are in different cities.\n\nStarting from 1982: \n- Next is 1986 (Seoul) \u2013 different from New Delhi.\n- Then 1994: Seoul to Hiroshima? Yes, that's a change.\nWait, but the claim says except 1994 and 1998. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again.\n\nThe claim states that every year the Asian Games occur, the equestrian events are in a different city except for 1994 and 1998. So, all years should have new locations except those two.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\nFrom 1982 to 1986: different.\n1986 to 1994: different (Seoul to Hiroshima).\n1994 to 1998: same? No, because in the table, 1994 is Hiroshima and 1998 is Bangkok. So that's a change.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says except 1994 and 1998, so perhaps those two years had the same location as the previous year.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n1982: New Delhi\n1986: Seoul (different from 1982)\n1994: Hiroshima (different from 1986)\n1998: Bangkok (different from 1994)\n2002: Busan (different from 1998)\n2006: Doha (different from 2002)\n2010: Guangzhou (different from 2006)\n\nWait, so in this list, every year is a different city than the previous one. But the claim says except for 1994 and 1998, implying that those two years were same as before.\n\nBut according to the table:\n\n1982, 1986, 1994, 1998: each subsequent year has a different location.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because it suggests that in 1994 and 1998, the equestrian events stayed in the same city as before. But according to the data, both years have changed cities.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding which events are being referred to. The table shows 'gold', 'silver', 'bronze' winners, which might be for different sports or categories. Perhaps the claim is specifically about equestrian events, so maybe only certain columns (like bronze) relate to that sport.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the same location listed in the 'location' column. So if the claim is about the equestrian events being located in a different city every year except 1994 and 1998, then perhaps the 'location' refers to where the Asian Games as a whole are held, not individual sports.\n\nBut regardless of that, according to the table, each location is unique per row. So if the claim is about the equestrian events (assuming they're in the same column as others), but maybe the locations for equestrian are different except 1994 and 1998.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that the claim says \"equestrian at the Asian Game have been located in a different city every year that it occurs except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nSo, looking for whether each occurrence of the equestrian event was in a new city every year, except for two instances: 1994 and 1998.\n\nIf I consider 'equestrian' as one of the events (like bronze), then perhaps the location is consistent with that event across years. Let's check the bronze column:\n\n1982 - Bariaa salem al - sabbah (New Delhi)\n1986 - Ryuzo Okuno (Seoul)\n1994 - Natya Chantrasmi (Hiroshima)\n1998 - Quzier Ambak Fathil (Bangkok)\n2002 - Tadayoshi Hayashi (Busan)\n2006 - Joo Jung-Hyun (Doha)\n2010 - Khaled al - eid (Guangzhou)\n\nLooking at the bronze winners' locations:\n\n1982: New Delhi\n1986: Seoul \u2013 different from 1982.\n1994: Hiroshima \u2013 different from 1986.\n1998: Bangkok \u2013 different from 1994.\n2002: Busan \u2013 different from 1998.\n2006: Doha \u2013 different from 2002.\n2010: Guangzhou \u2013 different from 2006.\n\nSo the bronze winners were in different cities each year, except maybe if any repeat occurs. Wait, but no repeats here. So according to this data, every year's bronze winner was in a different city, meaning that equestrian events (if that's what we're tracking) were moving each time, so the claim would be incorrect because it says only two exceptions.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which event is being referred to as \"equestrian\". Maybe not bronze but another column. Let me check the 'bronze' column again:\n\n1982: Bariaa salem al - sabbah (New Delhi)\n1994: Natya Chantrasmi (Hiroshima)\n2006: Joo Jung-Hyun (Doha)\n\nWait, no repeats in their locations either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'location' refers to where the Asian Games were held as a whole, which might have different hosts each time. So if that's the case, then all host cities are unique, so the claim is wrong because it suggests only two changes, but actually, every year was a new city.\n\nBut perhaps the user means that within the Asian Games, certain equestrian events were held in the same venue as previous years except for 1994 and 1998. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps I should look back at the original task: to determine whether the statement is true based on the table provided.\n\nThe user states that \"the equestrian events at the Asian Games have been held in different locations every year except for 1994 and 1998.\" Based on the data:\n\n- 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010.\n\nEach of these years has a unique location. So the claim that they've been held in different locations every year is actually true because each occurrence was in a new city. Therefore, there are no two consecutive years where equestrian events were held in the same location, except perhaps none at all. Wait, but if the statement says \"except for 1994 and 1998,\" that would imply that those two years had the same location as previous ones.\n\nBut according to the data, 1994 was Hiroshima, following Seoul (1986), so different. Then 1998: Bangkok, different from Hiroshima. So no repeats there either.\n\nSo perhaps the user's claim is incorrect because it suggests that in 1994 and 1998, the events were held in the same location as before, but according to the table, they weren't.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:\n\n- If 'equestrian' refers to a specific event (like bronze), then each year's winner is from a different city than the previous year. So every year was new, meaning no exceptions as per the claim.\n\nBut the user says except 1994 and 1998, which suggests that in those years, the equestrian events were held in the same location as before.\n\nBut according to the data:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul (different)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (different from 1986)\n- 1998: Bangkok (different from 1994)\n- So no, they didn't stay in the same location in 1994 or 1998.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there are no two consecutive years where the equestrian events were held in the same location except perhaps none. Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that \"the equestrian events at the Asian Games have been held in different locations every year except for 1994 and 1998\" is incorrect. Based on the provided data:\n\n- **1982**: New Delhi\n- **1986**: Seoul (Different from 1982)\n- **1994**: Hiroshima (Different from 1986)\n- **1998**: Bangkok (Different from 1994)\n- **2002**: Busan (Different from 1998)\n- **2006**: Doha (Different from 2002)\n- **2010**: Guangzhou (Different from 2006)\n\nEach year's equestrian event was held in a unique location, with no instances where the same location was used consecutively. Therefore, there are no exceptions as stated; all years had different locations.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time, in Seoul twice.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that South Korea is the sole country that has hosted the equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically mentioning that they did so twice in Seoul.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various years, locations, gold medalists, silver, and bronze winners. The relevant columns for this claim are 'year' and 'location', as well as perhaps 'country' if it were explicitly listed, but it seems location is used to denote the host city, which implies the country.\n\nThe key points I need to check:\n1. South Korea has hosted the Asian Games more than once.\n2. They hosted equestrian events in Seoul twice.\n\nFrom the table, let's look for rows where the 'location' is Seoul because that's the city associated with South Korea. Scanning through the 'location' column:\n\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nWait, in the table provided, I don't see a row with location Seoul beyond 1986. Let me double-check each row:\n\n1. 1982: New Delhi\n2. 1986: Seoul\n3. 1994: Hiroshima\n4. 1998: Bangkok\n5. 2002: Busan\n6. 2006: Doha\n7. 2010: Guangzhou\n\nSo only one instance where the location is Seoul, which is in 1986. That's just once. The claim says South Korea hosted equestrian events in Seoul twice. But from the table, there's only one occurrence of Seoul hosting.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other country hosts equestrian events more than once. Looking at 'location' column: New Delhi (1982), Seoul (1986), Hiroshima (1994), Bangkok (1998), Busan (2002), Doha (2006), Guangzhou (2010). Each location is unique; no repetition except for Seoul, which only happens once in 1986.\n\nWait, actually, checking the 'year' column, are there any other locations that South Korea might have hosted more than once? No, because each location is a different city, so each represents a single hosting. So South Korea's Seoul hosting is just once.\n\nTherefore, the claim says South Korea hosted equestrian events in Seoul twice, but according to the table, it's only once. That makes the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to check if South Korea hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically in Seoul twice.\n\n1. **Check Hosting Locations**: The 'location' column lists each city where the Asian Games were held.\n2. **South Korea (Seoul) Hosting**: Only one instance of Seoul hosting is found in 1986.\n3. **No Other Countries with Multiple Hostings**: No other location repeats, and South Korea's hosting is only once.\n\nSince the claim states South Korea hosted twice in Seoul but the table shows it hosted only once, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows correspond to the years mentioned in the claim. The claim talks about every year, so all rows are relevant. However, focusing on the \"gold\" column specifically because that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one and check if the gold medalist is different from previous years except for 1994 and 1998 as per the claim.\n\nLooking at the first row (1982), the gold medalist is Nadia Al-Moutawaa. Let's note that down as the starting point.\n\nNext, 1986: Takashi Tomura. Different from 1982, so that's fine.\n\n1994: Konoshin Kuwahara. Now, according to the claim, this should be the same as a previous year except for 94 and 98. Wait, but in 1994, is it the same as any other year before? Let me check previous gold medalists. Before 1994, the last was Takashi Tomura in 1986. So Konoshin Kuwahara is new, which means the claim allows for exceptions only at 94 and 98. But wait, does this fit into that? Hmm.\n\nWait, no. The claim says they have been different except 1994 and 1998. That suggests that in those two years, the gold medalist might be the same as a previous year or not? Or maybe it's saying that only for those years (94 and 98), there is an exception where the gold medalist hasn't changed.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the claim again: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\" So, it's saying that usually, each year has a different gold medalist, but there are exceptions in 1994 and 1998 where this didn't happen.\n\nSo I need to check if in 1994 and 1998, the gold medalist is the same as any previous years. Let me check:\n\nLooking at 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara. Before that, in 1986, it was Takashi Tomura. So different from all before, meaning 1994 should have a new name, which it does. Wait, but according to the claim, 94 and 98 are exceptions where the gold medalist hasn't changed? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says that except for 1994 and 1998, every year has had a different gold medalist. So in 1994 and 1998, perhaps the gold medalist didn't change from previous years.\n\nBut looking at 1994's gold: Konoshin Kuwahara. Before that, in 1986, it was Takashi Tomura. So they are different. Similarly, for 1998: Jin Kanno. Previous year was 1994: Konoshin. So different again. That means the claim is saying that only those two years (94 and 98) don't have a change, but in reality, both do.\n\nWait, no. Let me see each row:\n\n1982: Nadia\n1986: Takashi (different from 82)\n1994: Konoshin (different from before)\n1998: Jin (different from 94)\n2002: Mikaela (new)\n2006: Ali Yousuf (new)\n2010: Ramzy Al Duhami (new)\n\nSo all years have different gold medalists except maybe none. But the claim says that only 1994 and 1998 are exceptions where they didn't change, but in reality, they did change.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim again. The claim is: \"have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\" So it's saying that for all years except 94 and 98, the gold medalist was different each year. But looking at the data, even in 94 and 98, they are different from previous years.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is stating that in 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists were different as well, but the claim says they haven't been different, which would be false because they have changed each time. So if the claim states that except for those two years, all others have different golds, but since even 94 and 98 are new, then the claim is false.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently: The claim says that except for 1994 and 1998, every other year's gold medalist was different from previous years. So in 1994 and 1998, the gold medalist might have been the same as a prior year.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\n- 1982: Nadia\n- 1986: Takashi (different)\n- 1994: Konoshin (different)\n- 1998: Jin (different)\n- So in all cases, each year's gold is different from the previous ones. Therefore, the claim's statement that only 1994 and 1998 are exceptions where they haven't changed is incorrect because even those years have new gold medalists.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim means that the gold medalist has been the same in both 1994 and 1998 as some prior year. Let me check:\n\nIn 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara. Looking at previous years before that (1982,86), no one repeats yet.\n\nIn 1998: Jin Kanno. Before 94, it was Takashi, so different again. So even in those two years, the gold is new. Therefore, there are no exceptions where the gold didn't change; every year has a different gold medalist.\n\nThus, the claim is saying that except for 1994 and 1998, all other years have had different golds. But actually, including 94 and 98, each year's gold is new. Therefore, the claim is false because even in those two years, the gold was different from prior years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim as the opposite. Let me try again.\n\nThe claim: \"the gold medalists have been different in every year except 1994 and 1998.\" So that would mean:\n\n- In all other years (e.g., 1982,86,2002,06,10), each has a new gold.\n- But in 1994 and 1998, the gold was same as previous.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\n1994: Konoshin Kuwahara. Previous was Takashi in 86, which is different.\n\n1998: Jin Kanno. Previous was Konoshin, so different again.\n\nTherefore, even in 94 and 98, the golds are new. So the claim's statement that only those two years have exceptions where they didn't change is incorrect because they did change.\n\nThus, the correct situation is that every year has a different gold medalist, including 1994 and 1998. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether the statement about the Asian Games' equestrian gold medalists is accurate based on the provided data.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement:**\n   - The claim states that the gold medalist for equestrian events at the Asian Games has changed each year, except in 1994 and 1998, where there was no change (i.e., the same person won both years).\n\n2. **Examining the Data:**\n   - **1982:** Nadia Keamanthalli\n   - **1986:** Takashi Tsukizaki\n   - **1994:** Konoshin Kyuusui\n   - **1998:** Jin Hee Choi\n   - **2002:** Mikaela Hyatt\n   - **2006:** Ali Yousof Al Ajmi\n   - **2010:** Ramzy Al Duhami\n\n3. **Checking for Exceptions (1994 and 1998):**\n   - **1994:** Compared to previous years, Konoshin Kyuusui is a new name; thus, different from any prior winners.\n   - **1998:** Jin Hee Choi is also a new winner, different from both 1986 and 1994.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no instances where the same person won in consecutive Asian Games years (including 1994 and 1998). Each year's gold medalist is distinct.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe statement is false because each year, including 1994 and 1998, has had a different gold medalist. Therefore, there are no exceptions as claimed; every year's winner is unique.",
