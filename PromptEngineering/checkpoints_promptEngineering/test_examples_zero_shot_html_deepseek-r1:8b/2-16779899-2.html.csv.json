    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the result of the game on december 14 , 1986 on week 15 be a loss of 34 - 3.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the claim. It mentions a specific game that took place on December 14, 1986, during week 15. The result is a loss for the team, with a score of 34-3.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided to find the relevant data. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different game.\n\nI need to locate the game that occurred on December 14, 1986, during week 15. So, I'll scan through each row's date until I find one that matches. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: September 7\n- Row 2: September 14\n- Row 3: September 18\n- Row 4: September 28\n- Row 5: October 5\n- Row 6: October 13\n- Row 7: October 19\n- Row 8: October 26\n- Row 9: November 2\n- Row 10: November 9\n- Row 11: November 16\n- Row 12: November 23\n- Row 13: November 30\n- Row 14: December 7\n- Row 15: December 14, 1986 (found!)\n\nSo, row 15 has the date December 14, 1986. \n\nNow, checking the result for that game. The \"result\" column in row 15 is \"l 34 - 3,\" which means a loss with a score of 34-3.\n\nThe opponent in this game is the Cleveland Browns. However, since the claim doesn't specify the team, I can assume it refers to whoever played that game on December 14. \n\nThe attendance for that game was 58062, but that's not relevant here. \n\nSo, comparing the claim with the table: the result matches exactly as a loss of 34-3. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"week 15th's game on december 14 , 1986 be a win of 34 - 3.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific week, with details about the game played that week.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that verify this claim. Let's break it down. The claim mentions \"week 15th,\" so I should look for the row where week is 15. Scanning through the table, week 15 is indeed there. The date for week 15 is December 14, 1986, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, the result of that game is listed as \"l 34 - 3.\" Wait a minute, that's a loss, not a win. So the result doesn't match the claim which says it was a win with a score of 34-3.\n\nAlso, the opponent for week 15 is the Cleveland Browns. The claim doesn't mention the opponent, so I don't think that part affects the truthfulness of the claim directly, unless the opponent's identity was part of the claim, which it isn't here.\n\nSo, focusing on the result: the claim says it was a win (w), but in the table, it's listed as a loss (l). That means the result doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo support this, I need to point out the specific cells that show this discrepancy. The row index for week 15 is 14 (since counting starts at 0). So the relevant cell would be the \"result\" column in row 14.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the result for week 15 was a loss, not a win.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
