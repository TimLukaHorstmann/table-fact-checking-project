    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"game be play between the month of august november\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear at first glance, but breaking it down: \"game be play between the month of august november.\" Maybe it means that games are played in both August and November months? So, I need to check if there are any games listed in August (month 8) and November (month 11). \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details including week number, date, opponent, location, etc. The 'week' column might not be necessary here; instead, I should focus on the 'date' column to determine the month.\n\nI'll go through each row and note the corresponding month based on the 'date'. \n\n- Row 0: august 19 \u2192 August (month 8)\n- Row 1: august 22 \u2192 August\n- Row 2: september 1 \u2192 September (month 9)\n- Row 3: september 5 \u2192 September\n- Row 4: september 13 \u2192 September\n- Row 5: september 20 \u2192 September\n- Row 6: september 27 \u2192 September\n- Row 7: october 4 \u2192 October (month 10)\n- Row 8: october 11 \u2192 October\n- Row 9: october 18 \u2192 October\n- Row 10: october 25 \u2192 October\n- Row 11: november 1 \u2192 November (month 11)\n\nNow, checking for games in August and November:\n\nAugust has rows 0 and 1. November only has row 11.\n\nSo, the claim that games are played between August and November is supported because there are indeed games in both months. \n\nBut wait, does \"between\" mean games happening in both months? Or does it imply something else, like consecutive or something? The table shows games starting from week 1 (August 19) through week 11 (November 1). So, they cover August to November.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are games listed for both August and November.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the argonaut give up 44 point 2 time in the season.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of this claim means. \"Give up 44 point 2\" likely refers to a team giving up 44 points. The phrase \"in the season\" suggests that this happened during a single season.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns like 'final score', which indicates the points scored by and against each team in a game. So, the relevant column here is 'final score'. \n\nNext, I'll go through each row to check if there's any instance where the Argonauts gave up 44 points. The opponents listed are \"rough riders\", \"alouettes\", \"tiger - cats\", etc., so I need to look for games involving these teams where the Argonauts might have been the opposing team.\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column, when the opponent is the Argonauts, their score would be the one given. Wait, no\u2014the table lists the opponents, so if the row is about the Argonauts, then the final score in that row would reflect what they scored and against whom. But actually, each row represents a game where the team listed as 'opponent' played against another team. So, for example, in row 1, the opponent is \"rough riders\", so the other team is playing them.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: Each row represents a game. The first cell is the week number, then date, opponent, location, final score, attendance, and record. So each row is about a specific game. \n\nThe claim says that the Argonauts gave up 44 points in the season. That would mean in some game, they scored against their opponent, but perhaps lost with a high score against them.\n\nWait no, if the Argonauts are giving up 44 points, it means the opposing team scored 44 points against them. So I need to look for a row where the opponent is the Argonauts and the final score shows that the opposing team scored 44 points.\n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see any rows with \"Argonauts\" as the opponent. The opponents listed are \"rough riders\", \"alouettes\", \"tiger - cats\". So maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the Argonauts scoring 44 points against an opponent. Or maybe it's a typo and they meant giving up 44 points in a game. \n\nWait, looking at row 11: November 1, opponent Alouettes, location Varsity Stadium, final score l 44 - 7. The 'l' probably stands for loss. So the Argonauts lost to the Alouettes with a score of 44-7, meaning they scored 7 points and allowed 44.\n\nSo in this row, the Argonauts (opponent is Alouettes) gave up 44 points. Therefore, this specific game, week 11, the Argonauts allowed 44 points against the Alouettes.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be TRUE if it's referring to a single game where they gave up 44 points. But the claim says \"in the season,\" which implies over the entire season. If in any game they allowed 44 points, then perhaps it's considered giving up that many points in the season.\n\nSo yes, there is at least one game where they gave up 44 points, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the argonaut give up 44 point 2 time in the season,\" we look for any game where the Argonauts conceded 44 points. In week 11, against the Alouettes, the final score was l44-7, indicating the Argonauts allowed 44 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"final score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the argonaut play the rough rider in back to back week\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that the Argonauts are playing against the Rough Riders in consecutive weeks. So I need to look for games where these two teams face each other and see if any of those games are back-to-back in terms of their week numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check for matches between Argonauts (also known as the Argos) and Rough Riders (Roughriders). The table's 'opponent' column lists the teams they played against. So, I'm looking for rows where the opponent is either \"Argonaut\" or \"Rough Rider.\"\n\nWait, but in the table, I see entries like \"alouettes,\" \"rough riders,\" and others. Let me check each row:\n\n- Week 1: vs Rough Riders\n- Week 2: vs Alouettes\n- Week 3: vs Tiger-Cats\n- Week 4: vs Alouettes\n- Week 5: vs Rough Riders\n- Week 6: vs Rough Riders\n- Week 7: vs Alouettes\n- Week 8: vs Tiger-Cats\n- Week 9: vs Rough Riders\n- Week 10: vs Rough Riders\n- Week 11: vs Alouettes\n\nWait, I don't see any games where the opponent is Argonauts. Wait, maybe I misread the table. The team in question is probably the Argonauts (since they're called 'Argonaut'), but in the table, the opponents are Rough Riders, Alouettes, Tiger-Cats, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the Argonauts are playing against the Rough Riders. So looking for when both teams play each other. But from the table, I see:\n\nLooking at each row's opponent and location:\n\nIn Week 1: Argos? Wait no, in the table, week 1 is \"rough riders\" as the opponent. So the home team is playing against the Rough Riders.\n\nWait, maybe the table lists the games of one specific team, like the Argos. So perhaps each row represents a game that the Argons played, and their opponents are listed. If that's the case, then in which weeks did they play the Rough Riders?\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column:\n\n- Week 1: rough riders\n- Week 5: rough riders\n- Week 9: rough riders\n- Week 10: rough riders\n\nSo in week 1, Argos played Rough Riders. Then in week 5, they played again. Are those consecutive weeks?\n\nNo, because between week 1 and week 5 is a gap of 4 weeks. Similarly, week 5 to week 9 is 4 weeks later, and then week 10 is the next. So none are back-to-back.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding which team's schedule this table represents. If it's the Argos' schedule, then they played Rough Riders in weeks 1, 5, 9, 10. The claim is that they played Rough Riders in consecutive weeks. But looking at those weeks: week 1 and 5 are not consecutive; same with others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes all games in a season, not just the Argos' games. So perhaps any game where both teams played each other in back-to-back weeks would be relevant. Let me check for any pair of consecutive weeks where one team is Argons and the next week's opponent is Rough Riders.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Week 1: vs Rough Riders\n- Week 2: vs Alouettes\n- Week 3: vs Tiger-Cats\n- Week 4: vs Alouettes\n- Week 5: vs Rough Riders\n- Week 6: vs Rough Riders\nWait, that's two Rough Riders games in a row, but not Argos playing them. So maybe if the table is for all teams, including both Argos and Roughriders, then I need to check each week where either team played against the other.\n\nBut from the table provided, it seems like the opponents are from other teams (Alouettes, Tiger-Cats), so perhaps this isn't the case. Maybe the table only lists games involving a specific team, like the Argos.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure which team's schedule this is. If it's the Roughriders' schedule, then looking for when they played against Argos would be different weeks. But without knowing, perhaps the best approach is to assume that in the table, each row represents a game involving the team being analyzed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says that Argonauts and Rough Riders played in back-to-back weeks. So looking for two consecutive weeks where they face each other. From the table, I don't see any instances where both teams are playing each other in consecutive weeks. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For example, in week 5 and 6: week 5 opponent is Rough Riders, week 6 is also Rough Riders. So they played two games against Rough Riders in a row, but not back-to-back with each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table shows that Argos played Roughriders on week 1 and then again on week 5, which isn't consecutive. So no instance of back-to-back weeks between them playing each other.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that there are no instances where the Argonauts play the Rough Riders in consecutive weeks based on the provided schedule. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the largest attendance of the season be in the last game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim itself. It states that the largest attendance occurs in the last game of the season. So, to verify this, I need to check two main things: whether the \"attendance\" column has its highest value in the last row and whether that last game is indeed the last one of the season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week, with 'week' as an index. The last row (row 11) corresponds to week 11, which seems to be the latest week in the season. So, if the last game is considered the last game of the season, then checking the attendance for that week could verify the claim.\n\nNext, I'll examine the 'attendance' column across all weeks to see which week has the highest number. However, since the table doesn't specify the total games or the order beyond the given weeks, it's essential to focus on the last game (week 11). The attendance for week 11 is 26813, which needs to be compared against attendances of previous weeks.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' values:\n- Week 1: 18470\n- Week 2: 19492\n- Week 3: 20946\n- Week 4: 22620\n- Week 5: 20166\n- Week 6: 18500\n- Week 7: 16424\n- Week 8: 16583 (two entries for week 8)\n- Week 9: 14313\n- Week 10: 23334\n- Week 11: 26813\n\nThe highest attendance is in week 11, which is indeed the last game. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nHowever, I should also ensure that \"the last game\" refers to the final week of the season and not just any last game in terms of outcome. Since all games after week 10 are considered later weeks, week 11 is the last one, making the claim accurate.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the largest attendance corresponds to the last game (week 11).

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the argonaut lose 7 game in a row during 1 stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's about the Argonauts losing seven games consecutively at some point.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists games from week 1 to week 11, with details like opponent, location, final score, and attendance. The columns relevant here are 'week', 'opponent', 'final score', and perhaps 'record' as well, since it shows the team's performance over weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a stretch where they lost seven games in a row. To do this, I should look for consecutive weeks where their result was a loss (denoted by 'l') without any wins or ties interspersed. Each week's game is listed sequentially, so I can count the number of losses in each week.\n\nLet me go through each row and note the outcome:\n\n- Week 1: Lost (L)\n- Week 2: Won\n- Week 3: Lost\n- Week 4: Lost\n- Week 5: Lost\n- Week 6: Lost\n- Week 7: Lost\n- Week 8: Lost\n- Week 9: Won\n- Week 10: Won\n- Week 11: Lost\n\nNow, let's identify the streaks of losses. \n\nStarting from week 1:\n- Week 1: L (streak = 1)\n- Week 2: W (streak breaks, only 1 loss)\n\nThen weeks 3 to 8 are all losses except for week 9 and 10 which are wins.\n\nSo from week 3 to week 6: 4 losses in a row.\nWeek 7 is another loss, making it 5 consecutive losses.\nWeek 8 is another loss, so that's 6 in a row.\nWait, but the table shows two entries for week 8. The first week 8 on October 11 was a loss, and then another entry on October 13 where they won. So that might complicate things.\n\nSo, week 8: On Oct 11, they lost, making it streak to 6.\nThen on Oct 13, which is also week 8 but the next game, they won. That means only one loss in week 8. Therefore, the consecutive losses from week 3 to week 7 would be:\n\nWeek 3: L\nWeek 4: L (2)\nWeek 5: L (3)\nWeek 6: L (4)\nWeek 7: L (5)\nThen week 8 on Oct 11 is L (6), but then on Oct 13, they won. So the streak would be broken after week 8.\n\nWait, but week 8 appears twice because maybe it's a typo or two games scheduled on different dates for the same week. That might mean that in reality, their performance continued beyond that week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps week 8 is only one game, and the second entry is a correction or an error. But assuming that each week's entry represents a single game, then week 8 would have two games? That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table again: it lists each week once, so for week 8, there are two rows, which might be incorrect because a week shouldn't have two games unless they played twice. But that's probably an error in the data, but perhaps I should proceed as is.\n\nSo, if week 8 has two entries, one on Oct 11 (lost) and another on Oct 13 (won), then for the consecutive losses, the streak would be up to week 7: which is 5 losses. Wait no, let me recount:\n\nFrom week 3 to week 7: each of those weeks resulted in a loss except week 9.\n\nSo from week 3 to week 6: that's 4 weeks lost (weeks 3,4,5,6)\nWeek 7: another loss, making it 5\nThen week 8 on Oct 11: L, so 6\nBut then week 8 again on Oct 13: W, breaking the streak.\n\nSo up to week 8, they had lost 6 games in a row (weeks 3-8). But then they won on week 8 again. That seems like an inconsistency, but perhaps the two entries for week 8 are incorrect, and it's better to consider each week as one game.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that each week is a single game, then week 8 only has one result: lost. So from week 3 to week 7: 5 losses\nWeek 8: L (6)\nThen they won on week 9, breaking the streak at 6.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the claim is about losing 7 in a row. So did they lose 7 consecutive games?\n\nIf we count from week 3 to week 9:\n\nWait no, because week 9 was a win. So let's see:\n\nStarting from week 3: L\nWeek 4: L (2)\nWeek 5: L (3)\nWeek 6: L (4)\nWeek 7: L (5)\nWeek 8: L (6)\nThen Week 9: W (breaks streak)\n\nSo the maximum consecutive losses would be 6, from week 3 to week 8.\n\nBut then, wait, in the table provided, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list each week's outcome with their win/loss:\n\nWeek 1: L\nWeek 2: W\nWeek 3: L\nWeek 4: L\nWeek 5: L\nWeek 6: L\nWeek 7: L\nWeek 8: L (assuming only one entry, so L)\nWeek 9: W\nWeek 10: W\nWeek 11: L\n\nWait no, week 8 on Oct 13 is a win, but if it's the same week as Oct 11, that might be an error. So perhaps I should consider each week once.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFrom week 3 to week 7: L x5\nThen week 8: L (6)\nThen week 9: W\n\nSo they lost 6 in a row, not 7. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's only 6 consecutive losses, not 7.\n\nAlternatively, if considering the two entries for week 8, but that seems unlikely as each week should be one game. So perhaps I need to consider that the maximum streak is 6.\n\nThus, the claim of losing 7 in a row is not fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Argonauts lost up to 6 games consecutively (weeks 3 through 8), but not 7.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I should understand what the claim is stating. It seems to say that the Argonauts and Rough Riders played against each other in a week that wasn't consecutive. So, I need to check if there are any weeks where they faced each other with a non-consecutive gap.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the opponents for each week. The teams mentioned are \"rough riders\" and \"alouettes,\" but not \"argonauts.\" Wait, maybe \"argonauts\" is another name for one of these teams? Let me check the opponent names again. In row 1, it's the Rough Riders playing against the Alouettes. Then in week 2, the Alouettes play against the Tiger-Cats. I don't see any mention of Argonauts here.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake because the claim mentions Argonauts and Rough Riders, but the table only has Alouettes, Rough Riders, Tiger-Cats, etc. Maybe \"Argonauts\" is another name for one of these teams? For example, maybe they're referred to as the Argonauts in some weeks. Let me scan through the opponents again.\n\nWait, in week 1 and 6, the Rough Riders are playing against themselves or others. I don't see any week where both Argonauts and Rough Riders play each other. So, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no evidence of them playing each other at all.

For example, if the Rough Riders are sometimes called Argonauts in different contexts, but looking at the table, it's always referred to as \"rough riders.\" So I think they're distinct teams. Since there's no row where both Argonaut and Rough Rider face each other, the claim can't be true.\n\nAdditionally, even if they did play each other, I need to check if their matchup occurred in non-consecutive weeks.

The instructions also mention that I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It seems to say that a game occurs after November. Looking at the table, each row represents a week and some games occur in weeks beyond November, but others might be in November or earlier. However, the exact wording is \"game be play after november,\" which could mean a game happens after November, not necessarily all games.\n\nNow, I need to check the 'week' column to see if any game takes place after week 11, as November typically ends around week 11. Let me look through each row:\n\n- Week 1: August\n- Week 2: September\n- Week 3: September\n- Week 4: September\n- Week 5: September\n- Week 6: September\n- Week 7: October\n- Week 8: October\n- Week 9: October\n- Week 10: October\n- Week 11: November\n\nSo, week 11 is in November.

So, the last game in the table is week 11 on November 1.\n\nBut does any game occur after November? Week 12 would be after November, but I don't see that in the table. The highest week shown is 11, which is November. Therefore, there's no evidence of a game happening after November based on the given data.\n\nSo, the claim \"game be play after november\" isn't fully supported by the table since all games end in November at week 11.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"game be play after november\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if any games occur after November. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Weeks**: The highest week in the table is week 11, which falls in November. Games in week 11 are considered as happening in November.\n2. **Check for Post-November Games**: There's no entry in the table beyond week 11. Therefore, there are no games recorded after November.\n\nSince all games in the table occur up to and including November (week 11), the claim that a game occurs after November is not supported.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim suggests that a game takes place after November.\n2. **Analyze the Table Data**: Examine each row's 'week' column to determine if any games fall into weeks beyond November.\n3. **Determine Relevant Cells**: Identify cells in the 'week' column where week numbers might indicate games after November.\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the highest week is 11, which is November, and no games are listed for weeks beyond 11, the claim is not supported.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the argonaut give up 44 point only 1 time in the season.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's referring to a team (probably the Argonauts) that gave up 44 points only once during the season. So, I need to check if there's only one instance where they allowed 44 points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details about the game. The columns related to the claim would likely be \"opponent,\" \"final score,\" and possibly \"attendance\" but maybe not that. The key part is the final score, so I should look at the \"final score\" column for each week.\n\nI need to find all the games where the Argonauts (assuming they're the team in question) gave up 44 points. Wait, actually, the opponents listed are Rough Riders, Alouettes, Tiger-Cats, etc., but the team might be referred to as \"Argonauts\" somewhere. Looking at the table, I don't see a specific column for the home team's name. So maybe the claim is about the Argonauts giving up 44 points once.\n\nWait, the opponents are: Rough Riders, Alouettes, Tiger-Cats, etc., but there might be multiple games against each opponent. The \"final score\" includes both teams' scores, so for example, in week 1, it's l 44 - 7, which means the Argonauts scored 7 points and lost to the Rough Riders who scored 44. So here, the Argonauts gave up 44 points.\n\nNow, I need to check how many times this happened. Looking through each row:\n\nWeek 1: l 44 - 7 \u2192 Argonauts gave up 44\nWeek 2: w 15 -14 \u2192 They won, so opponent scored 14\nWeek 3: l 31 -24 \u2192 Opponent scored 31\nWeek 4: l 24 -21 \u2192 Opponent scored 24\nWeek 5: l 17 -14 \u2192 Opponent scored 17\nWeek 6: l 28 -4 \u2192 Opponent scored 28\nWeek 7: l 14 -10 \u2192 Opponent scored 14\nWeek 8: l 28 -15 \u2192 Opponent scored 28\nWeek 9: w 41 -0 \u2192 They won, so opponent scored 0\nWeek 10: w 42 -24 \u2192 They won, opponent scored 24\nWeek 11: l 44 -7 \u2192 Argonauts gave up 44 again\n\nWait a minute, in week 11, it's l 44 -7. So that's another time they allowed 44 points.\n\nSo the claim is that they only gave up 44 once. But from the table, I see at least two instances: week 1 and week 11 where the final score is l 44 - something.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are multiple times they gave up 44 points.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The \"final score\" column needs to be checked for each row. Each occurrence where the Argonauts gave up 44 would be a cell in that column. So I need to find all rows where the final score shows that the opponent scored 44 and it's an away game (but wait, no, the table doesn't specify home or away). Alternatively, perhaps any time the final score is l 44 - x, indicating they gave up 44.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Week 1: l 44-7 \u2192 Arg gives up 44\n- Week 11: l 44-7 \u2192 Again\n\nSo these are two instances. Therefore, relevant cells would be the \"final score\" column for week 1 and week 11.\n\nI need to map this into row indices. The table starts at row index 0 as per the example. Let's count:\n\nRow 0: Week 1\nRow 1: Week 2\n...\nRow 10: Week 11\n\nSo week 1 is row 0, week 11 is row 10.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are in column \"final score\" at row indices 0 and 10.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that the Argonauts gave up 44 points only once during the season, we examine each game's final score. The table shows two instances where the Argonauts allowed 44 points (weeks 1 and 11). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the argonaut win 7 game in a row during 1 stretch",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the Argonaut win 7 game in a row during 1 stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that the Argonauts won 7 games in a row. So I need to look for a sequence where they have seven consecutive wins. The term \"during 1 stretch\" implies that these seven wins happened over a period without any losses in between.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details about the game, including whether it was a win or loss and the final score. I should focus on the 'record' column since it shows the team's performance up to that point. The 'record' seems to be cumulative, listing their wins, losses, and ties in the order they occurred.\n\nI'll go through each week:\n\n1. Week 1: Loss (0-1), so no.\n2. Week 2: Win (1-1). Now, their record is 1-1-0.\n3. Week 3: Loss (1-2).\n4. Week 4: Loss (1-4).\n5. Week 5: Loss (1-5).\n6. Week 6: Loss (1-6).\n7. Week 7: Loss (1-7).\n\nWait, I see that the Argonauts have a win in week 2 and then continue to lose from weeks 3 onwards. That doesn't show seven consecutive wins but rather one win followed by losses.\n\nLooking at the next rows:\n\nWeek 8: They lost again (1-8). Week 9: They won, making their record 3-8. Then week 10: another win (4-8), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the 'record' column. Let me re-examine it. Each entry in the 'record' seems to be the current standing after that week's game. So each row's record is cumulative.\n\nFor example:\n\nWeek 2: After their win against the Alouettes (15-14), their record becomes 1-1-0.\nThen, they lost to the Tiger-Cats, making it 1-2-0 in week 3.\nContinuing to lose, by week 4 it's 1-4-0, and so on.\n\nIn week 9, after winning against the Rough Riders (41-0), their record becomes 3-8-0. Then in week 10, they win again, making it 4-8-0.\n\nWait, that doesn't show seven wins in a row. They have isolated wins but not consecutive ones.\n\nBut wait, let me check from the beginning:\n\nLooking for any point where the team has seven wins in a row. From the table provided, the highest number of consecutive wins seems to be just two (weeks 9 and 10). The 'record' column shows that after each game, their total wins are counted. So week 1: 0, week2:1, week3:1, week4:1, week5:1, week6:1, week7:1, week8:1, week9:2, week10:3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in week2, they had their first win, making it 1-1-0. Then they lost week3 (still 1-2), lost week4 (1-4), lost week5 (1-5), lost week6 (1-6), lost week7 (1-7). So the first win was in week2, and then losses followed.\n\nThen, in week9, they won again, making it 2-8. Then week10: another win, 3-8.\n\nSo their wins are not consecutive but spread out with losses in between. Therefore, there's no stretch where they have seven wins in a row.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the 'record' column. Maybe it's more detailed. Let me check each week:\n\nWeek1: loss (0-1)\nWeek2: win (1-1)\nWeek3: loss (1-2)\nWeek4: loss (1-4)\nWeek5: loss (1-5)\nWeek6: loss (1-6)\nWeek7: loss (1-7)\nWeek8: loss (1-8)\nWeek9: win (2-8)\nWeek10: win (3-8)\nWeek11: loss (4-9)\n\nHmm, so the only time they have multiple wins in a row is weeks 9 and 10. That's two consecutive wins, not seven.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. The claim says \"7 game in a row,\" which could mean seven games without interruption, regardless of when those games occurred. So maybe the Argonauts had seven wins somewhere in their season, not necessarily consecutive weeks.\n\nLooking at the table, by week11, their record is 4-9-0. They have four wins. But that's spread out over the season, with losses in between each win.\n\nSo they never got to seven consecutive wins in a single stretch of games. The maximum number of consecutive wins seems to be two (weeks 9 and10).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the second highest attendance of the season be in the last game\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that the second highest attendance for the season occurs in the last game. So I need to check if the highest and second highest attendances are correctly identified and positioned in the final game.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week with corresponding data. The relevant columns here are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"location\", \"final score\", \"attendance\", and \"record\". For this task, I'm particularly interested in the \"attendance\" column because it relates to the claim.\n\nI need to identify the highest attendance and the second highest attendance from all games listed in the table. Then, check if the second highest is indeed in the last game (game 11). If so, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet me list out the attendances for each week:\n\n- Week 1: 18470\n- Week 2: 19492\n- Week 3: 20946\n- Week 4: 22620\n- Week 5: 20166\n- Week 6: 18500\n- Week 7: 16424\n- Week 8: 16583 (appears twice, once for a loss and once for a win)\n- Week 9: 14313\n- Week 10: 23334\n- Week 11: 26813\n\nNow, let's sort these attendances in descending order to find the top two:\n\n1. Week 3: 20946 (highest)\n2. Week 4: 22620\nWait, actually, no\u2014let me correct that. Let me list them all properly.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each week's attendance:\n\nWeek 1: 18,470\n\nWeek 2: 19,492\n\nWeek 3: 20,946\n\nWeek 4: 22,620\n\nWeek 5: 20,166\n\nWeek 6: 18,500\n\nWeek 7: 16,424\n\nWeek 8 (loss): 16,583 and Week 8 (win): same number.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back at the table:\n\n- Week 8: attendance is 16583 in both rows because there are two games for week 8. So it's correct as is.\n\nThen Week 9: 14,313\n\nWeek 10: 23,334\n\nWeek 11: 26,813 (highest)\n\nSo now, let's list all attendances:\n\n18,470; 19,492; 20,946; 22,620; 20,166; 18,500; 16,424; 16,583; 14,313; 23,334; 26,813.\n\nNow, to find the top two highest attendances:\n\nThe highest is week 11 with 26,813. The next highest would be week 10 at 23,334.\n\nWait, let me confirm: After week 11, the next is week 4 at 22,620, then week 3 at 20,946, week 5 at 20,166, week 10 at 23,334. Wait, no\u2014week 10 is higher than some earlier weeks.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all attendances numerically:\n\n- Week 1: 18,470\n\n- Week 2: 19,492\n\n- Week 3: 20,946\n\n- Week 4: 22,620\n\n- Week 5: 20,166\n\n- Week 6: 18,500\n\n- Week 7: 16,424\n\n- Week 8: 16,583\n\n- Week 9: 14,313\n\n- Week 10: 23,334\n\n- Week 11: 26,813\n\nSo the highest is week 11 (26,813), followed by week 4 (22,620). Then comes week 3 at 20,946, and then week 10 at 23,334. Wait, no\u2014wait, 23,334 is higher than 20,946. So the order after week 11 is week 4 (22,620), then week 10 (23,334). Wait, but week 10's attendance is 23,334, which is lower than week 11's 26,813.\n\nSo the top two attendances are:\n\n1. Week 11: 26,813\n\n2. Week 4: 22,620\n\nWait no, because week 10 has 23,334, which is higher than week 3 and week 5 but lower than week 4 and week 11.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list them in order:\n\n- 26,813 (Week 11)\n\n- 22,620 (Week 4)\n\n- 23,334 (Week 10)\n\n- 20,946 (Week 3)\n\n- 20,166 (Week 5)\n\n- 19,492 (Week 2)\n\n- 18,470 (Week 1)\n\n- 18,500 (Week 6)\n\n- 16,583 (Week 8)\n\n- 16,424 (Week 7)\n\n- 14,313 (Week 9)\n\nSo the highest is week 11, next is week 4, then week 10, then week 3, etc.\n\nWait no\u2014actually, 23,334 in week 10 is higher than 22,620 in week 4. Wait, no: 23,334 is greater than 22,620? Let me check: 23k vs 22k. Yes, 23,334 is higher than 22,620.\n\nSo the order would be:\n\n1. Week 11: 26,813\n\n2. Week 10: 23,334\n\n3. Week 4: 22,620\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the claim says \"the second highest attendance...be in the last game\". The last game is week 11.\n\nSo the second highest would be week 10 at 23,334. So that's not the last game. Therefore, the second highest attendance isn't in the last game; it's in week 10.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: Is the second highest attendance indeed in the last game?\n\nWait, no\u2014the highest is in week 11, and the second highest is in week 10. So the claim says that the second highest is in the last game (week 11). But it's not; it's in week 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the second highest attendance isn't in the last game but in the penultimate one.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I'm correctly identifying the top two attendances.\n\nLooking at all attendances:\n\n26,813 (Week11)\n\n23,334 (Week10)\n\n22,620 (Week4)\n\n20,946 (Week3)\n\n20,166 (Week5)\n\n19,492 (Week2)\n\n18,470 (Week1)\n\n18,500 (Week6)\n\n16,583 (Week8)\n\n16,424 (Week7)\n\n14,313 (Week9)\n\nSo yes, the top two are week11 and week10. Therefore, the second highest is in week10, not in week11.\n\nThus, the claim that the second highest attendance is in the last game is false because the second highest is actually in the penultimate game (week10).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}]}",
