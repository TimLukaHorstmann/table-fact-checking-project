The claim says: \"the game at junction oval be 1 of 2 games that have a crowd of 12000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the venue is \"junction oval\". Scanning through the table, I see there's only one such row, which is row index 6 (since it starts from 0). \n\nNext, I need to check if the crowd number for this game is 12000. From the table, the crowd column for this row indeed shows 12000. \n\nNow, the claim mentions that this game is \"1 of 2 games\" with a crowd of 12000. However, looking at the entire table, I see only one instance where the crowd was 12000\u2014at junction oval. There's another entry at row index 5, which also shows 12000 for the crowd, but it's for st kilda versus essendon. \n\nWait, so if there are two games with a crowd of 12000, then the claim that \"the game at junction oval\" is one of them would be true because there are indeed two such games. But I need to make sure that the game at junction oval is correctly identified as having 12000.\n\nLooking back, yes, both the junction oval and another venue (princes park) have 12000 attendees on May 12, 1945. Therefore, the claim is true because the junction oval game is one of two games with a crowd of 12000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are two games listed with a crowd of 12000, and the game at junction oval is one of them.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"geelong and melbourne have an average home team score of 9.12.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI need to focus on \"geelong\" and \"melbourne\" as they are mentioned in the claim. So, I should find their respective rows in the table.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- The first row is melbourne with a home team score of 9.11 (65).\n- The second row is geelong with a home team score of 9.13 (67).\n\nNow, the claim mentions an average home team score for both teams. To find this average, I need to calculate the average of their home scores.\n\nFor melbourne:\nTheir home score is 9.11 (65). That's already in points, so 65 points.\n\nFor geelong:\nTheir home score is 9.13 (67), which is 67 points.\n\nCalculating the average: (65 + 67) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nThe claim states the average is 9.12. But wait, 9.12 is a score in the format of goals and behinds, where each goal is worth 6 points and each behind is worth 1 point. So 9.12 would be 9 goals and 12 behinds, totaling 9*6 + 12 = 66 points.\n\nSo the average is indeed 66 points. The claim states it as 9.12, which translates to 66 points. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this. The \"home team score\" column is where we found both teams' scores. So for geelong, it's row index 1 (since rows start at 0), and for melbourne, it's row index 0.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0, column \"home team score\"\n- Row 1, column \"home team score\"\n\nPutting this all together, the answer should be TRUE, with those two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that Essendon is not one of the home teams on May 12, 1945. So, I need to check if Essendon appears in any row as a home team on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with a home team and an away team. The \"date\" column has \"12 may 1945\" for all rows, so the date is consistent across all entries. \n\nNow, I'll go through each row's home team:\n\n1. Melbourne - Home team: Essendon isn't here.\n2. Geelong - Not Essendon.\n3. Footscray - No.\n4. Collingwood - Nope.\n5. Carlton - Not Essendon.\n6. St Kilda - Wait, the last row has \"st kilda\" as the home team and \"essendon\" as the away team.\n\nWait a second, in that last row, Essendon is listed as the away team, not the home team. So on May 12, 1945, Essendon was an away team, meaning they weren't one of the home teams.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Essendon isn't listed as a home team for that date.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"Essendon be not 1 of the home team on 12 may 1945\" is true, I'll check each row where the date is May 12, 1945. \n\nEach row lists either 'home team' or 'away team'.

The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. My task is to verify the claim by checking specific cells in this table.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions two teams: St Kilda and Collingwood. For each of these teams, I need to find their home team scores as per the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. The first row is for Melbourne, but it's not relevant here.\n2. The second row is Geelong vs South Melbourne; no match for St Kilda or Collingwood.\n3. Third row: Footscray vs North Melbourne\u2014again, not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Collingwood is the home team. Their score is 13.23 (101 points). That matches part of the claim.\n5. Fifth row: Carlton vs Fitzroy\u2014not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: St Kilda is the home team with a score of 14.17 (101 points), which aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. St Kilda's home score is indeed 14.17, and Collingwood's home score is 13.23. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are where St Kilda and Collingwood are listed as home teams with their respective scores.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the \"home team\" and \"home team score\" columns for both St Kilda and Collingwood in the table.\n\n- For **St Kilda**, located in row index 6, the home team score is indeed 14.17 (101).\n- For **Collingwood**, found in row index 4, their home team score is 13.23 (101).\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The user has provided a table with data about several football matches and is asking whether the claim \"a total of 5 away team have an away team score that be higher than 10.00 point\" is TRUE or FALSE. My task is to determine this based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It says there are 5 away teams whose away team scores are higher than 10 points. So, I should look at each row in the table, focus on the \"away team score\" column, and count how many times a score exceeds 10.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant column here is the \"away team score.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row:** Away team is Richmond with a score of 13.7 (85). That's way above 10.\n2. **Second Row:** South Melbourne scored 10.23 (83). Hmm, that's just over 10 because 10.23 is more than 10.00.\n3. **Third Row:** North Melbourne scored 14.8 (92), which is well above 10.\n4. **Fourth Row:** Hawthorn scored 9.9 (63), which is below 10.\n5. **Fifth Row:** Fitzroy scored 11.11 (77), just over 10.\n6. **Sixth Row:** Essendon scored 23.18 (156), way above 10.\n\nNow, counting the ones above 10:\n\n- Richmond: Yes\n- South Melbourne: Yes (since 10.23 > 10)\n- North Melbourne: Yes\n- Fitzroy: Yes (11.11 > 10)\n- Essendon: Yes\n\nThat's a total of 5 away teams with scores above 10.00 points.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because exactly five away teams meet this criterion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each \"away team score\" column and finding that there are indeed 5 instances where the score exceeds 10.00 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the game at junction oval be the only game that have a crowd of 12000.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there's only one game played at Junction Oval with exactly 12,000 people in attendance. So, my job is to check the table provided and see if this statement holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various games with details like home team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date. The relevant columns for the claim are \"crowd\" because we're interested in the number of people attending each game. But the claim specifically mentions \"junction oval,\" so I need to find which row corresponds to that venue.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first game is at Punt Road Oval with 23,000 crowd.\n2. The second is at Karlinia Park with 10,500.\n3. Third is Western Oval with 15,000.\n4. Fourth is Victoria Park with 11,000.\n5. Fifth is Princes Park with 12,000.\n6. Sixth is Junction Oval with 12,000.\n\nSo, the Junction Oval game has a crowd of 12,000. Now, I need to check if this is the only game in the table that had exactly 12,000 people. Let me look for any other rows where the crowd column is 12,000.\n\nLooking at all six rows:\n\n- Row 0: 23,000\n- Row 1: 10,500\n- Row 2: 15,000\n- Row 3: 11,000\n- Row 4: 12,000 (Princes Park)\n- Row 5: 12,000 (Junction Oval)\n\nSo, there are two games with a crowd of 12,000. The claim says \"the game at junction oval be the only game,\" which means it should have no other games with the same crowd number. Since there's another game at Princes Park also with 12,000, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify the relevant cells. The \"crowd\" column is key here because that's where the numbers are checked. So, for both rows where crowd is 12000, their row indices and column name need to be included.\n\nRow 4 has index 4 (since it's zero-based) and column \"crowd.\" Similarly, row 5 has index 5 and same column. Wait, no\u2014the Junction Oval is row 5? Let me count again:\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 5. The first game is row 0, second row1, up to Junction Oval being row5.\n\nSo the relevant cells are both at row4 (Princes Park) and row5 (Junction Oval). Therefore, I need to include both in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"geelong and melbourne have an average home team score of 11.13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match with these details.\n\nThe claim is about two teams, Geelong and Melbourne. It says their average home team score is 11.13. So, I need to find the home team scores for both Geelong and Melbourne in the table and then calculate their average to see if it matches 11.13.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. The first row (row index 0) has home team \"melbourne\" with a score of 9.11 (65).\n2. The second row (index 1) is about Geelong, scoring 9.13 (67).\n3. There are more rows for Footscray, Collingwood, Carlton, and St Kilda, but since the claim only mentions Geelong and Melbourne, I can focus on those two.\n\nWait, in the table, Geelong's home team score is 9.13 (67), and Melbourne's is 9.11 (65). So their scores are different. Let me check if I'm reading this correctly. The first row lists \"melbourne\" as the home team with a score of 9.11, which is 65 points. Geelong is in the second row with 9.13, totaling 67 points.\n\nSo the average would be (65 + 67) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66. That's not equal to 11.13. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the scores are in a format like 9.11 (total), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. But the claim refers to an average home team score of 11.13, which seems way lower than the actual scores.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount: \n\nMelbourne's score is 9.11 (65). Geelong's is 9.13 (67). So adding those, it's 65 + 67 = 132 points over two games. Divided by 2, that's an average of 66. But the claim says 11.13, which is much lower. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to take their average per game? That doesn't make sense because each game has a different score.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the scores are in points per game, but they add up differently. Let me think about how scoring works. In Australian Rules Football, the score is usually goals (G) and behinds (B), so 9.11 would mean 9 goals and 11 behinds, totaling 20 points. Similarly, 9.13 is 9 goals and 13 behinds = 22 points.\n\nWait no, that's incorrect because each goal is worth 6 points, each behind is 1 point. So a score of 9.11 would be 9*6 + 11*1 = 54 + 11 = 65 points. Similarly, 9.13 is 9*6 +13= 66 points? Wait, no: 9*6 is 54, plus 13 gives 67.\n\nSo Melbourne's score is 65, Geelong's is 67. Their average would be (65+67)/2 = 132/2 = 66. But the claim says their average home team score is 11.13. Wait, that can't be right because each of their scores are in the mid-60s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant something else. Perhaps they're talking about points per game for the two teams, but it's unclear why the average would be 11.13. Let me check if there's a misunderstanding in how the score is represented.\n\nWait, perhaps \"average home team score\" refers to an average of their home games, not across both teams. But the claim says \"geelong and melbourne,\" which are two different teams. So maybe it's saying that when Geelong is the home team, they average 11.13, or when Melbourne is the home team, they average 11.13.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\n- For Geelong (home), their score is 9.13 (67).\n- For Melbourne (home), it's 9.11 (65).\n\nSo neither of them have an average home score of 11.13. Therefore, the claim seems to be false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 1: melbourne (home) with 9.11\nRow 2: geelong (home) with 9.13\n\nSo, if we're looking at both as home teams, their scores are 65 and 67 respectively.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row is a match where one team is home and the other away. So perhaps for each of these teams, we need to look at all their home games and average their scores.\n\nIn the given data, each team plays multiple home games, except here only two matches are shown (since it's a small subset). Let me check how many times each team appears as home:\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Melbourne: once as home\n- Geelong: once as home\n\nSo with just one game each, their average is their own score. So for Melbourne, 65; Geelong, 67.\n\nBut the claim says both have an average of 11.13. That doesn't align because 11.13 would be a much lower score. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table's row indexes or team positions. Wait, no, each row has a home team and away team. The first row: Melbourne (H) vs Footscray (A), so Melbourne's home score is 9.11 (65). Second row: Geelong (H) vs Collingwood (A), so Geelong scored 9.13 (67).\n\nSo their own home scores are 65 and 67, which average to 66 if considered together.\n\nBut the claim says both have an average of 11.13, which is way off. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Geelong and Melbourne have an average home team score of 11.13\" is incorrect based on the provided data. \n\n**Answer:** The claim is false. Geelong and Melbourne's home scores are 9.13 (67 points) and 9.11 (65 points), respectively, which do not average to 11.13.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{The claim is false.}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about an HTML table is true or false. The claim is: \"Essendon be the only home team on 12 May 1945.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the instructions. They want me to carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and identify which cells are relevant. If everything checks out, I should say TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLooking at the claim, it's making two main points: that Essendon is a home team on that specific date. So, I need to find if there's only one instance where Essendon is the home team on 12 May 1945.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match.\n\nI need to go through each row and see if Essendon is listed as the home team on 12 May 1945. Let's start by checking the 'home team' column for that date.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column, all entries are \"12 may 1945\". So every row has the same date. Now, I'll scan each row's home team:\n\n1. melbourne - home team\n2. geelong - home team\n3. footscray - home team\n4. collingwood - home team\n5. carlton - home team\n6. st kilda - home team\n\nWait a minute, I don't see Essendon listed as a home team in any of these rows. The away teams are Richmond, South Melbourne, North Melbourne, Hawthorn, Fitzroy, and Essendon. So Essendon is an away team in one row.\n\nBut the claim says \"Essendon be the only home team on 12 May 1945.\" That's a problem because there are multiple home teams that day: Melbourne, Geelong, Footscray, Collingwood, Carlton, St Kilda. None of them are Essendon.\n\nAdditionally, since the claim states Essendon is the only home team, but in reality, there are six home teams listed for that date, and Essendon isn't among them. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim is about Essendon being a home team on 12 May 1945, I need to look at the 'home team' column. Each row's home team needs to be checked for that specific date.\n\nSo for each row where the date is 12 may 1945 (all of them), I should check the 'home team' cell. In this case, all six rows have a home team, so I need to list all those cells as relevant because they show which teams are playing at home on that day. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the 'home team' entries for 12 May 1945. Each of these cells shows that another team is the home team, not Essendon. So by checking each cell in the 'home team' column for that date, we can confirm that Essendon isn't the only one and in fact, isn't a home team at all on that day.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"a total of 2 away team have an away team score that be higher than 10.00 point.\" Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should check each row in the table to see how many away teams scored more than 10 points. Looking at the table, each row represents a match with home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is Melbourne with 9.11 (65). Away team is Richmond with 13.7 (85). So Richmond scored 85 points, which is higher than 10.\n2. **Row 1**: Geelong (9.13) vs South Melbourne (10.23). South Melbourne scored 83, which is more than 10.\n3. **Row 2**: Footscray (11.13) vs North Melbourne (14.8). North Melbourne scored 92, way above 10.\n4. **Row 3**: Collingwood (13.23) vs Hawthorn (9.9). Hawthorn only scored 63, which is over 10 but maybe the claim counts higher than 10 or 10+? Wait, 63 is more than 10, so that's another one.\n5. **Row 4**: Carlton (12.12) vs Fitzroy (11.11). Both scored under 80, so Fitzroy with 77 is just over 70, which is above 10.\n6. **Row 5**: St Kilda (14.17) vs Essendon (23.18). Essendon scored 156, definitely higher than 10.\n\nNow, let's count how many away teams have scores over 10:\n\n- Richmond: 85 \u2192 yes\n- South Melbourne: 83 \u2192 yes\n- North Melbourne: 92 \u2192 yes\n- Hawthorn: 63 \u2192 yes\n- Fitzroy: 77 \u2192 yes\n- Essendon: 156 \u2192 yes\n\nWait, that's six away teams with scores over 10. But the claim says \"a total of 2 away team.\" That seems off. Did I misinterpret something?\n\nLooking back, maybe the user meant two teams each scored more than 10 points collectively or individually. Each row has one away team, so each away team's score is per game.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about the number of games where the away team scored over 10. So in how many rows does the away team have a score >10?\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n1. Richmond:85 \u2192 yes\n2. South Melbourne:83 \u2192 yes\n3. North Melbourne:92 \u2192 yes\n4. Hawthorn:63 \u2192 yes (63>10)\n5. Fitzroy:77 \u2192 yes (77>10)\n6. Essendon:156 \u2192 yes\n\nSo all six away teams have scores over 10 points in their respective games. Therefore, the claim's assertion of \"a total of 2\" is incorrect. It should be six.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's about the total points scored by all away teams, not per game. So adding up all away team scores: 85+83+92+63+77+156 = let's calculate:\n\n85 +83=168; 168+92=260; 260+63=323; 323+77=400; 400+156=556.\n\nSo total points from away teams are 556, which is definitely more than 10. But the claim says \"2 away team have an away team score that be higher than 10.00 point.\" It seems like it's referring to individual team scores, not cumulative.\n\nBut in each game, one team is home and one is away. Each row has one away team with their score. So in all six games, the away teams scored over 10 points. Therefore, the number of away teams (as in, rows) where away score >10 is six, not two.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list each away team's score:\n\n- Richmond:85\n- South Melbourne:83\n- North Melbourne:92\n- Hawthorn:63\n- Fitzroy:77\n- Essendon:156\n\nAll of these are above 10 points. So the claim is saying only two, but actually all six have scores over 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me double-check each row's away team score:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Richmond scored 13.7 (85) \u2192 correct.\n2. **Row 1**: South Melbourne: 10.23 is 83 points.\n3. **Row 2**: North Melbourne:14.8 (92).\n4. **Row 3**: Hawthorn:9.9 is 63.\n5. **Row 4**: Fitzroy:11.11 is 77.\n6. **Row 5**: Essendon:23.18 is 156.\n\nYes, all away teams have scores over 10. Therefore, the claim's assertion that \"a total of 2\" is wrong; it should be six or more.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user meant two specific teams. Looking at the table, maybe only two teams scored over a certain number? Let me check:\n\nLooking for which away team scores over 10:\n\nAll six have scores over 10, as each is in the 60s and up. So the claim's assertion of \"a total of 2\" is false because it's actually six.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two away teams scored more than 10 points. However, upon reviewing each row, all six away teams have scores exceeding 10 points. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is incorrect. The correct number of away teams with scores over 10 points is six.\n\n\\boxed{6}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim states: \"St Kilda have a home team score of 9.11 while Collingwood have a home team score of 11.13.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has columns for 'home team,' 'home team score,' 'away team,' etc. Since the claim is about home team scores, I should focus on the rows where St Kilda and Collingwood are the home teams.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see which ones are relevant:\n\n1. The first row has Melbourne as the home team, so it's not relevant for either St Kilda or Collingwood.\n2. The second row is Geelong vs South Melbourne, so not relevant.\n3. Third row: Footscray vs North Melbourne \u2013 again, not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Collingwood is the home team with a score of 13.23 (101). That's one part of the claim I need to check.\n5. Fifth row: Carlton vs Fitzroy \u2013 not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: St Kilda is the home team with a score of 14.17 (101). Wait, that doesn't match the claim which says St Kilda has 9.11.\n\nWait, there's an issue here. In the table, St Kilda's home game on May 12, 1945, shows their score as 14.17 (101), but the claim states it's 9.11. That doesn't match. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row for Collingwood: yes, home team score is 13.23 (101). So that part of the claim is correct.\n- St Kilda's row shows their home team score as 14.17 (101), not 9.11. So the claim about St Kilda's score is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread. Let me check each team's home games:\n\nSt Kilda's row: yes, it's in the sixth row, and their home team score is 14.17 (101). The claim says they have 9.11, which doesn't match.\n\nCollingwood's row is correct at 13.23 (101).\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because St Kilda's actual home score isn't 9.11 but higher. So the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that St Kilda scored 9.11 as a home team and Collingwood scored 11.13 as a home team. From the table:\n\n- Collingwood's home score matches: 13.23 (101), which is not 11.13, so this part is correct.\n- St Kilda's home score in the table is 14.17 (101), not 9.11, so this part is incorrect.\n\nThus, since one part of the claim is wrong, the overall answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
