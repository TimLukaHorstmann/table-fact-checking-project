    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the building that remains the tallest in Montreal today be the 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-reference it with the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that \"the building that remains the tallest in Montreal today\" refers to a specific building. From the table, I can see several buildings listed along with their heights in meters and feet. The relevant column here is \"height m / ft,\" so I should look at each row's height for the buildings mentioned.\n\nThe claim specifically names \"1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re\" as the current tallest building in Montreal. So, my task is to check if this building has the highest height compared to the others listed.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Notre-Dame Basilica**: Height is 69m/226ft.\n2. **Royal Bank Building**: 121m/397ft.\n3. **Sun Life Building**: 122m/400ft.\n4. **Tour CIBC**: 187m/614ft.\n5. **Place Ville Marie**: 188m/617ft.\n6. **Tour de la Bourse**: 194m/637ft.\n7. **1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re**: 205m/673ft.\n\nComparing these heights, the \"1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re\" has the highest meter measurement at 205m. However, looking at the feet measurements, it's also the tallest, but I should confirm if there are any other buildings that might be taller. From the list, none of the other buildings have a higher height than this one.\n\nThe claim also mentions \"remain the tallest,\" so I need to check when each building was completed or became prominent. For example, \"1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re\" was constructed in 1992 and is still ongoing. The table indicates that it's been around for about 21 years as of present. \n\nLooking at other buildings like Tour CIBC (1962), Place Ville Marie (1964), and Tour de la Bourse (1964), their construction periods are earlier than \"1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re.\" Since the claim refers to the current tallest, it's about the present state.\n\nI should also consider if any building taller than \"1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re\" exists in Montreal. From what I know, as of recent data, \"1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re\" is indeed one of the tallest buildings in Montreal, often cited as the second-tallest in Canada after the CN Tower.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, \"1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re\" has the highest recorded height among all listed buildings. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the \"1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re\" building holds the tallest status with the highest height in meters and feet compared to other listed buildings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states that regardless of both buildings having 47 floors, Tour de la Bourse took the title from Place Ville Marie in 1964 by a mere 6/20 m/ft difference.\n\nFirst, I'll look for relevant information about Tour de la Bourse and Place Ville Marie in the table. \n\nIn the table, there are two rows that have 47 floors: Tour CIBC (row index 4) and Tour de la Bourse (row index 6). However, the claim specifically mentions Tour de la Bourse and Place Ville Marie.\n\nLooking at Place Ville Marie's row (index 5), its height is 188/617 m/ft, which converts to approximately 0.304 meters per floor. Tour de la Bourse's height is 194/637 m/ft, roughly 0.305 meters per floor. The difference is about 0.001 meters, which is much less than the claim's mentioned 6/20 or 0.3 meters.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me double-check:\n\nTour de la Bourse: 194/637 \u2248 0.3048 m per floor.\nPlace Ville Marie: 188/617 \u2248 0.3051 m per floor.\nThe difference is approximately 0.0003 meters, which is negligible and not a 6/20 or 0.3 difference.\n\nAlso, the claim says Tour de la Bourse took the title in 1964. Looking at the table, Tour de la Bourse was built from 1964 to 1992, while Place Ville Marie's construction period was 1962-1964. So in 1964, both were completed or still under construction.\n\nThe claim implies that by a minimal height difference, Tour de la Bourse became taller. However, based on the height per floor, the difference is minuscule, not 6/20 meters. The floors are both 47, so their overall heights aren't directly comparable unless we know when they were completed.\n\nIn reality, Place Ville Marie was built earlier, in 1964, while Tour de la Bourse was started in 1964 as well but completed later. So maybe the claim refers to a point where Tour de la Bourse surpassed Place Ville Marie in height, but based on the given data, the difference is almost nothing.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems incorrect because the height difference isn't significant as stated. It should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the Notre-Dame Basilica is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"From 1829 - 1928, the Notre Dame Basilica was the tallest building and still holds the record for the most years as the tallest.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant time frame in the claim, which is from 1829 to 1928. In the table, each row has a range under \"years as tallest\". The first row corresponds to Notre-Dame Basilica with the years 1829 - 1928. So that's definitely relevant.\n\nNext, I need to verify if it was the tallest building during that time and whether it still holds the record for the most years as the tallest. The table shows that from 1829 to 1928, Notre-Dame Basilica was the tallest. However, other buildings like the Sun Life Building (1931-1962) and Tour CIBC (1962) had shorter periods. But does Notre-Dame still hold the record? Looking at the last row, the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re building started in 1992 and is still under construction as of now, holding 21 years. Comparing durations: Notre-Dame's 99 years from 1829-1928 is longer than any other single period shown. However, Tour CIBC held for less than a year, Place Ville Marie for 2 years, Royal Bank for 3, etc. So, based on the table, Notre-Dame holds the record for the longest continuous time as the tallest.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"still hold the record,\" implying it's still the tallest today. But in reality, newer buildings like the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re might be taller now. The table doesn't provide current heights, only historical data. So, without knowing if Notre-Dame is the tallest currently, I can't confirm that part.\n\nHowever, based on the information given in the table up to 1992, Notre-Dame was the tallest for the longest time, so it holds the record according to the table's data. The claim doesn't specify current status beyond what's in the table, so within the provided data, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year, follow by place ville marie.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is stating. It mentions two buildings: Tour CIBC and Place Ville Marie. The claim is about their heights relative to the number of years they've been the tallest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a building with its details. For Tour CIBC (row index 4), the height is listed as 187/614 meters, which converts to approximately 614 meters tall. The years it's been the tallest are indicated as \"<1 year,\" meaning it was only recently completed in 1962.\n\nNext, Place Ville Marie is row index 5. Its height is 188/617 meters, roughly 617 meters tall. The years it was the tallest are stated as 2 years (from 1962 to 1964). \n\nComparing these two buildings based on height and the number of years they've been the tallest: Tour CIBC has a taller height but only for less than a year. Place Ville Marie is shorter in height but has been the tallest for two years.\n\nThe claim says Tour CIBC is the tallest building for the least amount of time, followed by Place Ville Marie. However, from the data, both buildings have different heights and durations as the tallest. It's not clear if \"least amount of year\" refers to duration or if it's a ranking based on height and time. Since Tour CIBC has a higher height but only for a shorter time, while Place Ville Marie is shorter but lasted longer, the statement doesn't accurately describe both buildings in the way the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nThe claim states: \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for close to a third of the time of the notre dame basilica.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing two buildings: Sun Life Building and Notre Dame Basilica. It's saying that Sun Life was the tallest for almost a third of the time that Notre Dame was the tallest.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find out when each building was the tallest and compare their durations. \n\nI'll start by identifying which buildings are referred to in the claim. The claim mentions both \"the sun life building\" and \"notre dame basilica.\" Looking at the table, these correspond to two rows: Sun Life Building (row index 2) and Notre Dame Basilica (row index 0).\n\nNext, I need to find out how long each was the tallest building in Montreal. The claim suggests that Sun Life's duration as the tallest is almost a third of Notre Dame's.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Notre Dame Basilica: years as tallest are from 1829 to 1928, so 100 years.\n- Sun Life Building: years as tallest are from 1931 to 1962, which is 31 years.\n\nNow, I need to check if Sun Life's duration (31 years) is roughly a third of Notre Dame's (100 years). Calculating one-third of 100 gives approximately 33.33 years. Since 31 is close but less than a third, it doesn't fully support the claim. However, considering that 31 is about 30% of 100, which is somewhat close to a third, there might be some interpretation where it's considered close enough.\n\nBut wait, looking at the actual durations: Notre Dame was from 1829-1928 (100 years), and Sun Life from 1931-1962 (31 years). So Sun Life's duration is about 31/100 = 0.31, which is roughly a third but not exact. The claim uses \"close to a third,\" so it might be considered TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is that Sun Life was tallest for a third of the time Notre Dame was, then the durations would need to align in that way. However, since Notre Dame was tallest from 1829-1928 and Sun Life from 1931-1962, their overlapping time as tallest might not be directly additive.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about Sun Life remaining tallest for close to a third of the time that Notre Dame was. So if Notre Dame was tallest for 100 years, then a third would be about 33 years. But Sun Life's duration as tallest is 31 years, which is approximately a third (31/100=0.31). Therefore, it's close.\n\nBut actually, looking at the table, the 'years as tallest' column shows the period during which each building was the tallest. For Notre Dame, it's from 1829-1928, so that's 99 years (from row index 0: 1829 - 1928). Sun Life is from 1931-1962, which is 31 years.\n\nSo the question is whether Sun Life's duration as tallest is close to a third of Notre Dame's. A third of 99 years is approximately 33 years. Since 31 is just below that, it's not quite a third. Therefore, the claim might be false because it's not fully supported.\n\nBut I need to consider if \"close to\" allows for some approximation. 31 is about 30% of 100, which is close to a third (33.3%). Depending on the interpretation, this could be considered as sufficiently close. However, strictly speaking, it's not exactly a third but approximately so.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the claim is about their durations relative to each other. If Sun Life was tallest for 31 years and Notre Dame for 99, then the ratio is ~0.313, which is very close to one-third (0.333). So it's almost a third, hence the claim would be TRUE.\n\nTherefore, considering that \"close to a third\" allows for approximation, the answer would be TRUE with the relevant cells being the rows of both buildings and their 'years as tallest' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Notre-Dame Basilica continues to be the tallest building in Montreal as of today. To verify this, I need to check if the data supports this assertion.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various attributes like name, street address, years it was the tallest, current height, and number of floors. The relevant columns for the claim would be \"name\" and \"years as tallest,\" especially since we're comparing heights over time.\n\nStarting with the first row, which is Notre-Dame Basilica. It has a range of years from 1829 to 1928 when it was the tallest. However, this was many years ago, so I need to see if it's still holding that title today.\n\nNext, I should check if any other buildings have been the tallest recently or currently. Let's look at each building:\n\n- Royal Bank Building: Tallest from 1928-1931.\n- Sun Life Building: From 1931-1962.\n- Tour CIBC: Only in 1962, so not sustained.\n- Place Ville Marie: 1962-1964.\n- Tour de la Bourse: From 1964-1992.\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: Started in 1992 and is still ongoing, with 21 years (current) as the tallest.\n\nSo, the 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re building has been the tallest since 1992 up to present. That means Notre-Dame Basilica hasn't held that title for over two decades. Therefore, the claim that it remains the tallest today is incorrect.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"name\" column is obviously important to check if we're talking about Notre-Dame Basilica. The \"years as tallest\" column shows when each building was tallest, especially the current one for 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re, which is still ongoing.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row index 0 (Notre-Dame Basilica) and \"name.\"\n- Row index 6 (1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re) and \"years as tallest.\"\n\nThese are the key points that disprove the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we compare Notre-Dame Basilica's status as Montreal's tallest building today with other buildings.

The relevant columns here are \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest,\" which indicate both the range of years and how long they were the tallest. Also, the \"height m / ft\" column might be useful for comparison, though it's more about their current height.\n\nStarting with Tour CIBC (which I assume is listed in the table), I look through each row.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the buildings is true or false. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"Although Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse, Tour de la Bourse takes the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts. The first part compares the number of floors between Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse. The second part claims that Tour de la Bourse was the tallest building from 1964 onwards when compared to Place Ville Marie.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to find the relevant data for both buildings in question: Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse.\n\nStarting with Place Ville Marie:\n- Row index is 5.\n- The 'floors' column shows 47 floors.\n\nFor Tour de la Bourse:\n- It's located in row index 6.\n- The 'floors' column also shows 47 floors.\n\nWait, both have the same number of floors according to the table. But the claim says Place Ville Marie has more floors. That seems contradictory. Did I read that correctly? Let me check again. Oh no, Place Ville Marie has 47 floors, and Tour de la Bourse is listed as 47 as well in row 6. So they have equal floors.\n\nBut the claim states that Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse. If both are 47, then this part of the claim might be false because they have the same number of floors, not more. However, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row.\n\nLooking back at Place Ville Marie's row: It's row index 5 with 47 floors.\nTour de la Bourse is row index 6 with 47 floors as well.\n\nSo yes, both have the same number of floors. Therefore, the claim that Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse is incorrect because they tie in floors.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: Tour de la Bourse takes the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964.\n\nI need to check when each building was completed or became the tallest. The 'years as tallest' column might help here, but I'm not sure if that's directly related. Alternatively, looking at their heights (m/ft) could indicate which was taller.\n\nLooking at Place Ville Marie's row: It spans from 1962 to 1964. Its height is listed as 188m/617ft.\nTour de la Bourse spans from 1964 to 1992 with a height of 194m/637ft.\n\nWait, in 1964, both Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse were under construction or completed around that time. Place Ville Marie was completed between 1962-1964, while Tour de la Bourse started in 1964. So in 1964, both were being built. However, the claim says that in 1964, Tour de la Bourse took the title from Place Ville Marie.\n\nLooking at their heights, Tour de la Bourse is taller than Place Ville Marie by a slight margin (194m vs. 188m). Since they are both completed around 1964, Tour de la Bourse might have been deemed the tallest upon its completion in 1964, overtaking Place Ville Marie which was under construction or already built but shorter.\n\nSo, according to the table data, in 1964, Tour de la Bourse was taller and thus took the title. Therefore, the second part of the claim seems true.\n\nPutting it all together: The first part of the claim is false because they have the same number of floors, not that Place Ville Marie has more. However, the second part is correct as Tour de la Bourse was indeed the taller building in 1964.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check each condition and determine if it's fully supported. So I need to consider both parts for the claim to be true or false. Since one part is false (floors comparison) and the other is true (tallest in 1964), does that mean the overall claim is false? Because the first part is incorrect, making the entire statement false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user's example had a relevant cells section for each part of the claim. So perhaps the claim has two parts, both of which need to be correct for the answer to be true.\n\nTherefore, since the floors comparison in the claim is incorrect (they have same floors), and the tallest part is correct, but one part is wrong, the overall claim is false. Also, the first part is a comparison error, so it's a factual mistake making the entire claim false.\n\nAdditionally, I should list the relevant cells for each part of the claim. For the floors comparison, I need to find Place Ville Marie and Tour de la Bourse's floor data. Both are in column 'floors' at their respective rows (5 and 6).\n\nFor the tallest part, I need to check which building was taller in 1964. The height columns would be relevant here: 188 / 617 for Place Ville Marie and 194 / 637 for Tour de la Bourse. So their respective 'height m / ft' cells are relevant.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Floors comparison: Both have 47 floors, so claim is wrong here.\n- Tallest in 1964: Tour de la Bourse was taller, supporting the claim here.\n\nSince both parts of the claim need to be true for it to hold. But since the first part is false, overall claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should state that the claim is false because the floors comparison is incorrect and provide the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim provided is **false**. Here's why:\n\n1. **Floors Comparison:**\n   - The claim states that Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse. However, both buildings have **47 floors each**, as indicated by their respective entries in the 'floors' column. Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\n2. **Tallest Building in 1964:**\n   - The claim states that Tour de la Bourse took the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964. This is supported by the data provided:\n     - **Place Ville Marie** has a height of **188m/617ft**.\n     - **Tour de la Bourse** has a height of **194m/637ft**, which is taller than Place Ville Marie when comparing their heights.\n\nHowever, since both parts of the claim are not entirely accurate (the first part is false), the overall claim is considered **false**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Floors Comparison:**\n  - **Place Ville Marie:** Row index: **5**, Column: 'floors' \u2192 **47 floors**\n  - **Tour de la Bourse:** Row index: **6**, Column: 'floors' \u2192 **47 floors**\n\n- **Tallest in 1964:**\n  - **Place Ville Marie:** Row index: **5**, Column: 'height m / ft' \u2192 **188m/617ft**\n  - **Tour de la Bourse:** Row index: **6**, Column: 'height m / ft' \u2192 **194m/637ft**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false due to the incorrect floors comparison.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"place ville marie be the tallest building for the least amount of year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that \"place ville marie\" is the tallest building and that it achieved this height for the shortest period of time compared to other buildings in the list. So, I need to check two things: whether it's the tallest, and whether its tenure as the tallest is the least among all buildings.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with various attributes. The relevant columns here are probably \"name\", \"height m / ft\", and \"years as tallest\" (since the claim talks about height and duration). But wait, the column named \"years as tallest\" might actually be the number of years it was tallest, but let me check.\n\nWait, the table has a column called \"years as tallest\". Let me look at each row:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 1829-1928 (99 years)\n- Royal Bank Building: 1928-1931 (3 years)\n- Sun Life Building: 1931-1962 (31 years)\n- Tour CIBC: 1962 (so less than a year, maybe 0 or 1)\n- Place Ville Marie: 1962-1964 (2 years)\n- Tour de la Bourse: 1964-1992 (28 years)\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 1992-present (21 years)\n\nSo, for \"years as tallest\", we need to see how many years each building was the tallest. Wait, but the column is named \"years as tallest,\" which might be a bit confusing. Does it mean the number of years they were the tallest, or when they started and ended being the tallest?\n\nLooking at Place Ville Marie's row: their \"years as tallest\" is 2 years (1962-1964). That makes sense because Tour de la Bourse took over after that.\n\nNow, let's check if Place Ville Marie is the tallest building. The column \"height m / ft\" shows their height as 188/617, which converts to approximately 30.3 meters. Comparing this to others:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: ~69m\n- Royal Bank Building: ~121m\n- Sun Life Building: ~122m\n- Tour CIBC: ~187m\n- Place Ville Marie: ~188m\n- Tour de la Bourse: ~194m\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: ~205m\n\nSo, the tallest building is Tour de la Bourse at 194m and 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re at 205m. Therefore, Place Ville Marie isn't the tallest; it's actually not even in the top two.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"place ville marie be the tallest building\". That part is false because Tour de la Bourse and 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re are taller.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm interpreting the columns correctly. The column named \"height m / ft\" should indicate each building's height, so yes, Place Ville Marie isn't the tallest. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false, making the entire statement false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"years as tallest\" are relevant in a different way. But since the initial part is already false, it doesn't matter how many years they were tallest; the building isn't the tallest at all.\n\nSo, putting it together: Place Ville Marie isn't the tallest, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the Sun Life Building and Notre-Dame Basilica is true based on the table provided. The claim states that the Sun Life Building remained the tallest building in Montreal for the same amount of time as Notre-Dame Basilica.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing the duration during which each building was the tallest. So, I need to find out how long each held the title and see if these durations match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building with its details. The relevant columns for this comparison are \"name,\" \"years as tallest,\" and \"of years as tallest.\" \n\nStarting with Notre-Dame Basilica (first row):\n- Name: notre dame basilica\n- Years as tallest: 1829 - 1928\n- Of years as tallest: 99 years\n\nSo, Notre-Dame Basilica was the tallest for 99 years.\n\nNext, Sun Life Building (third row):\n- Name: sun life building\n- Years as tallest: 1931 - 1962\n- Of years as tallest: 31 years\n\nWait, that doesn't match. The claim says both durations are the same. But according to the table, Notre-Dame was tallest for 99 years and Sun Life for 31 years. That\u2019s a big difference.\n\nI might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the rows. \n\nNotre-Dame Basilica: started in 1829 and ended in 1928, which is 100 years (from 1829 to 1928 inclusive). Wait, if it's from 1829 to 1928, that's 1928 - 1829 = 99 years, but actually, if you count each year it was tallest, including both the start and end years, it would be 100 years. But according to the table, the \"years as tallest\" is listed as 1829-1928, and \"of years as tallest\" as 99 years. So it's 99 years.\n\nSun Life Building: started in 1931 and ended in 1962, so that's 31 years (1962 - 1931 = 31). The table confirms this with \"of years as tallest\" being 31.\n\nSo the durations are indeed different: 99 vs. 31 years. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both buildings were the tallest for the same duration, but the data shows a significant difference in their years as the tallest. Notre-Dame Basilica held the title for 99 years, while Sun Life Building only did so for 31 years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
