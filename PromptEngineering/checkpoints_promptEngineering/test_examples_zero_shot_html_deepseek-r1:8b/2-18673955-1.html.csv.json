    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7\". Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any games scheduled for October 30, 1977. The table has a column called 'week' and another called 'date'. So, I'll go through each row's date and see if it matches October 30, 1977.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n- Week 1: September 19\n- Week 2: September 25\n- Week 3: October 2\n- Week 4: October 9\n- Week 5: October 16\n- Week 6: October 23\n- Week 7: October 30\n\nOh, there's a week 7 game on October 30, 1977. So that date exists in the table.\n\nNow, the claim is about games \"that be list greater than week 7\". Wait, I think it means games that are listed after week 7. But since week 7 is the highest number in the table (weeks go up to 14), there's no game beyond week 7. So, does that mean there are no games listed greater than week 7? \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"no game that be play on october 30, 1977 that be list greater than week 7\". So it specifically refers to October 30th and whether any game beyond week 7 was played. Since week 7 is already in the table for that date, there's no higher week listed after that.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about the wording. The claim could mean that on October 30, there are no games scheduled beyond week 7. Since week 7 is indeed the game on that date, but it's not greater than week 7, it's equal to week 7. So maybe the claim is saying there are no games after week 7 played on that date, which would be true because weeks go up to 14, but only week 7 is for October 30.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether any game beyond week 7 was played on October 30. Since the maximum week in the table is 14, and week 7 is the one for October 30, there are no games beyond that week (i.e., weeks 8-14) scheduled for that date. Therefore, the claim holds true because no game listed is beyond week 7 on that specific date.\n\nSo, I need to check which cells in the table support this. The relevant columns would be 'week' and 'date'. So, the cell for row_index 6 (since counting starts at 0) and column_name 'week' because it shows week 7. Also, the date is October 30, 1977.\n\nI should include both cells to show that there is a game on October 30th in week 7, thus making sure no higher weeks are listed for that date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
