    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"when new york be the opponent , the score be 111 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are game, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record. So, the relevant parts for the claim are the 'opponent' and 'score' columns.\n\nNow, I need to check each row where the opponent is \"new york\" and see if the score matches 111 - 106.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 18 has opponent as \"new york\" with a score of 111 - 106. That matches exactly.\n- Any other rows? Let me check all rows. The opponents are listed, and only row 18 is new york. So there's only one occurrence here.\n\nSo, in that case, the claim is true because when new york is the opponent, the score is indeed 111 - 106. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 113 - 106.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find games where the location is the Alexander Memorial Coliseum and the score is 113 - 106.\n\nI'll go row by row. Starting from row 0:\n\nRow 8: Location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum, score is 109-105. Not matching.\nRow 9: Same location, score 103-123. No match.\nRow 10: Different location, no match.\nRow 11: Same coliseum, score 114-101. Not 113-106.\nRow 12: Same location, score 113-106. Oh, that's the score we're looking for.\n\nSo in row 12, the game is number 12, location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum, and the score is exactly 113 - 106. That matches the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other games with the same details. Let me continue checking:\n\nRow 13: Different opponent and location.\nRows after that: Opponent changes each time, but I'll check for more Alexander Memorial Coliseum entries with 113-106.\n\nLooking through all rows, row 12 is the only one where both location and score match exactly. No other game in the table has those specific details.\n\nSo the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"new york be the opponent at the game with a score of 112 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a game where New York is the opponent and the score is exactly 112-106.\n\nStarting from the top, let me go row by row. Each row represents a different game, so I need to check each one for two specific conditions: opponent being \"new york\" (I should note that sometimes the names might be in lowercase or have variations, but here it seems consistent) and the score being 112-106.\n\nLooking at row 18, the opponent is new york. The score there is 111 - 106. That's close, but not exactly 112-106. So this isn't matching.\n\nNext, I see that in row 20, the opponent is chicago, so that doesn't apply. Row 21 is baltimore again, and row 22 is also baltimore. Row 23 has cincinnati as the opponent, and row 24 again is cincinnati. None of these seem to match both conditions.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check each game. Let me list out all the opponents and scores:\n\nRow 8: san francisco, score 109-105\nRow 9: boston, 103-123\nRow10: baltimore, 119-140\nRow11: san diego, 114-101\nRow12: san francisco, 113-106\nWait, here's row12 where the opponent is san francisco and the score is 113-106. That doesn't match.\n\nContinuing down:\n\nRow13: san francisco again, but different location, score 108-123\nRow14: seattle, 142-113\nRow15: philadelphia, 115-116\nRow16: cincinnati, 125-130\nRow17: milwaukee, 89-119\nRow18: new york, 111-106 (opponent is new york, score 111-106)\nRow19: detroit, 129-121\nRow20: chicago, 114-96\nRow21: baltimore, 111-118\nRow22: baltimore again, 99-102\nRow23: cincinnati, 94-91\nRow24: cincinnati, 126-109\n\nNone of these have \"new york\" as the opponent with a score of 112-106. The closest is row18, but that's 111-106.\n\nSo the claim doesn't seem to be supported by any single game in the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 114 - 106.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: the location and the score.\n\nStarting with the location, it mentions \"alexander memorial coliseum.\" Looking at the table, each row has a 'location / attendance' column. I need to check which rows have this exact location.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Location is \"alexander memorial coliseum\" \u2192 matches.\n- Row 1: Same location \u2192 matches.\n- Row 2: Different location \u2192 doesn't match.\n- Row 3: Different location (Oakland) \u2192 no.\n- Row 4: Seattle \u2192 no.\n- Row 5: Philadelphia \u2192 no.\n- Row 6: Cincinnati \u2192 no.\n- Row 7: Milwaukee \u2192 no.\n- Row 8: New York \u2192 no.\n- Row 9: Detroit \u2192 no.\n- Row 10: Chicago \u2192 no.\n- Row 11: Baltimore \u2192 no.\n- Row 12: Baltimore again, different location \u2192 no.\n- Row 13: Different location (Cincinnati Gardens) \u2192 no.\n- Row 14: Cincinnati Gardens \u2192 no.\n- Row 15: Milwaukee Arena \u2192 no.\n- Row 16: Alexander Memorial Coliseum \u2192 yes, it's another match.\n- Row 17: Milwaukee Arena again \u2192 no.\n- Row 18: Alexander Memorial again \u2192 yes.\n- Row 19: Cobo Arena \u2192 no.\n- Row 20: Chicago Stadium \u2192 no.\n- Row 21: Alexander Memorial again \u2192 yes.\n- Row 22: Baltimore Civic Center \u2192 no.\n- Row 23: Alexander Memorial \u2192 yes.\n- Row 24: Cincinnati Gardens \u2192 no.\n\nSo, the location \"alexander memorial coliseum\" appears in rows 0,1,16,18,21,23. Each of these has that location.\n\nNext, I need to check if any of those games have a score of 114 - 106. Looking at the 'score' column:\n\nRow 0: Score is \"109 - 105\" \u2192 no.\nRow 1: \"103 - 123\" \u2192 no.\nRow 2: \"119 - 140\" \u2192 no.\nRow 3: \"114 - 101\" \u2192 close but not 114-106.\nWait, 114-101 isn't the same as 114-106. So that's a different score.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 16: Score is 125-130 \u2192 no.\nRow 18: 111-118 \u2192 no.\nRow 21: 111-118 again \u2192 no.\nRow 23: 94-91 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, none of the games at Alexander Memorial Coliseum have a score of 114 - 106. Therefore, the claim is false because while the location matches in several rows, there's no game with that exact score there.\n\nWait, but I should double-check row 3. Score is \"114 - 101.\" That's different from 114-106. So it doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because while Alexander Memorial Coliseum is listed as the location in multiple games, none of those games have a score of 114-106.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
