    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"there be 1 woman's double team consist of kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey when jamie van hooijdonk compete in the men's single.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components. \n\n1. **Woman's Double Team**: This refers to the women's doubles category in the table.\n2. **Players on the Team**: The team should consist of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey.\n3. **Competitor**: Jamie Van Hooijdonk is competing in the men's singles.\n\nI'll start by looking for rows where Jamie Van Hooijdonk is involved in the men's singles. Scanning through each row:\n\n- In 2009, under \"men's singles\", we see \"jamie van hooijdonk\" and his opponent is \"sarah thomas.\" So this is the relevant row.\n\nNext, I need to check the women's doubles for that same year (2009). The women's doubles in 2009 is listed as \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\" This matches exactly with the team mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait a second, the name \"carolina harvey\" might be misspelled. In the table, under 2009, it's spelled as \"caroline harvey,\" not \"carolina.\" Does that matter? The claim uses \"carolina,\" which is different. If the names don't match exactly, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut looking again, maybe it's a typo. Let me check other instances of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey together in women's doubles:\n\n- In 2008, women's doubles are \"vikki jones nicole walkley.\"\n- In 2010, it's \"caroline harvey carissa turner.\"\n\nSo only in 2009 do we have Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey as a team. However, the claim specifies \"carolina,\" which is not exactly \"caroline.\" This discrepancy could mean the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The table has \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\" in 2009 women's doubles. The claim says \"kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey.\" If \"carolina\" is a typo for \"caroline,\" then it might still be considered correct, but usually, names are spelled consistently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table uses different spellings, and \"carolina\" is acceptable. But in the table, it's \"caroline,\" so the claim might have an error here.\n\nBut let me focus on the columns again. The relevant cells should include:\n\n- The row where Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes (men's singles) which is 2009.\n- The women's doubles team in that same year, which is Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be:\n- Row index 9 (assuming rows start at 0), column \"men's singles.\"\n- Row index 9, column \"women's doubles.\"\n\nWait, no, looking back, the table has 10 rows from 2000 to 2010. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: 2000\nRow 1: 2001\n...\nRow 9: 2009\n\nYes, so row index 9 is 2009.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"men's singles\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"}\n\nNow, checking the claim again. It says that when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles, there is a women's double team of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey.\n\nIn row 9 (2009), under men's singles: jamie van hooijdonk\nUnder women's doubles: kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\n\nThe claim mentions \"carolina harvey,\" but the table has \"caroline harvey.\" This is a discrepancy. If the names are supposed to match exactly, then the claim is incorrect. However, if it's just a slight variation in spelling, perhaps it's acceptable. But typically, such details matter.\n\nGiven that the table uses \"caroline,\" not \"carolina,\" the claim has an error. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because the team isn't as stated.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"men's singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the womens double team, kerry ann sheppard and caroline harvey compete in the same year as when jamie van hooijdonk compete in men single.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. **Womens Double Team**: Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey are part of the womens doubles team.\n2. **Year**: They compete in the same year that Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in the mens singles.\n\nSo, I need to find the years when both these individuals are present in their respective categories.\n\nStarting with the Womens Double Team: Looking at the table, each row represents a season from 2000 to 2010. The column for Womens Doubles is \"womens doubles\". I'll look through this column for both Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\n- **Kerry Ann Sheppard**: Scanning the table, in 2009 (row index 8), under womens doubles, we have \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\". So they are a team in 2009.\n  \n- **Caroline Harvey**: Similarly, looking for her name. In 2009 (row index 8), it's part of the same entry as Kerry Ann Sheppard. Also, Caroline appears again in 2008 under womens doubles as \"caroline harvey\" paired with someone else, but I think that's another team.\n\nSo, their Womens Double team is active in 2009.\n\nNow, Jamie Van Hooijdonk: Looking at the Mens Singles column. His name is \"jamie van hooijdonk\". Checking each row:\n\n- In 2009 (row index 8), under mens singles, it's his name.\n  \nSo, Jamie competes in men singles in 2009.\n\nTherefore, both the Womens Double team of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey, and Jamie Van Hooijdonk are active in the same year, which is 2009. That makes the claim TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For Womens Doubles in 2009: row index 8, column_name \"womens doubles\".\n- For Mens Singles in 2009: row index 8, column_name \"mens singles\".\n\nSo, these are the relevant cells that support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be zero woman's double team that compete when jamie van hooijdonk compete.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It\u2019s about women's doubles teams competing when Jamie Van Hooijdonk is involved. So, I need to check for rows where Jamie Van Hooijdonk is part of a competition, specifically in the women's doubles column, and see if any other woman's doubles team exists in those rows.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the 'season' column for 2009 since that's when Jamie Van Hooijdonk first appears. In row 2009 (row_index: 8), under 'women's doubles', we have Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey. So, there is a women's doubles team present.\n\nNext, I'll check if there are any other rows where Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in women's singles or mixed doubles, but the key here is to see if any women's doubles teams exist alongside his participation. \n\nLooking further, in row 2010 (row_index: 9), Jamie isn't listed in any of the columns except 'men's singles' where it says Irwansyah, but wait, that might be a different person. Wait, no\u2014looking back, in row 2010, under men's singles, it's Irwansyah, so Jamie is not competing there. So perhaps the only relevant row is 2009.\n\nIn row 2009, women's doubles have two players, so the claim that zero woman's double teams compete when Jamie competes would be false because in 2009, when he was playing, there was a women's doubles team.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
