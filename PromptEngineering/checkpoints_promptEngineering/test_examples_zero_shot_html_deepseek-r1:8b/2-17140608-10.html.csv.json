    "claim": "paul pierce lead the team in point for 5 of the 7 game",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim that Paul Pierce led his team in points for five out of seven games is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a game, and each column provides different statistics. The relevant columns for this claim would be the ones related to scoring, specifically points per game. From the table headers, the score is listed as \"score\" and the high points are in the \"high points\" column. So, I need to check the 'high points' column for each game where Paul Pierce scored.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Game 76: High points are by Paul Pierce with 32.\n2. Game 77: High points are by Paul Pierce with 21.\n3. Game 78: High points are by Rajaon Rondo, not Paul Pierce.\n4. Game 79: High points are by Paul Pierce with 28.\n5. Game 80: High points are by Paul Pierce with 14.\n6. Game 81: High points are shared between Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury, not Paul Pierce.\n7. Game 82: High points are by Glen Davis, not Paul Pierce.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times Paul Pierce was the sole or highest scorer. From the above, games 76, 77, and 79 have Paul as the sole top scorer. That's three games. Games where he didn't lead include game 78 (Rondo), game 80 (Paul but others also scored?), wait no, in game 80, Paul is the only one with high points? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, for each row, the 'high points' column lists who had the most points. So, if it's listed as \"paul pierce (32)\", that means he was the highest scorer. If it's someone else or multiple people, then Paul didn't lead alone.\n\nSo in game 80: High points are Paul with 14, but is there anyone else? The entry says \"paul pierce (14)\", so he was the sole top scorer here as well. So that would make four games where Paul led alone.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nGame 76: Paul - yes\nGame 77: Paul - yes\nGame 78: Rondo - no\nGame 79: Paul - yes\nGame 80: Paul - yes (only him)\nGame 81: Others - no\nGame 82: Glen Davis - no\n\nWait, that's games 76,77,79,80. That's four games where Paul was the sole leader in points.\n\nSo the claim says he led in five of seven games. But according to my count, it's only four games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI need to mark which cells are relevant. The 'high points' column is key here. Each row's high points cell needs to be checked if Paul is listed as leading alone.\n\nSo, for each game where Paul is the sole leader, those rows (their 'high points' cells) are relevant. Let me list them:\n\nGame 76: yes\nGame 77: yes\nGame 79: yes\nGame 80: yes\n\nThat's four games, so their row indices are 0,1,4,5.\n\nWait, the table has rows from 0 to 6 (since there are seven games). So the relevant rows are:\n\nRow 0: game 76\nRow 1: game 77\nRow 4: game 80\nRow 5: game 81? No, wait no. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the table, each row is numbered as per their order in the tbody. Let me list them with indices:\n\n0: game 76\n1: game 77\n2: game 78\n3: game 79\n4: game 80\n5: game 81\n6: game 82\n\nSo for Paul leading alone, it's games 76 (row 0), 77 (row1), 79 (row3), and 80 (row4). So the relevant cells are in columns 'high points' of these rows.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should be:\n\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\" }\n]\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the table, each row corresponds to a game number as per their order. So row 0 is game 76, row1:77, etc. So for rows 0,1,3,4 (games 76,77,79,80), Paul was the sole high scorer.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells are those four cells in the 'high points' column across these rows.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I analyzed each game's high points and found that Paul Pierce led in only four out of seven games. Thus, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are the 'high points' for those four games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "rajon rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim \"rajon rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It mentions Rajaon Rondo having the most assists with a number of 12 in one game for the Celtics. So, I need to check if there's any row where Rondo has exactly 12 assists.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The relevant columns here are \"high assists,\" which shows the player's assist numbers for that game.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: High assists for Rondo is 9.\n- Row 1: Rondo has 6 assists.\n- Row 2: He has 12 assists, but wait, in this case, it's noted as \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\", so does that mean Rondo had 12 or was it a combined total? No, I think it's per player. So maybe Rondo had 12 here.\n- Wait, no, let me check again. In row 2, the \"high assists\" column says \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\", which might indicate that both players have their assists listed, with Rondo having a higher number. Maybe he had 12? Or is it split?\n\nWait, in other rows like row 4 and others, the \"high assists\" are just single player names with numbers, but here in row 2, it's listed as two players with their assist counts. So perhaps Rondo had 12 assists in that game.\n\nBut then I look at row 4: high assists for Rondo is 8. So if in row 2 he has 12, and no other row shows him with more than 12, maybe the claim is referring to that specific game where he had 12.\n\nWait, but looking back, in row 2, the \"high assists\" column says \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\". So perhaps Rondo alone didn't have 12, but combined with Marbury? That would be 12 total. But I think each player's stats are listed separately, so maybe Rondo had 12 on his own.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way it's written is that both Rondo and Marbury contributed to the assists, making the total for the team higher, but perhaps Rondo alone didn't reach 12 in any game. Let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Rondo has 9\n- Row1:6\n- Row2: Maybe he had 12? But it's written as \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\". So perhaps that total is 16, but per player, maybe Rondo didn't have 12.\n- Row3: He has 10\n- Row4:8\n- Row5:6\n- Row6: He has 12? Wait no, in row6, the high rebounds are 13, and assists for Rondo is 8.\n\nWait, I think I might be mixing up rows. Let me list them properly:\n\nRow numbers as per HTML (starting from 0):\n\n0: April1: Rondo 9\n1: April3:6\n2: April8: possibly 12? Or combined?\n3: April10:10\n4: April12:6\n5: April14:12? No, in row5, high assists are \"tony allen , stephon marbury (5)\", so Rondo didn't have 12.\n6: April15:8\n\nWait, no. In row2, the high rebounds column says \"rajon rondo , kendrick perkins , mikki moore (9)\" \u2013 that's for rebounds. The high assists in row2 is \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\", which probably means Rondo had 12 and Marbury had 5, making the total assists 17 for the team? Or perhaps it's just listing both players, but their individual stats.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Each column is per player, so in row2, high assists are for each player. So if it says \"rajon rondo , stephon marbury (5)\", maybe Rondo had 12 and Marbury 5. That would mean Rondo had 12 assists in that game.\n\nBut let me check other rows to see if any have a higher number of assists by Rondo.\n\nIn row0:9, row1:6, row2:12 (if that's the case), row3:10, row4:8, row5:6, row6:8. So the highest assist count for Rondo is 12 in row2.\n\nTherefore, there is a game where he had 12 assists, so the claim could be considered TRUE if it refers to any single game. However, the claim says \"the most\" which implies that he had more than others in that game. But since in row2, he's tied with Marbury for 5, perhaps he didn't have a unique highest.\n\nWait, no, in that row, the high assists are listed as both players' stats. So maybe Rondo had 12 and Marbury had 5, making him the highest in that game.\n\nTherefore, it seems there is at least one game where Rondo had 12 assists for the Celtics.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there exists a row where Rajaon Rondo had 12 assists in a single game. The relevant cell is found in row 2 under the \"high assists\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"High Assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic win all of the game they play at td bank north garden",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the celtic win all of the game they play at td banknorth garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that whenever the Celtics play a game at TD Banknorth Garden, they win every time. So, I should check all games listed in the table where the location is \"td banknorth garden\" and see if the result is a win for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc. The location column mentions \"td banknorth garden\" in some rows but not all. For example, row 0 has \"td banknorth garden\" as the location and the result is a win (57 - 19). Similarly, row 1 also shows a win with the same location.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row to check the outcome:\n\n- Row 0: Celtics vs Charlotte, played at TD Banknorth Garden. Score is w 111 - 109 (2ot), so they won.\n- Row 1: Celtics vs Atlanta, again at TD Banknorth Garden, and they won with a score of w 104 - 92 (ot).\n- Row 2: The location is \"td banknorth garden\", but the game is against New Jersey. However, in the table, row 2's team is Charlotte? Wait no, looking back, row indices start at 0. Let me correct that:\n  - Row 0: April 1 vs Charlotte\n  - Row 1: April 3 vs Atlanta\n  - Row 2: April 8 vs New Jersey (location same as previous rows)\n  - So in row 2, Celtics played against New Jersey at TD Banknorth Garden and won.\n- Row 3: April 10 vs Miami, also at TD Banknorth Garden, they won.\n- Then there are some rows with different locations. For example, row 4 is Cleveland, which is a loss. But location is Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, I see that the first six games have the same location, TD Banknorth Garden, except for row 4 and 5, which have different locations.\n\nBut the claim is about games at TD Banknorth Garden only. So let me focus on rows where the location is \"td banknorth garden\".\n\nLooking back:\n\nRows with location as \"td banknorth garden\" are rows 0,1,2,3,4? Wait no, row 4's location is Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nWait in the table, after row 3 (April 10 vs Miami), row 4 is April 12 vs Cleveland, and the location is Quicken Loans Arena. So only rows 0-3 have TD Banknorth Garden as the location.\n\nSo, for these four games:\n\n- Row 0: Win\n- Row 1: Win\n- Row 2: Win\n- Row 3: Win\n\nThat's all the games at TD Banknorth Garden in the table. All of them are wins. So if this is all the data provided, then yes, Celtics won all their games at that venue.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there aren't any other rows with the same location but different outcomes. Let me check each row's location:\n\nRow 0: td banknorth garden - Win\nRow 1: td banknorth garden - Win\nRow 2: td banknorth garden - Win\nRow 3: td banknorth garden - Win\nRow 4: Quicken Loans Arena - Loss\nRow 5: Wachovia Center - Win (but Celtics are playing in this location, not as home)\nWait no, row 5 is April 14 vs Philadelphia at Wachovia Center. The result is a win, but the location is different. So it's not relevant for the claim.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 is April 15 vs Washington at TD Banknorth Garden, and they won, but that's in row 6, which I might have missed earlier. Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait the table has rows from 76 to 82, so six rows? Or more? Let me count again.\n\nEach <tr> is a row, starting from 0 to maybe 7 or so? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the provided HTML table structure, each game is a row. The first few are:\n\n- Game 76: April 01 vs Charlotte (win)\n- Game 77: April 03 vs Atlanta (win)\n- Game 78: April 08 vs New Jersey (win)\n- Game 79: April 10 vs Miami (win)\n- Game 80: April 12 vs Cleveland (loss)\n- Game 81: April 14 vs Philadelphia (win)\n- Game 82: April 15 vs Washington (win)\n\nWait, so rows 0 to 6 correspond to games 76 to 82.\n\nSo, in the table:\n\nRow 0: TD Banknorth Garden, Win\nRow 1: TD Banknorth Garden, Win\nRow 2: TD Banknorth Garden, Win\nRow 3: TD Banknorth Garden, Win\nRow 4: Quicken Loans Arena, Loss\nRow 5: Wachovia Center, Win (away game)\nRow 6: TD Banknorth Garden, Win\n\nSo rows where location is \"td banknorth garden\" are 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nEach of these rows has the result as a win for the Celtics. Therefore, in all games they played at TD Banknorth Garden within this dataset, they won.\n\nSince there's no data showing a loss in any of their home games at that venue, the claim holds TRUE based on the given information.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}]}",

    "claim": "the celtic win 6 of their 7 game during this stretch",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the celtic win 6 of their 7 game during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the Celtics are referred to here as \"celtic\" with a lowercase 'c'. I should check if that's a typo because in the table, the team names are capitalized like \"Charlotte,\" \"Atlanta,\" etc. Maybe it's a mistake, so I'll consider both possibilities: whether the team name is case-sensitive or not.\n\nNext, the claim says they won 6 out of 7 games during this stretch. So I need to look at each game in the table and count how many times the Celtics (assuming that's the correct team) won.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, etc. The 'game' column has numbers from 76 to 82, which likely correspond to the sequence of games. The 'record' column shows their win-loss record after each game, but that might be cumulative or per game.\n\nWait, in the table, the 'score' cell sometimes ends with a 'w' for wins and 'l' for losses, followed by the score and possibly (ot) for overtime. For example, row 76 has \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\" indicating a win. Similarly, row 80 shows a loss.\n\nSo each 'record' entry is their current record after that game, but I'm not sure if it's cumulative or per game. However, the 'score' column directly tells us if they won each individual game. So for each row, I should check whether the team (which I assume is Celtics) won or lost.\n\nBut wait, in the table, the team names are like \"charlotte,\" \"atlanta,\" etc., which don't match \"celtic.\" Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the table is about a different team, and there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps \"celtic\" is another name for the Boston Celtics.\n\nWait, no, in the table, the teams are opponents like Charlotte, Atlanta, New Jersey, Miami, etc. So maybe the claim refers to these teams as Celtics? That doesn't make sense because the opponents' names don't include Celtics. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting; maybe \"celtic\" is a nickname for another team.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, in the table, each row lists a game, date, opponent (like Charlotte), and then details. So the 'team' column is the opponent's name. Wait no, wait: in the table, the first cell is 'game,' then 'date,' 'team,' which would be the home team? Or is it the away team?\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify the structure of the table. The columns are:\n\n- game\n- date\n- team\n- score\n- high points\n- high rebounds\n- high assists\n- location attendance\n- record\n\nSo in each row, 'team' refers to the opponent they played against. For example, in row 76, the team is \"charlotte,\" so that's the opponent, and the Celtics (if that's the home team) won with a score of 111-109.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the 'record' column indicates their overall record or per game. Let me check:\n\nIn row 76, after the game, the record is \"57 - 19.\" The next row, 77, it's \"58 - 19,\" and so on up to row 82 where it's \"62 - 20.\" So this seems like their overall win-loss record, not per game.\n\nBut the 'score' column shows whether they won or lost each game with a 'w' or 'l.' So perhaps I should count how many times they won in the games listed.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 76: Game 76, April 1 vs Charlotte. Score is \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\" \u2013 so win.\nRow 77: April 3 vs Atlanta. Score \"w 104 - 92 (ot)\" \u2013 win.\nRow 78: April 8 vs New Jersey. Score \"w 106 - 104 (ot)\" \u2013 win.\nRow 79: April 9 vs Miami, score not shown but row 80 is a loss.\nWait, let's list all rows:\n\nRow index as per the example starts at 0. So row 0 is game 76, row1=77, etc.\n\nSo from row 0 to row6 (since there are 7 games):\n\nGame 76: win\nGame77: win\nGame78: win\nGame79: Not shown in table? Or perhaps I miscounted. Wait the table has rows up to game82, which is the 7th game.\n\nWait, let's count each row:\n\n- Row0: Game76, W\n- Row1: Game77, W\n- Row2: Game78, W\n- Row3: Game79, not sure if it's a win or loss. Wait no, in the table provided, how many rows are there? Let me check.\n\nWait the user provided an HTML table, but I can't see it. Wait no, the initial prompt says \"You are tasked with analyzing the following HTML table...\" but perhaps it's not included here. So perhaps I should assume that all games in the table from 76 to 82 are Celtics' games, and they won most.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'team' column refers to the opponent, so if the Celtics are playing against these teams, then their wins would be when the score starts with 'w.'\n\nWait, but without knowing which team is the home or away, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps each row represents a game where the Celtics played and whether they won.\n\nSo in this case:\n\nRow0: Win\nRow1: Win\nRow2: Win\nRow3: Loss (because in row80, which would be row4? Wait no, from 76 to82 is 7 games.\n\nWait, let's see. The 'game' numbers are 76,77,78,79,80,81,82 \u2013 seven games.\n\nNow looking at each game:\n\n- Game76: W\n- Game77: W\n- Game78: W\n- Game79: I don't know the score, but from row3 onwards, maybe it's a loss?\nWait no, perhaps better to count all 'w' in the 'score' column.\n\nSo looking for cells in 'score' that start with 'w':\n\nRow0: w 111 - 109 \u2013 W\nRow1: w 104 -92 \u2013 W\nRow2: w106-104 \u2013 W\nRow3: I don't know, but let's assume it's a loss because the next rows have increasing losses.\nWait no, in row80 (which is game80), the score is \"l 98 -102\" \u2013 L.\n\nSimilarly, game81: Not sure, perhaps another L. And game82: also L.\n\nSo total wins would be games76,77,78, and maybe79?\n\nBut without seeing all rows, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the table provided by the user, the Celtics (if that's the team) won 6 out of 7 games.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each row as a game where the 'team' is the opponent, and if the score shows 'w,' then the Celtics won.\n\nSo:\n\nGame76: W\nGame77: W\nGame78: W\nGame79: L (assuming based on later rows)\nGame80: L\nGame81: L\nGame82: L\n\nThat would mean they only won 3 games, which contradicts the claim of winning 6/7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting 'team' as their opponents. So if the team is playing against these opponents and has a win, then:\n\nWait, but without knowing which team is the Celtics, it's confusing. Maybe the table lists the Celtics as one of the teams, but in this case, the opponents are other teams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'team' column refers to their own team, so when they won, that's a victory.\n\nSo in each row, if the score starts with 'w,' then it's a win. So:\n\nLooking at each row's 'score':\n\nRow0: w 111-109 \u2013 W\nRow1: w104-92 \u2013 W\nRow2: w106-104 \u2013 W\nRow3: Let's see, in the provided table, perhaps the next rows are losses.\n\nWait, but without seeing all the rows, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that in each game from 76 to82, the Celtics won except for one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the 'record' column, which shows their cumulative wins and losses after each game. So:\n\nRow0: 57-19 \u2013 before game76? That seems low. Or after game76: maybe they were 57-19 before, then 58-19 after a win.\n\nWait no, that doesn't make sense because winning a game would increase wins by1.\n\nSo perhaps the 'record' is cumulative. So each row shows their total W-L up to that point.\n\nIf so, then:\n\nAfter Game76: 57-19 (total wins)\nAfter Game77:58-19\nAfter78:59-19\nEtc., but this can't be right because after 7 games, they'd have too many wins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'record' is per game, which isn't clear. Maybe better to assume that in each row, if the score starts with 'w,' it's a win.\n\nSo from Game76 to82, seven games:\n\nAssuming wins on rows0-5 (6 times) and one loss on row6.\n\nThus total wins=6, losses=1.\n\nHence, claim is correct: 6/7 wins.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that they did indeed win six out of seven games, so the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing an HTML table to determine if a team won six out of seven games. By examining each game's result:\n\n1. **Game 76**: The score starts with 'w', indicating a win.\n2. **Game 77**: The score also starts with 'w'.\n3. **Game 78**: Another win as the score begins with 'w'.\n4. **Game 79**: The score likely indicates a loss, but without the exact data, this is assumed based on subsequent results.\n5. **Game 80**: Clear loss, as the score starts with 'l'.\n6. **Game 81**: Another loss, inferred from pattern.\n7. **Game 82**: Final loss, confirmed by score.\n\nTotal wins: 3 (Games 76, 77, 78). This contradicts the claim of six wins. However, considering possible missing data or misinterpretation, it's uncertain without full access to the table.\n\n**Answer**: The claim that the team won six out of seven games cannot be definitively confirmed based on the provided information.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the highest point total for a Celtic player in one game be 32 by Paul Pierce.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need verification from the table. The key points are:\n1. Highest point total in one game.\n2. By a Celtic player.\n3. Equal to 32 points.\n4. Named player: Paul Pierce.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a game with details like date, team, score, and individual player statistics such as high points, rebounds, and assists.\n\nI need to check if there's any instance where a Celtic player scored 32 points in a single game. From the table, I can look through the 'high points' column for each row where the team is the Celtics (Boston?) or if it specifies which team each game belongs to.\n\nWait, the table has teams like Charlotte, Atlanta, New Jersey, Miami, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Washington. But I'm assuming that \"Celtic\" refers to the Boston Celtics. However, in the table, the teams listed don't include Boston Celtics. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me check the 'team' column.\n\nLooking at the first row: team is Charlotte. Second: Atlanta. Third: New Jersey (which might be the Nets). Fourth: Miami. Fifth: Cleveland. Sixth: Philadelphia. Seventh: Washington. So none of these are the Boston Celtics. Does that mean there are no relevant data points? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table.\n\nWait, maybe \"Celtic\" in the claim refers to a player's nickname or something else, but in basketball, the term \"Celtics\" typically refers to the team, not individual players. So if the claim is about a Celtics player, perhaps it's referring to the Boston Celtics, which aren't listed here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes all games involving these teams, and I need to check if any of their players scored 32 points in a game, regardless of the team. But then, the claim specifies \"for a Celtic player,\" so perhaps the player must be associated with the Celtics.\n\nBut given that none of the games in the table are against the Celtics, maybe there's no relevant data here. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look at each row for 'high points' and see if any player scored 32 points:\n\nRow 0: Paul Pierce (32)\nRow 1: Paul Pierce (21)\nRow 2: Raja Rondo (31)\nRow 3: Paul Pierce (28)\nRow 4: Paul Pierce (14)\nRow 5: Paul Pierce (31)\nRow 6: Glen Davis (21)\nRow 7: No player with 32 points.\n\nSo in row 0, the game number is 76, against Charlotte, Paul Pierce scored 32 points. But if the claim is about a Celtic player, but the table doesn't show any games for the Celtics, then this might be irrelevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if the team in that game was the Celtics. But the teams listed are Charlotte, Atlanta, New Jersey (Nets), Miami, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Washington. So none of these are the Boston Celtics. Therefore, if the claim is about a Celtic player's game, but all games in the table are against other teams, then there might not be any relevant data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Celtic\" refers to a specific player's name or nickname, which I'm not aware of. But in general, \"Celtics\" refer to the team, so unless it's about a Celtic player on another team, like if Paul Pierce was part of another Celtics team, but he's usually associated with Boston.\n\nWait, looking at row 0: the game is against Charlotte, and the high points are by Paul Pierce (32). So if the claim is that in one of their games, a Celtic player scored 32, but since this game isn't against the Celtics, perhaps it's not relevant. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"Celtic\" in the claim refers to a Boston Celtics player, and since the table doesn't include any games involving the Celtics, then there are no data points to support or deny the claim. Therefore, the answer would be false because there's no evidence in the provided data.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"in one game,\" so if any game in the table has a player scoring 32 points who is a Celtic, regardless of the opponent, then it's true. But since Paul Pierce was a Celtics player, and he scored 32 against Charlotte (which is not the Celtics), maybe that's still relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes all games played by these teams, including when they were Celtics? No, the team names are specific: Charlotte, Atlanta, etc., which are separate from the Celtics. So perhaps there's no data point where a Celtic player scored 32 in a game, as per the given table.\n\nWait, let me re-express this:\n\n- The claim is about a Celtic (Boston Celtics) player scoring 32 points in one game.\n- Looking at the 'high points' column for all rows:\n  - Row 0: Paul Pierce scored 32 against Charlotte. Since he was a Celtics player, but the game is against Charlotte, not the Celtics, so it's not against his own team.\n  - Therefore, perhaps this isn't considered as a game for the Celtics.\n\nSo maybe there are no games in the table where a Boston Celtic player scored 32 points against their opponents. Thus, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, if the term \"Celtic\" doesn't refer to the team but to an individual, like a player's nickname, then perhaps it's referring to Paul Pierce, and his 32-point game exists. But since the table includes that, then maybe it's true.\n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake in the team names or perhaps \"Celtic\" refers to someone else. Alternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete.\n\nBut based on the information given, the answer would be false because there are no games in the table where a Celtics player scored 32 points against their opponent (since none of the games are against the Celtics). Therefore, the relevant cells would be those where Paul Pierce scored 32, but if that's not considered a game for the Celtics, then it's irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. If the claim is about any Celtic player (regardless of team), then yes, Paul Pierce did score 32 points in a game, so the answer would be true with relevant cells pointing to row 0, column 'high points'.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Celtic\" refers to the team, but since the game isn't against them, it's not applicable. Therefore, there are no games where a Celtics player scored 32 points in the table, making the claim false.\n\nI think I'm stuck between two interpretations: whether the term \"Celtic\" refers to the team or an individual player. If it's the team, then the answer is false because none of their players scored 32 against them. If it's about any Celtic player (like Paul Pierce), regardless of opponent, then yes, he did score 32.\n\nGiven that in basketball, \"Celtics\" typically refer to the team, but if the claim is about a specific player named Celtic or associated with Celtics, like Paul Pierce, then his scoring is relevant. But since the table includes his game against Charlotte where he scored 32, and he was a Celtics player, perhaps that's the intended data point.\n\nTherefore, even though the opponent isn't the Celtics, if the claim is about any player who identifies as Celtic or plays for the Celtics, then row 0 would be relevant. So the answer would be TRUE with the relevant cell pointing to Paul Pierce in row 0.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"paul pierce lead the team in point for 6 of the 7 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that Paul Pierce was the leading scorer for his team in 6 out of 7 games listed in the table. So, my task is to check each game and see if Paul Pierce indeed led in points for at least 6 of these.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 7 rows corresponding to games 76 through 82. Each row has a 'score' column that shows the result of the game, but more importantly, the 'high points' column lists the player(s) with the most points in that game.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. **Game 76**: The high points are listed as Paul Pierce (32). So, he led this game.\n2. **Game 77**: High points are Paul Pierce (21). He led again.\n3. **Game 78**: Rajo\u0144 Rondo is listed with 31 points, and there's mention of others but Rondo leads here. So, Paul didn't lead in this game.\n4. **Game 79**: Paul Pierce scored 28 points, leading the team.\n5. **Game 80**: High points are Paul Pierce (14). He led again.\n6. **Game 81**: High points are Paul Pierce (31). He leads here as well.\n7. **Game 82**: Glen Davis is listed with 21 points, so Paul didn't lead in this game.\n\nNow, counting the games where Paul led:\n\n- Games 76: Yes\n- 77: Yes\n- 78: No\n- 79: Yes\n- 80: Yes\n- 81: Yes\n- 82: No\n\nSo that's a total of 5 games where Paul Pierce was the leading scorer. The claim states he led in 6 out of 7, but it looks like he only did so in 5 games.\n\nWait, let me double-check Game 78 and Game 82 to make sure I didn't misread them. In Game 78, Rajo\u0144 Rondo is clearly the highest with 31 points, so Paul didn't lead there. And in Game 82, Glen Davis has 21 points, which seems to be the high for that game.\n\nTherefore, Paul led in 5 games, not 6. That means the claim is FALSE because it's incorrect to say he did so in 6 out of 7.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"Paul Pierce lead the team in point for 6 of the 7 game\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze each game in the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant column to check is 'high points' since it indicates who scored the most points in each game.\n2. **Review Each Game**:\n   - **Game 76**: Paul Pierce (32) led.\n   - **Game 77**: Paul Pierce (21) led.\n   - **Game 78**: Rajo\u0144 Rondo (31) led, so Paul didn't.\n   - **Game 79**: Paul Pierce (28) led.\n   - **Game 80**: Paul Pierce (14) led.\n   - **Game 81**: Paul Pierce (31) led.\n   - **Game 82**: Glen Davis (21) led, so Paul didn't.\n\n3. **Count Leading Games**: Paul leads in games 76, 77, 79, 80, and 81\u2014total of 5 games, not 6.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because Paul Pierce only led the team in 5 out of the 7 games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"kendrick perkins have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the task step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand the claim. It's stating that Kendrick Perkins had the highest number of assists with 12 in a single game for the Celtics. So, I need to find if there's any row in the table where Kendrick Perkins has 12 assists for the Celtics in one game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns relevant here are \"high assists,\" since that's where the number of assists would be listed. The other columns like \"game,\" \"date,\" etc., can help identify if it's about the Celtics and whether Perkins is the player involved.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Game 76, April 1 vs Charlotte. High assists are Rondo with 9.\n2. **Row 1**: Game 77, April 3 vs Atlanta. High assists are Rondo with 6.\n3. **Row 2**: Game 78, April 8 vs New Jersey. High assists are Rondo and Perkins each with 9? Wait, the column says \"rajon rondo , kendrick perkins , mikki moore (9)\". Hmm, that might mean each player had 9 or it's a combined total. But since it's in parentheses, maybe it's Rondo with 9, Perkins with 9 as well?\n4. **Row 3**: Game 79, April 10 vs Miami. High assists are Rondo with 12.\n5. **Row 4**: Game 80, April 12 vs Cleveland. High assists are Rondo and others with 6.\n6. **Row 5**: Game 81, April 14 vs Philadelphia. High assists are Allen and Marbury each with 5.\n7. **Row 6**: Game 82, April 15 vs Washington. High assists are Marbury with 8.\n\nNow, looking for any row where Kendrick Perkins has 12 assists. From the table, I don't see any row where \"high assists\" is 12 and attributed to Kendrick Perkins. The closest is in Row 2, but it's unclear if that's a total or each player had 9. It seems more likely that Rondo and others each had 9, not Perkins.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about the maximum number of assists by any Celtics player in one game where Perkins played. So I should also check if in any game, Perkins had the highest assist count for the Celtics, even if others have higher.\n\nBut the specific claim says \"kendrick perkins have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game.\" So it's a specific number, 12, and he is the one with the most. Looking at the table:\n\n- In Row 3, Game 79, Perkins has 10 assists.\n- In other games, Perkins' assists are lower except in Row 2 where it's unclear.\n\nI don't see any game where Perkins had 12 assists. The highest I see is Rondo with 12 in Row 3, but that's for the Celtics against Miami? Wait, no\u2014looking again: row 3 is Game 79, which is vs Miami, and the location is td banknorth garden, which is where the Celtics play (Boston). So yes, that game was played by the Celtics.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 3, high assists are Rondo with 12. So Rondo had more assists than Perkins in that game. Therefore, Perkins didn't have the most assists that game.\n\nLooking again at the claim: it's about Perkins having 12 assists as the highest in one game for the Celtics. From the table, I don't see any such instance. The closest is Row 3 where Rondo has 12, and in other games, Perkins has lower numbers.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because there's no game where Perkins had 12 assists as the highest for the Celtics.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kendrick Perkins had 12 assists in a single game for the Celtics. However, examining each game, none show Perkins with 12 assists; Rondo has 12 in one game. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the structure of the data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details: game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location/attendance, and record. The claim is about the Celtics losing 6 out of their 7 games in this stretch. So, I should focus on the 'team' column to see which teams are playing and whether they're losing.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 76**: Team is Charlotte. They won.\n2. **Row 77**: Team is Atlanta. They won.\n3. **Row 78**: Team is New Jersey. They won.\n4. **Row 79**: Team is Miami. They won.\n5. **Row 80**: Team is Cleveland. They lost.\n6. **Row 81**: Team is Philadelphia. They won.\n7. **Row 82**: Team is Washington. They won.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up to 6 losses. Let me recount: Only Row 80 shows a loss, so only one loss in seven games. That means the claim's assertion of six losses isn't supported by the data provided here.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are other rows or perhaps misinterpretation. However, looking at all seven rows, only row 80 has a loss for the Celtics. The rest are wins against different teams.\n\nAdditionally, the 'record' column shows the overall win-loss record, but it's cumulative, not per game. For example, after game 82, they have 62-20, which is their season total, not just these seven games.\n\nTherefore, there's only one loss in the given stretch of seven games.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the Celtics lose all of the games they play at TD Banknorth Garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim suggests that whenever the Celtics play a game at TD Banknorth Garden, they lose. So, I need to check if in all such games listed in the table, the result is a loss for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, etc. The location column includes \"td banknorth garden\" which matches the venue in the claim.\n\nNext, I need to look through each row where the location is TD Banknorth Garden and check the game result. The Celtics are playing at this venue when their team name is listed as 'celtic' or 'Celtics'? Wait, looking at the table data:\n\nIn the first few rows, the 'team' column lists \"charlotte\", \"atlanta\", etc., which are opposing teams. When does it list the Celtics? Let's see:\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Game 76: Opponent is Charlotte; location is TD Banknorth Garden.\nWait, no, in this table, the team refers to the home team? Or is it the opponent?\n\nWait, actually, the 'team' column might be the home team because the game results are listed as \"w\" for win and \"l\" for loss. For example, Game 76: team is Charlotte, score is w 111-109, so Charlotte won. So if the Celtics were playing at TD Banknorth Garden, they would be the away team? Or is it that when the game is at TD Banknorth Garden, the home team is listed as, say, Boston Celtics?\n\nWait, no, in the table, I don't see any row where the home team is the Celtics. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 76: Team is Charlotte; location is TD Banknorth Garden. So that's Charlotte playing at TD Banknorth Garden.\n\nRow 77: Atlanta is the team; same location.\n\nRow 78: New Jersey.\n\nRow 79: Miami.\n\nRow 80: Cleveland, but location is Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nWait, no, row 80's location is Quicken Loans Arena. So in that case, when Celtics play at TD Banknorth Garden, are they listed as the home team?\n\nLooking again:\n\nI need to find rows where the location is \"td banknorth garden\" and see what the result is for the Celtics.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, I don't see any row where the home team is Boston Celtics. For example, the teams listed are Charlotte, Atlanta, New Jersey, Miami, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Washington. So perhaps in this context, TD Banknorth Garden is not being used by the Celtics as their home court.\n\nWait, that might be a key point. If in the table, there are no games where the Celtics are playing at TD Banknorth Garden, then the claim would automatically be TRUE because they didn't lose any such games.\n\nAlternatively, if the Celtics did play some games at that venue and lost all of them, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 76: Team is Charlotte, location TD Banknorth Garden. Score is w, so Charlotte won.\n\nRow 77: Atlanta, same location, won.\n\nRow 78: New Jersey, same location, won.\n\nRow 79: Miami, same location, won.\n\nRow 80: Cleveland, different location, and they lost.\n\nSo wait, in the table provided, there are no games where the Celtics are playing at TD Banknorth Garden. Therefore, the claim is that they lose all their games there, but since they didn't play any such games, it's technically TRUE because they didn't have any opportunity to lose or win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the team names. If 'celtic' in the table refers to the Celtics, then perhaps looking for rows where the home team is 'celtic'.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 76: Team is Charlotte; no.\n\nRow 77: Atlanta.\n\nRow 78: New Jersey.\n\nRow 79: Miami.\n\nRow 80: Cleveland.\n\nNone of these are Celtics. So the Celtics aren't playing any games at TD Banknorth Garden in this table, meaning they didn't have any losses there.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they lose all their games at that venue is TRUE because there's no evidence to the contrary, as they didn't play any games there.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. The claim says \"the Celtics lose all of the games they play at TD Banknorth Garden.\" If the Celtics didn't play any games there, then the statement is vacuously true. In logic, an implication where the premise is false makes the entire statement true.\n\nSo in this case, since the Celtics didn't play any games at TD Banknorth Garden, they didn't lose any such games, making the claim TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if in reality, the Celtics did play some games there and lost all, but in this table, they haven't. So based on the data provided, the statement is TRUE because there are no counterexamples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells would be those where location is TD Banknorth Garden to check if any games were played by Celtics.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"the Celtics lose all of the games they play at TD Banknorth Garden\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze each row where the venue is \"td banknorth garden.\" The table shows that none of these games are played by the Celtics. Since no games were played, the statement holds as vacuously true.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:** The cells where the location is \"td banknorth garden\" to confirm no Celtics games were played there.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the highest point total for a Celtic player in one game be 32, by Stephon Marbury.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that there's at least one game where a Boston Celtics player named Stephon Marbury scored 32 points in that single game.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists games from 76 to 82, each with details like date, team, score, and individual player statistics including high points, rebounds, and assists. \n\nI need to check if there's any row where Stephon Marbury is listed as the high points scorer with a total of 32 points in any game. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 76: The high points are by Paul Pierce (32). So, not Stephon Marbury.\n\nRow 77: High points by Paul Pierce again, 21 points. Not him.\n\nRow 78: Rajaon Rondo is listed with 31 points. Stephon isn't here.\n\nRow 79: Paul Pierce scores 28. Not Stephon.\n\nRow 80: Paul Pierce again, 14 points. Nope.\n\nRow 81: High points go to Paul Pierce (31). Still not Stephon.\n\nRow 82: Glen Davis is the high scorer with 21 points. No Stephon here either.\n\nWait a second, in row 78, it says \"rajon rondo , kendrick perkins , mikki moore (9)\" under high rebounds. Does that mean Rondo scored 31? Yes, because under high points, it's listed as Rajon Rondo (31). So Stephon isn't mentioned here.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I don't see any instance where Stephon Marbury is credited with a game-high of 32 points. The highest I see him mentioned is in row 81, where he and Tony Allen each have 5 assists, but that's not points.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 76: Paul Pierce, 32 points.\n- Row 77: Paul Pierce, 21.\n- Row 78: Rondo, 31.\n- Row 79: Paul, 28.\n- Row 80: Paul, 14.\n- Row 81: Paul, 31.\n- Row 82: Glen Davis, 21.\n\nNo Stephon with 32 points in any game. So the claim must be false because there's no such instance where Stephon Marbury scored 32 points in a single game as per this table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 78, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n]}",
