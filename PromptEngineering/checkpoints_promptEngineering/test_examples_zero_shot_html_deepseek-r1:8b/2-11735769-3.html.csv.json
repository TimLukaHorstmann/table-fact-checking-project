    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It says that icarly was nominated for more awards than the show won. So, I need to compare the number of nominations icarly received against the number of wins by the show.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents an award ceremony, including the year, award name, category, work, and result (nominated or won). The company or show in question is \"icarly,\" but sometimes it's associated with different shows like \"Tuff Puppy.\"\n\nI'll go through each row where icarly is mentioned:\n\n1. 2009: Teen Choice Awards - nominated\n2. 2010: Australian Kids' Choice Awards - two entries, both for icarly. One was a nomination, and the other was a win.\n3. 2011: UK Kids' Choice Awards - won\n   Another entry in 2011 for Meus Pr\u00e3\u00a3oios Nick Brazil - nominated\n4. 2012: Kids' Choice Awards - nominated\n5. 2013: Daytime Emmy Awards - nominated as Tuff Puppy\n\nNow, I'll count the number of times icarly was nominated and won.\n\nIn 2009: 1 nomination\nIn 2010: 1 win (second row) + 1 nomination (third row)\nWait, in 2010 there are two rows. The second row is for a different award but same year. So, both are 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards. One was a win, the other a nomination. That means in 2010 alone, icarly had 1 win and 1 nomination.\n\nIn 2011: 1 win (UK Kids' Choice)\nAnother entry for Meus Pr\u00e3\u00a3oios Nick Brazil in 2011: that's a different award but same year. So in 2011, icarly had 1 win and 1 nomination from another category.\n\nWait, no, the second row is 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards. The third row is also 2010 for a different award. So for each year, I need to check all entries.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list out all the nominations and wins for icarly across all years:\n\nNominations:\n- 2009: 1\n- 2010 (Australian Kids'): 1\n- 2010 (another category? Wait, no, both are same year but different awards. So in 2010, icarly had one win and one nomination.\nWait, each row is a separate entry. So the second row of 2010 is another award, so icarly was nominated there as well.\n\nSo in 2010, two entries: one where they were nominated, another where they won.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011, two entries: one where they won and another where they were nominated (for Meus Pr\u00e3\u00a3oios).\n\nWait, no, the third row of 2010 is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" which is a win. The fourth row of 2011 is \"nick uk 's funniest person\" which is a win. The fifth row of 2011 is for a different show: Meus Pr\u00e3\u00a3oios Nick Brazil, where icarly was nominated.\n\nSo for each year:\n\n2009: 1 nomination\n2010: 2 entries (1 nom, 1 win)\n2011: 2 entries (1 win, 1 nom in another category)\n2012: 1 nom\n2013: 1 nom as Tuff Puppy\n\nSo total nominations for icarly: 2009 (1) + 2010 (1) + 2011 (1) + 2012 (1) + 2013 (1) = 5 nominations.\n\nTotal wins for icarly: 2010 (1) + 2011 (1) = 2 wins.\n\nSo the claim is that icarly was nominated for more awards than the show won. The show refers to \"icarly,\" but in 2013, it's associated with Tuff Puppy, which also received a nomination.\n\nWait, no, the claim doesn't specify the show; it just says \"the show.\" So I think \"show\" here is referring to icarly. But based on the table, icarly was nominated more times (5) than it won (2). Therefore, the statement that \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is TRUE because they were indeed nominated more.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if \"the show\" refers to a different entity. The table shows icarly being associated with various awards and categories, including Tuff Puppy in 2013. So perhaps the claim is comparing icarly's nominations against its own wins or against another show's wins.\n\nIf \"the show\" is referring to a specific show like Tuff Puppy, then:\n\nicarly (as part of Tuff Puppy) was nominated once in 2013 and won nothing there. So that doesn't help. But overall, icarly has more nominations across all its associated shows than the number of times it won.\n\nWait, but the claim is \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win.\" So perhaps \"the show\" refers to a single entity. If \"the show\" is Tuff Puppy, then in 2013, icarly was nominated once, and Tuff Puppy didn't win anything. So that would make the claim TRUE because icarly had more nominations (1) than Tuff Puppy's wins (0).\n\nBut if \"the show\" refers to icarly itself, then comparing its own nominations and wins: icarly has 5 nominations and 2 wins, so indeed more nominations.\n\nTherefore, the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is true, I analyzed the table to count the number of times 'icarly' was nominated versus the number of times it won. \n\n- **Nominations for icarly**: 5\n- **Wins for icarly**: 2\n\nSince 5 (nominations) > 2 (wins), the statement holds true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe statement is \\boxed{\\text{True}}.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two shows: \"tuff\" and \"icarly.\" It states that \"tuff\" is the only other show nominated, besides \"icarly.\" So, I need to check if in the table, all nominations for shows (other than \"icarly\") are from \"tuff\" alone.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"category\" which refers to different awards. For example, in 2009, it's about a TV actor award, and the category is \"choice tv actor : comedy,\" but that might not be directly relevant here.\n\nWait, actually, the \"work\" column lists the shows. So, for each row, I should look at the \"category\" which might refer to different awards, but the important part is the \"work\" column, which tells us which show was nominated or won.\n\nSo, let's go through each row:\n\n1. 2009: icarly - nominated\n2. 2010: icarly - nominated\n3. 2010: icarly - won\n4. 2011: icarly - won\n5. 2011: icarly - nominated (Meus Pr\u00e3\u00a3oios Nick Brazil)\n6. 2012: icarly - nominated\n7. 2013: tuff puppy - nominated\n\nSo, in all these rows except the last one, it's about \"icarly.\" The last row is for \"tuff puppy,\" which was nominated.\n\nNow, the claim says that \"tuff\" is the only other show besides \"icarly\" being nominated. But looking at the table, \"icarly\" has multiple nominations and some wins, and then in 2013, \"tuff puppy\" is also nominated. Are there any other shows mentioned? Let's check.\n\nIn the rows provided, I don't see any other show besides \"icarly\" and \"tuff puppy.\" So, does that mean only these two shows have nominations?\n\nWait, but the claim says \"nominate aside from icarly,\" which might imply that all other shows are \"tuff.\" But in the table, \"icarly\" is a single show, and \"tuff puppy\" is another. So, if the claim is saying that besides \"icarly,\" only \"tuff\" is nominated, then technically yes because there's no other show besides these two.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Are there any other shows in the table? The rows are from 2009 to 2013, and each time it's either \"icarly\" or \"tuff puppy.\" So, does that mean that \"tuff puppy\" is indeed the only other show besides \"icarly\" in these nominations?\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"aside from icarly,\" so it's talking about all other shows. If there are multiple shows nominated aside from icarly, then the claim would be false because tuff isn't the only one.\n\nWait no, the claim is saying that tuff is the only other show besides icarly. So, in this context, if \"icarly\" is one show and \"tuff puppy\" is another, then yes, it's true because there are no other shows mentioned in the table aside from these two.\n\nBut wait, looking again at the instruction: I need to check whether the claim is fully supported by the table. The claim says that tuff is the only other show nominate aside from icarly.\n\nIn the table, \"icarly\" appears multiple times as a nominee or winner, and in 2013, \"tuff puppy\" is also a nominee. So, are there any other shows besides these two? Let me check all the rows again.\n\nRow 0: icarly - nominated\nRow1: icarly - nominated\nRow2: icarly - won\nRow3: icarly - won\nRow4: icarly - nominated (Meus Pr\u00e3oos Nick Brazil)\nRow5: icarly - nominated\nRow6: tuff puppy - nominated\n\nSo, yes, only \"icarly\" and \"tuff puppy\" are the shows mentioned. Therefore, the claim that \"tuff\" is the only other show besides \"icarly\" would be TRUE because there's no mention of any other show in the table.\n\nWait, but I think I might have misread something. The claim says \"nominate aside from icarly.\" So, it's about all shows being \"tuff,\" but in reality, \"icarly\" is one and \"tuff\" is another. But perhaps the claim is saying that besides \"icarly,\" all other shows are \"tuff.\" If that's the case, then yes because there are no other shows.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The table shows that \"icarly\" and \"tuff puppy\" have been nominated or won. So, the claim is that besides \"icarly,\" only \"tuff\" has been nominated. Since in the table, there are no other shows except these two, then yes.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because the table doesn't mention any other shows besides \"icarly\" and \"tuff puppy.\"\n\nBut wait, another angle: perhaps the claim is saying that all other shows aside from icarly have been nominated. But in the table, \"icarly\" has multiple entries, but \"tuff puppy\" only appears once as a nominee.\n\nSo, to confirm, the claim is about other shows being nominated. So, if there's another show besides icarly that was also nominated, then it's TRUE because tuff is that other show. Since the table doesn't mention any others, it's TRUE.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table as only \"tuff puppy\" and \"icarly\" are mentioned as shows with nominations or wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_index\": 0},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_index\": 1}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about Jerry Trainor's nominations and wins is true based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"Jerry Traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win only 1 in each year.\" So, according to this, in 2010, Jerry was nominated for two awards, and in 2011, he was also nominated for two awards. Additionally, he won one in each of those years.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several rows, each representing different years (from 2009 to 2013) and includes information on the award, category, work, and result.\n\nI need to focus on the years 2010 and 2011 because the claim mentions those years specifically.\n\nLooking at the row for 2010: There are two entries. The first one is about being nominated for the 'big kid award' in the 'big kid award' category with a result of 'nominated'. The second entry in 2010 is about the 'lol award (shared with ensemble)' which was won.\n\nSo, in 2010, there are two awards mentioned: 'big kid award' and 'lol award'. Both were either nominated or won. However, the claim says he was \"nominate for 2 award\" in 2010. But wait, one of them is a win. Does that mean the count is based on nominations only? Or does it include wins as part of the total?\n\nSimilarly, looking at 2011: There are two rows. The first is about winning the 'nick uk's funniest person' award, and the second is about being nominated for 'funniest character'. So in 2011, he had one win and one nomination.\n\nNow, analyzing the claim again: It states that in 2010, he was nominated for two awards. However, according to the table, in 2010, one of them was a win. Therefore, it's not accurate to say he was only nominated; there was also a win. The same applies to 2011 where he had both a win and a nomination.\n\nSo, the claim seems to be incorrect because in both years, Jerry won an award as well, which isn't just being \"nominate for\" two awards each year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Jerry Trainor was nominated for two awards each in 2010 and 2011 but only won one in each year. However, the table shows he actually won one award in both years, contradicting the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Years:** Focus on 2010 and 2011 as per the claim.\n2. **Check 2010 Entries:**\n   - Nominated for \"big kid award\".\n   - Won \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\".\n3. **Check 2011 Entries:**\n   - Won \"nick uk's funniest person\" award.\n   - Nominated for \"funniest character\" award.\n4. **Analyze the Claim:** The claim states only nominations, but both years include a win.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"Jerry Traino won a total of 2 awards, 1 for 'LOL Award (shared with ensemble)' and 1 for 'Nick UK's funniest person'\". \n\nFirst, I should check if Jerry Traino is mentioned in the table. Looking through the 'work' column, I see entries like \"icarly\", \"tuff puppy\", but I don't see any mention of \"Jerry Traino\". This could mean that either his name isn't in the table, or it's spelled differently.\n\nWait, maybe Jerry Traino is associated with a specific work. For example, in 2011, under 'Nick UK Kids' Choice Awards', the category is 'funniest person'. But I'm not sure if that's for Jerry Traino. The name \"Jerry Traino\" isn't explicitly listed here.\n\nLooking further, in 2010, there are two entries for 'Australian Kids' Choice Awards'. One of them mentions the 'LOL Award (shared with ensemble)'. So that might be related to one of the awards mentioned in the claim. However, without seeing Jerry's name, it's unclear if he's the one who won it.\n\nAlso, in 2011, under 'Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brasil', there's a category for 'funniest character' where icarly is nominated. But again, no mention of Jerry Traino here.\n\nAnother point: The table shows that some awards were won by icarly and others. For instance, the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards had both a nomination and a win in different categories. So maybe Jerry Traino was involved in multiple categories but under different names or works.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Nick UK's funniest person\" refers to icarly? But that doesn't align with the name Jerry Traino. I'm getting confused here because without his name in the table, it's hard to confirm if he won these awards.\n\nI think the key issue is whether Jerry Traino actually won these specific awards. Since his name isn't present in the 'work' column where these awards are listed, it's possible that the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because there's no evidence in the table linking Jerry Traino to those two awards.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about Jerry Traino winning specific awards is true, I analyzed the provided HTML table for any relevant information. The table lists various award categories and whether they were won or nominated. However, the name \"Jerry Traino\" does not appear in the 'work' column where these awards are mentioned. Without his name being explicitly linked to these awards, the claim lacks support from the table data.\n\nAnswer: FALSE\n\nRelevant cells:\n- No relevant cells found as Jerry Traino's name is absent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let me read through the claim again: \"in 2010 jerry traino be nominate for the 2010 australian kids' choice award in 2 different category.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n\n1. Year: 2010\n2. Person: Jerry Traino\n3. Award: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Award\n4. Nomination: In two different categories\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it's an HTML table with columns: year, award, category, work, result.\n\nI need to search through each row for the year 2010 and see if Jerry Traino was nominated in two different categories.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row is for 2009, so not relevant.\n- The second row is for 2010: award is \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\", category is \"big kid award\", work is icarly, result is nominated.\n- The third row is also 2010: same award, but the category is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\", and the result is won.\nWait, so in 2010, there are two rows. Let me check each one.\n\nIn the second row for 2010: The person isn't mentioned, just the categories. The third row also doesn't mention Jerry Traino; it's about a different category. So maybe I need to see if Jerry Traino was in both these categories?\n\nWait, but in the table, the \"work\" column is icarly for all entries except 2013. But the person's name isn't listed in the table\u2014only the award and category names. So perhaps the table doesn't include the person's name.\n\nSo, the claim says Jerry Traino was nominated in two different categories in 2010. But looking at the table, I don't see where Jerry Traino is mentioned. The \"work\" column just says icarly, which might be a company or show, but not a person.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the person is implied? Let me check each row again for 2010.\n\nRow 2: category is \"big kid award\", result is nominated.\nRow 3: category is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\", result is won.\n\nSo, in both cases, the work is icarly, but without knowing who that refers to. If icarly is a person's name, then maybe Jerry Traino was nominated twice. But if it's an entity like a company or show, then perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says Jerry Traino was nominated in two different categories for the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Award. So I need to check if there are two entries in 2010 where Jerry Traino is associated with two different categories.\n\nBut looking at the table, there's only one award named \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\", but two categories: \"big kid award\" and \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\". So, perhaps Jerry was nominated twice under two different categories for the same award. But in that case, does each category count as separate? For example, if he was separately nominated in each category, then it's two.\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row is a separate entry. The second 2010 row has \"big kid award\" and result \"nominated\", while the third has \"lol award\" and result \"won\". So, in 2010, he was either nominated or won, but not both. Wait no: in the claim, it's about being nominated, not necessarily winning.\n\nWait, the second row for 2010 shows \"big kid award\" with result \"nominated\". The third row shows \"lol award\" with result \"won\". So, if Jerry Traino was involved in both categories, perhaps he was part of the nomination. But without his name mentioned, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because the table doesn't show two nominations for Jerry in different categories in 2010. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, another approach: The claim says that in 2010, Jerry Traino was nominated in two different categories for the award. So looking at the table, in 2010, there are two separate categories: \"big kid award\" and \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\". If Jerry Traino was associated with both, then it's TRUE.\n\nBut without his name being listed in the table, maybe he wasn't involved in both. Or perhaps the claim is incorrect because the table doesn't show two different nominations for him.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relevant cells are the ones where the award is \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\" and category is either \"big kid award\" or \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\". So those would be the relevant rows.\n\nSo in the table:\n\n- Row 2: 2010, \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\", \"big kid award\", icarly, nominated.\n- Row 3: 2010, same award, \"lol award...\", won.\n\nTherefore, these are two different categories for the same award. So if Jerry Traino was involved in both, then the claim is TRUE. But since his name isn't mentioned, perhaps it's not verifiable from the table. Alternatively, maybe the table doesn't mention people, only works and categories.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim says Jerry Traino was nominated for two different categories in 2010 for that award. So I need to find if there are two entries in 2010 where he is associated with two categories.\n\nBut the table doesn't list people; it lists awards and categories. So unless \"icarly\" refers to him, which seems unlikely, then perhaps the claim is incorrect because the table doesn't mention Jerry Traino at all. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if \"icarly\" is a person's name, like Jerry Traino, then he was nominated in two categories: big kid and lol award. But I don't think that's the case; \"icarly\" sounds more like a company or entity rather than a person.\n\nTherefore, without any mention of Jerry Traino in the table, the claim can't be supported. So the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires evaluating whether Jerry Traino was nominated for two different categories in 2010 for the \"2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\" After analyzing the provided data, it's evident that:\n\n1. The table lists two distinct categories for the \"2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards\": \"big kid award\" and \"lol award (shared with ensemble.\"\n2. Both entries fall under the same award year.\n3. The \"work\" column references \"icarly,\" which likely refers to an entity rather than a person, making it unclear if Jerry Traino is involved.\n\nSince the table doesn't mention Jerry Traino by name and \"icarly\" appears to be an entity, there's no direct evidence supporting his nomination in two different categories. Therefore, the claim lacks sufficient data to be verified.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"icarly\" being nominated for 10 times as many awards as the show won. So I need to see if there are 10 instances where \"icarly\" was nominated, and compare that number to how many times it actually won awards.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award event with specific details: year, award name, category, work, and result (either 'nominated' or 'won'). My task is to count how many times \"icarly\" was nominated across all these rows and compare that number to its wins.\n\nI'll start by examining each row:\n\n1. **2009**: Award is \"teen choice awards\", category is \"choice tv actor : comedy\", work is \"icarly\". The result is 'nominated'.\n2. **2010**: First row: same as above, but award is \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\", category is \"big kid award\", and result is 'nominated'.\n3. **2010**: Second 2010 row: Award is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\", category is \"icarly\", result is 'won'.\n4. **2011**: First 2011 row: Award is \"2011 uk kids' choice awards\", category is \"nick uk 's funniest person\", result is 'won'.\n5. **2011**: Second 2011 row: Award is \"meus pr\u00e3\u00a3oios nick brazil\", category is \"funniest character\", result is 'nominated'.\n6. **2012**: Award is \"2012 kids' choice awards\", category is \"favorite tv sidekick\", result is 'nominated'.\n7. **2013**: Award is \"2013 daytime emmy awards\", category is \"outstanding performer in an animated program\", work is \"tuff puppy\", result is 'nominated'.\n\nNow, let's count the number of times \"icarly\" was nominated and won.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Nominations for icarly**:\n  - 2009: nominated\n  - 2010 (first): nominated\n  - 2010 (second): not specified because the work is \"icarly\", but result is 'won', so this isn't a nomination.\n  - 2011 (first): category is \"nick uk 's funniest person\" \u2013 not icarly, so no.\n  - 2011 (second): nominated\n  - 2012: nominated\n  - 2013: work is \"tuff puppy\", so not for icarly.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Let me correct that. The 'work' column in 2010 second row is \"icarly\", but the result is 'won', which means it was nominated and then won. So actually, each time the work is \"icarly\" and the result is 'nominated', it's a nomination.\n\nSo let me list all rows where the work is \"icarly\":\n\n- 2009: work icarly, result 'nominated' \u2013 count as nomination.\n- 2010 (first): work icarly, result 'nominated' \u2013 count.\n- 2010 (second): same as above but result 'won' \u2013 so this was a nomination followed by a win, meaning it's still a single nomination instance.\n- 2011: the two rows for 2011 have different works. The first is \"nick uk 's funniest person\" and the second is \"funniest character\", neither of which are \"icarly\".\n- So, only three nominations for icarly in 2009, 2010 (first), and 2010 (second).\n\nWait, but in 2010, there are two rows: one where it's nominated and another where it won. So that's two separate entries. But the 'work' is \"icarly\" in both.\n\nSo, the relevant rows where icarly was nominated:\n\n- Row 0 (2009): result 'nominated'\n- Row 1 (2010 first): 'nominated'\n- Row 2 (2010 second): 'won', but since it's listed as a separate row, that means it was also a nomination before being won.\n\nSo total nominations for icarly: 3 times.\n\nNow, how many times did icarly win? Looking at the table:\n\n- In 2010 second row: 'won'\n- In 2011 first row: 'won'\n\nSo two wins.\n\nThe claim is that icarly was nominated 10 times as many times as it won. So let's see if 3 (nominations) equals 10 times the number of wins, which is 2.\n\nCalculating 10 * wins = 20. But nominations are only 3, which is less than 20. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"icarly be nominate for 10 time as many award as the show win.\" So it's suggesting that the number of nominations equals 10 times the number of wins.\n\nIn numbers:\n\n- Wins = 2\n- Nominations = 3\n\nIs 3 equal to 10*2? No, because 10*2=20. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, I analyzed each row of the table to count how many times \"icarly\" was nominated and won awards. The claim states that \"icarly\" was nominated 10 times as many times as it won. However, from the data:\n\n- **Wins**: 2 (2010 and 2011)\n- **Nominations**: 3 (2009, 2010 first row, 2010 second row)\n\nSince 3 (nominations) is not equal to 10 times the number of wins (20), the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tuff be the only show nominate\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"tuff be the only show nominate.\" It seems to suggest that \"tuff\" is the sole TV show nominated in some category where others aren't. But wait, \"nominated\" and \"won\" are different outcomes, so I need to clarify what exactly the claim is stating.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award ceremony year, the award name, category, work (show), and result. The relevant column here is \"work,\" which lists the TV shows. The other important column is \"result,\" indicating if they were nominated or won.\n\nThe term \"tuff\" appears in the \"work\" column at row 2013 under the category \"outstanding performer in an animated program.\" So, Tuff Puppy was nominated for a Daytime Emmy award in 2013. Now, I need to check if any other shows are also being nominated or winning awards, which would make \"tuff be the only show nominate\" false.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I see that in 2009 and 2010, ICARLY was either nominated or won in categories like Teen Choice Awards. In 2011, they have two entries: one where ICARLY's \"Funniest Character\" was nominated, and another where Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brasil's \"Funniest Character\" also got nominated. So, there are multiple shows being recognized across different awards and years.\n\nWait, the claim says \"tuff be the only show nominate.\" Does it mean Tuff is the only one that was nominated? But in 2013, Tuff Puppy was indeed nominated. However, looking back, other entries like ICARLY and others were also nominated in their respective categories. So, the claim's statement isn't accurate because Tuff isn't alone; there are other shows that have been nominated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is suggesting that Tuff is the only show to be awarded a nomination without winning? No, because being nominated is just that\u2014nomination doesn't imply it's the only one. The table shows multiple nominations across different years and categories, so \"tuff\" isn't unique in being nominated.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there are other shows (like ICARLY) that have been nominated in their respective award ceremonies.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2013,\n      \"column_name\": \"work\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"jerry traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win both in each year.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Jerry Traino is listed as a nominee in 2010 and 2011. Looking at the table, each row has the 'work' column, which probably represents the category or work for which they were nominated. So, for 2010, there are two rows: one where the award is \"2010 australian kids' choice awards\" and the other is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\". Both of these seem to be categories, not people. There's no mention of Jerry Traino in either of these.\n\nIn 2011, there are also two entries. One row mentions \"2011 uk kids' choice awards\" for a category called \"nick uk 's funniest person,\" again likely the award name, and another row is about \"meus pr\u00e3\u00a3oios nick brazil.\" None of these seem to refer to Jerry Traino.\n\nWait, but maybe I should look at the 'result' column. In 2011, one row shows that icarly won the award for \"funniest character,\" so perhaps the winner was icarly, not Jerry Traino. Similarly, in 2010, icarly either won or was nominated in both instances.\n\nI'm trying to find if there's any cell where Jerry Traino is listed as a nominee. Scanning through each row, I don't see his name in the 'work' column. The 'award' and 'category' columns seem to refer more to the award names rather than individuals.\n\nSo, putting this together, there's no mention of Jerry Traino being nominated or winning any awards in 2010 or 2011 according to the table provided. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"in 2008 jerry traino be nominate for the 2008 australian kids' choice award in 2 different category.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the year mentioned in the claim, which is 2008. I need to check if there's any data for that year in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see entries from 2009 onwards. There's no row for 2008. This means there's no information about Jerry Traino being nominated in 2008 for any award.\n\nSince the claim refers to a specific year (2008) which isn't present in the table, it can't be verified as TRUE.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about Jerry Traino's awards is true or false by checking the provided HTML table. The claim says Jerry Traino won a total of 4 awards: two for \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\" and two for \"Nick UK's funniest person.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find any mention of Jerry Traino or his associated categories. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nThe first few rows have award names like \"teen choice awards,\" \"2010 australian kids' choice awards,\" etc., but none seem to reference Jerry Traino specifically. Then I see a row for 2011 where the category is \"Nick UK's funniest person\" and the result is \"won.\" That seems relevant because it matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, looking for any mention of \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble),\" which would be another award he supposedly won. Scanning further, I don't see that exact phrasing in the table. The closest is a 2010 row where the category is \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" and the result is \"won.\" Wait, that's for \"icarly,\" not Jerry Traino.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, no, in the 2010 rows, both categories are for \"icarly,\" so that's a different entity, likely an animated character. So, that row doesn't reference Jerry Traino.\n\nNow, looking at the 2011 row where the award is \"Nick UK's funniest person,\" the result is \"won.\" That's one win. The claim says two for this category, but in the table, it's only mentioned once. So that might be a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another occurrence. Let me check other years. In 2011, there's another row for \"meus pr\u00e3\u00a3oios nick brazil,\" which is in Portuguese, so probably not relevant here. Then in 2012, the award is about a sidekick, and 2013 is about a daytime Emmy. None of these mention Jerry Traino.\n\nSo, from the table, it seems Jerry Traino has only one award win: \"Nick UK's funniest person\" in 2011. The claim says two for that category, so that would be incorrect. Also, there's no mention of him winning the \"LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\" or any other awards, but wait, maybe I misread again.\n\nLooking back, the row for 2010 has \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" but it says \"icarly\" won it. So unless Jerry Traino is part of that, it's not his win. The claim suggests he won two LOL awards and two Nick UK awards, but the table only shows one Nick UK win.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't seem to be fully supported by the table data. It appears that the total number of awards won by Jerry Traino in the table is just one for \"Nick UK's funniest person,\" not four as claimed. Also, there's no evidence of him winning the LOL award.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be FALSE because the claim doesn't align with the provided data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Jerry Traino's awards is true, we analyze each row in the table for relevant information:\n\n1. **Identify Rows and Columns:**\n   - Check each row to see if it mentions \"Jerry Traino\" or categories he might have won.\n   \n2. **2010 Rows:**\n   - The award categories are \"teen choice awards\" and \"lol award (shared with ensemble),\" but these pertain to \"icarly,\" not Jerry Traino.\n\n3. **2011 Rows:**\n   - In the row for \"Nick UK's funniest person,\" the result is \"won.\" This is one award.\n   \n4. **No Further Wins:**\n   - Other years do not mention Jerry Traino, and no other categories align with his supposed wins.\n\nThe claim states four awards (two each for LOL and Nick UK), but the table only shows one win for Nick UK's funniest person. There's no evidence of two LOL awards or a total of four wins by Jerry Traino.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is not supported by the table data, so it is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
