    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Melbourne Tigers be the away team that play home team of Perth Wildcats on the 29 November.\" So, I'm looking for a match where Melbourne Tigers are the away team playing against Perth Wildcats on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'date' column has several entries. The only date provided is \"29 november,\" which seems to be the day in question. Next, I need to check if there's an entry where Melbourne Tigers are listed as the away team and Perth Wildcats as the home team.\n\nI'll go through each row with the date \"29 november\" one by one:\n\n1. Row 4: Home team is Adelaide 36ers vs. Wollongong Hawks. No mention of Melbourne or Perth.\n2. Row 5: Cairns Taipans vs. Townsville Crocodiles. Again, no relevant teams.\n3. Row 6: Gold Coast Blaze vs. New Zealand Breakers. Not the teams in question.\n4. Row 7: Perth Wildcats vs. Melbourne Tigers. Here, Perth is home, and Melbourne is away. That matches the claim.\n\nI should also check other rows but since the date is \"29 november,\" any other dates like \"26\" or \"27\" can be ignored. So, the relevant row is row 7 with columns 'home team' (Perth Wildcats) and 'away team' (Melbourne Tigers).\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's a match on November 29 where Melbourne Tigers are away against Perth Wildcats.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each game on November 29 for the specified teams. The relevant row is found where Melbourne Tigers are the away team facing Perth Wildcats.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "on the 29 november be the game score for sydney spirit v south dragon be 103 - 94",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"On the 29 November, the game score for Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons was 103 - 94.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and see if there's a matching entry. Let me check each row where the date is 29 November.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that on 29 November, there are multiple games listed:\n\n1. Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons with a score of 103 - 94.\n2. Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles.\n3. Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers.\n4. Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers.\n5. Another game involving Sydney Spirit and South Dragons.\n\nWait, actually, the fifth entry is Sydney Spirit again against South Dragons with a score of 103 - 94? Let me double-check that. No, looking back, the fourth entry on 29 November is Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons with a score of 103 - 94. The other entries are different teams.\n\nSo, I need to make sure which row corresponds to Sydney Spirit versus South Dragons. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 3: Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks.\n- Row 4: Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles.\n- Row 5: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers.\n- Row 6: Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers.\n- Row 7: Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons with score 103 - 94.\n\nWait, no. Let me recount the rows properly. The table has 8 rows in total, from row index 0 to 7 (since it starts at 26 November and goes up). \n\nLooking for the date 29 November:\n\n- Row 3: 27 November\n- Row 4: 29 November, Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks.\n- Row 5: 29 November, Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles.\n- Row 6: 29 November, Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers.\n- Row 7: 29 November, Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers.\n- Row 8: 29 November, Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons.\n\nWait, no. Let me list them properly:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 7, each row is a different day or same day but different games.\n\nSo, rows 4 to 7 are all on 29 November:\n\n- Row 4: Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks\n- Row 5: Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles\n- Row 6: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers\n- Row 7: Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers\n- Then, row 8 would be Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons.\n\nWait, no. The table shows that on 29 November, there are five games:\n\n1. Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks (row 4)\n2. Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles (row 5)\n3. Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers (row 6)\n4. Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers (row 7)\n5. Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons (row 8)\n\nWait, but the table has only 8 rows in total, starting from row 0 as 26 November, and then each subsequent day up to 29 November.\n\nSo, row indices:\n\n- Row 0: 26 November\n- Rows 1-3: 26 November more games?\nNo, looking back, it's:\n\nWait no, the table is structured with multiple rows per date. So 26 November has two games (rows 0 and 1), then 27 November one game (row 2), and 29 November five games from row 3 to 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the HTML structure shows each row as a separate game on the same day or different days. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first two rows are 26 November.\n- Then one row for 27 November (row 2).\n- Then four rows for 29 November (rows 3 to 7, but actually five games? Wait, no: looking at the HTML, after 27 November comes four more rows on 29 November.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count correctly:\n\nThe table has the following structure:\n\n<thead> with date columns, then tbody with trs.\n\nLooking at each tr's td for 'date' to see the actual dates.\n\nRow 0: date is 26 november\nRow 1: 26 november\nRow 2: 27 november\nRow 3: 29 november\nRow 4: 29 november\nRow 5: 29 november\nRow 6: 29 november\nRow 7: 29 november\n\nWait, that can't be because the table has only 8 rows. Let me list all dates per row:\n\nRow 0: 26 November (south dragons vs cairns)\nRow 1: 26 November (townsville crocodiles vs melbourne tigers)\nRow 2: 27 November (new zealand breakers vs perth wildcats)\nRow 3: 29 November (adelaide 36ers vs wollongong hawks)\nRow 4: 29 November (cairns taipans vs townsville crocodiles)\nRow 5: 29 November (gold coast blaze vs new zealand breakers)\nRow 6: 29 November (perth wildcats vs melbourne tigers)\nRow 7: 29 November (sydney spirit vs south dragons)\n\nWait, that's five games on 29 November? Or is it four?\n\nWait no, the 'date' is per row. So each row has a single game.\n\nSo:\n\n- Row 0: 26 Nov\n- Row1:26 Nov\n- Row2:27 Nov\n- Row3:29 Nov (adelaide vs wollongong)\n- Row4:29 Nov (cairns vs townsville)\n- Row5:29 Nov (gold coast vs new zealand)\n- Row6:29 Nov (perth vs melbourne)\n- Row7:29 Nov (sydney spirit vs south dragons)\n\nYes, so each row is a separate game on the same date or different dates.\n\nSo Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons is in row 7, which is 29 November, and the score is indeed 103 - 94.\n\nTherefore, the task is to confirm that on 29 November, Sydney Spirit plays against South Dragons with a score of 103-94. So the statement is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying the details of a specific basketball game. Upon reviewing the provided table, it's clear that on November 29th, the Sydney Spirit faced the South Dragons with a final score of 103 to 94 in their match.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe statement is accurate. On November 29th, the Sydney Spirit played against the South Dragons and won by a score of 103-94.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the november 29 melbourne tiger game be in the state sport centre venue.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify the relevant parts of the claim. The key elements are November 29, Melbourne Tigers, and the venue being the State Sport Centre.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, etc. I'll go through each row to find the one that matches November 29 and involves the Melbourne Tigers.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Row 0: Date is November 26. Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Also November 26. Skip.\n3. Row 2: November 27. No.\n4. Rows 3,4,5,6: These are November 29 games. Let's check each.\n\nRow 3: Home team is Adelaide 36ers, away is Wollongong Hawks. Not Melbourne Tigers.\n\nRow 4: Home team Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles. Not Melbourne Tigers.\n\nRow 5: Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers. No Melbourne Tigers here.\n\nRow 6: Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers. Ah, this matches the date (November 29) and the away team is Melbourne Tigers. So this row is relevant.\n\nNow, check the venue for this game. The column is \"venue\" and in row 6, it's listed as \"marrara stadium.\" That doesn't match the claim of being at the State Sport Centre.\n\nSo the claim says the venue should be State Sport Centre, but according to the table, it was at Marrara Stadium. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
