    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nThe claim says: \"brook lopez lead the team in both point and rebound in a single game 3 different time.\" Hmm, that might be a typo. It probably should say \"three different games\" instead of \"time.\" So I'll assume it's about three different games where Brook Lopez led in both points and rebounds.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to find when Brook Lopez was the leading player in both categories.\n\nLooking at the 'high points' and 'high rebounds' columns:\n\n- Row 0: High points by Brandan Wright, not Lopez.\n- Row 1: High points by Deron Williams, not Lopez.\n- Row 2: High points by Brook Lopez (30), but rebounds are also by Lopez (12). So in game 77, he led both.\n- Row 3: High points by Lopez (39), rebounds by Jordan Farmar. So only points.\n- Row 4: High points by Lopez (27), rebounds by Jordan Farmar. Again, only points.\n- Rows 5 and 6 don't list Lopez in high points or rebounds.\n\nSo only game 77 shows Lopez leading both points and rebounds. The claim mentions three different games, but from the table, there's only one such instance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it claims Brook Lopez did this three times, but according to the table, he only did it once.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let me start by understanding what's being claimed.\n\nThe claim says: \"Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams did.\" So I need to check each game to see if Jordan Farmar has more assists than Deron Williams in each instance.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the relevant columns and rows. Looking at the table headers, the important columns are 'high points', 'high rebounds', 'high assists', etc., but specifically for this claim, it's about high assists. So the column to focus on is \"high assists\".\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 75: \n- Game 75\n- Jordan Farmar isn't listed here; only Deron Williams has 7 assists.\nSo in this game, Deron had more assists than Jordan, so this doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 76:\n- Game 76\n- Assist leaders are Travis Outlaw (9) and Deron Williams (9). Both have equal assists. Since the claim is about Jordan having more, this doesn't apply here.\n\nRow 77:\n- Game 77\n- Brook Lopez has 12 rebounds but for assists, Deron Williams leads with 21. So again, Deron has more than Jordan.\n\nWait, no, looking back: In row 77, high rebounds are Brook Lopez (12), but the assists column says Deron Williams (21). Wait, no, the 'high assists' column is separate. Let me check:\n\nEach row has 'high points', 'high rebounds', 'high assists', etc. So in game 77, for high assists, it's Deron Williams with 21. Jordan Farmar isn't listed as the leader here.\n\nRow 78:\n- Game 78\n- High assist is Jordan Farmar (11). Now, comparing to Deron Williams' assists: Looking at the 'score' column, the result was l 109 - 116 (ot), so Deron would have some assists. Wait, but looking back, in game 78, the high rebounds are Brook Lopez with 7. The high assists are Jordan Farmar with 11.\n\nWait, the 'high assists' column for this row is Jordan Farmar (11). So in this game, Jordan led in assists. Now I need to check if he did so more times than Deron.\n\nRow 79:\n- Game 79\n- High assist is Jordan Farmar (9) again. So Jordan leads here as well.\n\nRow 80:\n- Game 80\n- High assist is Jordan Farmar with 7. Deron isn't listed as the leader here, so Jordan led.\n\nRow 81:\n- Game 81\n- High assist is Jordan Farmar with 9. Deron isn't the leader here either.\n\nWait a minute, I need to correct myself. Looking at each game's high assists:\n\nLet me list them out properly:\n\nGame 75: high assists are Deron Williams (7)\nGame 76: both Travis Outlaw and Deron have 9\nGame 77: Deron (21)\nGame 78: Jordan (11)\nGame 79: Jordan (9)\nGame 80: Jordan (7)\nGame 81: Jordan (9)\n\nSo in games 75, 77, 76: Deron leads. In the other games (78,79,80,81), Jordan leads.\n\nThat's a total of 4 games where Jordan led and 3 where Deron did (plus one game where they tied). So overall, more times Jordan led than Deron.\n\nBut wait, in the claim it says \"more games than Deron Williams do.\" So if Jordan led in more games, then the claim is TRUE. But I need to verify each game individually because the claim might be about leading in a single game.\n\nWait no, the claim is whether for more games (i.e., more instances) did Jordan lead in assists compared to Deron. So we have:\n\nJordan leads: 4 times (games 78,79,80,81)\nDeron leads: 3 times (75,77,76)\n\nBut wait, game 76 has both at 9, so it's a tie. The claim is about leading \"more games than Deron,\" meaning Jordan must have more assists in the majority of games.\n\nSo yes, Jordan led in 4 games vs. Deron's 3, with one tie. So overall, Jordan led more times.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all the rows where Jordan is the leader.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 78, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 79, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 80, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 81, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"} ]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that all of the Nets' wins occur at the Prudential Center. So I need to check each game in the table and see where the Nets won and if it was at Prudential.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc. The columns relevant here are 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', 'location attendance', and 'record'. I'm particularly interested in where the Nets won and lost, so the 'score' column will tell me that. If the score shows a win (like W 107 - 105) then I can note the location.\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\nRow 75: The game was on April 1 against Philadelphia. The score is l 90 - 115 (ot), so it's a loss. Not relevant for wins.\n\nRow 76: Against Miami on April 3, score l 94 - 108 (ot) \u2013 another loss. No win here.\n\nRow 77: On April 5 vs Minnesota. Score w 107 - 105 (ot). So this is a win, and the location was Prudential Center with attendance 13461.\n\nRow 78: Against Detroit on April 6, score l 109 - 116 (ot) \u2013 loss. Not a win.\n\nRow 79: On April 8 vs New York, score l 93 - 116 (ot). Loss again.\n\nRow 80: Game against Toronto on April 10, score l 92 - 99 (ot) \u2013 another loss.\n\nRow 81: Against Charlotte on April 11, score l 103 - 105 (ot). So this is a loss too.\n\nFrom the table, it looks like the only win by the Nets in these games was Row 77. The location for that game was Prudential Center. So far, that supports the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other wins not listed here. However, based on the given data, we only have one win, which is at Prudential. So the claim is saying that all their wins (which in this case is just one) come from there.\n\nTherefore, according to the table provided, the Nets only won once, and that was at Prudential Center. There are no other games where they won elsewhere, so the claim holds true based on the data given.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each game in the table for wins by the Nets and noted their locations.\n\n- **Row 77** is the only win, occurring at Prudential Center.\n- No other wins are present in the provided games.\n\nThus, the claim holds true as all Nets' wins (only one) occur at Prudential Center.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 77, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the most highly attended game be against miami at the prudential center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions three key points: that the game was against Miami, it took place at the Prudential Center, and that it had the highest attendance among all games listed in the table.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, opponent, location, and attendance. My task is to check if any of these games meet all three conditions specified in the claim.\n\nStarting with the opponent: the claim says \"against Miami.\" Scanning through the table rows, I see that only the second game (row 1) is against Miami. So this narrows down the relevant row to row index 1.\n\nNext, the location must be the Prudential Center. Checking column 'location attendance' for row 1: it's \"prudential center 18711.\" That matches, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nLastly, I need to confirm if this game had the highest attendance compared to all other games. To do this, I'll list out the attendance numbers from each relevant row:\n\n- Row 0: 16695\n- Row 1: 18711\n- Row 2: 13461\n- Row 3: 14554\n- Row 4: 18023\n- Row 5: 17755\n- Row 6: 13853\n\nThe highest attendance is indeed row 1 with 18,711. So this game meets all three criteria stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a game against Miami at the Prudential Center with the highest attendance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"brook lopez lead the team in points for 5 straight games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says Brook Lopez led the team in points for five consecutive games. So, I need to check the 'high points' column in the table and see if Brook Lopez appears there for five straight game entries.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 75: High Points are brandan wright (15) \u2013 not Lopez.\n- Game 76: High Points are deron williams (18) \u2013 not Lopez.\n- Game 77: High Points are brook lopez (30) \u2013 yes, he leads here.\n- Game 78: High Points are brook lopez (39) \u2013 yes, another lead.\n- Game 79: High Points are brook lopez (27) \u2013 yes, leading again.\n- Game 80: High Points are brook lopez (35) \u2013 yes, continues the streak.\n- Game 81: High Points are brook lopez (31) \u2013 yes, fifth game.\n\nWait a minute. The games are from 75 to 81, which is seven games in total. The claim says five straight games. I need to see if Lopez led for any five consecutive games without interruption.\n\nLet me list the 'high points' column:\n\n- Game 75: brandan wright\n- Game 76: deron williams\n- Game 77: Brook Lopez\n- Game 78: Brook Lopez\n- Game 79: Brook Lopez\n- Game 80: Brook Lopez\n- Game 81: Brook Lopez\n\nSo, starting from game 77 to game 81, that's five games in a row where Lopez leads. However, game 75 and 76 are not led by him, so the streak isn't starting at game 77 but continues from there.\n\nWait, actually, starting from game 77, each subsequent game up to 81 shows Lopez leading. So from 77 to 81 is five games (including both endpoints). Let me count:\n\n- Game 77: Yes\n- Game 78: Yes\n- Game 79: Yes\n- Game 80: Yes\n- Game 81: Yes\n\nThat's five consecutive games where Lopez leads in points. However, I need to make sure that there are exactly five games without any breaks.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nGame 75: No\n76: No\n77: Yes\n78: Yes\n79: Yes\n80: Yes\n81: Yes\n\nSo starting from game 77, it's five consecutive games (including 77) where Lopez leads. Therefore, the claim is supported by five straight games.\n\nWait, but the user might interpret 'five straight games' as any five in a row without gaps. So if from 77 to 81, that's five games in a row where Lopez led, each subsequent game after 77. So yes, that fits the claim.\n\nI don't see any breaks in this sequence.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"brook lopez lead the team in assist for more game than deron williams do.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's comparing Brook Lopez and Deron Williams as assists leaders and checking if Lopez leads in more games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like player name, stats, etc. The relevant columns for this comparison are \"high assists\" because that's where the number of assists per game would be recorded.\n\nI'll go through each row to see who has the higher assist count in each game.\n\nRow 0: April 1 vs Philadelphia. High assists by Deron Williams (7) and Brook Lopez isn't listed, so maybe he didn't play or didn't lead that game. Wait, actually, looking at the \"high assists\" column for this row, it's deron williams with 11, but wait no, in row 0, high points are brandan wright, rebounds also brandan wright, and assists are deron williams (7). So in this game, Deron had more assists than Lopez.\n\nRow 1: April 3 vs Miami. High assists by Deron Williams (9), so he leads here.\n\nRow 2: April 5 vs Minnesota. High assists by Deron Williams (21). He leads again.\n\nRow 3: April 6 vs Detroit. High assists by Jordan Farmar (11). Neither Lopez nor Williams, but since the claim is about Lopez vs Williams, this doesn't affect their comparison directly.\n\nRow 4: April 8 vs New York. High assists by Jordan Farmar (9). Again, not relevant for our comparison.\n\nRow 5: April 10 vs Toronto. High assists by Jordan Farmar (7). Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: April 11 vs Charlotte. High assists by Jordan Farmar (9) again. Not relevant.\n\nWait, in the table, each row's \"high assists\" column shows which player had the most assists that game. For example, in row 0, it's deron williams with 7, but wait no\u2014the \"high points\" is brandan wright, and \"high rebounds\" also brandan wright, while \"high assists\" is deron williams (7). So, Deron leads in that aspect.\n\nSimilarly, in row 1, \"high assists\" is deron williams with 9. Row 2: deron with 21. So in these games, Deron leads in assists over Lopez.\n\nIn rows where Lopez leads in assists, we need to check if those are more games than Deron's. But looking through the table, I don't see any row where Lopez is listed as leading in assists. Most of the time, either Deron or Farmar have the high assists.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: game 75. High points and rebounds by brandan wright. Assists by deron (7). So Deron leads here.\n\nRow 1: game 76. High points by deron, rebounds by travis outlaw, assists by deron (9). So Deron leads again.\n\nRow 2: game 77. High points by brook lopez (30), but high assists by deron (21). So Lopez has more points here, but not assists.\n\nRow 3: game78. High points by lopez (39), rebounds by brook (7), assists by jordan farmar (11). Farmar leads in assists here, not Lopez or Williams.\n\nRow4: game79. Points by lopez, rebounds by farmar (8), assists by farmar (9). So farmar leads.\n\nRow5: game80. Points by lopez (35), rebounds by lopez (11), assists by farmar (7). Farmar leads here.\n\nRow6: game81. Points by lopez (31), rebounds by gadzuric (8), assists by farmar (9). Farmar leads again.\n\nSo in none of the games does Lopez have more assists than Williams or even lead in assists. In most games, either Deron leads in assists, and sometimes Farmar does when both are not involved. Therefore, Lopez doesn't lead the team in assist for any game. So the claim is false because Lopez didn't lead in any game; it's usually Deron or others.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that in each row, if Lopez is listed as having assists, he might lead in that column. But looking at each row:\n\nIn Row 0: \"high assists\" is deron.\n\nRow1: same.\n\nRow2: deron.\n\nRow3: farmar.\n\nRow4: farmar.\n\nRow5: farmar.\n\nRow6: farmar.\n\nSo no instance where Lopez leads in assists. Therefore, the number of games Lopez leads in assist is zero, while Deron leads in at least three games (rows 0,1,2). So the claim that Lopez leads in more games than Williams is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Brook Lopez does not lead the team in assists for any game. Deron Williams or other players have higher assist counts each time.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The \"high assists\" column shows who had the most assists in each game.\n2. **Analyze Each Game:**\n   - **Game 75 (Row 0):** Deron Williams leads with 7 assists.\n   - **Game 76 (Row 1):** Deron Williams leads with 9 assists.\n   - **Game 77 (Row 2):** Deron Williams leads with 21 assists.\n   - **Games 78-81:** Jordan Farmar leads in assists, not Lopez or Williams.\n3. **Conclusion:** Lopez never leads in any game; thus, he doesn't have more games leading than Williams.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high_assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Travis Outlaw leading his team in both points and rebounds in a single game three different times is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly. It says that Travis Outlaw led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game, and this happened three different times. So, we're looking for instances where, in one game, Travis was the top scorer (points) and also the top rebounder (rebounds).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details. I need to go through each game one by one.\n\nStarting from Game 75: The high points are credited to Brandan Wright (15), and rebounds to Brandan Wright as well. So Travis didn't lead in either category here. Moving on to Game 76: High points are Deron Williams with 18, and rebounds are Travis Outlaw with 9. Here, Travis led in rebounds but not in points.\n\nGame 77: Brook Lopez scored 30 points, and Brook also had 12 rebounds. So Travis didn't lead either category here.\n\nGame 78: Brook Lopez scored 39 points, which is a lot, and he had 7 rebounds. Travis isn't mentioned as leading here either.\n\nGame 79: Again, Brook Lopez with 27 points and Jordan Farmar with 8 rebounds. Travis didn't lead in either.\n\nGame 80: Brook Lopez again, this time with 35 points and 11 rebounds. So Travis isn't leading here.\n\nGame 81: Brook Lopez scored 31 points, and Dan Gadzuric had 8 rebounds. Travis isn't mentioned as leading either category.\n\nNow, let's check the games where Travis might have led both. From Game 76, Travis led in rebounds but not points. Are there any other games?\n\nLooking back at Game 75 to 81, I don't see any game where Travis Outlaw is listed as the top scorer and also the top rebounder in the same game. He only leads in rebounds once (Game 76) without leading points.\n\nThe claim says this happened three different times. Since we found zero instances where Travis led both stats simultaneously in a single game, the claim doesn't hold true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the nets' only win come at the air canada centre",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the nets' only win come at the air canada centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that all of the Nets' wins (from the games listed in the table) occurred at the Air Canada Centre. So, I need to check each game in the table where the Nets won and see if their location was indeed the Air Canada Centre.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists games from #75 to #80. Each row has a 'game' number, 'date', 'team', 'score', etc., including the location of each game. The claim is specifically about wins, so I should focus on rows where the team's result was a win (denoted by an 'w' in the score column).\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Game 75: The team is listed as Philadelphia, and the result is a loss ('l'). So this doesn't count towards Nets' wins.\n- Game 76: Team is Miami, result is a loss ('l'). Not relevant.\n- Game 77: Team is Minnesota, score shows 'w', so it's a win. Location is Prudential Center in New York. This location isn't Air Canada Centre, which is in Toronto.\n- Game 78: Team is Detroit, result is a loss ('l'). Not relevant.\n- Game 79: Team is New York, result is a loss ('l'). Not relevant.\n- Game 80: Team is Toronto, score shows 'w'. So this is a win. The location is Air Canada Centre.\n\nSo, from the table, the Nets have two wins: one at Prudential Center and another at Air Canada Centre. This means that not all of their wins are at Air Canada Centre; they also won at another venue. Therefore, the claim that \"the nets' only win come at the air canada centre\" is FALSE because there's at least one other location where they won.\n\nAdditionally, I should note which specific cells in the table support this conclusion. The relevant columns would be 'game', 'date', 'team', and 'location attendance'. But since the claim is about the location of wins, the key columns are 'game' (to identify each game) and 'location attendance' (to check where each win occurred).\n\nLooking at Game 80: it's row index 5, with game number 80. The 'location attendance' column shows \"air canada centre\". So that's one relevant cell. Then for Game 77, which is row index 2, the location is Prudential Center, but since they won there as well, we should include both wins to show not all are at Air Canada.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only win\", implying all their wins are there. So even though they have one at Prudential, that's still another venue, making the statement false. Therefore, I need to list all rows where they won and check their locations.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Game 77: row index 2, location is Prudential Center\n- Game 80: row index 5, location is Air Canada Centre\n\nIncluding both because each win happened at different locations. So even though one is at Air Canada, the other isn't, so the claim is false.\n\nI think that's it. The Nets have wins in multiple locations beyond just Air Canada, so the claim is not fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the Nets won at both Prudential Center and Air Canada Centre, not only at Air Canada.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. The claim says, \"jordan farmar lead the team in points for 5 straight games.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see where Jordan Farmar is mentioned as a high points scorer.\n\nLooking at row 75: the player listed under high points is Brandan Wright. So that's not Farmar.\n\nRow 76: High points are Deron Williams. Not Farmar.\n\nRow 77: Brook Lopez has the high points here, so again, not Farmar.\n\nRows 78 through 80 mention Brook Lopez as well, so no Farmar there either.\n\nIn row 81, it says \"jordan farmar (9)\" under high rebounds and \"jordan farmar\" in assists, but for high points, it's Dan Gadzuric. So wait, the claim is about points, not rebounds or assists. So does Farmar lead in points here? No, because the high points are Dan Gadzuric.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 75: Brandan Wright (15)\nRow 76: Deron Williams (18)\nRow 77: Brook Lopez (30)\nRow 78: Brook Lopez (39)\nRow 79: Brook Lopez (27)\nRow 80: Brook Lopez (35)\nRow 81: Dan Gadzuric (31)\n\nSo in none of these rows does Jordan Farmar have the highest points. The claim says he led for five straight games, but I don't see him leading any single game as the top scorer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Does \"lead the team in points\" mean that he was one of the leading scorers, not necessarily the highest? But the term \"lead\" usually implies being first. So if he's not listed as the high points for any of those games, then the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the rows where Jordan Farmar is mentioned in the 'high points' column, but since none have him there, maybe no cells? Or perhaps I need to check all mentions of him regardless of being top scorer. But the instruction says to look for cells that verify the claim, so if he's not leading any games, then no relevant cells support it.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the claim is about him leading in points for five consecutive games where he scored the most, but according to the table, he never did. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the most highly attended game be against minnesota at the prudential center.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. \"Most highly attended game\" likely refers to the game with the highest attendance numbers. The claim is about a specific game being this one.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there's a game against Minnesota held at Prudential Center that has the highest attendance among all games in the table.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table and note down the relevant information:\n\nRow 0: Game 75 vs Philadelphia at Wells Fargo Center, attendance 16695.\nRow 1: Game 76 vs Miami at Prudential Center, attendance 18711.\nRow 2: Game 77 vs Minnesota at Prudential Center, attendance 13461.\nRow 3: Game 78 vs Detroit at The Palace of Auburn Hills, attendance 14554.\nRow 4: Game 79 vs New York at Prudential Center, attendance 18023.\nRow 5: Game 80 vs Toronto at Air Canada Centre, attendance 17755.\nRow 6: Game 81 vs Charlotte at Prudential Center, attendance 13853.\n\nNow, I need to find the highest attendance. Let me list out the attendances:\n\n- Game 75: 16695\n- Game 76: 18711\n- Game 77: 13461\n- Game 78: 14554\n- Game 79: 18023\n- Game 80: 17755\n- Game 81: 13853\n\nThe highest attendance is 18711, which is for Game 76 against Miami. \n\nSo, the claim says it's against Minnesota at Prudential Center. Looking at the table:\n\n- There are two games against Minnesota. Wait, no, checking again:\n\nWait, looking at the 'team' column:\n\nRow 2: Team is Minnesota.\nRow 3: Team is Detroit.\nRow 4: New York.\nRow 5: Toronto.\nRow 6: Charlotte.\n\nSo only Game 77 is against Minnesota. Its attendance is 13461, which isn't the highest.\n\nBut the claim says \"most highly attended game be against minnesota at prudential center.\" But that's not correct because the highest attended games are:\n\nGame 76 (Miami) with 18711 and Game 79 (New York) with 18023.\n\nSo the highest attendance is against Miami, not Minnesota. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the most highly attended game was against Minnesota at Prudential Center. However, examining the table shows that the highest attendance (18,711) occurred in a game against Miami, not Minnesota. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
