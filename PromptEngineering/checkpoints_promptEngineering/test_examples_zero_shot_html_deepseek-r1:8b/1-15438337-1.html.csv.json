    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"kweku adoboli work for ubs in london, united kingdom.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a match with Kweku Adoboli. Let me scan down:\n\n1. Yasuo Hamanaka - not relevant.\n2. Kweku Adoboli - this is the person we're interested in. His country is listed as \"london, united kingdom.\" So that part matches the claim.\n3. Nick Leeson - different name, so no.\n4. Toshihide Iguchi - no match.\n5. Boris Picano - different name.\n6. John Rusnak - different name.\n\nSo Kweku Adoboli is indeed in row 1 (row_index 1). Now, I need to check which columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"work for UBS\" and the location \"london, united kingdom.\"\n\nLooking at the table columns:\n- institution: This should be where we look to confirm his employer.\n- country: To check if he's from London, UK.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- row 1, column 'institution' (to see if it's UBS).\n- row 1, column 'country' (to confirm it's London, UK).\n\nWait, in the table, Kweku Adoboli's country is listed as \"london , united kingdom,\" which matches. His institution is \"ubs,\" so that also checks out.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 1 for 'country' and 'institution'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"institution\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
