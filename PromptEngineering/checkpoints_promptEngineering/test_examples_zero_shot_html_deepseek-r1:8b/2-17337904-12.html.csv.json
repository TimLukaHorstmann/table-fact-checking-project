    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim is: \"the royal house be unavailable for the state cao , chen , song , wey , and yan.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"royal house\" likely refers to a family or lineage that holds significant power or titles, which might affect whether they are available for certain states (in this context, probably referring to political or historical contexts).\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: state, type, name, title, and royal house. Each row represents a different state with details about their sovereigns, titles, and their associated royal houses.\n\nThe claim mentions specific states: cao, chen, song, wey, and yan. For each of these states, I need to look into the relevant columns that might indicate whether the royal house is unavailable or not.\n\nStarting with \"state\" column:\n- Cao\n- Chen\n- Song\n- Wey\n- Yan\n\nFor each of these states, I should check the corresponding row in the table and see what information is provided under 'royal house'.\n\nLooking at the table rows for each state:\n\n1. **Cao**: The relevant row is <tr><td>cao</td>... which corresponds to row index 1 (assuming the first row after thead is index 0). In this row, under \"royal house\", it's marked as \"-\". I'm not sure if \"-\" indicates unavailable or not applicable. If it means the royal house isn't specified or doesn't exist for Cao, then perhaps the royal house is unavailable.\n\n2. **Chen**: The relevant row is <tr><td>chen</td>... which is row index 2. Here, under \"royal house\", it's also \"-\". Similar to Cao, Chen's royal house might be unavailable or not specified.\n\n3. **Song**: This state's row is at <tr><td>song</td>..., row index 9. The \"royal house\" cell is \"-\", suggesting again that the information isn't available or doesn't exist.\n\n4. **Wey**: Located in <tr><td>wey</td>..., which is row index 11. Again, \"royal house\" is \"-\", indicating perhaps unavailability.\n\n5. **Yan**: The relevant row is <tr><td>yan</td>..., row index 13. Here, \"royal house\" is \"-\", so same as above.\n\nSo, for all these states (Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, Yan), the \"royal house\" field has a \"-\", which might imply that their royal houses are unavailable or not listed in the table.\n\nNext, I should check if there's any information that contradicts this. For example, if any of these states have a non-empty \"royal house,\" then the claim would be false. But looking through each relevant row:\n\n- Cao: \"-\"\n- Chen: \"-\"\n- Song: \"-\"\n- Wey: \"-\"\n- Yan: \"-\"\n\nNone of them have any value except \"-\", so it seems consistent that their royal houses are unavailable or not present in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is likely TRUE because for all those states, the royal house information isn't available. The relevant cells would be the \"royal house\" column for each of these states.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: state, type, name, title, and royal house. Each row represents a different entity with their respective titles.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two names: xiong yan the elder and xiong yong. My task is to find out what their titles are according to the table and see if both are indeed viscounts.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n1. The first few rows (like cai, cao, chen, chu) don't seem relevant because they mention different names.\n2. When I reach the row with state 'chu', there are two entries for xiong yan the elder and xiong yong both under the name column. \n   - For xiong yan the elder (row index 3), the title is viscount.\n   - For xiong yong (row index 4), the title is also viscount.\n\nSo, both individuals have the title 'viscount'. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant columns are 'name' and 'title' for these specific rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" So, I need to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two titles: Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. Each of these should have a name associated with them, specifically \"li.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: state, type, name, title, and royal house. The relevant parts here are the 'name' column and the 'title' column.\n\nStarting with the Duke of Song. In the table, the row for 'song' has a 'name' of 'li' and the 'title' as 'duke.' So that part checks out. \"li\" is indeed the name for the Duke of Song.\n\nNext, looking at the Marquis of Wey. The table has two entries for 'wey': one where 'type' is 'sovereign' with 'name' as 'li' and 'title' as 'marquis.' So that also matches\u2014 \"li\" is the name for the Marquis of Wey.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other entries or conflicting information. For example, in the 'qi' row, there's a 'name' of 'wu,' but that's under different titles and states, so it doesn't affect this check. Similarly, other rows like 'qin' have different names, which don't conflict.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table.

So, my task is to check if in the table, Wu is ever listed as the Duke when the state is Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different state (like cai, cao, chen, etc.), and each column corresponds to different attributes: type, name, title, and royal house. The relevant columns for this claim are \"name\" and \"title\", specifically looking for when the state is Chen or Lu.\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the state is either Chen or Lu.\n\n1. **Chen State Rows:**\n   - Looking through the table:\n     - Row with state \"chen\": It's in the third row (index 2). The name column has \"you\", and the title is \"duke\". So, for state Chen, the name is you, not wu.\n   \n2. **Lu State Rows:**\n   - Scanning further down:\n     - Row with state \"lu\": It's in the eighth row (index 7). The name column has \"shen\", and the title is \"duke\". So, for state Lu, the name is shen, not wu.\n\nNow, I need to see if any row where the state is Chen or Lu has a name of \"wu\" and the title as \"duke\".\n\n- From the Chen rows: The only one is index 2 with name \"you\", so no wu there.\n- From the Lu rows: The only one is index 7 with name \"shen\", again no wu.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other row where state is Chen or Lu and the title is Duke with a different name that might affect the claim. However, in both cases, it's not Wu.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"not the duke of either chen or lu\". So, if wu is ever the Duke for Chen or Lu, then the claim would be FALSE. But from my analysis, I don't see wu being the Duke for either. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because Wu isn't listed as a Duke for Chen or Lu.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let me recount:\n\n- For Chen: Only row 2 has title Duke.\n- For Lu: Only row 7 has title Duke.\n- Other states like Qin have different titles, but the claim is only about Chen and Lu.\n\nSo, since in all relevant rows (Chen and Lu), the name isn't Wu when the title is Duke, the claim holds as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n]}",

It mentions five states: cao, chen, song, wey, and yan. The claim is about whether the \"royal house\" is available for each of these states.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find which rows correspond to these states and check the relevant columns. The table has a column called \"royal house,\" which seems directly related to the claim. So, my main focus will be on the \"royal house\" column for each of these states.\n\nLet me go through each state one by one:\n\n1. **Cao**: I'll look for rows where \"state\" is \"cao.\" There's only one such row in the table (row 2). The value under \"royal house\" is \"-\", which means no royal house is available for Cao.\n\n2. **Chen**: Similarly, find the row with state \"chen,\" which is row 3. The \"royal house\" column here also has a \"-\", indicating no royal house available.\n\n3. **Song**: The row for \"song\" is row 9. Again, the \"royal house\" column shows \"-\", so no availability there either.\n\n4. **Wey**: Row 11 corresponds to state wey. Checking the \"royal house\" column again, it's \"-\", meaning no royal house available.\n\n5. **Yan**: The row for \"yan\" is row 10.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the royal house be ji for the state jin , which have both jing and xi.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means and check it against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for state, type, name, title, and royal house. The states listed include cai, cao, chen, chu (appearing twice), jin, lu, qi, qin (three times), song, wey, and yan.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the royal house be ji\" for the state jin. So I need to find all rows where the state is 'jin' and see what their royal house is listed as.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For state 'jin', there are two rows:\n  1. First row with 'jin': type is sovereign, name is jing, title is marquis, royal house is ji.\n  2. Second row with 'jin': type is sovereign, name is xi, title is marquis, royal house is ji.\n\nSo both instances of state 'jin' have a royal house value of 'ji'. That part seems to check out because the claim says \"the royal house be ji for the state jin,\" which matches the table data.\n\nNext part: \"which have both jing and xi.\" This means that the state should have both 'jing' and 'xi' as their names. So I need to look at all states where either 'jing' or 'xi' is present in the name column, but it seems like each state has a single name.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- State 'jin' appears twice:\n  - First: name is jing.\n  - Second: name is xi.\nSo for state 'jin', there are two different names. However, the claim says \"have both jing and xi,\" which would imply that within the same state, both names exist.\n\nBut in the table, each row represents a specific instance. So if a state has multiple entries (like 'chu' twice), does that mean they can have different names? Or are these separate individuals?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim seems to suggest that for state 'jin', there are two individuals: one named jing and another named xi, each possibly with their own royal house information. But looking at the table:\n\nFor 'jin':\n- First row: name is jing, title marquis, royal house ji.\n- Second row: name is xi, same title and royal house.\n\nSo both entries for 'jin' have the same royal house, ji, but different names. The claim says \"the royal house be ji for the state jin, which have both jing and xi.\" So it's correct that 'jin' has both jing and xi as names (they are separate rows under 'jin'), and both share the same royal house.\n\nWait, no. The way the table is structured, each row is a different entity. So for 'jin', there are two entries: one with name jing, another with xi. Each of these has royal house ji. So the claim's statement that \"the royal house be ji for the state jin\" is correct because both instances of 'jin' have ji.\n\nAdditionally, it says \"which have both jing and xi.\" Since the state 'jin' has entries with names jing and xi, this also holds true. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should check if there's any discrepancy or missing information that might invalidate the claim. Looking for 'ji' as royal house: yes, it's present under 'jin'. For state 'jin', both jing and xi are present as names. So all parts of the claim are satisfied by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"royal house\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"royal house\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The rows represent different entities, each with their respective titles and other attributes.\n\nThe claim mentions that the title \"viscount\" is held only by two specific people: Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong. So my task is to check if these two are indeed the only ones with the viscount title in the table.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's title column to identify who holds the viscount title. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first few rows (like cai, cao, etc.) don't have viscount.\n2. When I reach the 'chu' state, there are two rows:\n   - The name is \"xiong yan the elder\" with title \"viscount\".\n   - Another row with name \"xiong yong\" also has \"viscount\" as their title.\n3. Further down, other states like jin, lu, qi, and qin have titles like marquis, duke, etc., but not viscount.\n4. The 'qin' state has several entries: one with 'marquis', others with 'ruler'.\n\nSo from this scan, only two people are listed as having the title of \"viscount\": Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong.\n\nNext, I should check if there are any other viscounts in the table. Continuing through each row:\n\n- The 'song' state's title is 'duke'.\n- 'wey' is 'marquis'.\n- 'yan' is also 'marquis'.\n\nI don't see any other entries with \"viscount\" besides those two.

'song' and 'wey' are the states related to the titles mentioned in the claim.\n\nNext, I'll look for rows where State is Song or Wey because these correspond to the titles Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey.\n\n- For **Song**: The relevant row is the 9th row (index 8). The columns to check are 'name' and 'title'. The name is 'li', and the title is 'duke'.\n  \n- For **Wey**: The relevant row is the 10th row (index 9). The columns are 'name' which is 'li' again, but the title here is 'marquis'.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the table:\n- In row 8: state is lu? No, let me recount. Wait, the table starts with cai as first row, index 0. Let me list out the states properly.\n\nThe rows in order are:\n\n0: cai\n1: cao\n2: chen\n3: chu (elder)\n4: chu (young)\n5: jin\n6: jin\n7: lu\n8: qi? Wait no, let me check again. The HTML table has the following <tr> elements in tbody:\n\nFirst row after thead is cai... up to qin.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all rows properly:\n\n0: cai\n1: cao\n2: chen\n3: chu (elder)\n4: chu (young)\n5: jin\n6: jin\n7: lu\n8: qi\n9: qin\n10: qin (gongbo)\n11: qin (qin zhong)\n12: song\n13: wey\n14: yan\n\nSo, row 12 is song and row 13 is wey.\n\nIn row 12: state=Song.

This would mean the claim is FALSE because in reality, 'li' is used as the name for both.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure there are no other uses of 'li' elsewhere that might affect this. For example, looking at row 1: state=cao, name=yi, title=count. No 'li' here.\n\nIn row 5: state=jin, name=jing, title=marquis\u2014no 'li'.\n\nSimilarly, in the other rows, I don't see any other uses of 'li' as a name except for song and wey.\n\nSo, since 'li' is used for both Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey, the claim that \"li be not the name for only...\" is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: these are the rows where state is Song and Wey, and within those rows, the 'name' column which is 'li'.\n\nFor song (row 12):\n- row_index=12\n- columns: name (column_name=\"name\")\n\nFor wey (row 13):\n- row_index=13\n- columns: name\n\nAdditionally, the titles are also relevant because they indicate that these are Dukes and Marquises.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it says that \"wu\" is the Duke of both Chen and Lu. So, I need to find out if in the table, there's an entry where wu holds the title of Duke for both Chen and Lu.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"name\", \"title\", \"state\". The \"state\" column has values like cai, cao, chen, etc., which seem to be the names of states or clans. The \"name\" column has individual names, possibly people associated with those states. The \"title\" column lists titles like sovereign, marquis, count, duke, etc.\n\nI need to check each row where the state is either Chen or Lu and see if the name is \"wu\" and the title is \"duke\".\n\nStarting with Chen: I'll look for rows where the \"state\" is chen. From the table:\n\n- Row 3: state=chen, name=you, title=duke.\n- So, here, the name is you, not wu.\n\nNext, checking if there's another row for Chen with wu as the name and Duke title. But in the provided table, only one row has state chen, and it's you who is the Duke, not wu.\n\nNow, looking at Lu: I'll look for rows where \"state\" is lu.\n\n- Row 9: state=lu, name=shen, title=duke.\n- So here, the name is shen, not wu.\n\nIs there another row for Lu with wu as the name and Duke? From the table, no. Only shen is associated with Lu and holds the title of Duke.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other occurrence where wu is a Duke in any state. Let's scan through all rows:\n\nLooking at each state:\n\n- cai: Wu isn't here; it's either yi or you.\n- cao: Sovereign, name not wu.\n- chen: Only you as duke.\n- chu: Two entries, xiong yan and xiong yong, neither is wu.\n- jin: Jing and xi, not wu.\n- lu: Shen is the Duke.\n- qi: Wu here is a marquis, not a Duke.\n- qin: Qin zhong is a ruler, others are marquis or counts.\n- song: Li is duke.\n- wey: Li is marquis.\n- yan: Hui is marquis.\n\nWait, in state qi, there's a row where name is wu and title is marquis. So wu is a marquis for qi, but not a Duke. So that doesn't help the claim about being a Duke of Chen or Lu.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- For Chen: The Duke is you.\n- For Lu: The Duke is shen.\n- There's no row where wu is the Duke of either Chen or Lu.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" isn't supported by the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "claim": "the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I think it's trying to say that for the state 'jin', their royal house is not 'ji', and also they don't have either 'jing' or 'xi' associated with them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a state (like 'jin'), and there are columns like 'type', 'name', 'title', and 'royal house'. My goal is to check if for state 'jin', the royal house is not 'ji', and also verify that they don't have either 'jing' or 'xi' in their titles.\n\nFirst, I'll locate the row for state 'jin'. Scanning through the table, I see two rows with 'jin' as the state. Let's note their row indices: I think it's row 6 and row 7 based on the count starting from 0. So, row_index 6 and 7.\n\nLooking at column 'title' for these rows:\n- For row 6, the title is 'marquis'.\n- For row 7, the title is also 'marquis'.\n\nWait, the claim says that the royal house should not be 'ji'. The 'royal house' column has values like 'ji', '-'. So for state 'jin', in row 6 and 7, the 'royal house' cell is 'ji' and 'ji' respectively. That seems contradictory because the claim states it shouldn't be 'ji'.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me parse it again: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin\". So for state 'jin', the royal house should not be 'ji'. But looking at the table, both instances of 'jin' have 'royal house' as 'ji'. That would mean the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check each relevant cell step by step.\n\n1. Identify state 'jin': rows 6 and 7.\n2. Check 'royal house' column: for both these rows, it's 'ji'.\n3. The claim says that for 'jin', royal house is not 'ji'. But according to the table, it is 'ji'.\n\nThat already contradicts the claim. So regardless of other parts, this makes the claim FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other conditions in the claim. It also mentions \"which do not have either jing and xi.\" So the state 'jin' shouldn't have 'jing' or 'xi' in their titles.\n\nLooking at row 6: title is 'marquis', no 'jing' or 'xi'.\nRow 7: same, 'marquis'. So they don't have those. But since the first part of the claim about royal house being not 'ji' is false, the overall claim is false regardless.\n\nHowever, maybe I'm misinterpreting 'which do not have either jing and xi.' Perhaps it's referring to the titles for the state 'jin'. Since their titles are 'marquis', which don't include 'jing' or 'xi', that part holds. But since the first part about royal house is wrong, the overall claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe the user meant that both conditions must be met: the royal house isn't 'ji' and they don't have 'jing' or 'xi'. Since one condition fails, the entire claim is false.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n- Royal house for 'jin' is indeed 'ji', so first part of claim is wrong.\n- They don't have 'jing' or 'xi', but that doesn't affect the overall truth because the first part is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells would be those where state is 'jin' and column is 'royal house'.\n\nWait, let me double-check row indices. Let's count them:\n\nRows are numbered starting from 0.\n\nLooking at the table:\nRow 6: state jin, royal house ji.\nRow 7: same.\n\nSo rows 6 and 7 are relevant, specifically column 'royal house'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because for the state 'jin', the royal house is 'ji' according to the table. Additionally, the titles of 'marquis' don't include 'jing' or 'xi'. However, since the first part of the claim is incorrect, the overall statement is false.\n\n{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}",
