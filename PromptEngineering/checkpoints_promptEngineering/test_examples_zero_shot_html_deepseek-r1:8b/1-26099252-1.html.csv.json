    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean, release november 27th, 2012, be the stable version of the software.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of this claim correspond to the data in the table. The key points are:\n\n- Version: 4.2.1 Jelly Bean\n- Release Date: November 27, 2012\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like 'browser', 'operating system', 'latest stable release', and others. The relevant column here is \"latest stable release\" because that's where the version information is stored.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any of them match this specific version and date. \n\nStarting with the first data row:\n\n1. **Android Browser**: The latest stable release is listed as \"4.2.1 jelly bean (November 27, 2012)\". This matches exactly what the claim states. So, this cell is definitely relevant.\n\nNext, I check if any other rows might be relevant. \n\n2. **Chromium**: It says \"n / a\" for latest stable release, so it doesn't provide version info here.\n3. **Google Chrome**: The release is October 15, 2013, which is after November 27, 2012, so not relevant.\n4. **Internet Explorer (Windows)**: Latest stable release is October 17, 2013, different from the claim.\n5. **Other IE versions**: Their latest releases are in 2012 and 2010, but they don't mention Jelly Bean or Android.\n6. **Konqueror**: Its version is 4.11.2 on October 1, 2013, which doesn't match.\n7. **Safari (iOS & MacOS X)**: Their versions are older than 4.2.1 and don't match the date.\n\nSo only the first row's \"latest stable release\" cell matches the claim. Therefore, this is the relevant cell to check.\n\nI think that's all. The other cells either don't have data or don't match the version and date specified in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"latest stable release\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about the Android browser is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break down what the claim says: \"the android browser for android have a theora version of 2.3 and an h264 version of 3.0.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the relevant information. The table has several columns: browser, operating system, latest stable release, theora, h264, vp8 (webm), and vp9 (webm). The claim specifically mentions \"android browser\" and \"for android,\" so I should focus on that row.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see there's a row for \"android browser\" with \"android\" as the operating system. In that row, under the \"theora\" column, it says 2.3, which matches the claim. The \"h264\" column also shows 3.0, which is mentioned in the claim.\n\nI need to make sure I'm checking all relevant cells. So, for the Android browser on Android OS, both the \"theora\" and \"h264\" columns have values that align with the claim. There's no conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would negate this. \n\nWait, is there any chance another row might have similar info? Let me check. The rows are for different browsers: Chrome, Internet Explorer (in multiple versions), Konqueror, Safari (both Mac and iOS), etc. None of these other browsers would affect the Android browser's values. So, it's just the first row I need to focus on.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied by the relevant cells in the table. That means the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the \"theora\" and \"h264\" columns for the Android browser.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"theora\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant information in the table. The claim is about Google Chrome's support for VP8 and VP9 codecs. Specifically, it mentions VP8 version 6.0 and VP9 version 29.0.\n\nI should locate where Google Chrome is listed in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that there are two entries for Google Chrome:\n\n1. The first row lists \"chromium\" as the browser with \"all supported\" operating system. It mentions various versions under \"theora\", \"h264\", etc., but it's unclear if this is about Chromium or Chrome.\n2. The second row clearly states \"google chrome\" with its own entry, OS version 30.0.1599.101.\n\nLooking at the VP8 column for Google Chrome, I see it's listed as 6.0. Then in the VP9 column, it's 29.0. So both versions are present as supported.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the claim correctly states \"both\" so that each is supported. Since the table shows both VP8 6.0 and VP9 29.0, the claim should be TRUE because Google Chrome does support both these versions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Google Chrome supports both VP8 (webm) 6.0 and VP9 (webm) 29.0, we need to check the relevant columns in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the row for Google Chrome**: The second row clearly states \"google chrome\" as the browser.\n2. **Check the VP8 column for Google Chrome**: It shows version 6.0.\n3. **Check the VP9 column for Google Chrome**: It shows version 29.0.\n\nBoth versions are supported, confirming the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"vp8 ( webm )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"vp9 ( webm )\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Konqueror supports only VP8 (WebM) 4.4 but not VP9 (WebM).\" So I need to look at Konqueror's entries in the table and see what their VP8 and VP9 statuses are.\n\nLooking at the table, Konqueror is one of the browsers listed. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"vp8 (webm)\" and \"vp9 (webm)\". \n\nLet me find Konqueror's row. Scanning through the rows, I see Konqueror as one of the entries. In the \"vp8 (webm)\" column, it shows 4.4, which suggests that VP8 is supported at version 4.4. Now, checking the \"vp9 (webm)\" column for Konqueror, I notice it says \"no\". \n\nSo, according to the table, Konqueror does support VP8 WebM with version 4.4 but does not support VP9 WebM. That aligns exactly with the claim made. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also identify which cells are relevant. The row index for Konqueror is... let me count. Starting from 0: android browser (row 0), chromium (1), Google Chrome (2), Internet Explorer (3-5), Konqueror is row 6. Wait, no, looking at the table again, the rows after the first few are:\n\nRow 0: android\nRow 1: chromium\nRow 2: google chrome\nRows 3-5: internet explorer (three different entries)\nRow 6: konqueror\n\nSo Konqueror is row 6. The relevant columns are \"vp8 (webm)\" and \"vp9 (webm)\". Therefore, the relevant_cells should include both these columns from row 6.\n\nWait, but in the table, the headers for vp8 and vp9 are \"theora\", \"h264\", etc., but looking at the specific columns:\n\nYes, the column names are:\n- theora\n- h264\n- vp8 (webm)\n- vp9 (webm)\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 6, column \"vp8 (webm)\" and \"vp9 (webm)\". \n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the two columns in Konqueror's row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"vp8 (webm)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"when theora be 2.3 and the h264 be 3.0 , the vp8 ( webm ) be r47759\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's stating that if two conditions are met\u2014the 'theora' field is 2.3 and the 'h264' field is 3.0\u2014then the 'vp8 (webm)' field should be 'r47759'. So my task is to check the table for rows where 'theora' equals 2.3, 'h264' equals 3.0, and see if in those cases, 'vp8 (webm)' is indeed 'r47759'.\n\nI'll start by looking at each row in the table to identify which ones meet both conditions. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **First Row**: Android browser\n   - Theora: 2.3\n   - H264: 3.0\n   - VP8/WebM: no\n   Here, 'theora' is 2.3 and 'h264' is 3.0, but the VP8 field says \"no\". So this doesn't meet the claim.\n\n2. **Second Row**: Chromium\n   - Theora: r18297 (not a number)\n   - H264: manual install (not 3.0)\n   - VP8/WebM: r47759\n   Since 'theora' isn't 2.3 and 'h264' isn't 3.0, this doesn't apply.\n\n3. **Third Row**: Google Chrome\n   - Theora: 3.0 (not 2.3)\n   - H264: 3.0\n   - VP8/WebM: 29.0 (not r47759)\n   Again, 'theora' isn't 2.3 but 'h264' is correct. However, VP8 doesn't match.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: Internet Explorer (Windows)\n   - Theora: manual install\n   - H264: 9.0\n   Doesn't apply as both conditions aren't met.\n\n5. **Fifth Row**: Internet Explorer (Windows Phone)\n   - Theora: no\n   - H264: 9.0\n   Neither condition is met.\n\n6. **Sixth Row**: Internet Explorer (Windows RT)\n   - Theora: no\n   - H264: 10.0\n   Doesn't apply.\n\n7. **Seventh Row**: Konqueror\n   - Theora: 4.4\n   - H264: 4.4\n   VP8/WebM is also 4.4, so conditions not met.\n\n8. **Eighth Row**: Safari (iOS)\n   - Theora: no\n   - H264: 3.1\n   Doesn't apply.\n\n9. **Ninth Row**: Safari (MacOS X)\n   - Theora: manual install\n   - H264: 3.1\n   Neither condition met.\n\nSo, looking through all the rows, I don't see any that have 'theora' as 2.3 and 'h264' as exactly 3.0 at the same time. The closest is the first row where both are correct, but VP8/WebM isn't r47759\u2014it's \"no\". \n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true because there's no row in the table that satisfies all three conditions specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"theora\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"h264\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"when vp8 ( webm ) be 6.0 , and the vp9 ( webm ) be 29.0 , the operating system be window.\" \n\nSo, I need to check if there's any row in the table where both the 'vp8 (webm)' column has a value of 6.0 and the 'vp9 (webm)' column has a value of 29.0, and when that happens, the 'operating system' for that row is 'window'.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different browser with its corresponding details. The columns relevant to the claim are:\n\n- vp8 ( webm )\n- vp9 ( webm )\n- operating system\n\nSo my task is to go through each row and check these three columns.\n\nLet me list out all the rows and their values for these columns:\n\n1. **Android Browser**\n   - vp8: 2.3\n   - vp9: no\n   - OS: android\n\n2. **Chromium**\n   - vp8: r18297\n   - vp9: r172738\n   - OS: all supported\n\n3. **Google Chrome**\n   - vp8: 3.0\n   - vp9: 29.0\n   - OS: windows (but let's check the exact value in the table)\n\nLooking back, for Google Chrome:\n- vp8 is 3.0\n- vp9 is 29.0\n- OS is \"30.0.1599.101 (october 15 , 2013 )\" which is Windows-based, so 'windows'\n\nSo this row has both vp8 as 6.0? Wait no, in the table, for Google Chrome, vp8 is listed as 3.0 and vp9 is 29.0.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check the table:\n\nLooking at the third row (Chrome):\n\n- <td>3.0</td>\n- <td>29.0</td>\n\nSo, yes, vp8 is 3.0, not 6.0. Therefore, this doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nWait, but the claim says when vp8 is 6.0 and vp9 is 29.0. So I'm looking for a row where both are exactly those numbers.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- **Konqueror**: vp8 is 4.4, vp9 no\n- **Safari (iOS)**: vp8 no, vp9 no\n- **Safari (MacOS X)**: vp8 manual install, vp9 no\n- **Internet Explorer (Windows)**: vp8 manual install, vp9 no\n- **IE for Windows Phone**: vp8 no, vp9 no\n- **IE for Windows RT**: vp8 no, vp9 10.0\n\nNone of the other rows have vp8 as 6.0 and vp9 as 29.0 except maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again each row:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow for Google Chrome: vp8 is 3.0, vp9 is 29.0.\n\nSo does any other row have vp8 as 6.0? Looking through all rows:\n\n- Android browser: vp8 2.3\n- Chromium: vp8 r18297 (a version string)\n- Google Chrome: 3.0\n- IE Windows: manual install\n- IE Windows Phone: no\n- IE Windows RT: no\n- Konqueror: 4.4\n- Safari iOS: no\n- Safari MacOS X: manual install\n- Others don't have vp8 as a number.\n\nSo, none of the rows have vp8 at 6.0 and vp9 at 29.0 except for Google Chrome, but in that case, vp8 is 3.0. Therefore, no row meets both conditions simultaneously.\n\nWait, unless I'm misreading something. Let me check again:\n\nThe claim says when vp8 (webm) is 6.0 and vp9 (webm) is 29.0, the OS is window.\n\nBut looking at the table, the only time vp9 is 29.0 is in Google Chrome's row, where vp8 is 3.0. So that doesn't meet both conditions.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where both are exactly 6.0 and 29.0 as numbers\u2014since most of them either have 'no' or specific version identifiers like r18297, which aren't numerical 6.0.\n\nSo the condition never occurs in the table.

Let me break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 ) be the stable version where the h264 be 9.0 and vp9 (webm) be no.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to specific cells in the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )\". Looking at the table, this seems to refer to the 'latest stable release' column for Android browser under Windows OS. In row 0, column 'latest stable release', the value is indeed \"4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )\".\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"h264 be 9.0\". The 'h264' column in the table shows version numbers for different browsers. For Android browser, under h264, it's listed as 3.0. However, the claim says 9.0, which doesn't match. This discrepancy suggests a problem.\n\nThen, the claim refers to \"vp9 (webm) be no\". Looking at the same row, in the 'vp9 (webm)' column, it's indeed marked as 'no'. So this part of the claim is correct.\n\nNow, checking all conditions:\n\n1. The stable version: Correct for Android browser.\n2. h264 version: Incorrect; it's 3.0, not 9.0.\n3. vp9 (webm): Correct; it's 'no'.\n\nSince one condition (h264) is incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are other browsers that might match the claim. For example, if another row's h264 is 9.0 and vp9 is no, but the stable version also matches November 27, 2012. Looking through the table:\n\n- Chrome: latest stable release is October 15, 2013.\n- Firefox: not in the list.\n- Safari: same as above.\n- Internet Explorer has different versions, none matching the claim.\n- Konqueror: doesn't match.\n- So only Android browser's row 0 might be relevant, but since h264 isn't 9.0, it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because one of the conditions isn't met.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"latest stable release\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
