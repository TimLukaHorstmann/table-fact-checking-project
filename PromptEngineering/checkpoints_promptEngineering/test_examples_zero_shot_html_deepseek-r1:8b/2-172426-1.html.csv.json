    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary marry william ii before she be 12\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Princess Mary marrying William II before she turns 12. From my knowledge, Princess Mary was also known as Queen Mary, who married King William II of Orange. However, I remember that she was quite young at the time of their marriage. So, let me check the table provided to see if this information is supported.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different princess and her details. The relevant columns for this claim are \"name dates\" (which includes the princess's name), \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\", \"parent\", \"date married\", and \"husband dates\". \n\nI need to identify which rows are about Princess Mary. Scanning through the table, I see that row 1 lists \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\". This seems to be the correct entry for Princess Mary.\n\nNow, looking at her details: she was married from 1642 to 1660. The date of marriage is listed in the \"date married\" column as 1641. Since she was born in 1631, turning 12 would occur around 1643. Therefore, she married in 1641, which is before she reached 12. That aligns with the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact dates to ensure accuracy. Princess Mary was indeed born in December 1631 and married King William II in September 1641. Since her age at marriage was about 10 or 11, which is before 12, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, considering the table structure, the columns involved are \"name\", \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\", \"parent\", \"date married\", and \"husband dates\". For Princess Mary's row, these correspond to specific cells that need to be checked. \n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include the row index of 1 (since it's the first row), and the columns: \"name dates\" (to confirm the princess is Mary), \"date married\" (to check the year she married), and perhaps \"husband dates\" to verify the husband is William II. However, the claim specifically mentions William II, so ensuring that her husband's details match is also necessary.\n\nWait, in the table, the column \"husband dates\" for row 1 is \"william ii , prince of orange 1626 - 1650\". This confirms it's William II. So all relevant cells are covered.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"princess mary marry william ii before she be 12\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the provided table:\n\n1. **Princess Mary** is identified in row 1 with her marriage details spanning from 1642 to 1660 and a marriage date of 1641.\n2. **Age at Marriage**: Born in 1631, Princess Mary was approximately 10-11 years old when she married in 1641, which is before turning 12.\n\nThe table confirms that Princess Mary married King William II before reaching the age of 12.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"Princess Louise did not marry until she was around 38 years old\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll look for Princess Louise in the table. Scanning each row's 'name' column:\n\n- Row 5: Louise, Princess Royal 1867 - 1931\nThat's her.\n\nNow, I need to find the columns related to her marriage details. The relevant columns are 'parent', 'date married', and 'husband dates'. \n\nLooking at Row 5:\n- Parent is Edward VII (1841-1910)\n- Date Married: 1889\n- Husband Dates: Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife (1849-1912)\n\nWait, Princess Louise was born in 1867. If she married in 1889, that's about 22 years old, not 38. But the claim says she didn't marry until around 38. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking again: The table shows her husband as Alexander Duff, starting from 1849. Maybe there was an engagement or something earlier? Or perhaps the table only lists her marriage to him in 1889. \n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to another marriage after she turned 38. Let me check other rows for Princess Louise. No, it's only Row 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table shows a later marriage. Wait, no, Row 5 is the only one with Louise.\n\nSo, the date married in the table is 1889, which is around 22 years old, not 38. Therefore, the claim that she didn't marry until 38 is false because she married earlier. But I need to confirm if this data is accurate.\n\nI think the key cells are row 5, columns: 'parent', 'date married', and 'husband dates'. These directly show her marriage at 22.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Princess Louise married in 1889 at 22 years old, not around 38.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth the ii have have 2 husband\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions Princess Anne, referencing Elizabeth the II. Wait, actually, the claim says \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II.\" That might be a bit confusing because I think Elizabeth the II is a monarch, and Princess Anne is her daughter. But in reality, Elizabeth the II was the queen, so maybe the claim is trying to say something about Princess Anne being married twice.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates. Each row seems to represent a different princess royal, their timeline, parents, and husbands.\n\nI need to find rows where \"name\" is Princess Anne. Let me scan the table:\n\n- Row 2: name is \"Anne , princess royal 1709 - 1759\"\n- Row 7: name is \"Anne , princess royal 1950 -\"\nWait, there are two entries for Anne? That might be a mistake because in reality, Princess Anne has married twice, so maybe the table reflects that. Let me check each entry.\n\nRow 2 (index 1) has Anne as the princess royal from 1709 to 1759. Her parent is George II and she married William IV, Prince of Orange in 1711. So her marriage dates are 1711-1751. That's one husband.\n\nRow 7 is a bit confusing because it seems there are two entries for Anne with different husbands: Mark Phillips (1948-) and Sir Timothy Laurence (1955-). Wait, that might be an error in the table because Princess Anne can't have both husbands at once unless she remarried. Let me check the instruction again.\n\nThe claim is about Princess Anne of Elizabeth II having two husbands. So I need to see if the table shows her with two marriages or two husbands.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 2 (Anne): one husband, William IV.\n- Row 7: has two entries, which seems odd. The first entry for row 7 is Anne with Mark Phillips, and then another row also labeled as 7 with Sir Timothy Laurence. That might indicate that there are two different husbands listed under the same person, but in reality, it's more likely a mistake in the table indexing since each row should have a unique order number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me check again:\n\nThe table has rows from 1 to 7. Each \"order\" is a number. Row 2 (index 1) is one Anne with one husband. Then, row 7 (index 6) is another Anne entry with two different husbands listed in separate rows? That can't be right because each row should represent a unique individual.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe HTML table has <tr> elements for each row. The first tr is order 1, then order 2 up to 7. However, the last two trs both have order 7, which seems incorrect. Maybe it's a typo and should be 8 or something else.\n\nBut regardless of that, let me focus on the data. The claim says Princess Anne has two husbands. From the table:\n\n- Row 2: Anne married once.\n- Row 7: Wait, row 7 (which is order 7) lists Anne with Mark Phillips and then another row (also labeled as 7?) which isn't possible because each row should have a unique order number.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check the data without worrying about the order numbers. Let me list all Annes:\n\n1. Row 2: Anne married William IV.\n2. Row 7: Anne married Mark Phillips and then Sir Timothy Laurence in separate entries?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because each row is a separate entity. So perhaps the table has two different Annes, but I think it's more likely that there are two marriages for Princess Anne, which would mean she has two husbands.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- Row 2: Anne, one husband.\n- Row 7: There's an entry where Anne married Mark Phillips in 1948 and another where she married Sir Timothy Laurence in 1955? No, that can't be because each row is separate. Alternatively, maybe row 7 has two husbands listed, but the table shows her with two different husbands.\n\nWait, no, in the table, each row represents a single person. So perhaps the second Anne (row 7) is a different person, but I think it's more likely that the table incorrectly duplicates entries or perhaps reflects her two marriages.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nRow 2: Anne (1709-1759) married once.\nRow 7: Anne (1950-) married twice? Wait, in row 7, there are two different entries, which might mean she has two husbands, but that's not possible because each row should represent a unique individual. Alternatively, maybe the table is meant to show her having two marriages.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether Princess Anne has two husbands. From history, Princess Anne married twice: first to Captain Mark Phillips in 1973 and then to Sir Timothy Laurence in 1988. So she has two husbands.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 2 (order 1): Anne, one husband.\n- Then, perhaps row 7 is intended to show her second marriage? But I need to check each entry.\n\nWait, looking at row 7:\n\nThe first tr for order 7: name is \"Anne , princess royal 1950 -\", parent is George VI, and she married Mark Phillips in 1948. Then, the same row has another husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, which doesn't make sense because each tr should be a single entry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two separate rows for Anne with different husbands, implying two marriages. So row 2 (order 2) and row 7 (order 7) both represent Princess Anne, each with a different husband.\n\nBut that would mean the table lists her twice, which might not be accurate, but it's possible the table is structured to show her two marriages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table has an error in numbering, and row 2 and row 7 are both Princess Anne with different husbands.\n\nIn any case, the key point is whether the table shows her with two husbands. From the data:\n\n- Row 2: one husband.\n- Then, another row (possibly row 7) showing her married to Mark and then Tim.\n\nBut in reality, she has two marriages, so the claim is correct based on the table.\n\nWait, but looking again at the table's HTML code:\n\nThe last few rows have order numbers as 7, which might be incorrect. Let me check:\n\nThe initial rows are from order 1 to 7, with each tr having an order number. But in the provided data, there are two entries for Anne: one as row 2 and another as row 7.\n\nSo, in the table, there are two separate Annes, each married once. That would not support the claim of having two husbands. Therefore, perhaps the table doesn't correctly reflect her two marriages.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the table might have duplicated entries or incorrect order numbers. Let me try to parse it properly.\n\nThe HTML shows:\n\n<tr>\n<td>7</td><td>Anne , princess royal 1950 -</td><td>(parent?)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Mark Phillips, Sir Timothy Laurence</td>\n</tr>\n\nWait, no, the data might be that row 7 has her married to both Mark and Tim, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's intended to show her two marriages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at each row as a separate entry, so row 2 (order 2) is one marriage, and row 7 (order 7) is another, meaning she has two husbands.\n\nBut in reality, Princess Anne has two husbands, so the claim would be true based on the table. However, I'm not entirely sure because the table's structure might be off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only shows one marriage for each row, so if there are two Annes with separate marriages, then she has two husbands.\n\nWait, but in reality, Princess Anne is a single person who has married twice, so the claim is correct. The table may have incorrectly split her into two entries, but the data would still reflect that she has two husbands.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the claim is true because the table shows her with two marriages.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II have have 2 husband\" is supported by the table data. The table lists Princess Anne married to William IV (Row 2) and later to Sir Timothy Laurence (Row 7), indicating she has two husbands.\n\nAnswer: true\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": \"true\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth be the only princess of the list to have gotten a divorce\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions Princess Anne and claims she is the only one in the list who has gotten a divorce. So, my task is to check each row in the table and see if any other princesses have a history of divorce.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent different princesses with details like their order, name, dates as princess royal, parent, date married, and husband's details. The key columns here are 'parent' and 'husband', but more importantly, perhaps the 'date married' and any other information that might indicate a divorce.\n\nWait, actually, the column that might be relevant is not directly mentioned in the claim. Since the claim talks about getting a divorce, I need to see if any princesses have had their marriages dissolved. But looking at the table, the columns provided are order, name, princess royal dates, parent, date married, and husband details.\n\nHmm, I don't see a column that directly indicates whether there was a divorce. That's a problem because without that information, how can I verify if any princess had a divorce? Maybe I need to infer from other data. For example, if the 'parent' is different from the 'husband', perhaps indicating a divorce. Or maybe looking for changes in the husband column over time.\n\nWait, another approach: sometimes in such tables, a change in the parent or husband might indicate a remarriage or a divorce. But I'm not sure how that's represented here. Alternatively, if a princess has more than one marriage recorded, it might suggest a divorce occurred between her marriages.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Mary, married to William II in 1641, and later to Charles I? Wait, no, the parent is Charles I. So maybe she was married to someone else before. Not sure if that indicates a divorce.\n\nWait, actually, looking at Row 1, the husband is William II from 1626-1650, and the date married is 1641. Then her parent is Charles I, who reigned until 1649. So perhaps she was married to Charles I after her first marriage? Or maybe it's a different person.\n\nWait no, looking again: The 'name' column for Row 1 is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\", so that's her name and her dates as princess royal. Then the husband details are William II from 1626-1650, with the marriage date in 1641.\n\nSo perhaps she was married to William II, and later to someone else? Or maybe Charles I?\n\nWait, no, the parent is Charles I (1600-1649), so that might indicate that her parent was King Charles I, and she married him. But wait, if Charles I was her father, then how could she have married him? That would be an incestuous relationship, which seems unlikely. So perhaps this indicates a remarriage or a divorce.\n\nWait, maybe the 'parent' column is who she's currently married to or related to. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the parent might indicate her family line, and the husband is another person. But without knowing if there was a divorce, it's hard to tell.\n\nSimilarly, looking at Row 2: Anne, married in 1734 to William IV, and her parent is George II. So she's married to William IV, who became king after George II? Not sure about any divorce here.\n\nRow 3: Charlotte, married in 1797 to Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg. Her parent is George III. No indication of a divorce.\n\nRow 4: Victoria, married in 1858 to Frederick III, and her parent is Victoria (Queen). She was the daughter of Queen Victoria, so that makes sense. No mention of divorce here.\n\nRow 5: Louise, married in 1889 to Alexander Duff, and her parent is Edward VII. No sign of a divorce.\n\nRow 6: Mary, married in 1922 to Henry Lascelles, with her parent being George V. Again, no indication of a divorce.\n\nRow 7: Anne, married to Mark Phillips from 1948-present, but in another row (duplicate row 7?), she's married to Sir Timothy Laurence starting in 1955. Wait, that seems odd. So the same person, Princess Anne, is listed twice with two different husbands? That could indicate a divorce between her first and second marriage.\n\nWait, looking at the table again, I see that Row 7 has two entries for Anne. The first entry says she was married to Mark Phillips from 1948 onwards. Then the second entry (same row number?) shows she's married to Sir Timothy Laurence since 1955. That seems conflicting because you can't be married to two people at once unless there's a divorce.\n\nSo perhaps this indicates that Princess Anne divorced her first husband, Mark Phillips, and remarried Sir Timothy Laurence in 1976 (if that's the actual date). Therefore, she would have had a divorce.\n\nIf that's the case, then according to the table, Princess Anne is indeed the only one who has a record of a divorce as per the duplicate row showing two marriages. So the claim would be correct.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that this duplication in the same row indicates a divorce. If Row 7 lists her first marriage ending and then a second marriage, that implies a divorce occurred between them. Therefore, she is the only princess in the list with a known divorce.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Anne is the only princess in the list to have gotten a divorce is supported by the table data. The duplication in Row 7 indicates that Princess Anne married Mark Phillips first and later Sir Timothy Laurence after a divorce, making her unique in having experienced a divorce among the listed princesses.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"column_name\": \"Employees\"\n    }\n]\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has headers like 'name dates', 'princess royal from (date) to (date)', and others. The relevant columns for this claim would likely be the ones that mention names and dates related to Prince Mary and King Charles I.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Refers to Mary, Princess Royal with dates 1631-1660. Her princess royal period was from 1642-1660. So she was about 27-29 years old during that time.\n   - But the claim says she died before 40, so I need to check her death date. The 'name dates' column shows Mary as 1631-1660, but under 'princess royal from (date) to (date)' it's 1642-1660. She might have lived beyond 40, depending on her actual lifespan.\n   \n2. Row 6: This is another Mary, Princess Royal with dates 1897-1965. Her princess royal period was from 1932-1965. She lived a long life, likely over 40 when she died in 1965.\n\nSo the first Mary (Row 0) might have been born in 1631, and if she died around 1660, that would make her about 29. But I'm not sure from the table if she lived beyond 40. The claim says she died before 40, which would be false if she was 29 when she died.\n\nWait, maybe I should check other rows for more information. There's Row 7 with another Anne, but that's a different person. So focusing on Mary:\n\nRow 0: Mary, Princess Royal, dates 1631-1660. Her princess royal period started in 1642, so her birth year is likely 1625 (if she was 17 when she became princess). If she died in 1660 at 35 years old, that's over 40? No, 35 is under 40. Wait, 35 is less than 40, so if she died at 35, the claim would be true because she died before 40.\n\nBut wait, I don't know her exact death age from the table. The table shows her name as Mary with dates 1631-1660, but it doesn't specify when she actually died beyond that range. So maybe she lived longer, but the princess royal period is until 1660. If she was born in 1625 and died in 1660 at 35, then yes, she died before 40.\n\nAlternatively, if she was born later, say 1631, and died in 1660 at 29, still under 40.\n\nWait, but the claim is about dying before age 40. If she lived past 40, the claim would be false. But according to her princess royal period ending in 1660, if she was born in 1625, she'd be 35 when she died, which is under 40. So the claim would be true.\n\nBut I'm not entirely certain without more data. The table doesn't specify her exact death age beyond 1660. It just says she was princess royal until then. Maybe she lived longer, but perhaps not over 40. Alternatively, maybe she did live past 40, making the claim false.\n\nWait, another approach: looking for cells that directly relate to Mary's lifespan or death age. The 'name dates' column in Row 0 is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\". So her lifespan is from 1631-1660. If she died in 1660 at 29, that's under 40, so the claim would be true.\n\nBut if the table doesn't specify her death age beyond that period, maybe she lived longer. Without more info, it's hard to say definitively. But based on the princess royal dates ending in 1660, and assuming she died then at around 29, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Prince Mary of Charles I died before the age of 40. Examining Row 0 of the table, Mary was a Princess Royal from 1642-1660. If she was born in 1631 and died in 1660 at 29 years old, she indeed died before reaching 40. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary marry her husband william ii after her 12th birthday\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify which princess Mary we're talking about. The table lists several Princess Royals, and there are a few named Mary. Specifically, looking at row 1: Mary, then rows 6 and 7 also mention Mary. \n\nThe claim mentions that Mary married William II after her 12th birthday. So I need to check if this is supported by the table.\n\nLooking at row 1: The princess in question is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660.\" Her husband is listed as \"william ii , prince of orange 1626 - 1650.\" The date she married is not explicitly stated, but her marriage dates are from 1642 to 1660. Since her birth year is 1631, if she was born in 1631, she would turn 12 around 1643. If the marriage happened in 1642, that's before her 12th birthday (which would be around 1643). However, the claim says after her 12th birthday, so this might not align.\n\nWait, let me double-check: The princess Mary's birth year is 1631. If she married in 1641 (as per row 1), her age would have been about 10, which is before 12. But wait, looking at the table again, row 1 shows that she married in 1641, and her husband is William II. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait no, actually, the claim says \"after her 12th birthday,\" so if Mary was born in 1631, her 12th birthday would be around 1643. If she married in 1642, that's still before turning 12. But according to the table, row 1 shows her marriage start as 1642. So perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check other rows. Row 6 also mentions Mary, but her husband is George V, so that's not William II. So only row 1 is relevant here.\n\nWait, but in row 1, the princess's name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\" and her parent is Charles I (1600-1649). She married William II in 1641, which would make her around 10 years old. Therefore, she didn't marry after her 12th birthday; she was younger.\n\nSo the claim that she married after her 12th birthday is FALSE because she married before turning 12. Thus, the answer should be \"FALSE\" and the relevant cells are row 1, columns 'name dates' and 'husband dates' as they show her marriage details.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Mary married William II after her 12th birthday. However, according to the table, she married him in 1641, which was before her 12th birthday (around 1643). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:** Look for rows where \"Mary\" is listed as a Princess Royal.\n2. **Analyze Marriage Details:** Check the corresponding columns for the marriage year.\n3. **Calculate Age at Marriage:** Determine if she was older than 12 when she married.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because Mary married before her 12th birthday.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Princess Louise marry Edward VII before the age of 20\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: it says Princess Louise married Edward VII before she turned 20. So, I'm looking for information about Princess Louise's marriage to Edward VII in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different princess with details like name, dates as princess royal, parent, date of marriage, and her husband's details. The rows are numbered from 1 to 7.\n\nI need to find the row where the princess is named \"Louise\" and married to Edward VII. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Mary, married to William II. Not Louise.\n- Row 2: Anne, married to George II. Not Louise.\n- Row 3: Charlotte, married to Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg. Not Louise.\n- Row 4: Victoria, married to Frederick III. Not Louise.\n- Row 5: Louise, name matches. Let's check her details.\n\nIn row 5, the princess is named \"louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931\". Her parent is Edward VII (1841 - 1910), which matches the claim's husband. The date married is 1889. Now, checking if she married before turning 20.\n\nWait, her birth year would be around 1867. If she was born in 1867 and married in 1889, that makes her age about 22 years old, right? Because 1889 minus 1867 is 22. So, she didn't marry before the age of 20; she was 22 when they married.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because she married at 22, not before 20.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"Princess Louise marry Edward VII before the age of 20\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check the relevant cells in the provided table. The relevant row and column are identified as follows:\n\n- **Row**: Row 5 (index 5)\n- **Columns**: \"name\", \"parent\", \"date married\"\n\nThe data in these columns shows that Princess Louise was indeed married to Edward VII in 1889, but she was 22 years old at the time. Since she did not marry before turning 20, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "princess anne of elizabeth the ii have only 1 husband",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth the ii have only 1 husband\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. First, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions Princess Anne and refers to Elizabeth the II as her mother, which makes sense because from the table, we see that each row starts with a princess royal whose parent is a king or queen. For example, in row 7, the parent is Elizabeth II, so that's probably Queen Elizabeth's info.\n\nNow, the claim states that Princess Anne has only one husband. I need to check if this is supported by the table data. Looking at the table, each row after the first few columns lists information about each princess royal. Specifically, for each princess, there are several columns: order, name, princess royal dates, parent, date married, and husband dates.\n\nSo, the relevant columns here would be \"husband dates\" because that's where their marriages would be recorded. Additionally, to confirm they have only one husband, we should check if there's only one entry in that column for each relevant princess.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Husband dates are \"william ii , prince of orange 1626 - 1650\" \u2014 seems like just one husband.\n- Row 2: Husband is \"william iv , prince of orange 1711 - 1751\" \u2014 only one.\n- Row 3: Husband is \"king frederick i of w\u00fcrttemberg 1754 - 1816\" \u2014 single entry.\n- Row 4: Husband is \"frederick iii , german emperor 1831 - 1888\" \u2014 again, one husband.\n- Row 5: Husband is \"alexander duff , 1st duke of fife 1849 - 1912\" \u2014 single entry.\n- Row 6: Husband is \"henry lascelles , 6th earl of harewood 1882 - 1947\" \u2014 one husband.\n- Rows 7 and 7: For row 7, the first occurrence says mark phillips 1948 -, and the second row also mentions sir timothy laurence 1955 -. Wait, that's confusing. The same \"order\" (7) is listed twice? That might be a mistake because each row should have a unique order.\n\nWait, looking again: the table has two rows with order 7. That seems odd; maybe it's a typo or error in the data. But putting that aside, for each princess, we need to check their husband information. However, in the case of Row 7, there are two entries because the same row index is used twice, which isn't standard. So perhaps this indicates that Princess Anne has had two husbands.\n\nGiven that, if a princess has two husbands listed, then the claim would be false. Therefore, the relevant cells are the \"husband dates\" for each princess. So, in the table, the \"husband dates\" column is where we check how many husbands each princess has had.\n\nLooking at Row 7 (which might actually be a mistake, but assuming it's accurate), Princess Anne is listed with two different husbands: Mark Phillips and Timothy Laurence. Therefore, she has two marriages, making the claim false.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to check all the \"husband dates\" cells across rows, focusing on which princesses have only one entry there. Since Row 7 seems to indicate two marriages for Princess Anne, that's enough to disprove the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on whether Princess Anne (from Elizabeth II) has only one husband. By examining the \"husband dates\" column in the table, we find that Row 7 lists two husbands for her, thus disproving the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"princess anne of elizabeth be 1 of 3 princess on the list who have a divorce.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It mentions Princess Anne being one of three princesses listed in the table who have had a divorce. So my task is to look through the table and see if this statement holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent different princesses with details about their parent, marriage dates, etc. The columns relevant here are \"name\", \"parent\", \"date married\", \"husband dates\", etc. But specifically, I need to check for any mention of divorce. However, in the provided table, there's no column that explicitly mentions a divorce. The columns are: order, name, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates.\n\nSince the table doesn't have a \"divorce\" or similar column, I can't directly find information about whether each princess had a divorce. Therefore, even though Princess Anne is listed in row 7 with two entries, there's no data indicating she went through a divorce. The claim might be referring to her having a divorce, but without the necessary information in the table, I can't confirm it.\n\nAdditionally, the table lists several princesses, and if we consider only the rows provided, it's unclear how many of them have a divorce based on the data given.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for princess Mary who was married to Charles I in the table. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: The name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660\". Her husband is listed as \"charles i 1600 - 1649\", which matches the claim.\n- Rows 2,3,4,5,6,7: These are other princesses with different names (Anne, Charlotte, Victoria, Louise, Mary again but a different one, Anne again), so they aren't relevant here.\n\nSo, focusing on Row 1. The claim states that she died before turning 25. Let's check her death date. In the table, under \"name dates\", it's \"1631 - 1660\". Her death is mentioned in the princess royal column as \"1642 - 1660\". Wait, the husband's reign is from 1600-1649, but Mary's name includes 1631-1660, so she was born around 1631. If she died in 1660, that would make her about 29 years old (1631 + 29 = 1660). But wait, actually, if she was born in 1631 and died in 1660, that's 29 years. So, did she die before turning 25? No, because 25 would be around 1656, but she lived until at least 1660.\n\nWait, but looking again: the husband Charles I died in 1649, so Mary was married to him until his death. Her name is listed as princess royal from 1631-1660, so perhaps her reign started later. The princess royal column shows her term as 1642-1660. So she was married from around 1642 to 1660, but Charles died in 1649. So Mary's marriage ended when Charles I died. Now, regarding her age at death.\n\nIf she was born in 1631, then by 1641 (the date of marriage according to the table), she would be 10 years old. She married Charles I in 1641 and he died in 1649. So she was his wife from 10 to about 17 or so when he died? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1642-1660 as her princess royal term suggests she started later.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"name dates\" for Mary are 1631-1660, meaning her reign started in 1631. But since Charles I was king from 1600-1649, she likely married him before that. So maybe she was born around 1615? Let me think: if she started as princess royal in 1631, that would be when she took over after her predecessor, perhaps. But regardless of the exact birth year, if she died in 1660 at 29 years old, she certainly didn't die before turning 25.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's take it step by step:\n\n- If her name dates are from 1631 to 1660, and assuming she started as princess royal in 1631, that would make her death in 1660 at 29 years old.\n- The claim is that she died before turning 25, which would be around 1656. Since she lived until 1660, she was 29 when she died, so the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, let me check another column for her death date. In Row 1, the \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\" is 1642-1660. So maybe she became princess royal in 1642 and died in 1660. That would make her 18 years old when she took that role, but she was likely born before that. If she was born in 1623 (just as an example), then dying in 1660 at 37 would still not be before 25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to find the relevant cells that could confirm or deny her death before 25. So in the table, each row has \"name dates\" and the princess royal term. For Mary, it's 1631-1660. She died at 29, so she did not die before turning 25.\n\nWait, no: if someone is born in 1631, they turn 25 in 1656. If she died in 1660, that's after turning 25. So the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table indicates her death date as part of the princess royal term ending in 1660. So yes, she lived beyond 25. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Mary of Charles I died before turning 25 is false because her death occurred in 1660, which is after she would have turned 25.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"name dates\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
