    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"jessica ennis be the guest on andrew and jack guest episode broadcast on 4 may 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. There are three main points:\n1. Jessica Ennis was a guest.\n2. She was on an Andrew and Jack show.\n3. The episode aired on May 4, 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like the episode number, broadcast date, guests, etc. So I need to find rows that match all three criteria.\n\nStarting with the broadcast date: 4 May 2012. In the table, I'll look for rows where the 'first broadcast' column matches this date. Scanning through the table:\n- Row 0: 20 April\n- Row 1: 27 April\n- Row 2: 4 May (this is the one)\n- Row 3: 11 May\n- And so on.\n\nSo row 2 has the correct broadcast date of 4 May 2012. Now, check if Jessica Ennis was a guest in that episode. The 'andrew and jacks guest' column for row 2 lists 'jessica ennis'. Yes, she is mentioned there.\n\nNext, confirming that the show is \"Andrew and Jack.\" Looking at the table headers, the third column is named \"andrew and jacks guest,\" which suggests the show is indeed Andrew and Jack's. So that part checks out.\n\nPutting it all together: The episode on 4 May 2012 had Jessica Ennis as a guest on Andrew and Jack's show. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction. The claim is: \"the first broadcast with jessica ennis as andrew and jack guest be before may 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions two key points: \n1. Jessica Ennis was a guest on an episode of Andrew and Jack.\n2. This particular episode's first broadcast date was before May 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any episodes where Jessica Ennis was a guest and check their broadcast dates.\n\nThe table has multiple rows, each representing an episode. The columns relevant here are \"episode\" (which is 05x01, etc.), \"first broadcast\", and \"andrew and jacks guest\". \n\nI'll go through each row to find the one where Jessica Ennis was a guest. Scanning the \"andrew and jacks guest\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Georgie Thompson\n- Row 1: Louise Hazel\n- Row 2: Jessica Ennis\n- Row 3: Zo\u00eb Ball\n- Row 4: Clare Balding\n- Row 5: Christine Bleakley\n- Row 6: Claudia Winkleman\n\nOnly row 2 (05x03) has Jessica Ennis as the guest. Now, I need to check when this episode was first broadcast. The \"first broadcast\" date for this episode is May 4, 2012.\n\nThe claim says the broadcast should be before May 2012. May 4 is in May 2012, so it's not strictly before May 2012. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely true because the specific episode with Jessica Ennis was broadcasted on May 4, which is within May 2012.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might consider \"before May\" as up to April. However, May 4 is technically in May. So the date doesn't meet the condition of being before May 2012.\n\nSo, the claim is false because Jessica Ennis's episode was broadcasted on May 4, which isn't before May 2012.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the specific episode with Jessica Ennis was broadcast on May 4, 2012, which is not before May 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
