    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in HTML format, and the claim is specifically about game 75's opponent being the Minnesota North Stars.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. It has columns: game number, march (maybe a date?), opponent, score, and record. Each row represents a different game with these details.\n\nThe claim says that for game 75, the opponent was the Minnesota North Stars. So, I need to find the relevant data in the table related to game 75 and check if the opponent matches this team.\n\nLooking at the table rows, each starts with a game number. Let's scan through them until we find game 75. Here's what I see:\n\n- Game 63: Opponent is California Golden Seals\n- Game 64: Buffalo Sabres\n- ...\n- Game 70: Detroit Red Wings\n- Game 71: Philadelphia Flyers\n- Game 72: Toronto Maple Leafs\n- Game 73: Boston Bruins\n- Game 74: Montreal Canadiens\n- Game 75: Minnesota North Stars\n\nWait, no, game 75 is the one where the opponent is Minnesota North Stars. So that matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Looking at each row's game number until I find 75. The last few rows before 75 are:\n\n- Game 74: Montreal Canadiens\n- Game 75:Minnesota North Stars\n\nYes, so in row for game 75, opponent is Minnesota North Stars. That matches the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be from that specific row. Specifically, the columns 'game' and 'opponent'. So, I need to extract those cells.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, the answer needs to include the relevant_cells as a list of objects with row_index (int) and column_name (string).\n\nSo for game 75, it's row index is... let's see, starting from 0? Or does the first row have row index 1? Looking at the example given in the instructions: their example starts from 0, as in the sample JSON has row_index 0. But in the actual table provided, each <tr> is a row, so probably row indices start at 0.\n\nWait, looking back at the HTML, the first <tr> is game 63, which would be row index 0. So yes, each subsequent tr increases by one.\n\nSo for game 75, which is the 12th row from the top (since 75-63=12), but wait no: let's count:\n\nLooking at the HTML table, it starts with game 63 as the first row (row 0). Then 64 is row 1, up to 75 being row 12.\n\nSo in row 12, column 'opponent' is Minnesota North Stars. So the relevant cells are row 12 and the columns 'game' and 'opponent'.\n\nWait, but the instruction says \"the opponent for game 75\". So actually, I need to find which row corresponds to game 75 and then note that cell.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Identify the row where game number is 75.\n2. Find the columns relevant: in this case, 'opponent' since that's what the claim refers to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both 'game' and 'opponent' are relevant, but the instruction says to check each condition against the table. The claim has two conditions:\n\n- Opponent for game 75 is Minnesota North Stars.\n\nSo, I need to verify both aspects: that it's game 75, and that the opponent is indeed Minnesota North Stars.\n\nWait, no, because the 'game' column is given as 75 in that row, so perhaps just checking the opponent cell suffices. But maybe the claim could be about whether the opponent is correct for a specific game number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check both the game number and opponent. But since the game number is fixed, it's better to focus on opponent.\n\nBut the user instruction says: \"the opponent for game 75 be the minnesota north star\". So I think only the 'opponent' cell in that row is relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include the 'row_index' and 'column_name' of the opponent. Therefore, in this case, it's row 12 (since 63+12=75), column 'opponent'.\n\nWait, wait: actually, let's check how many rows there are. Starting from game 63 as row 0.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: 63\n\nRow 1:64\n\n...\n\nEach increment adds one. So to get to game 75, it's 75-63=12 rows down, so row index 12.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be a list with one object: row_index 12 and column 'opponent'.\n\nBecause that's where the opponent is listed as Minnesota North Stars.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because game 75 has Minnesota North Stars as the opponent, and the relevant cell is row 12, column 'opponent'.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about the opponent for game 75 being the Minnesota North Stars is correct, we first locate the relevant data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the row for game 75**: The table starts with game 63 as the first entry (row index 0). Each subsequent game increments by 1, so game 75 corresponds to row index 12.\n2. **Check the opponent's name** in that specific row: In row 12, the opponent is listed as Minnesota North Stars.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are met, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific game is true or false by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"the opponent for game 75 be the minnesota north stars with a record of 48 - 15 - 13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: the opponent and their record. \n\nStarting with the opponent, I need to find out who played against which game number in the table. The table has a column called \"game\" which lists the games from 63 to 76. Game 75 is one of them, so I'll look for that specific row.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The first column under \"game\" is numbered, and I'm searching for game 75. Scanning through the rows: 63,64,...70,71,72,73,74,75. There it is, row number 12 (since the first row is 63, so adding up 12 games gets to 75). \n\nIn that row (game 75), the \"opponent\" column says \"minnesota north stars.\" So that part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, checking the record. The claim specifies a record of 48-15-13. In the table, there's a column called \"record\" which seems to show three numbers separated by dashes. For game 75, the record is listed as \"48 - 15 - 12.\" Wait, that doesn't match 48-15-13. There's a discrepancy here\u2014maybe I misread it.\n\nWait, looking again: in row for game 75, the \"record\" cell says \"48 - 15 - 12.\" So the claim is stating 48-15-13, which isn't what's in the table. That means the record part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, even though the opponent matches, the record does not. Since both parts need to be correct for the entire claim to be true, this makes the overall claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for game 75, the opponent was Minnesota North Stars with a 48-15-13 record. \n\n- **Opponent Check**: \n  - Find the row for game 75: it's row index 12 (since game starts at 63).\n  - Opponent is Minnesota North Stars.\n\n- **Record Check**:\n  - Record in row for game 75 is \"48 - 15 - 12\", not \"48 - 15 - 13\".\n\nSince the record doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"after march 2 the minnesota north star be not the opponent until game 75.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that after March 2nd, the Minnesota North Stars are not the opponent until game 75. So, I should check the table to see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, march (which I assume is the date or sequence in March), opponent, score, and record. My focus here is on two things: when the Minnesota North Stars are the opponent and whether they appear after March 2nd but before game 75.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to games after March 2nd. The 'march' column likely indicates the date or sequence in March. For example, march=1 might be March 1st, march=2 on March 2nd, and so on. So I need to find all rows where 'march' is greater than 2 because the claim says \"after March 2.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 68: march=12 (so March 12th)\n- Row 69: march=15\n- Row 70: march=16\n- Row 71: march=18\n- Row 72: march=19\n- Row 73: march=23\n- Row 74: march=25\n- Row 75: march=26\n\nSo games 68 to 75 are after March 2nd.\n\nNext, I need to check if the Minnesota North Stars are opponents in any of these games before game 75. From the table:\n\n- Row 75 has 'opponent' as 'minnesota north stars', and it's game 75.\n- Checking the other rows (68-74), none have Minnesota North Stars as opponents.\n\nSo, from game 68 to 73, the opponent is someone else, like Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins, etc. Then in game 75, they play against themselves. But wait, that might be an error because a team doesn't usually play against itself in a series or games. Maybe it's a typo, but I have to go with what's given.\n\nWait, the claim says \"after March 2\" until game 75, so up to game 74, perhaps. Because game 75 is when they are opponents again, but if the claim is about not being opponents until game 75, then that would mean from after March 2 until game 75, they are not the opponent. But in reality, they are the opponent in game 75.\n\nWait, let me think again. The claim says \"after march 2 the minnesota north star be not the opponent until game 75.\" So up to and including game 75, they are not opponents except at game 75. Or does it mean that after March 2, they stop being opponents until game 75? That might imply that before March 2, they were opponents, then stopped being opponents after March 2 until game 75 when they become the opponent again.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nBefore March 2 (march=1 and 2), which games are there?\n\n- Game 63: march=1\n- Game 64: march=2\n\nIn those, the opponent is California Golden Seals and Buffalo Sabres. So in game 63, opponent is California, game 64 is Buffalo.\n\nThen starting from march=3 (game 65), opponent is Vancouver Canucks.\n\nLooking for when Minnesota North Stars are opponents before March 2:\n\nWait, actually in the table, I don't see any row where opponent is Minnesota North Stars until game 75. So up to game 74, they aren't opponents, and at game 75, they play against themselves, which might be a mistake but it's part of the data.\n\nSo according to the table, from March 2 (game 64) onwards, the opponent isn't Minnesota North Stars until game 75. But in the claim, it says after March 2, they are not opponents until game 75. That seems correct because they don't appear as opponents between games 65-74 and only do so at game 75.\n\nBut wait, does that mean that up to game 75, they aren't opponents? Or is the claim suggesting that from after March 2 onwards, they stop being opponents until game 75 when they become opponents again?\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that between games after March 2 and before game 75, they are not opponents. So from game 65 to 74, they aren't opponents, which matches the data.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all rows where opponent is Minnesota North Stars and where march >2 but <75? Wait, in the table, the only row with MN as opponent is game 75, which is at march=26. So perhaps the relevant cells are that specific row, row_index=74 (assuming rows start from 0 or not?), but I need to check.\n\nWait, let's count the rows:\n\nRow indices probably start from 0. Let me see:\n\nGame 63: row 0\nGame 64: row1\n...\nGame 75: would be row73 (since 75-63=12, so 12th game after 63 is 63+12=75, which is row63? Wait, no. Wait, each row represents a single game, so row_index=0 is game63, row1 is game64, etc. So game75 would be row74.\n\nSo in the table:\n\nLooking for when opponent is Minnesota North Stars: only at row74 (game75). So from March 2 onwards (games after march=2), until game75, they are not opponents except in game75 where they play against themselves.\n\nWait, but if the claim is that after March 2, they are not opponents until game75, which would mean up to and including game75, they aren't opponents. But since game75 is when they are opponents, perhaps the claim is incorrect because at game75, they become opponents again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim intended that between March 2 (game64) and before game75, they are not opponents, which is true because in games65-74, their opponent is someone else. Then at game75, they play as opponents.\n\nSo perhaps the relevant cells are all rows from march=3 to march=25, which would be row2 to row73 (since row74 is march26). Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused with indices and games. Let's list out the rows with their game numbers and opponents:\n\nRow0: game63, opponent: California\nRow1: game64, opponent: Buffalo\nRow2: game65, opponent: Vancouver\nRow3: game66, opponent: ?\nWait, actually, looking back at the table provided by the user, each row has columns: game number, march, opponent, score, record. So I need to check each row's 'opponent' column.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nLooking for when opponent is Minnesota North Stars:\n\nOnly in row74 (game75), as per the table provided earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me re-examine the table structure as given by the user:\n\nThe user wrote a table with columns: Game Number, March, Opponent, Score, Record. The rows are numbered from 0 to n-1, I assume.\n\nIn the initial data, the relevant part is:\n\nGame 63: opponent California\nGame64: Buffalo\nGame65: Vancouver\n...\nLooking through all the rows, only game75 has Minnesota North Stars as opponents.\n\nSo, in terms of the claim: after March2 (game64), until game75, they are not opponents. However, at game75, they become opponents again. So up to game74, they aren't opponents, and at game75, they are. Therefore, from March2 onwards, except for game75, they aren't opponents.\n\nBut the claim says \"after March 2... be not the opponent until game 75.\" Which would mean that after March2 (game64), they stop being opponents until game75 when they become opponents again.\n\nSo in the table, this holds true because between game65 and game74, their opponents are others. Therefore, the relevant cells would be all the rows where opponent is not Minnesota North Stars after March2 but including up to game75.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about them being not opponents until game75. So from March2 onwards (game64), they stop being opponents until game75 when they become opponents again.\n\nSo in the table, that would mean that starting from row1 (game64) onward, except for row74 (game75), their opponent is not Minnesota North Stars.\n\nBut wait, in the data provided by the user, the table starts at game63 and goes up. So after March2 (game64), until game75, they are not opponents except at game75.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all rows from row1 to row73 where opponent is not Minnesota North Stars, but including row74 where opponent is MN as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user wants to know which specific cells (rows) make the statement true. So the statement is that after March2 (game64), until game75, they are not opponents. But at game75, they become opponents again.\n\nSo in terms of data:\n\n- From game65 (row2) to game74 (row73): opponent is someone else.\n\n- At game75 (row74): opponent is MN, which contradicts the statement's implication that until game75, they are not opponents.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct cells to highlight are from row2 (game65) to row73 (game74), where their opponent is not MN. And then at row74, it becomes MN.\n\nBut the user is asking for what makes the statement true, so perhaps the relevant cells are all the rows from row1 onwards except row74.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only row74 needs to be included because that's when they become opponents again, making the previous assertion incorrect.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe user wants to identify which specific data points (rows) support the claim that after March2 (game64), until game75, the team is not the opponent of MN. So in other words, from game64 onwards, they don't play against MN as opponents until game75 when they do become opponents again.\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows would be:\n\n- All rows starting from row1 (game64) up to row73 (game74), where their opponent is not MN.\n\n- And then row74 (game75) where opponent is MN, which contradicts the statement's conclusion that they are not opponents until game75. So perhaps only the first part is relevant, but since the statement includes up to game75 as not being opponents, and at game75 it does become opponents, maybe the statement isn't entirely accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if the statement is that from March2 onwards (game64), they do not have MN as opponents until after game75, then perhaps only game75 and beyond would be relevant. But in the data provided by the user, we don't have games beyond 75.\n\nThis is getting too confusing without seeing the actual table data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to highlight the rows where opponent is MN and after March2, which is just row74 (game75).\n\nBut perhaps I should consider that the task is to find the cells that make the statement true. So the statement says: after March2, until game75, they are not opponents. But in reality, at game75, they become opponents again. Therefore, to support the statement, we need to exclude row74.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to say that up to game74, they are not opponents, and then at game75, they are, which makes the statement partially true but with an exception.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to consider that the relevant cells are from row2 (game65) to row73 (game74), where opponent is not MN, and then row74 (game75) where opponent is MN. Therefore, these would be the cells needed to support the statement, but since game75 contradicts it, maybe only up to row73.\n\nBut without more information, I think the best answer is that the relevant rows are from row2 onwards (i.e., games65 and beyond) until row74, highlighting that their opponents change except for game75.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which data points support the statement that after March 2 (game64), until game75, the team does not have Minnesota North Stars as their opponent, we need to examine each relevant row:\n\n- **Rows 1 to 73 (games64 to 74):** In these rows, the opponents are not the Minnesota North Stars. This supports the statement.\n- **Row74 (game75):** Here, the opponent is the Minnesota North Stars, which contradicts the statement's conclusion that they do not become opponents until game75.\n\nTherefore, the data points supporting the claim are from row1 to row73, where their opponents are not the Minnesota North Stars.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n- **Relevant Rows:** From row1 (game64) to row73 (game74)\n- **Highlighting Opponent Column:** Emphasizing that in these rows, the opponent is not Minnesota North Stars",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific conditions in the claim. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the lowest game number of the game after march 2 with the detroit red wing as the opponent be 76.0\". \n\nSo, I need to find all games that meet two criteria:\n1. The game is after March 2.\n2. The opponent is the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nThen, among those games, identify the lowest game number and check if it's exactly 76.0.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with columns: game number (game), march (which I assume is the number of games played in March?), opponent, score, and record. But wait, the 'march' column might actually indicate the date or sequence within March, not sure, but perhaps it's better to consider that as the date or specific identifier.\n\nWait, the first row has game 63 with march 1. Then game 64 is march 2. So perhaps each row represents a single game, with 'march' indicating the month and day? Or maybe it's just a counter within March. The key point is that we're looking for games after March 2.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 63: March 1\n- Game 64: March 2\n- Game 65: March 5\n- And so on until game 76, which is March 29.\n\nSo, the claim specifies \"after March 2,\" meaning games where the 'march' value is greater than 2. So that would be games starting from March 5 onwards.\n\nNext, we need to find all these games where the opponent is Detroit Red Wings.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Game 64: Opponent is Buffalo Sabres.\n- Game 65: Vancouver Canucks.\n- Game 66: Chicago Black Hawks.\n- Game 67: Detroit Red Wings. So game 67 is after March 2, opponent is Detroit Red Wings.\n- Game 68: California Golden Seals.\n- Game 69: Chicago Black Hawks.\n- Game 70: Detroit Red Wings again (game 70).\n- Game 71: Philadelphia Flyers.\n- Game 72: Toronto Maple Leafs.\n- Game 73: Boston Bruins.\n- Game 74: Montreal Canadiens.\n- Game 75: Minnesota North Stars.\n- Game 76: Detroit Red Wings.\n\nSo, relevant games after March 2 with Detroit Red Wings as opponents are game 67, 70, and 76.\n\nNow, among these, the lowest game number is 67. But wait, the claim says \"the lowest game number... be 76.0\". That would imply that 76 is the minimum, which isn't true because there's a game 67 that's lower than 76.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check:\n\nAfter March 2, the games with Detroit Red Wings are at game numbers 67,70,76. The lowest among these is 67, not 76. So if the claim says the lowest is 76, that's incorrect because there's a lower number (67). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the 'march' column. If 'march' indicates the month and day, then after March 2 would include March 3 onwards. But in the table, game numbers are sequential: 63 on March 1, 64 on March 2, then presumably March 3 is game 65? Wait, no, looking at the data:\n\nLooking at the 'march' column:\n- Row 0: march=1 (game 63)\n- Row 1: march=2 (game 64)\n- Row 2: march=5 (game 65)\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Game numbers are 63 to 76, but the 'march' values go from 1,2,5,8,... It seems like it's not the date but perhaps an internal counter within March or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a sequential number per month.\n\nWait, maybe each row is a different game, and 'march' indicates the month in which the game occurred. So for example:\n\n- Game 63: Played in March (march=1)\n- Game 64: Also in March (march=2)\n- Then perhaps April (march=3) would be next, but here it's going to 5, which might not make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'march' column is indicating the number of games played in March, not the month. So, for example:\n\nGame 63: that's the first game, so maybe March has more than one game? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'march' value isn't relevant to the date but is just an identifier column, and the key columns are 'game' and 'opponent'.\n\nIn that case, we can ignore the 'march' column as it might be an internal tracking number. So, focusing on 'game' and 'opponent' columns:\n\nLooking for games where opponent is Detroit Red Wings and game number is after a certain point.\n\nBut without knowing what \"after March 2\" refers to, perhaps 'march' indicates the date or sequence in March. For example, game 64 is March 2, so games after that would be games with higher 'game' numbers.\n\nSo, considering 'march' as indicating the specific March date:\n\n- Game 63: March 1\n- Game 64: March 2\n- Game 65: March 5 (but perhaps the 'march' value is 3 for March 3? Not sure.)\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe the 'march' column is just a sequential number within the dataset, not related to actual dates.\n\nIn that case, \"after March 2\" might refer to rows where 'march' > 2. So looking at the table:\n\nRows where 'march' > 2 (assuming 'march' is an incremental counter):\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: march=1 \u2192 no\n- Row 1: march=2 \u2192 no\n- Row 2: march=5 \u2192 yes\n- Row 3: march=8 \u2192 yes\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut then, the opponent for row 2 is Chicago Black Hawks, row 3 is Detroit Red Wings (game 67), etc.\n\nSo, games after March 2 would start from row 2 onwards where opponent is Detroit Red Wings. So in this case:\n\nRow 6: game=67, march=8? Opponent: Detroit Red Wings \u2192 yes\nRow 7: game=70, march=10? Opponent: Detroit Red Wings \u2192 yes\nRow 11: game=76, march=29? Opponent: Detroit Red Wings \u2192 yes\n\nSo the relevant games are 67,70,76. The lowest among these is 67, so the claim that the lowest is 76 is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest game number after March 2 with the Detroit Red Wings as opponents is 76, but in reality, the lowest such game number is 67.
