    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"just 1 of the judge be appoint as a chief justice\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions that only one judge was appointed as a chief justice. So, my task is to check how many judges hold the position of chief justice in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. The ranks include \"associate justice\" and \"chief justice.\" My focus should be on the 'rank' column to identify who is a chief justice.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez - associate justice.\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda - associate justice.\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo - associate justice.\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton - chief justice.\n5. Liana Fiol Matta - associate justice.\n6. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez - associate justice.\n7. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco - associate justice.\n8. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres - associate justice.\n9. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n - associate justice.\n\nFrom this, I can see that only one person is a chief justice: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton. That means exactly one judge was appointed as the chief justice. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because it states \"just 1 of the judge,\" which matches the data in the table.\n\nNow, considering the relevant cells for this check, I need to identify which rows and columns are relevant. The 'rank' column is crucial here because that's where we determine if someone is a chief justice. So, each row where rank is \"chief justice\" would be relevant. In this case, only row 4 (index 3) has Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton as the chief justice.\n\nTherefore, I should include in 'relevant_cells' the object corresponding to row index 3 and column name \"rank.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by analyzing the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"2 third of the judge appoint have more than 10 year to go until their mandatory retirement.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into manageable parts. \n\n\"2/3 of the judge appointments have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement.\" So, I need to check if two-thirds (or approximately two-thirds) of the judges in the table have a retirement age that is more than 10 years from their current position.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 9 judges listed. To find two-thirds of this number, I can calculate it as follows: 2/3 of 9 is about 6 judges. So, I need to verify if at least 6 of these 9 judges have a retirement age greater than 10 years.\n\nNext, I'll look through each row and note the value in the \"years until mandatory retirement\" column. Here are the values:\n\n- Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: 6 years\n- Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: 11 years\n- Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: 17 years\n- Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: 0 year\n- Liana Fiol Matta: 2 years\n- Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: 27 years\n- Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: 13 years\n- Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: 15 years\n- Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: 19 years\n\nNow, I'll count how many of these have more than 10 years:\n\n1. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: 11 > 10 \u2192 yes\n2. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: 17 > 10 \u2192 yes\n3. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: 27 > 10 \u2192 yes\n4. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: 13 > 10 \u2192 yes\n5. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: 15 > 10 \u2192 yes\n6. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: 19 > 10 \u2192 yes\n\nSo, there are 6 judges with more than 10 years until retirement. That's exactly two-thirds of the total 9 judges (since 6/9 = 2/3). \n\nHowever, I should also check if \"judge appoint\" refers to their rank or position. In the table, each judge has a \"rank,\" which can be either \"associate justice\" or \"chief justice.\" The claim mentions \"judge appoint,\" which seems to refer to the appointment process, possibly their role.\n\nBut in this context, it's more about the number of years until retirement based on their current position. Since all the associate justices have varying years, and the chief justice has 0 year, which is less than 10. So, only the associate justices are relevant here because the chief justice doesn't affect the count.\n\nWait, but in this table, the \"years until mandatory retirement\" might be based on their current role. For example, a chief justice might have different rules compared to an associate justice. However, since Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is the chief justice with 0 years, he doesn't meet the criteria, so he's excluded from the count.\n\nTherefore, out of the 8 associate justices (since there are 9 total and one is a chief justice), we have 6 meeting the 10+ year requirement. But wait, the original table has 9 judges in total, with one being a chief justice. So actually, all except Federico are associate justices, making 8. Out of these 8, 6 meet the criteria.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the table includes all 9 as separate entries regardless of rank. The \"years until mandatory retirement\" is specific to each individual's position. So, for example, if a judge is an associate justice when appointed and later becomes chief justice, their years might change. However, in this table, it seems that each row represents the current status upon appointment, so perhaps the years are based on the time remaining as of that point.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can consider all 9 judges as separate entities with their own retirement years. So, for each judge, regardless of rank, if they have more than 10 years until retirement, they count toward the two-thirds.\n\nIn this case, there are 6 such judges (Edgardo, Erick, Luis, Mildred, Rafael, Roberto). Since 6 is exactly two-thirds of 9, that meets the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"only 3 of the new justice be appoint by sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table shows. Let me look at each row and see who was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. The column in question is \"appointed by,\" so I should focus on that.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n2. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, not Sila.\n3. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: Appointed by Sila in 2004.\n4. Liana Fiol Matta: Appointed by Sila in 2004.\n5. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n6. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n7. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n8. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nSo, from the table, there are four individuals who were appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n: Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, Liana Fiol Matta, and possibly another? Wait, let me count again. Anabelle is one, Federico is two, Liana is three. Oh, wait, that's only three so far. Did I miss anyone?\n\nWait, looking back, the fourth row: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is the third. Then Liana Fiol Matta is the fourth. So that's four people appointed by Sila.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 3 of the new justice be appoint by sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n.\" That would mean only three were appointed by her, but according to my count, there are four: Anabelle, Federico, Liana, and possibly another? Wait no, in row 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Let me list them:\n\nRow 0: Anabelle - yes\nRow 1: Erick - no\nRow 2: Federico - yes (third)\nRow 3: Liana - yes (fourth)\nRows 4-8 are all appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nWait, so that's four people: rows 0,2,3. Wait, row 3 is Liana Fiol Matta, which would be the third? No, row 0 is Anabelle (1), row 2 is Federico (2), row 3 is Liana (3). Then, is there another? Let me check:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 8. So rows 0,2,3 are three people. But wait, in row 4: Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez is appointed by Fortu\u00f1o, so not Sila.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"only 3 of the new justice be appoint by sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n.\" So if there are four, that would make the claim false because it's saying only three were appointed by her when actually four were.\n\nBut let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: Anabelle - Sila (yes)\nRow 1: Erick - Fortu\u00f1o\nRow 2: Federico - Sila (second)\nRow 3: Liana - Sila (third)\nRow 4: Luis Estrella - Fortu\u00f1o\nRow 5: Mildred - Fortu\u00f1o\nRow 6: Rafael - Fortu\u00f1o\nRow 7: Roberto - Fortu\u00f1o\n\nWait, that's three people: Anabelle, Federico, Liana. So the count is three, not four.\n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me list them:\n\n1. Anabelle (row 0)\n2. Federico (row 2)\n3. Liana (row 3)\n\nThat's three. So the claim says only three were appointed by Sila, which matches the data. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nWait but earlier I thought there were four because I miscounted. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Anabelle - Sila (1)\nRow 2: Federico - Sila (2)\nRow 3: Liana - Sila (3)\n\nSo three in total.

It appears no other rows have a 'year appointed' of 2010 except for Edgardo. Therefore, the claim is correct in stating that only one was appointed in 2010.\n\nHowever, before finalizing, I should consider if there are any other possible interpretations. The term \"be appoint\" could be ambiguous\u2014does it refer to the justice being appointed or someone else? But given the context of the table, which lists justices and their appointment years, it's clear that we're talking about the justices' appointments.\n\nAdditionally, the claim uses the phrase \"only 1 of the justice,\" but there are multiple associate justices. The term \"justice\" is used in the table as a rank, so each row represents a different justice. So, it's correct to say that only one was appointed in 2010.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing all rows and focusing on the 'year appointed' column, I can confirm that the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one justice was appointed in 2010.

So, my task is to check each row in the table and see if any of the judges with the rank \"chief justice\" have a \"years until mandatory retirement\" greater than 1.\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on the rows where the \"rank\" column is \"chief justice\". Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez - associate justice, so not relevant.\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda - associate justice, same as above.\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo - associate justice.\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton - chief justice. This is the first relevant row for the claim.\n5. Liana Fiol Matta - associate justice.\n6.

The number 0 here likely means that he retired immediately upon appointment or perhaps there was no requirement for him to serve beyond that point.\n\nThe claim is whether any judge last more than a year as chief justice. Since his years are listed as 0, which is not greater than 1, this doesn't violate the claim.

Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n5. Liana Fiol Matta: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n6. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n7. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n8. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n9. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\n\nFrom this, I can see that several judges were indeed appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Specifically, Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda, Erick Kolthoff Caraballo, Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez, Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco, Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres, and Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n all have \"Luis fortu\u00f1o\" listed as their appointing authority.\n\nSo, since multiple judges are appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, the claim holds true. I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"appointed by\" column is the key here, so each row where this column has Luis Fortu\u00f1o is relevant. That would be rows 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with those specific cells marked as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, the claim says that \"1 of the judge be appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o.\" The term \"1 of the judge\" implies that there's at least one judge in the table who was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. So I need to check each row in the table to see if any justice has Luis Fortu\u00f1o as their appointer.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different judge with details like name, rank, years until retirement, who they were appointed by, and the year of appointment. The column relevant here is \"appointed by,\" which should be checked against Luis Fortu\u00f1o's name.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez**: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n2. **Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda**: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2010.\n3. **Erick Kolthoff Caraballo**: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n4. **Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton**: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n5. **Liana Fiol Matta**: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n6. **Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez**: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2011.\n7. **Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco**: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n8. **Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres**: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n9. **Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n**: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2011.\n\nFrom this, I can see that several judges\u2014specifically Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda, Erick Kolthoff Caraballo, Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco, Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres, and Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n\u2014were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Each of these individuals meets the condition outlined in the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there is at least one judge (in fact, multiple) who was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n appoint the chief justice\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed someone as the Chief Justice. So, my goal is to check if there's any record in the table where she did this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a person with their details. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"appointed by\" and \"name,\" because we want to see who was appointed and by whom. Also, since it's about a Chief Justice, I should focus on that role specifically, so maybe the column \"rank\" could help too.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: Appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004. Her rank is Associate Justice, not Chief Justice.\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2010. Associate Justice.\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: Appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009. Associate Justice.\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: He is the Chief Justice, appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n\nSo, row 4 shows that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n did indeed appoint someone as Chief Justice. That directly supports the claim.\n\nNow, I need to map this out into relevant cells. The relevant columns are \"appointed by\" and \"name,\" specifically for each instance where Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n is the appointer. So, row 4's columns: \"appointed by\" which is Sila, and \"name\" which is Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton. Also, checking if there are any others. Looking through the rest of the rows, I see that Sila only appointed Federico as Chief Justice.\n\nWait, but in row 0, Anabelle is also appointed by Sila, but she's an Associate Justice, not Chief. So only row 4 is relevant for the claim about appointing a Chief Justice.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one relevant cell where Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton as Chief Justice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the table carefully. The table has several columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. My focus is on the \"chief justice\" rank and the \"year appointed\" column to check if any chief justice was appointed in 2011.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: name is anabelle rodr\u00edguez, rank is associate justice.\n- Row 1: edgardo rivera garcia, associate justice.\n- Row 2: erick kolthoff caraballo, associate justice.\n- Row 3: federico hern\u00e1ndez denton, chief justice.
