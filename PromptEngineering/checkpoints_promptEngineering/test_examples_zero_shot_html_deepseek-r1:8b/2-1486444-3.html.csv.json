    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify whether the claim is true based on the provided table. The claim is: \"At the shooto 2003 event on March 18th in Tokyo, Japan, he battled with fighter Rumina Sato.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each part of this claim against the table columns and rows.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns like Date, Opponent, Event. Each row seems to represent a fight or match that the fighter had. My task is to find relevant cells that could support the claim.\n\nStarting with the event details: The claim mentions \"shooto 2003 event on March 18th in Tokyo, Japan.\" So I need to see if there's an event with Shooto 2003 and the date matching March 18, 2003. Looking through the table, most dates are in the 'Date' column. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 5: Date is \"2/9/2024\" (probably 2024, not relevant)\n- ... skipping ahead, looking for March 18, 2003. Wait, I don't see that exact date in the table. The earliest dates are from 2002 onward, but let me check each row's Date column carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me list out all the 'Date' entries:\n\nLooking at each row's Date:\nRow 0: \"3/18/2024\"\nRow 1: \"2/9/2024\"\nRow 2: \"2/25/2024\"\n... up to Row 5, which is March events? Wait, no, looking closer, the first few rows have dates in 2024. Maybe I misread. Let me check each row.\n\nWait, perhaps the table starts from 2023 or later because some of the opponents like RUMINA SATO are listed with later dates. Wait, actually, the opponent RUMINA SATO is in Row 5: \"rumina sato\" as Opponent, Date: 2/9/2024.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to a fight that happened on March 18th, 2003, which would be earlier than these rows. So perhaps this row isn't the one. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each row's Date column carefully:\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see rows starting from 0:\n\nRow 0: Opponent RUMINA SATO, Date 2/9/2024\nRow 1: Opponent RUMINA SATO again? Wait no, looking back, Row 5 is the first with RUMINA SATO as opponent. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting rows. Let me list each row's details:\n\nRow 0:\n- Opponent: Rumina Sato\n- Date: 2/9/2024\n- Event: Shooto 2003: 3/18 (probably a typo)\n\nWait, no, the table seems to have inconsistent data. For example, Row 5 has \"Shooto 2003: year - end show\" as the Event, with Date 11/30/2002.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the 'Opponent' column, RUMINA SATO appears in multiple rows. The claim specifies a fight against Rumina Sato at Shooto 2003 on March 18th in Tokyo. So I need to find a row where the Opponent is Rumina Sato and the Event is related to Shooto 2003, and the Date is March 18, 2003.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 5: Opponent is Rumina Sato, Event is \"Shooto 2003: year - end show\", Date is November 30, 2002. So not March 18th.\n\nRow 4: Opponent Takumi Nakayama, Event Shooto 2002, Date Nov 30, 2002.\n\nRow 6: Opponent Sami Hyyppa, Event Shooto Finland, Date April 00, 2003.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is referring to a different event. Wait, let me check each row again:\n\nLooking for \"Shooto 2003\" in the 'Event' column:\n\n- Row 5: \"Shooto 2002: year - end show\"\n- Row 6: \"Shooto Finland : the first time\"\n- Others don't mention Shooto 2003.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the table only goes up to a certain year. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because in the table, there's no event on March 18th, 2003 where he fought Rumina Sato.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a different fighter or an incorrect date.\n\nWait, another angle: The claim says \"he battled with fighter rumina sato.\" So I need to find if any row has both Opponent as Rumina Sato and Event as Shooto 2003. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 5: Opponent is Rumina Sato, but Event is Shooto 2002, not 2003.\n- Row 0: Opponent is Rumina Sato, Date is February 9, 2024.\n\nWait, the dates in the table go up to 2024, which is much later than 2003. So perhaps the claim refers to an event that's not listed in the table or a typo in the date.\n\nAdditionally, looking for March 18th in any row: None of the 'Date' columns have 03/18/2003. The closest is Row 5 with November 30, 2002.\n\nSo putting it together: There's no row that matches both the opponent Rumina Sato and the event Shooto 2003 on March 18th. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect or based on incomplete data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is from a different year, but given the information provided, there's no matching row for the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not have a matching entry in the provided table. There is no record of a fight involving Rumina Sato at the Shooto 2003 event on March 18th, 2003. \n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect based on the information provided in the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"at dream 11 , his fight with shinya aoki go to 4:56\" is true based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of this claim means.\n\nFirst, the event mentioned is \"dream 11.\" I need to check if there's any row in the table that mentions \"Dream 11.\" Looking through the rows, I don't see an exact match for \"Dream 11\" in any column like Event or Opponent. The events listed are things like \"CW 3,\" \"Fire Fight 5,\" etc., but no \"Dream 11.\" That's a red flag because if it's not mentioned, maybe the fight didn't happen under that name.\n\nNext, the claim refers to a fight against \"Shinya Aoki.\" I should look for any row where the opponent is Shinya Aoki. Scanning through each row, I don't see his name listed as an opponent in any of the table cells. The opponents mentioned are names like Vitor Ribeiro, Takumi Nakayama, and others, but not Shinya Aoki.\n\nThe time mentioned is \"4:56.\" Looking at the table, there's a column for Duration or maybe another time-related column? Let me check each row. Most of them have columns like Event, Opponent, or Result. Some have things like \"Revenue,\" \"Employees,\" which don't seem relevant. Wait, in one of the rows, there's a cell with \"4:56\" under the column name \"Duration.\" Hmm, that might be relevant.\n\nBut even if that's the case, the opponent isn't Shinya Aoki, and the event isn't Dream 11. So putting it all together, the claim doesn't seem to have any supporting evidence in the table provided. There's no fight with Shinya Aoki at Dream 11 ending at 4:56.\n\nI should also consider if \"Dream 11\" might be abbreviated or referred to differently in the table, but since I don't see it spelled out, that doesn't help. The opponent's name is also not present, so even if there was a fight ending at 4:56, without the right event and opponent, the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Duration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18 be the event in turku, finland and have an opponent of rumina sato.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. There are two main points here:\n\n1. The event is \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" held in Turku, Finland.\n2. The opponent in this event is Rumina Sato.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find cells related to these two points. \n\nStarting with the first part, I'll search for \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\". Scanning through the column names, I see that some columns mention \"Shooto\" followed by a year and a number, like \"shooto 2003: 8 / 10\", \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\", etc. So I need to find rows where the column name is exactly \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\".\n\nNext, for the second part, the opponent is Rumina Sato. So I'll look for any row where the fighter's name is Rumina Sato and the event location is Turku, Finland.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In row 5 (index 5), column \"Shooto 2003: 3 / 18\", the fighter is Rumina Sato.\n- The event location for this row is Turku, Finland.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check two specific cells in the table. \n\n1. **shooto 2003: 3 / 18** event in Turku, Finland.\n2. Opponent of Rumina Sato in that event.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 5 has the column \"Shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" and the fighter is Rumina Sato, held in Turku, Finland.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Shooto 2003: 3 / 18\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and instructions. The claim is: \"his fight at pride bushido 10 ended via KO with a knee strike.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Pride Bushido 10**: This refers to an event by the Pride Mixed Martial Arts promotion, specifically their 10th event.\n2. **Ended via KO (Knockout)**: This means the fighter was defeated through a knockout.\n3. **With a knee strike**: The method of the knockout was a knee strike.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a fight with various details like date, opponent, result, etc. I need to find the specific fight that matches these criteria.\n\nI'll start by scanning the table for any mention of \"Pride Bushido 10.\" However, I notice that in the column named \"Opponent\" and other columns, the terms related to Pride events are listed as \"Pride\" or \"Pride Fighter,\" but none explicitly say \"Pride Bushido 10.\" This might mean that the table isn't directly indicating which specific event each fight took place at.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, the table has a column labeled \"Event,\" and under that, entries like \"Cage Match,\" \"MMA Fight,\" etc. There's no entry explicitly mentioning \"Pride Bushido 10\" in the Event column. This could be an issue because if the claim refers to Pride Bushido 10, but the table doesn't specify this event for any of the fights, then it might not be possible to verify.\n\nHowever, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe I should look for the fighter mentioned in the claim. The claim doesn't specify who the fighter was, so without knowing that, it's harder to pinpoint the exact row. Alternatively, maybe the table includes enough details to infer which fight this refers to.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Pride Bushido 10\" is a well-known event with a specific fighter known for a KO via knee strike. If I could match the fighter's name and the result, that might help. But since I don't have any names in the claim, I can't directly look up who the fighter was.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row to see if any of them have a KO result caused by a knee strike. Let's go through some rows:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is unknown, Result is unknown.\n- Row 1: Opponent is Vitor Ribeiro, Submission via arm triangle choke.\n- Row 2: Takahashi Gomi vs. Takanori Gomi, Decision.\n- Row 3: Rumina Sato vs. Takanori Gomi, TKO.\nWait, that's not a knee strike. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the Results column, some entries are KO or TKO. For example, row 5 shows a KO by TAKANORI GOMI over RUMINA SATO via TKO. But that's not a knee strike; it's a punch.\n\nWait, let me check if any rows mention a KO via knee:\n\nLooking through the Results:\n\n- Row 6: Vitor Ribeiro vs. Rumina Sato? No, it's a submission.\n- Row 7: Takahashi Gomi vs. Takanori Gomi? Decision.\n- Row 8: Rumina Sato vs. Takumi Nakayama? Decision.\n- Row 9: Sami Hyyppa vs. Someone? Submission.\n- Row 10: Draw between Rafles La Rose and someone.\n- Row 11: Olof Ingier wins via decision.\n- Row 12: Jani Lax loses via submission.\n- Row 13: Marcus Peltonen wins via TKO.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to have a KO via knee strike. Now, this is confusing because if none of the fights in the table are KO'd by a knee strike, then the claim might be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. The table seems incomplete or perhaps not all rows are shown. Alternatively, maybe the specific fight referred to isn't listed here.\n\nAnother angle: The column names include \"Opponent,\" \"Result,\" \"Event,\" and others. If the event is Pride Bushido 10, but that's not in the Event column, then there's no data to support it. So, without evidence of a KO via knee in the table, the claim can't be fully supported.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a fight at Pride Bushido 10 ending via KO with a knee strike. Upon examining the table, none of the listed fights specify a KO caused by a knee strike or reference Pride Bushido 10 directly. Therefore, there's insufficient evidence in the provided data to confirm the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nFALSE",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"round 3 be at 3:50\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the table represents. It seems like it's a record of fight events or something similar, with columns like 'Opponent', 'Time', and 'Event'. Each row probably represents a different match or round.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"round 3 be at 3:50\". So I need to check if there's a row where the round number is 3 and the time is exactly 3:50. Let me go through each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it starts from row 0 up to row 14. Each row has various details. I'll focus on the 'Round' column and the 'Time' column for this task.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Round: 6\n- Time: 5:00\n\nRow 1:\n- Round: 5\n- Time: 2:09\n\nRow 2:\n- Round: 4\n- Time: 5:00\n\nRow 3:\n- Round: 3\n- Time: 4:00\n\nHmm, row 3 has a round number of 3 but the time is 4:00, not 3:50. That's different.\n\nContinuing to check if any other rows have round 3 with time 3:50. Let me go further:\n\nRow 4:\n- Round: 2\n- Time: 5:00\n\nRow 5:\n- Round: 1\n- Time: 1:38\n\nRows after that don't seem to reset the round numbers again, as it goes from 6 down to 1. So there's only one instance where the round is 3, at row 3 with a time of 4:00.\n\nSince none of the rows have both round 3 and time 3:50, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"round 3 be at 3:50\", we check if any row has Round=3 and Time=\"3:50\". Scanning each row:\n\n- **Row 3**: Round=3, Time=4:00 (not 3:50)\n- No other rows meet both criteria.\n\nSince no such entry exists, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dream 11 be the event at 5:00 with the opponent of caol uno\" is true based on the provided table. First, let me break down what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific things:\n1. The event is \"dream 11\".\n2. This event takes place at 5:00.\n3. The opponent in this event is the same person who fought against Caol Uno.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight event with details like the fighter's name, their record before the fight, the outcome (win/loss/draw), the column name, etc. So I need to check for any rows where \"dream 11\" is mentioned as the event and whether the opponent fought Caol Uno.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row's \"Event\" column for \"dream 11\". If I find such a row, then I need to check if the opponent in that fight is indeed the same person who fought against Caol Uno elsewhere in the table.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n- Row 0: Event is \"dream 11\", fighter is Olf, result is win. Opponent is Marcus Peltonen.\nWait, no, let me check again. The row index might not be correct because I'm looking for \"Dream 11\" as the event name.\n\nLooking at each row's \"Event\" column:\n\nRow 0: Event is \"dream 11\"\nFighter: Olf Inger\nResult: Win\nOpponent: Marcus Peltonen\n\nRow 6: Event is \"Fire Fight 5\"\nRow 7: Event is \"Fire Fight 4\"\nRow 8: Event is \"Fire Fight 3\"\n\nOther events like \"CW 3\" and others don't mention \"Dream 11\".\n\nSo, the only row where the event is \"dream 11\" is Row 0. In that fight, Olf Inger fought Marcus Peltonen.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a fight where Caol Uno fought against someone else. Looking through the table:\n\nLooking for rows where Caol Uno is either the fighter or the opponent.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 3: Fighter: Sami Hyyppa vs Rafles La Rose\n- Row 4: Fighter: Olf Inger vs Rafles La Rose (draw)\n- Row 5: Fighter: Vitor Ribeiro vs Takumi Nakayama (loss for Ribeiro)\n- Row 6: Fighter: Takanori Gomi vs Rumina Sato (win)\n- Row 7: Fighter: Rumina Sato vs Vitor Ribeiro (win)\n- Row 8: Fighter: Takumi Nakayama vs Rafles La Rose (win)\n- Row 9: Fighter: Olf Inger vs Jani Lahti (loss)\n- Row 10: Fighter: Marcus Peltonen vs Jani Lahti (win)\n- Row 11: Fighter: Caol Uno vs Sami Hyyppa (win)\n\nAh, here we go. Row 11 is where Caol Uno fought against Sami Hyyppa and won.\n\nSo the claim says that in \"dream 11\" event at 5:00, Caol Uno's opponent is someone. Looking back, in Row 0, Olf Inger fought Marcus Peltonen in \"dream 11\". But Caol Uno's fight was against Sami Hyyppa.\n\nWait, so the claim says that in \"dream 11\" event, Caol Uno's opponent is the same person who fought him elsewhere. But in Row 0, it's Olf Inger vs Marcus Peltonen in \"dream 11\". That doesn't involve Caol Uno. Caol Uno fought Sami Hyyppa in a different event, which was \"Fire Fight 3\" (Row 12: Fighter: Marcus Peltonen vs Jani Lahti). Wait no, that's Row 13.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the row indices. Let me recount:\n\nRows start from index 0 to 19. So in the table provided, each row corresponds to a specific fight.\n\nLooking for where \"dream 11\" is the event: it's only in Row 0. The fighter was Olf Inger, opponent Marcus Peltonen.\n\nNow, Caol Uno fought Sami Hyyppa in Row 3? No, Row 3 is Sami vs Rafles. Wait no, let me check again:\n\nWait, looking at the table as provided:\n\nRow 11: Fighter: Caol Uno vs Sami Hyyppa (win). So that's \"Fire Fight 3\" event.\n\nSo in the claim, it says that in \"dream 11\" event, the opponent of Caol Uno is present. But in Row 0, the event was \"dream 11\", but the fighter was Olf Inger, not Caol Uno. The opponent was Marcus Peltonen. So in \"dream 11\", Olf fought Marcus, not Caol.\n\nTherefore, the claim that in \"dream 11\" at 5:00, the opponent of Caol Uno is present is incorrect because in that event, it's a different fighter and opponent altogether.\n\nSo the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false. In the table provided, there is no evidence that Caol Uno fought in the \"dream 11\" event at 5:00; instead, he fought Sami Hyyppa in a separate event.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect because Caol Uno's fight does not appear in the \"dream 11\" event.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"pride bushido 10 never have ko (knee) method\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that in Pride Bushido 10, there were no knockouts via a knee method. So, I need to check if any fights in this event ended with a KO due to a knee strike.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: Fighter, Win/Loss/Draw, Record, Method, Duration, Venue. The \"Method\" column indicates how the fight ended, such as KO (knee), KO (strikes), etc.\n\nI'll go through each row related to Pride Bushido 10. The event name isn't explicitly mentioned in the table headers or data, but based on my knowledge, Pride Bushido events are numbered, so I can look for rows where the venue might be \"Pride Arena\" or something similar, but the table's Venue column doesn't specify that.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, most of the venues are places like Tokyo, Chiba, Yokohama, etc. Since Pride Bushido 10 was held in Japan, I should focus on rows where the venue is a known Pride location or if the fighter's name suggests it's related to Pride 10.\n\nAlternatively, since the table doesn't explicitly list the event for each row, I might need to assume that any row without an explicit method of KO (knee) would support the claim. However, the user provided the table data, and I need to check if in any of those rows, a fighter was KOed via knee.\n\nLooking through the \"Method\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Submission\n- Row 1: KO (strikes)\n- Row 2: Decision\n- ...and so on.\n\nWait, looking back, in row 5 (index 5), the method is KO (punches). Not a knee. Let me check other rows. Wait, actually, I'm miscounting.

In the table, the method for a knockout would be specified as \"KO\" and possibly the technique in parentheses.\n\nLooking at each win:\n\nRow 1: Vitor Ribeiro vs. Ryuki Fukawa \u2013 method is KO (strikes). Not a knee.\nRow 5: Rumina Sato vs. Kengo Masaoka \u2013 KO (punches).\nRow 6: Takumi Nakayama vs. Tetsuya Okuno \u2013 Decision\nRow 7: Sami Hyyppa vs. Jussi Latvala \u2013 Submission\nRow 12: Rafles La Rose vs. Jimmy Koski \u2013 Draw\nRow 13: Olof Inger vs. ?? \u2013 Decision\nRow 14: Jani Lax vs. ??? \u2013 Submission\nRow 15: Marcus Peltonen vs. ??? \u2013 KO (tko), which is a knockout, but the method isn't specified as a knee.\n\nWait, in row 15, the method is \"tko\", which stands for Technical Knockout. But it's not specified whether it was via a knee or another method. So, if a fight ended with a tko, does that count towards the claim? The claim specifically mentions KO (knee), so a technical knockout doesn't fall under that unless it's explicitly via a knee.\n\nTherefore, in none of the rows is there an explicit mention of KO (knee). All knockouts are either via strikes or punches, not knees. Therefore, Pride Bushido 10 didn't have any KO via knee methods.\n\nThus, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Pride Bushido 10 never have ko (knee) method,\" we examine each row in the provided table for any instance where a fighter was knocked out using a knee. The analysis reveals no such cases; all knockouts are via strikes or punches. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"Method\": \"Submission\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"Method\": \"KO (strikes)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
