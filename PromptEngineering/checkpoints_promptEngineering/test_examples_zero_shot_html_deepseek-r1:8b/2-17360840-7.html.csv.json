    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows and columns in the table are relevant. The table has several columns: game, date, opponent, score, location, attendance, record, points. The key here is to find the row where the opponent is the Buffalo Sabres because that's specifically mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking through each row, I see that row 47 has the opponent as \"buffalo sabres.\" So, the relevant row is row_index 47. Now, within this row, the attendance is listed as a number under the \"attendance\" column. Checking that value, it says 15611. \n\nWait, the claim mentions an attendance of 10750, but in the table, for Buffalo Sabres, the attendance is 15611. That's different from 10750. So, does this mean the claim is false? Because the actual attendance is higher than what's claimed.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm looking at the right row and column. Row 47 has opponent as Buffalo Sabres, date January 21, score 5-3, location st pete times forum, attendance 15611, etc. So yes, the attendance is indeed 15611 for that game.\n\nTherefore, since the claim states 10750 but the actual figure is 15611, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
