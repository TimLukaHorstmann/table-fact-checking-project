    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"north melbourne's away team score be 13.11 (89)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what parts of the claim relate to the table data. The key elements are \"north melbourne\", which refers to the away team, and their score, which should be 13.11 (89).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details about both teams, including the home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where \"north melbourne\" is listed as an away team. \n\nStarting from the first row: the away team is Hawthorn, so that's not it.\nSecond row: the away team is Geelong, nope.\nThird row: the away team is South Melbourne, still not matching.\nFourth row: here, the away team is North Melbourne. This seems promising.\n\nIn this fourth row, let's check the scores. The home team is St Kilda with a score of 10.12 (72). The away team is North Melbourne with a score of 13.11 (89). That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other instances where \"north melbourne\" appears as an away team, but looking at the table, it only appears once in row 4.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in row 4: the home team column, which is St Kilda (not needed for the claim), the away team column for North Melbourne, and their score column. Wait, actually, the claim is about the away team's score, so I need to include both the away team and their score.\n\nWait, no, the relevant cells are the columns that contain the data we're checking. The claim refers to the away team's score, which is in two columns: \"away team\" (the team name) and \"away team score\" (the numerical score). So, I should include both of these columns for row 4.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 4 (since it's the fourth row, but starting from 0, it's row 3)\n- Columns: away team and away team score.\n\nI think that's correct. The claim is fully supported by the data in those cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the score for the away team of north melbourne be 7.14 (56)\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions the away team named \"north melbourne\" and their score, which is given as 7.14 (56). So I need to find in the table if there's a row where the home team is north melbourne and check their away team's score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The rows are indexed from 0 to 5 based on the given data.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Home team is footscray, away team is hawthorn. Not north melbourne.\nRow 1: Home team is fitzroy, away team is geelong. Still not.\nRow 2: Home team essendon vs south melbourne. No match with north melbourne here.\nRow 3: Home team st kilda, away team north melbourne. Ah, this row seems relevant because the home team is st kilda, but wait, the claim is about north melbourne as the away team. So in row 3, the away team is north melbourne. That's what we're looking for.\n\nNow, check the away score for that row. The column \"away team score\" is present. In this case, the away team is north melbourne with a score of 13.11 (89). But wait, the claim says their score should be 7.14 (56), which doesn't match. So that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check again. In row 3, the home team is st kilda, and the away team is north melbourne with a score of 13.11 (89). But the claim is about an away team named north melbourne having a score of 7.14 (56). So in this row, the score doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all rows again to make sure I didn't miss any occurrence of \"north melbourne\" as the away team.\n\nRow 4: Home team is richmond, away team collingwood.\nRow 5: Home team carlton, away team melbourne.\n\nSo in row 3, north melbourne is indeed the away team. Their score is 13.11 (89), which doesn't match the claim of 7.14 (56). Therefore, the claim is false because the score for the away team of north melbourne on that day was different.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me look at the table again. The \"away team\" column lists who the away team is, and the next column is their score. So in row 3, away team is north melbourne with a score of 13.11 (89). Therefore, the claim that their score was 7.14 (56) is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because the score doesn't match. The relevant cells are the row where north melbourne is the away team, which is row_index 3 and column \"away team score\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if the away team of \"north melbourne\" scored 7.14 (56). In the table, \"north melbourne\" is the away team in row 3 with a score of 13.11 (89), not 7.14 (56).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
