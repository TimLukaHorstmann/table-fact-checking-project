    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporated in malaysia , except for taj madras air catering limit , which be incorporate in india.\"\n\nFirst, I'll examine the table provided. It lists several companies along with their types (subsidiary, joint venture, etc.), principal activities, incorporation country, and equity shareholding.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two categories: subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines. So, I should focus on the 'type' column for these entries to see if they're either subsidiary or associate.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - type is subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia.\n2. ge engine services malaysia - joint venture, not relevant here.\n3. maswings sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n4. firefly sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n5. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n6. mas golden holidays sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n7. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n8. mas academy sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n9. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n10. taj madras air catering limited - associate, India.\n11. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - subsidiary, Malaysia.\n12. lsg sky chefs - associate, Malaysia.\n\nNow, the claim says that all subsidiaries and associates should be incorporated in Malaysia except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is in India. \n\nI'll check each relevant row:\n\n- For subsidiaries: All listed companies with type 'subsidiary' are indeed incorporated in Malaysia except none\u2014wait, no, all of them are in Malaysia. The claim suggests that they should be except for one, but here, it seems all are in Malaysia as per the table.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify: The claim says \"all of the subsidiary and associate... except for Taj Madras...\" So for subsidiaries, all should be in Malaysia, and only Taj is an exception as an associate from India.\n\nLooking at the 'associate' type:\n\n- Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an associate incorporated in India.\n- LSG Sky Chefs is an associate but incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nSo, among associates, only Taj is in India, which aligns with the claim. But for subsidiaries, all are in Malaysia. The claim says \"except for Taj...\", implying that perhaps other subsidiaries might not be in Malaysia, but according to the table, they are.\n\nWait, wait a second\u2014the claim could be interpreted as: All subsidiary and associate companies of Malaysia Airlines should be incorporated in Malaysia except Taj Madras, which is in India. So the claim is making two points:\n\n1. All subsidiaries are in Malaysia.\n2. Among associates, only Taj is in India; others (like LSG Sky Chefs) might still be in Malaysia.\n\nBut looking at the table, all the 'subsidiary' entries are indeed in Malaysia. However, there's also a mention of 'associate', which includes both Taj and LSG. The claim says except for Taj, which is an associate, others (like LSG) should be in Malaysia. But according to the table, LSG Sky Chefs is an associate incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nSo, the claim seems to suggest that all subsidiaries are in Malaysia, but among associates, only Taj is not; the rest of the associates (if any beyond Taj and LSG) would need to be in Malaysia as well.\n\nWait, but in the table, there's only Taj Madras Air Catering Limited as an associate from India. All others under 'associate' are either in Malaysia or, perhaps, maybe none else? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the 'type' column again:\n\n- The 10th row is Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: type associate, incorporated in India.\n- The 12th row is LSG Sky Chefs: type associate, incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nSo, among associates, only Taj is not in Malaysia. Therefore, the claim seems to be correct because it says except for Taj, all others (subsidiaries and associates) are in Malaysia.\n\nBut wait\u2014does the claim mention that? Let me re-read it:\n\n\"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporated in malaysia , except for taj madras air catering limit , which be incorporate in india\"\n\nYes, so it's saying that all subsidiaries are in Malaysia, and among the associates, only Taj is not; others (like LSG) are. But in the table, LSG Sky Chefs is also an associate but in Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds because all subsidiaries are in Malaysia, and among associates, only Taj is in India. So it's TRUE.\n\nBut wait another thing: The 'group's equity shareholding' column might be relevant if there are differing percentages, but here, that doesn't affect incorporation country.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is accurate because:\n\n- All subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines (maswings, firefly, etc.) are incorporated in Malaysia.\n- Among the associates, only Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is not in Malaysia; LSG Sky Chefs is still in Malaysia.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the provided table. All subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines are indeed incorporated in Malaysia, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is incorporated in India.\n\nAnswer: **TRUE**",

    "claim": "malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiary",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Malaysia Airlines have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiaries.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and see which ones are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines. Looking at the 'type' column, I can identify the subsidiaries. For example, the first row is a subsidiary, and so are rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. Wait, actually, let me count them.\n\nThe table has 13 rows in total. The claim specifies 9 different subsidiaries, but according to the type column, some might be joint ventures or associates, so not all are subsidiaries. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia - joint venture\n3. MASwings Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited - associate\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n12. LSG Sky Chefs - associate\n\nSo, excluding the joint ventures and associates, the subsidiaries are rows 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. That's a total of 9 subsidiaries.\n\nNow, looking at the 'group's equity shareholding' column: \n\n- For the first subsidiary (row 0), it's 100%.\n- Row 2 is not a subsidiary, so ignore.\n- Rows 3 and onwards that are subsidiaries show 100% equity except for row 10, which is an associate with 20%, and row 12, another associate with 30%.\n\nSo, among the 9 subsidiaries, rows 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11 all have 100% equity. That matches the claim.\n\nWait, but wait: the claim says \"Malaysia Airlines\" have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiaries. But according to my count, there are 9 subsidiaries where Malaysia Airlines has 100% equity. So does that mean the claim is false because it's actually 9 out of 9, not 7? Or did I miscount?\n\nWait no, looking back: rows 0-12. The 9 subsidiaries with 100% equity are:\n\n1. row 0: yes\n2. row3: yes\n3. row4: yes\n4. row5: yes\n5. row6: yes\n6. row7: yes\n7. row8: yes\n8. row9: yes\n9. row11: yes\n\nThat's 9, but the claim says 7 out of 9 subsidiaries have 100%. So that would mean it's false because the number is higher than stated.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding which companies are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines. Because some of these subsidiaries might actually be subsidiaries of other holding companies related to Malaysia Airlines but not directly under Malaysia Airlines.\n\nFor example, MASwings (row3) is a subsidiary, and Firefly (row4) as well. So if the table lists all these as subsidiaries under Malaysia Airlines, then yes, there are 9, but the claim says 7. Therefore, the claim is false because it's actually more than 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRows where type is 'subsidiary' and equity is 100%:\n\nrow0: yes\nrow3: yes\nrow4: yes\nrow5: yes\nrow6: yes\nrow7: yes\nrow8: yes\nrow9: yes\nrow11: yes\n\nThat's 9 rows. So the claim says 7 out of 9, which is incorrect because it's actually 9. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where \"type\" is \"subsidiary\" and \"group 's equity shareholding\" is \"100%\". There are 9 such rows, so the claim that Malaysia Airlines have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 subsidiaries is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that Malaysia Airlines works with two different companies for catering: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The relevant columns are \"company,\" \"type,\" \"principal activities,\" \"incorporated in,\" and \"group's equity shareholding.\" But the key part for the claim is the \"catering\" activity, so I'm focusing on that column.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - Cargo\n2. ge engine services malaysia - Engine overhaul\n3. maswings sdn bhd - Airline\n4. firefly sdn bhd - Airline\n5. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - MRO\n6. mas golden holidays sdn bhd - Tour operator\n7. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - Engineering\n8. mas academy sdn bhd - Flight school\n9. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - Computer reservation system\n10. taj madras air catering limited - Catering\n11. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - Catering\n12. lsg sky chefs - Holding company\n\nSo, the two companies mentioned in the claim are Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd. Both of these are listed in the table as separate rows. Taj Madras is an associate, and MAS Cater is a subsidiary.\n\nNow, I need to check if Malaysia Airlines works with both. The table doesn't explicitly state which companies they work with beyond their own subsidiaries, joint ventures, etc. But from the table, it's clear that these two catering companies are separate entities under Malaysia Airlines' group.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data because both companies provide catering services as per their principal activities.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I analyzed the relevant cells in the table where the company type and principal activities are listed. Both Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd are recorded as providing catering services, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim states: \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the HTML table provided. It has several columns: company, type, principal activities, incorporated in, and group's equity shareholding.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines. So, I should identify which companies in the table are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines. Looking through each row:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia - joint venture (not a subsidiary)\n3. MASwings Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Ltd - associate (not a subsidiary)\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd - subsidiary\n12. LSG Sky Chefs - associate (not a subsidiary)\n\nSo, the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines are rows 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11.\n\nNext, I need to check their equity shareholdings in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd. Looking for that company in the table:\n\nRow 11: MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary with an equity shareholding of 60%.\n\nThe claim says Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in this company. So, I need to see what the other subsidiaries' shareholdings are.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Row 1: 100%\n- Row3:100%\n- Row4:100%\n- Row5:100%\n- Row6:100%\n- Row7:100%\n- Row8:100%\n- Row9:80%\n- Row11:60%\n\nThe lowest is 60%, held by MAS Catering. The claim says \"Malaysia Airlines\" (which might be referring to the parent company) have the lowest shareholding in this specific subsidiary.\n\nWait, but in the table, MAS Catering's equity is 60%, which is indeed lower than others like 80% and 100%. So among all subsidiaries listed, MAS Catering has the lowest at 60%.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"Of all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\" Since MAS Catering is a subsidiary, and it's the one with the lowest equity, the statement seems true. However, I need to ensure that it's the parent company, Malaysia Airlines, that holds this. Wait, actually, in the table, the companies are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines or others.\n\nWait, looking back at the columns: \"group 's equity shareholding\" likely refers to the group holding the equity in the listed company. For example, if a company is a subsidiary, the group's equity would be 100%. For joint ventures or associates, it's less.\n\nIn the case of MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd, which is a subsidiary, the equity shareholding is 60%, so the parent company, Malaysia Airlines, holds 60% in this subsidiary. Now, I need to check if among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, does Malaysia Airlines hold the lowest equity in MAS Catering.\n\nLooking at other subsidiaries:\n\n- Malaysia Airlines Cargo: 100%\n- MASwings:100%\n- Firefly:100%\n- MAS Aerotechnologies:100%\n- MAS Golden Holidays:100%\n- Malaysian Aerospace Engineering:100%\n- MAS Academy:100%\n- Abacus Distribution Systems:80%\n- MAS Catering:60%\n\nSo the lowest is 60%, so the claim is that \"Malaysia Airlines have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering.\" Since they hold 60%, which is lower than others, it's true.\n\nHowever, wait: the term \"group 's equity shareholding\" might refer to within their group. So if MAS Catering is part of Malaysia Airlines' group, then yes, Malaysia Airlines has a 60% stake. The claim says \"of all the subsidiaries... have the lowest equity shareholding in MAS Catering.\" But does it mean that among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, which ones have shares in MAS Catering? Or does it refer to the equity within their own group?\n\nI think the claim is implying that among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, they (Malaysia Airlines) hold the least equity in MAS Catering. Since the others are 100% or 80%, and MAS Catering is 60%, yes, it's correct.\n\nSo the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true based on the analysis of the table provided. Among all the subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, the parent company holds the lowest equity shareholding of 60% in MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\n\n**Answer:** True.",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Malaysia Airlines' equity shareholdings is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in both lsg sky chef and ge engine service malaysia , which both be not subsidiary.\" So, the claim is making two points. One, Malaysia Airlines holds a 30% equity stake in LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Service Malaysia. Two, these entities are not subsidiaries.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify the relevant rows and columns that could verify this claim. The table has several companies listed with their type, principal activities, incorporation country, and equity shareholding percentage relative to Malaysia Airlines (I assume).\n\nStarting with LSG Sky Chef. Scanning through the table, I see a row for \"lsg sky chefs\" which is an associate, involved in catering as their principal activity, incorporated in Malaysia, with 30% equity. So that matches the first part of the claim\u2014Malaysia Airlines has a 30% shareholding here.\n\nNext, GE Engine Service Malaysia. In the table, there's a row for \"ge engine services malaysia\" which is listed as a joint venture, primarily handling engine overhaul, also in Malaysia, with a 30% equity share. So that also aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the second part: whether these entities are not subsidiaries. Looking at their types from the table\u2014LSG Sky Chef is an associate, and GE Engine Service Malaysia is a joint venture. Associates and joint ventures are different from subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are companies where ownership is direct, whereas associates and joint ventures often imply partnerships without direct ownership.\n\nIn the table, the relevant columns for type are \"type\" and \"group 's equity shareholding.\" For LSG Sky Chef, it's an associate, which isn't a subsidiary. Similarly, GE Engine Service Malaysia is a joint venture, not a subsidiary. Therefore, both entities are not subsidiaries as per the claim.\n\nPutting this together, the claim's first part is true because Malaysia Airlines does hold 30% equity in both companies. The second part is also true since neither is a subsidiary but rather associates or joint ventures.\n\nI need to map out which rows and columns are relevant for verification. For LSG Sky Chef, it's row index 8 (assuming rows start at 0) with \"catering\" as the principal activity. For GE Engine Service Malaysia, it's row index 1, under \"engine overhaul.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 8, column \"type\"\n- Row 1, column \"type\"\n\nThese specific cells verify both parts of the claim accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporated in india except taj madras air catering limit , which be not from india.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's stating that all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines are incorporated in India, but there's an exception with Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which isn't from India.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to focus on the relevant columns: 'company', 'type' (which can be subsidiary or associate), and 'incorporated in'. The claim specifically mentions subsidiaries and associates, so I should look for rows where 'type' is either 'subsidiary' or 'associate'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd: type is subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia.\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia: joint venture, not relevant since type isn't subsidiary/associate.\n3. Maswings Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia.\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, Malaysia.\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, Malaysia.\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, Malaysia.\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, Malaysia.\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, Malaysia.\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, Malaysia.\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: associate, incorporated in India.\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: subsidiary, Malaysia.\n12. LSG Sky Chefs: associate, incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim. It says all subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in India except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is not from India.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- All subsidiaries (rows 1 to 9, 11) and associates (row 10,12) have their incorporation country as either Malaysia or India.\n- For subsidiaries: all are incorporated in Malaysia, so the claim's assertion that they're in India is incorrect. However, the claim might be referring only to associates being in India except Taj Madras.\n\nWait, but the claim includes both subsidiaries and associates. Subsidiaries are mainly in Malaysia, not India. So the initial part of the claim is false because it says all subsidiaries are incorporated in India, which isn't true.\n\nBut let's focus on the specific parts: the claim mentions that \"all of the subsidiary and associate... except Taj Madras...\". The user instruction is to check if the claim is fully supported.\n\nSo for subsidiaries, they are not all incorporated in India; most are in Malaysia. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it falsely states that all subsidiaries are incorporated in India when in fact they're mostly in Malaysia.\n\nHowever, the second part of the claim mentions Taj Madras as an exception not being from India, which is correct since it's incorporated in India. Wait, no: Taj Madras is an associate and is incorporated in India (row 10). The claim says \"except Taj Madras... which be not from india.\" But Taj Madras is from India, so the claim is incorrect there as well.\n\nWait, let me recheck row 10: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an associate, incorporated in India. So the claim says it's not from India, but actually it is. Therefore, the claim is false because both parts are wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"all of the subsidiary and associate... except Taj Madras... which be not from india.\" So for subsidiaries: they're all in Malaysia except none? No, all subsidiaries are in Malaysia. For associates: all except Taj Madras are not in India? Wait, no, the claim is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is trying to say that all subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in India, but Taj Madras is an exception because it's not from India. But from the table, most of the associates (Taj Madras and LSG Sky Chefs) are either in Malaysia or India.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect on two fronts: subsidiaries are mainly in Malaysia, and Taj Madras is actually incorporated in India, so it doesn't support the exception part either.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is false because it incorrectly states that all subsidiaries are in India (they're not; they're mostly in Malaysia) and incorrectly claims that Taj Madras isn't from India when it is.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are where 'type' is either 'subsidiary' or 'associate', as these are the categories mentioned in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"malaysia airline have 100% equity in each of their subsidies, like taj madras air catering limit.\" So I need to check if Malaysia Airlines have 100% ownership in all their subsidiaries listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are several companies listed under the 'company' column. The relevant columns here are \"type\" and \"group's equity shareholding.\"\n\nStarting with the first row, it's about Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd. It's a subsidiary and has 100% equity. That fits the claim.\n\nNext is GE Engine Services Malaysia, which is a joint venture with 30% equity. This doesn't meet 100%, so it's not relevant to the claim.\n\nMASwings Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary with 100% equity. Fits the claim.\n\nFirefly Sdn Bhd is also a subsidiary with 100% equity. Also fits.\n\nMAS Aerotechnologies has 100% equity, same as others.\n\nMAS Golden Holidays and MAS Academy both have 100% equity.\n\nABacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary but only has 80% equity, so it doesn't fit the claim.\n\nNow, Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an associate with 20% equity. This doesn't meet 100%, so it's not relevant to the claim as per the example given.\n\nMAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd has 60% equity, again not 100%.\n\nLSG Sky Chefs is an associate with 30% equity. Also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says \"like Taj Madras Air Catering Limit.\" The claim example included this company, so I need to check if Malaysia Airlines have 100% equity there as well. From the table, Taj Madras has only 20%, so that part of the claim is incorrect because they don't own 100%.\n\nSo, for the claim to be true, all examples must have 100% equity. Since Taj Madras doesn't, the overall claim is false.\n\nNow, the relevant cells: I need to find rows where \"group's equity shareholding\" is 100%. Let's list them:\n\n- Row 0: 100%\n- Row 2: 100%\n- Row 3: 100%\n- Row 4: 100%\n- Row 5: 100%\n- Row 6: 100%\n- Row 7: 100%\n\nWait, row indices start at 0. Let me count correctly.\n\nLooking again:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd - row index 0\n2. MASwings - row index 2\n3. Firefly - row index 3\n4. MAS Aerotechnologies - row index 4\n5. MAS Golden Holidays - row index 5\n6. MAS Academy - row index 6\n7. ABacus is row index 8 with 80%\n8. Taj Madras is row index 9 with 20%\n9. MAS Catering (Sarawak) is row index 10 with 60%\n10. LSG Sky Chefs is row index 11 with 30%\n\nSo the relevant rows are indices 0,2,3,4,5,6, and also any others that have 100%. Wait, ABacus has 80% but it's a subsidiary; the claim is about equity in their subsidiaries. So only those with 100% should be considered.\n\nTherefore, the cells to include are rows where \"group's equity shareholding\" is 100%.\n\nSo the answer should mark them all except Taj Madras and others that don't meet the condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"malaysia airline have equal equity in each subsidy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's saying that Malaysia Airlines have equal equity in each of their subsidiaries. So, I need to check if each subsidiary listed under Malaysia Airlines has the same percentage equity held by Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLooking at the table, I see companies like \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd,\" \"maswings sdn bhd,\" \"firefly sdn bhd,\" etc., all marked as subsidiaries. The key column here is \"group 's equity shareholding,\" which indicates the percentage of equity that Malaysia Airlines (or its group) holds in each subsidiary.\n\nI'll go through each row where the type is \"subsidiary\" and check their equity percentages. \n\n1. **malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd**: 100%\n2. **maswings sdn bhd**: 100%\n3. **firefly sdn bhd**: 100%\n4. **mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd**: 100%\n5. **mas golden holidays sdn bhd**: 100%\n6. **malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd**: 100%\n7. **mas academy sdn bhd**: 100%\n8. **abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd**: 80%\n\nWait, the last one is different\u2014it's only 80%. That breaks the pattern of equal equity percentages.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are other subsidiaries not under Malaysia Airlines. For example, \"ge engine services malaysia\" is a joint venture with 30% equity, and \"taj madras air catering limited\" is an associate with 20%, but these aren't subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, so they don't affect the claim.\n\nSo, since one subsidiary has 80% instead of 100%, the claim that all subsidiaries have equal equity isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are those where type is \"subsidiary\" with varying equity percentages.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Malaysia Airlines work with all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to suggest that Malaysia Airlines uses all their subsidiaries for catering services but not Taj Madras. So, I need to check if in the table, any of the subsidiaries are used for catering and whether Taj Madras is excluded.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are 'company', 'type', 'principal activities', and 'incorporated in'. The claim specifically mentions 'catering' as a principal activity, so I should focus on rows where 'catering' is listed under 'principal activities'.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd: Type is subsidiary, but their activity is cargo, not catering. So irrelevant for this claim.\n\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia: Joint venture, engine overhaul. Not relevant.\n\n3. Maswings Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, airline. Not catering.\n\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, airline. Not catering.\n\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, MRO. No.\n\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, tour operator. No.\n\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, engineering. No.\n\n8. MAS Academy Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, flight school. No.\n\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, computer reservation system. No.\n\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: Associate, catering. This is the one mentioned in the claim.\n\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd: Subsidiary, catering. So this is a subsidiary used for catering.\n\n12. LSG Sky Chefs: Associate, holding company. Not directly catering as a principal activity.\n\nWait, so the table shows that there's at least one subsidiary (MAS Catering Sarawak) used for catering. That means Malaysia Airlines does work with a subsidiary for catering, which contradicts the claim that they don't work with Taj Madras but do others. The claim says \"except Taj Madras,\" implying all others are used. But in reality, there's another subsidiary (MAS Catering Sarawak) that is used, and Taj Madras is listed as an associate, so maybe it's not a subsidiary. \n\nWait, the claim is about subsidiaries. So looking back, only the subsidiaries are relevant for this check. The 'type' column indicates whether each company is a subsidiary, joint venture, etc.\n\nTaj Madras Air Catering Limited is labeled as an 'associate', not a subsidiary. So in the context of the claim, which refers to subsidiaries, Taj Madras isn't one. Therefore, if the claim says Malaysia Airlines doesn't work with their subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras, but actually, they do work with at least one subsidiary (MAS Catering Sarawak) and perhaps others as well.\n\nSo the claim is saying that all subsidiaries are used except Taj Madras. But in reality, there's at least one subsidiary used, so the claim is incorrect because it implies no subsidiaries are used for catering except Taj Madras, but there is another subsidiary (MAS Catering Sarawak) that is used.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table:\n\n- MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary and is involved in catering. So the claim is wrong because it says they don't use subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras, but they do use this subsidiary.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines uses all their subsidiaries for catering services except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited. However, upon examining the table, MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd is listed as a subsidiary involved in catering, which contradicts the claim's assertion. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's saying that Malaysia Airlines don't hold a 30% equity share in any associate listed in the table. So my task is to check each row and see if there's an associate where Malaysia Airlines has a 30% stake.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various companies under the \"company\" column, along with details like type, principal activities, incorporated country, and equity shareholding. The relevant columns here are 'company' and 'equity shareholding'. \n\nWait, actually, since the claim is about Malaysia Airlines having a 30% stake in an associate, I need to find rows where the company is an \"associate\" (from the 'type' column) and see if their equity shareholding is 30%. If there's such a row, then the claim would be false because it implies they have a 30% share somewhere.\n\nSo I'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd, which is a subsidiary. No mention of associates here.\n2. GE Engine Services Malaysia is a joint venture. Not an associate.\n3. MASwings is a subsidiary. Again, not an associate.\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd is also a subsidiary. So no associates yet.\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies is a subsidiary. Still not relevant for the claim.\n6. MAS Golden Holidays is a subsidiary. Not an associate.\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering is a subsidiary. No.\n8. MAS Academy is a subsidiary. Nope.\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems is a subsidiary with 80% shareholding. Not 30%, and it's a subsidiary, not an associate.\n10. Taj Madras Air Catering is listed as an associate. Oh, this is interesting. Their equity shareholding is 20%. So if Malaysia Airlines have a 30% stake in any associate, but here it's 20%, that doesn't match. But wait, the claim says \"none of the associate,\" so if there is at least one associate where they have some percentage, then the claim is false.\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) is a subsidiary with 60% equity. Not an associate.\n12. LSG Sky Chefs are associates with a 30% shareholding.\n\nWait, hold on. In row 12, LSG Sky Chefs are labeled as \"associate\" and their equity shareholding is 30%. That's exactly what the claim says: Malaysia Airlines have a 30% equity in an associate. So this would make the claim false because it does exist.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate.\" If they have at least one associate with 30%, then it's not true that none have it. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'company' name is LSG Sky Chefs, which is an associate (type: associate) and has a 30% equity shareholding. So the row index for this entry is 12 (since it's zero-indexed). Therefore, the relevant cells are at row 12, columns \"type\" and \"group 's equity shareholding\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
