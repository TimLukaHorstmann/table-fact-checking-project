Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It states that there are zero poles in the Moto2 class. So I need to find any information about the \"pole\" column for the Moto2 class in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents different classes and their corresponding data. The columns relevant here are 'class', 'season', 'race', 'podiums', and 'pole'. Since the claim is specifically about the \"pole\", I should focus on the 'pole' column.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for any entry under 'pole' in the Moto2 class. \n\n1. The first row is for the 125 cc class, so not relevant here.\n2. The second row is for the 250 cc class, with a season range from 2002-2008. No pole data is mentioned.\n3. The third row is about MotogP in 2009, which isn't Moto2 either.\n4. The fourth row is for Moto2 starting from 2010 onwards. Here, under the 'pole' column, it says \"0\". That's exactly what we're looking for.\n5. The fifth row is the total summary, so not directly about a specific class.\n\nSo, according to this, in the Moto2 class, there are indeed zero poles recorded in the data provided. Therefore, the claim appears to be TRUE based on the information from the 'pole' column of the Moto2 class.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class,\" we look at the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- The row for **moto2** (row index 3) has a 'pole' value of **0**.\n\nThis specific cell directly supports the claim, confirming zero poles in the Moto2 class.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully analyze each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the table data.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that 4 (which likely refers to the number of instances) have a \"moto2 class.\" So I'm looking for cells in the table where the value is 4 and the corresponding class is \"moto2.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different classes: 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, and total. The columns are class, season, race, podiums, and pole.\n\nI'll go through each relevant column to see if there's any data that supports the claim.\n\n1. **Podiums Column (podiums):** This seems related because \"pole\" is a term sometimes used in racing, but here it's listed under a separate column as \"pole.\" So podiums might not directly relate unless I'm misunderstanding. However, since the claim mentions 4 poles, I should focus on the \"pole\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"pole\" column has values: 0 for all rows except maybe none have any poles. For example:\n- 125 cc: 0\n- 250 cc: 0\n- motogp: 0\n- moto2: 0\n- total: 0\n\nSo there are no instances where the pole count is 4.\n\nNext, let's check if any class has a value of 4 in the race or podiums columns that could be misinterpreted as referring to \"moto2.\"\n\nLooking at the \"race\" column:\n- 125 cc: 1\n- 250 cc: 65\n- motogp: 7\n- moto2: 62\n- total: 135\n\nNone of these are 4. Similarly, the \"podiums\" column has values like 0, 7, etc., but no 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread something. The claim says \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" Maybe it's referring to four poles in moto2? Let me check the moto2 row again.\n\nIn the moto2 row:\n- Season: 2010 -\n- Race: 62\n- Podiums: 4\n- Pole: 0\n\nSo here, podiums are 4. But the claim is about \"pole\" (with lowercase 'p') or \"Pole.\" The term \"pole\" in racing typically refers to the starting position, where the highest qualifying rider gets the first start. So if it's about poles, then looking at the \"pole\" column.\n\nBut in the table, all entries under \"pole\" are 0 except for none. So there are no 4 poles. Therefore, the claim that 4 poles have a moto2 class is incorrect because the pole count for moto2 is 0.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about podiums, then the claim might be misinterpreted. But since the term used in the claim is \"pole,\" not \"podiums,\" I need to check accordingly.\n\nTherefore, there are no instances where 4 poles correspond to a moto2 class because all pole counts across classes, including moto2, are 0.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that none of the classes have a pole count of 4. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
