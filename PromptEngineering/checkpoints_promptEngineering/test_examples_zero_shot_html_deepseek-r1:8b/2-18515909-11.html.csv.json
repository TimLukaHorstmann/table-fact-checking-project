    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"player geremi have win only 1 fifa club world championship\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate where Geremi is in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see that Geremi is listed at row index 8. So his data is in row 8.\n\nNext, I need to check which columns are relevant to the claim. The claim mentions \"fifa club world championship,\" so the relevant column here would be \"fifa club world championship.\" Looking at the table headers, that's the fifth column, right after uefa champions league and before total.\n\nNow, looking at Geremi's data in row 8, under the \"fifa club world championship\" column, I see he has a value of 1. That means he won once in this category.\n\nThe claim says he only won one, so that seems to match up. But wait, maybe the term \"win\" is ambiguous. Does it refer strictly to winning, or does it include participation? In football statistics, sometimes \"wins\" are counted as the team's victories, not individual player wins. However, in this table, each column likely represents the number of times the player won that specific trophy.\n\nSo, Geremi has 1 win in the fifa club world championship. The claim says he only has one, which is correct. There's no indication elsewhere that he won more than once in that category from the table data provided.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant columns for this claim. Since the claim specifically mentions \"fifa club world championship,\" I don't need to consider other columns like la liga or copa del rey unless they somehow relate, which they don't here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Geremi's data in row 8, column \"fifa club world championship\" is 1. The claim states he only has one win there, so the statement is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"fifa club world championship\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
