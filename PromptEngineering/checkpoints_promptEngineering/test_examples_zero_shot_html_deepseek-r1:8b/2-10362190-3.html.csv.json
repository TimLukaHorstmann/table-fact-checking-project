    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nThe claim says: \"On November 12, 1995, there was an attendance of 51,342.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and find the relevant information. The table has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nI should check if there's a game played on November 12, 1995. So I'll go through each row to see which week corresponds to that date.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Week 1: September 3, 1995\n- Week 2: September 10, 1995\n- Week 3: September 17, 1995\n- Week 4: September 24, 1995\n- Week 6: October 8, 1995\n- Week 7: October 15, 1995\n- Week 8: October 22, 1995\n- Week 9: October 30, 1995\n- Week 10: November 5, 1995\n- Week 11: November 12, 1995\n- Week 12: November 19, 1995\n- Week 13: November 23, 1995\n- Week 14: December 3, 1995\n- Week 15: December 9, 1995\n- Week 16: December 18, 1995\n- Week 17: December 24, 1995\n\nI see that week 11 is on November 12, 1995. So the relevant row is row index 10 (since it's zero-indexed).\n\nNext, I need to check the 'attendance' column for that row. The attendance for week 11 is 51,342.\n\nSo the attendance figure matches exactly what the claim states.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"during week 7, the attendance was 55703.\" \n\nFirst, I should find where in the table the information for week 7 and attendance is located. Let me look at each row to see which one corresponds to week 7.\n\nLooking at the 'week' column:\nRow 1: week 1\nRow 2: week 2\nRow 3: week 3\n...\nContinuing this way, I reach row 7, which has \"week\" as 7. So that's the relevant row for week 7.\n\nNext, I need to check the attendance column for that row. In row 7, under the 'attendance' column, it says \"55703.\" That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, both the week number and the attendance figure are correctly matched in the table. There's no discrepancy here, so the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"During week 16, the team lost to the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 37 - 30.\"\n\nSo, I need to check each part of this claim against the table provided.\n\n1. **Week Number**: The claim mentions week 16. I'll look for a row where week is 16. Scanning through the table, there's a row where week is 17, which is \"december 24 , 1995\" against Cincinnati Bengals, but no week 16. Wait, looking again, yes, week 16 is December 18, 1995, opposing San Francisco 49ers. So that's correct.\n\n2. **Opponent**: The claim states the opponent is San Francisco 49ers. In week 16, the opponent is listed as \"san francisco 49ers\". That matches exactly.\n\n3. **Result**: The claim says the team lost with a score of 37-30. Looking at week 16's result, it's \"l 37 - 30\". So that's a loss (l) and the score is 37-30. That matches as well.\n\nNow, checking if all these are true. Week is 16, opponent is San Francisco 49ers, and result is a loss with that score. All three points are correct based on the table.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE. Now, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The week number in row 16: columns are week, date, opponent, result, attendance. So for week 16, row_index is 15 (since rows start at 0). But wait, looking back, the first row is index 0, which is week 1. So week 16 would be row 15.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nRows are from 0 to 19. Week 1 is row 0, week 2 row1,... week16 would be row15? Let me check: week=1 is first row (row_index 0), so week 16 should be row 15.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include:\n\n- Row index 15, column \"week\" because the claim specifies the week number.\n- Also, row index 15, column \"opponent\" since it mentions San Francisco 49ers as opponent.\n- And row index 15, column \"result\" because it refers to the score and outcome.\n\nTherefore, all three cells are relevant to verify the claim. Any of these being incorrect would make the claim false, but since all match, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"before november 12 , 1995 , there be an attendance of 51342\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll break down the claim.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The date must be before November 12, 1995.\n2. There should be a game with an attendance of 51,342.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table to find any that match these criteria. Each row represents a week, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n- Week 1: Sept 3, 1995 \u2013 attendance is 63,036.\n- Week 2: Sept 10 \u2013 52,234.\n- Week 3: Sept 17 \u2013 60,088.\n- Week 4: Sept 24 \u2013 57,853.\n- Week 6: Oct 8 \u2013 56,430. Wait, week 5 is missing. That's odd, but I'll proceed with what's there.\n- Week 7: Oct 15 \u2013 55,703.\n- Week 8: Oct 22 \u2013 60,332.\n- Week 9: Oct 30 \u2013 61,238.\n- Week 10: Nov 5 \u2013 62,839.\n- Week 11: Nov 12 \u2013 51,342.\n\nHold on, week 11's date is November 12, 1995. The claim says \"before November 12,\" so that exact week doesn't qualify because it's on the specified date. So I need to check weeks before week 11.\n\nLooking back at all previous weeks: none of them have an attendance of 51,342. The closest is week 7 with 55,703 and week 9 with 61k, but nothing exactly matches 51,342.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any:\n\nWeeks 1-4: No match.\nWeek 6: 56k\nWeek 7: 55k\nWeek 8: 60k\nWeek 9: 61k\nWeek 10: 62k\n\nNo attendance of exactly 51,342 before November 12. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because there's no matching attendance figure in prior weeks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"before week 16, the score was a loss of 37 - 30.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game with specific details.\n\nThe key part is understanding what \"before week 16\" means. So, it refers to all games that took place before week 16. Therefore, I should check each row where the week number is less than 16.\n\nLooking at the table, weeks go from 1 to 17. Week 16 is one of them, so I need to examine all weeks prior to week 16. That includes week 1 through week 15.\n\nNow, I'll scan each relevant row:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent Chicago Bears, result l 31 -14 (loss). \n- Week 2: Detroit Lions, w 20-10 (win).\n- Week 3: Dallas Cowboys, l 23-17 (OT) (loss).\n- Week 4: Pittsburgh Steelers, w 44-24 (win).\n- Week 6: Houston Oilers, w 23-17 (OT) (win). \n- Week 7: Tampa Bay Buccaneers, l 20-17 (OT) (loss).\n- Week 8: Green Bay Packers, l 38-21 (loss).\n- Week 9: Chicago Bears, l 14-6 (loss).\n- Week 10: Green Bay Packers, w 27-24 (win). \n- Week 11: Arizona Cardinals, w 30-24 (OT) (win).\n- Week 12: New Orleans Saints, w 43-24 (win).\n- Week 13: Detroit Lions, l 44-38 (loss).\n- Week 14: Tampa Bay Buccaneers, w 31-17 (win).\n- Week 15: Cleveland Browns, w 27-11 (win).\n\nNone of these results show a loss with the score 37 -30. The only loss mentioned in week 16 is against the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 37-30.\n\nSo, since no prior weeks before 16 had that exact loss result, the claim is FALSE. \n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. These would be the cells where the result is \"l 37 - 30\". That's only in week 16, so row_index 15 (since rows start at 0), column_name \"result\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because none of the games before week 16 resulted in a loss with the score 37-30. The relevant cell is the result for week 16.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
