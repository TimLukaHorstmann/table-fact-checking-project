    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the north carolina contest have a preliminaries score of a 8.068 with an even gown score of 8.472.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has headers: state, preliminaries, interview, swimsuit, evening gown, and average. Each row represents a different state's contest results.\n\nThe claim mentions \"north carolina,\" so I need to find the row for North Carolina in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see one with \"north carolina\" as the state.\n\nNow, looking at the columns relevant to the claim: preliminaries and evening gown. The claim specifies both a preliminaries score of 8.068 and an evening gown score of 8.472.\n\nChecking the North Carolina row:\n- Preliminaries column has 8.068.\n- Evening gown column has 8.472.\n\nBoth values match exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones for preliminaries and evening gown in North Carolina's row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
