    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013\" is true or false by checking the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"kansas city,\" which refers to the MLB affiliate. Looking at the table, each row has a season and an \"mlb affiliate\" column. I need to find the row for 2013 where the affiliate is kansas city.\n\nNext, the claim talks about the post-season record in 2013. In the table, there's a \"post - season record\" column. For 2013, I should check if this value is present and what it shows.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find 2013:\n\n1. The first row is 2001, not relevant.\n2. 2002 is also not the year in question.\n3. 2003 has a post-season record of 0-2, but that's for a different affiliate and season.\n4. ... (skipping ahead) until I find 2013.\n\nLooking at row 12 (assuming rows start from 0), the season is 2013. The \"mlb affiliate\" is kansas city, which matches. Now, check the \"post - season record\" column. In this row, it's marked as \"-\", indicating no post-season record that year.\n\nSo, if the post-season record is \"-\", does that mean they had none? That would imply they didn't make the playoffs or have a post-season game, hence no record. Therefore, kansas city indeed had no post-season record in 2013.\n\nI need to make sure I'm looking at the correct columns and rows. The \"post - season record\" column is where it's important. Since 2013 has \"-\" there, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013,\" we examine the table for the year 2013 under the \"mlb affiliate\" and \"post - season record\" columns.\n\n- **Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Identify rows where the \"season\" is 2013.\n2. Check if the \"mlb affiliate\" for that row is kansas city.\n3. Look at the \"post - season record\" value for that row.\n4. If the value is \"-\", it indicates no post-season record, supporting the claim.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- The row for 2013 (row index 12) in the \"post - season record\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"houston have no post - season record\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Houston\" having \"no post-season record.\" Looking at the table, I see that it's structured with various columns like season, manager, record, win %, post-season record, post-season win %, and MLB affiliate. The relevant part here is the \"post - season record\" column because that's what the claim refers to.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to check for any entry where the team is Houston and there's a post-season record listed. \n\nLooking at the first row (row 0), the manager is Joe Cannon, and the post-season record is \"4 - 0\" with a win percentage of 1.000. So this row is relevant because it shows that Houston had a post-season record in 2001.\n\nMoving on, rows 2 through 8 also list various seasons for Houston, but many of them have \"-\" in the post-season record column. For example, in 2002, the post-season record is \"-\", which might mean they didn't qualify or there's no data. Similarly, in 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, the post-season records are either \"-\" or missing. However, row 3 (2002) shows a \"-\", which could imply they didn't have a post-season record that year.\n\nWait, but in 2003 and 2006, there are entries like \"0 - 2\" with a post-season win percentage of 000, indicating they lost the wildcard game. So these rows also show that Houston had post-season records in those years.\n\nHowever, regardless of the specifics, the claim is whether Houston \"have no post - season record.\" If even one row shows that Houston has a post-season record, then the claim is false because having any record, even if it's a loss or \"-\", contradicts the idea of having none. \n\nSo, looking at the table, in 2001, 2003, and 2006, Houston does have post-season records listed. Therefore, the claim that they have no post-season record is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"houston have no post - season record,\" we check each row where the MLB affiliate is Houston for entries in the \"post - season record\" column.\n\n- **Row 0 (2001):** Post-season record is \"4 - 0\".\n- **Rows 2, 3, 6, 7:** Show \"-\" indicating no post-season record.\n- **Rows 4,5,8,9,10,11,12:** Similar entries with \"-\".\n- **Row 1 (2003) and Row 5 (2006):** Post-season records are \"0 - 2\".\n\nSince multiple rows show Houston having post-season records, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
