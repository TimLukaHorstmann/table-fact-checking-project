    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the fighter have 5 win with the method knockout (strikes)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It's saying that there are five instances where a fighter won using the knockout (strikes) method. So I need to check if such information exists in the table and if it adds up to exactly five wins.\n\nLooking at the table structure: It has columns for 'result', 'record', 'opponent', 'method', etc. The 'result' column can be either 'win' or 'loss'. The 'method' column specifies how the fight ended, such as knockout (strikes), submission (armbar), etc.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to count the number of wins where the method was knockout (strikes).\n\n1. Row 0: result is win, method is knockout (strikes). So that's one.\n2. Row 1: same as above. That's two.\n3. Row 2: same again. Now three.\n4. Row 3: same. Four wins.\n5. Row 4: same. Five wins.\n\nSo up to row 4, we've got five wins via knockout (strikes).\n\nNext, let's check the remaining rows to see if there are more such instances beyond five.\n\n6. Row 5: result is loss, so doesn't count towards wins.\n7. Row 6: same as above, loss.\n8. Row 7: also a loss.\n\nWait, but row 4 is the fifth win. So only five rows where 'result' is win and 'method' is knockout (strikes). Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by these five instances.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if any other methods are considered as knockout (strikes) or if there's a specific fighter involved. Looking back at the table, all five wins are indeed via knockout (strikes), and no other method is mixed in. Also, each of these five rows has 'result' as win.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the fighter have 5 win with the method knockout (strikes)\" seems to be TRUE based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we count the number of wins where the method was knockout (strikes). There are exactly five such instances, matching the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the fighter have 3 win in 1995 with the location itapeua , brazil.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's about a fighter who had three wins in the year 1995, and these wins occurred at a location called Itapeua, Brazil.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I need to check each row for the year 1995 and see how many wins were recorded there with the opponent at Itapeua, Brazil. \n\nLet me go through the table step by step:\n\n1. The first three rows (row indices 0, 1, 2) all have \"win\" as the result, the record numbers are 1-0-0, 2-0-0, and 3-0-0 respectively. The date for these is 1995, which matches the claim's year. The location is Itapeua, Brazil in each case. So that's three wins already.\n\n2. The fourth row (row index 3) also shows a \"win\" with record 4-0-0, but the date here is 1996, not 1995. So this doesn't count towards the 1995 tally.\n\n3. The fifth row (row index 4) is for 1999, so that's beyond 1995 and can be ignored for this check.\n\nThen there are the loss rows starting from row 5 onwards, but those don't affect the wins in 1995.\n\nSo adding them up: three wins by different fighters in 1995 at Itapeua, Brazil. The claim says \"the fighter\" which is a bit ambiguous, but it could be referring to any fighter who had such victories. So each of these rows shows a fighter with a win in 1995 at the specified location.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true because there are three instances where the result was a win, occurred in 1995, and took place at Itapeua, Brazil.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by three entries in the table: rows 0, 1, and 2.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the fighter have 2 loss , with opponent junior pitbull and zuluzinho , with both method be knockout (strikes)\". So, the fighter has two losses. The opponents for these losses are junior pitbull and zuluzinho. Both methods were knockouts via strikes.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I need to find if there are two rows where the result is a loss, the opponents are junior pitbull and zuluzinho, and the method is knockout (strikes).\n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. The first row shows a win against joa mendes via knockout. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: another win, same as above. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: win again. No loss here.\n4. Fourth row: win. Not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: win against luigi maiolini. Still no loss.\n6. Sixth row: result is loss. Opponent is junior pitbull, method knockout (strikes). That's one loss as per the claim.\n7. Seventh row: another loss. Opponent is zuluzinho, method knockout. That's the second loss as mentioned.\n8. Eighth row: loss against osvaldo castuera via submission, not strikes. So this doesn't fit because the method is different.\n\nSo, there are two losses where the opponent is junior pitbull and zuluzinho, both by knockout (strikes). Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on these rows.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant columns are 'result', 'opponent', and 'method'.\n\nLooking at row 6: result is loss, opponent junior pitbull, method knockout (strikes).\nRow 7: result loss, opponent zuluzinho, method knockout.\n\nSo the relevant rows are indices 6 and 7, and the columns involved are result, opponent, and method for both. But since the claim refers to the fighter's two losses, I should include all three columns from these rows.\n\nWait, actually, in the JSON example, they included multiple cells per row. So for each relevant row, I list all applicable columns.\n\nSo for row 6: result (column 0), opponent (column 2), method (column 3).\nFor row 7: same as above, but result is loss again.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the fighter have 2 loss\", so both are losses. Therefore, in the table, two rows have result 'loss', opponents as specified, and methods knockout.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row index 6, columns: result, opponent, method.\n- Row index 7, same columns.\n\nBut let me check the table indices. The table starts at row 0 for the header, then row 1 is first data row.\n\nWait, in the given HTML, the first data row is <tr> with win against joa mendes, which is row index 1 (since <thead> is before that). So row indices start from 1 to 8.\n\nSo the two loss rows are at row indices 6 and 7.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor row 6:\n- result: 'loss'\n- opponent: 'junior pitbull'\n- method: 'knockout (strikes)'\n\nFor row 7:\n- result: 'loss'\n- opponent: 'zuluzinho'\n- method: 'knockout (strikes)'\n\nThus, each of these cells supports the claim.\n\nSo in the JSON, I need to include for each relevant row their index and the column names that apply. Since each row has multiple columns, but the claim refers to result being loss, opponent being those names, and method being knockout.\n\nWait, but the columns are 'result', 'opponent', 'method'. So for each of these two rows, I need to list all three columns as relevant because they collectively support the claim that there were two losses with those opponents via knockouts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can be more precise. Since the claim is about two specific opponents and method, perhaps only the opponent and result columns are needed, but the method also matters. So including all three columns is correct.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON, each relevant cell will have row_index (6 and 7) and the column names as 'result', 'opponent', 'method'.\n\nI think that's accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two rows in the table where the fighter has losses against junior pitbull and zuluzinho via knockout (strikes). Each of these rows includes relevant information about the result, opponent, and method.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": True,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Two rows (indices 6 and 7) show losses with opponents junior pitbull and zuluzinho, both by knockout (strikes).\",\n  \"supporting_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the fighter have 2 loss in 2003 , both with method knockout (strikes) , with the location itapeua , brazil.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into specific conditions that need to be verified.\n\n1. **Two losses in 2003**: This means there should be two rows in the table where the 'result' is a loss, and the 'date' is 2003.\n\n2. **Both losses have method knockout (strikes)**: So, the 'method' column for both of these losses should be \"knockout (strikes)\".\n\n3. **Location is itapeua , brazil**: The 'location' column for both losses should be \"itapeua , brazil\".\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to check these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- There are two loss rows: row 5 and row 6 (assuming rows start from 0 as per the example given). Wait, actually, let me count properly. The first row is index 0, then 1, up to 9 maybe? No, looking back, the user's example in their response had relevant_cells with row_index starting at 0, so I think each <tr> is a row with an index.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the table provided, it's better to count each <tr> as a separate row. Let me list all the rows:\n\nRow 1: result 'win', date 1995\nRow 2: result 'win', date 1995\nRow 3: result 'win', date 1995\nRow 4: result 'win', date 1996\nRow 5: result 'win', date 1999\nRow 6: result 'loss', date 2003\nRow 7: result 'loss', date 2003 (4 november)\nRow 8: result 'loss', date 2007\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the table.\n\nThe table has 8 rows in total:\n\n1. win, 1995\n2. win, 1995\n3. win, 1995\n4. win, 1996\n5. win, 1999\n6. loss, 2003 (junior pitbull)\n7. loss, 2003 (zuluzinho)\n8. loss, 2007\n\nWait no, looking at the HTML code:\n\n<tr>\n... data for row 1\n</tr>\n\nThen next <tr> is row 2.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided table, there are 9 rows? Let me count:\n\n- The first <tr> is row 0?\nWait, the user's example had a JSON with row_index starting at 0, so each <tr> corresponds to a row index from 0 upwards.\n\nBut looking at the HTML code, the table has one <thead> and then multiple <tbody> rows. Each <tr> within <tbody> is a separate row. Let me count them:\n\n1. First <tr>: row 0\n2. Second: row 1\n3. Third: row 2\n4. Fourth: row 3\n5. Fifth: row 4\n6. Sixth: row 5 (result loss)\n7. Seventh: row 6 (result loss, date 4 nov)\n8. Eighth: row 7 (result loss, method submission)\n\nWait, no, the table has 8 <tr> elements in tbody:\n\n- First four are wins with date 1995, then win 1996, win 1999.\n\nThen, starting from row 5: loss to junior pitbull on 2003.\n\nRow 6: loss to zuluzinho on 4 nov 2003.\n\nRow 7: loss to osvaldo castuera in 2007.\n\nWait, but the table as provided has:\n\n<tbody>\n    <tr>... (1)\n    </tr>\n    ... up to\n    <tr> (6th row? Wait no, let me count again.\n\nThe table starts with <tbody>, then 9 <tr> elements because after counting each <tr> in the HTML code:\n\nLooking at the provided HTML code:\n\n<table ...>\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"...\">...</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>... (1)</tr>\n<tr>... (2)</tr>\n<tr>... (3)</tr>\n<tr>... (4)</tr>\n<tr>... (5)</tr>\n<tr>... (6)</tr>\n<tr>... (7)</tr>\n<tr>... (8)</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSo there are 8 rows in total. So row indices from 0 to 7.\n\nNow, looking for two losses in 2003:\n\nRow 5: date is \"2003\" (junior pitbull)\nRow 6: date is \"4 november\" which is part of 2003\nSo both these rows are losses in 2003.\n\nNext, the method for both these rows should be \"knockout (strikes)\".\n\nLooking at row 5: result 'loss', date 2003. The method is \"knockout (strikes)\"? Let me check the table data:\n\nRow 6: yes, method is knockout (strikes). Row 7: result is loss but method is submission.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rows are:\n\n1. row 5: loss to junior pitbull on 2003. The 'method' for this row is \"knockout (strikes)\"?\nYes, because in the table, row 6 is the first loss with date 2003, and method knockout.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML data:\n\nRow 5: result 'loss', date '2003' \u2014 let's check the columns for this row. From the user's initial message, each <tr> includes several columns like result, date, etc.\n\nBut in the actual table, the columns are:\n\n- result (win/loss)\n- date\n- opponent\n- method\n\nSo, for row 5: result is 'loss', date is '2003', method is \"knockout (strikes)\".\n\nSimilarly, row 6: result 'loss', date '4 november' (which is 2003), method \"knockout (strikes)\".\n\nWait no, let me check again. The user provided the table, but I think in their initial problem statement, they included a table with columns like Result, Date, Opponent, Method.\n\nSo for row 5:\n\n- Result: loss\n- Date: 2003\n- Opponent: junior pitbull\n- Method: knockout (strikes)\n\nRow 6:\n\n- Result: loss\n- Date: 4 November 2003\n- Opponent: zuluzinho\n- Method: knockout (strikes)\n\nSo both these rows meet the criteria of being losses in 2003 with knockout methods.\n\nAdditionally, their locations are both \"itapeua , brazil\".\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nEach row has a 'location' column. Let me check that for these two rows.\n\nRow 5: location is itapeua, brazil\n\nRow 6: same as well? Wait no, perhaps I need to check each row's location.\n\nFrom the table data:\n\nRow 0: location is itapeua, brazil\nSame for all the win rows.\n\nRows 5 and 6 are losses but still located in itapeua, brazil.\n\nSo both losses in 2003 have method knockout (strikes) and location itapeua, brazil.\n\nTherefore, the claim's conditions are met: two losses in 2003, both by knockout, in the same location.\n\nSo the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be true based on the specified criteria. There are two losses in 2003 with the required method and location.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Two losses occurred in 2003, both using knockout (strikes) methods, and both were located in itapeua, brazil.\"\n}\n```",

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the fighter have a first win in the year 1995 and have his last win in the year 1999.\" So I need to verify two things:\n1. The fighter has at least one win in 1995.\n2. The fighter's last win was in 1999.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight result with details like 'result', 'record', 'opponent', and so on. The columns relevant here are 'date' and 'method', but more importantly for this claim, we're focusing on the year part of the date.\n\nI'll go through each row to find any wins in 1995 and 1999.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- result: win\n- date: 1995\nSo that's a win in 1995. That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's a win in 1999. Looking through the rows, the fifth one (row index 4) has:\n- result: win\n- date: 1999\nSo that's another win, specifically in 1999.

So, I need to check if there are any fighters who have exactly five knockouts with the method being a strike that led to a win.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight result with various details like opponent, method, date, etc. The 'result' column shows either 'win' or 'loss', which indicates whether the fighter won or lost that particular fight.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the fighter have 2 loss , with opponent junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez , with both method be winner.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two losses for the fighter, with one of the opponents being \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez.\" Additionally, it claims that both methods in these losses resulted in a win for the opponent.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight result. The relevant columns are 'result' (which can be 'win' or 'loss'), 'record' (how many wins, losses, draws), 'opponent', 'method', and others.\n\nTo check if there's a loss where the opponent is \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez,\" I'll go through each row with a 'loss' result. Scanning the table:\n\n1. The first two rows are wins.\n2. Then, there's a loss for \"junior pitbull\" in 2003, which doesn't match the name.\n3. Next, another loss to \"zuluzinho\" in 2003; not matching.\n4. Finally, a loss to \"osvaldo castuera.\"\n\nWait, I might have missed something. The claim mentions two losses with opponent \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez.\" Looking back at the table, I don't see any rows where the opponent is \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez\" and the result is 'loss.' In fact, looking through all the loss rows:\n\n- Opponent: junior pitbull\n- Opponent: zuluzinho\n- Opponent: osvaldo castuera\n\nNo entries match \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez.\" So, this part of the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the opponent's name. Let me check again. The third loss is against \"osvaldo castuera,\" and earlier losses are against different opponents. There's no entry where the opponent is \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez\" with a 'loss' result.\n\nTherefore, the claim's first part about two losses by the fighter isn't fully supported by the table. Additionally, even if there were such entries, we need to check the method column. The claim states both methods are wins for the opponent, meaning in each of those loss rows, the method would be something that resulted in a win. But since no such rows exist, this condition isn't met.\n\nSo, the claim is not fully supported because there's no evidence of two losses by \"junior h\u00e9ctor rodr\u00edguez\" as an opponent, and hence the relevant cells aren't present in the table to confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the fighter has two losses with a specific opponent and method. However, the table doesn\u2019t show such entries, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the fighter have 3 win in 1999 with the location itapeua , brazil.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into its components. It mentions three wins (3 win) in the year 1999, and specifically at the location Itapeua, Brazil.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check for any rows where the 'result' is a win, the 'year' is 1999, and the 'location' is Itapeua, Brazil. \n\nLet me go through each row in the table:\n\n1. The first three rows (row indices 0, 1, 2) all have wins in 1995. None of them are in 1999.\n2. The fourth row (index 3) is a win in 1996, not 1999.\n3. The fifth row (index 4) shows a win in 1999, but the location is Itapeua, Brazil. So this seems relevant.\n4. The sixth and seventh rows are losses, so we can ignore those.\n\nWait, there's only one row where the fighter won in 1999, which is row index 4. But the claim says \"3 wins,\" implying three instances. Since only one win exists for that year, it doesn't meet the count of three. \n\nSo, this means the claim is FALSE because there aren't three wins in 1999 at Itapeua, Brazil.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts three wins by a fighter in 1999 at Itapeua, Brazil. However, only one win is recorded in that specific year and location, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim states: \"the fighter have 2 loss in 2007 , both with method win with the location itapeua , brazil.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Two losses in 2007**: So I'm looking for two rows where the 'result' is 'loss' and the 'date' is 2007.\n\n2. **Both methods are wins**: Wait, that seems contradictory because if a fighter lost, how can the method be a win? Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding here. Perhaps it means both losses were by a specific method, like submission or strikes, but in the table, I see 'knockout (strikes)' and 'submission (armbar)'. So maybe the method refers to the way the fighter lost.\n\n3. **Location is Itapeua, Brazil**: The 'location' column should be Itapeua, Brazil for both losses.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row where the result is a loss.\n\n- **Row 5**: Loss on 2003, not 2007.\n- **Row 6**: Loss on November 4, 2003, also not 2007.\n- **Row 7**: Loss in 2007 with method submission (armbar), location Itapeua, Brazil. So this is one loss in 2007.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's another loss in 2007. Scanning the table:\n\nThe only other loss in 2007 is row 7. There are no more losses in 2007 after that. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each row again.\n\nRows 0-6: \n\n- Rows 5 and 6 are 2003.\n- Row 7 is 2007.\n\nSo only one loss in 2007. Therefore, the claim says two losses, but only one exists. That would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\nRows:\n\n0:1995\n\n1:1995\n\n2:1995\n\n3:1996\n\n4:1999\n\n5:2003\n\n6:2003\n\n7:2007\n\nSo only row 7 is 2007. Therefore, only one loss in 2007.\n\nThus, the claim stating two losses in 2007 is incorrect. It's FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells:\n\nFor the single loss in 2007 (row 7), we need columns: result, date, opponent, method, location.\n\nSo relevant cells would be row 7 for 'result', 'date', 'opponent', 'method', and 'location'.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions two losses, but only one exists. So the key point is that there's only one loss in 2007, not two. Therefore, the relevant cells are those that show this single loss.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim is incorrect about having two losses in 2007.\n\nThe relevant_cells would include row 7 for all columns related to that loss.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the fighter have a first lose in the year 2003 and have his last win in the year 2001.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The claim mentions two specific events: a loss in 2003 and a win in 2001. I need to check if these are present in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various fights with results (win or loss), records, opponents, methods, dates, rounds, locations, and notes. Each row represents a fight, so each line is an individual event.\n\nNow, the claim talks about \"the fighter's\" first loss in 2003 and last win in 2001. So I need to find if there's any loss where the date is 2003 and a win where the date is 2001.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- The earliest losses are in 2003, specifically row indices 5,6,7. For example, row 5 has a loss on November 4, 2003, opponent Junior Pitbull. So that's a loss in 2003.\n- Now, checking for wins: I need to see if there's any win in 2001.\n\nWait, let me check the dates again. The table starts from 1995 and goes up. Scanning each row:\n\nRow 0: 1995\nRow 1: 1995\nRow 2: 1995\nRow 3: 1996\nRow 4: 1999\nRow 5: 2003 (loss)\nRow 6: 2003 (loss)\nRow7:2007 (loss)\n\nHmm, I don't see any wins in the year 2001. The last win is in 1999 (row4). So if the claim says the fighter's last win was in 2001, that's incorrect because there are no wins after 1999.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Each row has a 'date' column. For example:\n\nRow0:1995\nRow1:1995\nRow2:1995\nRow3:1996\nRow4:1999 (win)\nRow5:2003 (loss)\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the last win in the table is 1999, which would be row4. There's no row with a date of 2001 or later wins beyond 1999. So if the claim says the last win was in 2001, that's not supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because while there are losses in 2003, there are no wins in 2001 according to the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
