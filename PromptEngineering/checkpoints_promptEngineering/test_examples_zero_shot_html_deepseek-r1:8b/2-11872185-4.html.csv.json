    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there are no lifetime India distributor shares given before 2009. So, in other words, all the entries in the \"lifetime india distributor share\" column should be from movies released in 2009 or later. If any movie before 2009 has a non-zero value in that column, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll examine each row to see if there's a movie with a release year before 2009 and check their distributor shares.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Chennai Express (2013): Year 2013, which is after 2009.\n2. Ek Tha Tiger (2012): Also after 2009.\n3. 3 Idiots (2009): This one is exactly in 2009, so it's not before.\n4. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013): After 2009.\n5. Dabangg 2 (2012): After 2009.\n6. Bodyguard (2011): Also after.\n7. Dabangg (2010): After.\n8. Rowdy Rathore (2012): After.\n9. Agneepath (2012): After.\n10. Ready (2011): After.\n\nWait, all the movies in this table are released from 2009 onwards, except maybe one I missed. Let me check each row again:\n\n- The first movie is Chennai Express in 2013.\n- Ek Tha Tiger is 2012.\n- 3 Idiots is 2009.\n- Yeh Jawaani is 2013.\n- Dabangg 2 is 2012.\n- Bodyguard is 2011.\n- Dabangg is 2010.\n- Rowdy Rathore is 2012.\n- Agneepath is 2012.\n- Ready is 2011.\n\nSo, all movies in the table are from 2009 or later. There's no movie before 2009 listed here. Therefore, none of them have a lifetime India distributor share given earlier than 2009 because there are no such movies before 2009 in the table.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is there any row where the release year is before 2009? Let me check each one again:\n\n1. 2013: Yes\n2. 2012: Yes\n3. 2009: Yes (but not earlier than 2009)\n4. 2013: Yes\n5. 2012: Yes\n6. 2011: Yes\n7. 2010: Yes\n8. 2012: Yes\n9. 2012: Yes\n10. 2011: Yes\n\nSo, all are 2009 or later. Therefore, the claim is true because there's no data before 2009 to contradict it.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that in 2009, \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2012 according to the table. So I'm a bit confused here. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about movies with their respective years. The claim mentions \"2009,\" so I should look for any movie that was released in 2009 and see if it's first in some context. But the claim says \"ek tha tiger\" was first, which doesn't align because it's actually from 2012.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is trying to say that \"ek ta Tiger\" (maybe a typo) was first released in 2009, but according to the table, the movie \"3 Idiots\" was released in 2009. So maybe the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut I need to analyze it based on the table. The relevant columns are year and possibly rank if the claim is about being first. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 1: Chennai Express - 2013\n- Row 2: Ek Tha Tiger - 2012\n- Row 3: 3 Idiots - 2009\n- Row 4: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani - 2013\n- And so on.\n\nSo, in 2009, the only movie listed is \"3 Idiots.\" There's no mention of \"ek tha tiger\" being released in 2009. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because \"ek tha tiger\" was actually released in 2012, and the first release in 2009 was \"3 Idiots.\"\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in 2009 ek ta Tiger be first release.\" Maybe it's a misstatement, perhaps trying to refer to \"Ekta Tiger\" or another movie. But based on the table, no such movie is listed for 2009 except \"3 Idiots.\"\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because \"ek tha tiger\" wasn't released in 2009. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"Ek Tha Tiger\" was released in 2009, but it was actually released in 2012. The only movie released in 2009 according to the table is \"3 Idiots,\" which doesn't align with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the claim. It says that for movies released before 2009, their lifetime India distributor' shares were zero. So, any movie with a release year earlier than 2009 should have a share of 0 in the 'lifetime india distributor share' column.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists movies from 2010 onwards, as the earliest year is 2009 (\"3 Idiots\" from 2009). Wait, that's actually the first movie released in 2009. So, if the claim is about movies before 2009, are there any such movies in the table?\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n1. Chennai Express - 2013\n2. Ek Tha Tiger - 2012\n3. 3 Idiots - 2009\n4. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani - 2013\n5. Dabangg 2 - 2012\n6. Bodyguard - 2011\n7. Dabangg - 2010\n8. Rowdy Rathore - 2012\n9. Agneepath - 2012\n10. Ready - 2011\n\nAll the movies listed are from 2009 or later. There's no movie released before 2009 in this table. Therefore, there are no data points to check whether their shares were zero because none exist.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"earlier than 2009.\" Since all movies in the table are 2009 or newer, does that mean the relevant cells don't exist? Or perhaps the claim is implying that any data before 2009 (which isn't present here) should be zero. However, since there's no data to validate, maybe it's considered as supported because there are no contradicting entries.\n\nAlternatively, if a movie existed before 2009, its share should be zero. Since such movies aren't in the table, the claim holds as true by default for the absence of evidence. Or does it mean that the claim is false because there are no data points to confirm?\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The claim is asserting a fact about movies before 2009 having zero share. Since all movies in the table are from 2009 onwards, and their shares vary, but none of them were released before 2009. So, perhaps the claim is true because there's no movie in the data that contradicts it\u2014meaning all relevant (non-existent) movies do have a share of zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe the term \"relevant_cells\" refers to the cells where we should check if the condition holds. Since there are no rows before 2009, perhaps there are no relevant cells. However, according to the example given, they included rows even when their data wasn't directly related. So in this case, since all movies are from 2009 or later, maybe none of them are \"earlier than 2009,\" so the claim is vacuously true because there's no data that contradicts it.\n\nAlternatively, if a movie was released before 2009 and had a non-zero share, then the claim would be false. But since all movies in the table are after or equal to 2009, and their shares are non-zero except for some entries, but those are post-2009. Wait, no, the claim is about movies earlier than 2009; if any of them had a non-zero share, the claim would be false.\n\nBut since there's no data before 2009 in the table, perhaps the claim is considered true because it doesn't apply to any of the provided data. Or maybe not\u2014the instruction says to check each condition against the table. Since the table has no rows where the year is earlier than 2009, the claim is trivially true because there's nothing to contradict it.\n\nWait, but in reality, if a movie existed before 2009 with a non-zero share, then the claim would be false. But since such movies aren't in the data, does that mean the claim holds? Or perhaps it doesn't apply, so we can consider it true because there's no evidence of any movie having a positive share before 2009.\n\nI think I've gone around this enough. To sum up: all movies in the table are from 2009 or later, and their shares vary. Since the claim is about movies before 2009, which don't exist here, it's either vacuously true or not applicable. Therefore, the answer would be TRUE because there's no data to contradict it.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim that \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0,\" we examine the 'year' column in the table. All listed movies were released from 2009 onwards, meaning there are no movies prior to 2009 in the dataset. Since no relevant data exists for movies before 2009, the claim holds as true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"agneepath be release first in 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts. The main points are:\n\n1. \"Agnepath\" is released.\n2. It was released \"first\" in 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if Agnepath was indeed released in 2010 and whether it was the first movie from any studio that year or among all movies in the list. \n\nFrom the table, I see that there's a row for Agnepath:\n\n- Rank: 9\n- Movie: Agnepath\n- Year: 2012\n- Studio: Dharma Productions\n- Lifetime India distributor share: 65,53,00000\n\nThe year listed is 2012, not 2010. So the claim about the release year being 2010 seems incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if it was released first in 2010. Looking at other movies in the table, some were released in 2010:\n\n- Dabangg: 2010\n- Rowdy Rathore: 2012\n- Ek Tha Tiger: 2012\n- Chennai Express: 2013\n- Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani: 2013\n- Dabangg 2: 2012\n- Bodyguard: 2011\n- Ready: 2011\n\nWait, actually, Dabangg was released in 2010. So if Agnepath wasn't released in 2010, the claim is false.\n\nMoreover, looking at the table's rows, Agnepath is ranked 9th, which likely means it wasn't the first movie in 2010, as Dabangg (rank 7) was released in 2010.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 9, \"year\" column: to check the release year.\n- Possibly rank if we need to see its position relative to others in 2010.\n\nBut since the claim mentions 2010 as the release year and being first, the main relevant cells are row 9's year and possibly rank if needed. However, the key point is that Agnepath wasn't released in 2010.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because \"Agnepath\" was released in 2012, not 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
