    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a stadium is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the new trabzon stadium have a capacity of 41513 people.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which row in the table corresponds to \"new trabzon stadium.\" Looking at the table, each row has the columns: stadium name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. Scanning through the rows, I see that the fifth row (since it's a 0-index or maybe 1-index) is labeled as \"new trabzon stadium\". Wait, let me check again.\n\nActually, counting from the top: first row is Tim Sah Arena, second Vodafone Arena, third New Konya Stadium, fourth New Trabzon Stadium. So that would be the fourth row if it's zero-indexed or the fifth if one-indexed. But in programming contexts, usually, rows are zero-indexed, so I'll consider the fourth row as index 4.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table structure: the first <tr> is Tim Sah Arena, which would be row index 0. Then each subsequent tr increases by one. So \"new trabzon stadium\" is the fourth in the list, meaning row_index 3? Wait, let me recount:\n\n1. Tim Sah Arena (row 0)\n2. Vodafone Arena (row 1)\n3. New Konya Stadium (row 2)\n4. New Trabzon Stadium (row 3)\nYes, so row index is 3.\n\nNext, the claim refers to the capacity of \"new trabzon stadium\" being 41513 people. Looking at the capacity column for that row. The table shows for row 3, the capacity is 41513. That's a match.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the row where stadium is \"new trabzon stadium\", specifically the capacity column.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because the claim matches the data in the table. The relevant cell is at row index 3 and column_name \"capacity\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015 be new trabzon stadium that hold 41513",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a stadium is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015 be new trabzon stadium that hold 41513.\" \n\nBreaking this down, the claim has two main parts. The first part asks about a stadium that has the largest capacity and was opened after 2015. The second part specifies that this stadium is called \"new trabzon stadium\" with a capacity of 41,513.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to check two things: \n1. Among all stadiums in the table, which one opened after 2015 has the highest capacity.\n2. Whether that stadium is indeed \"new trabzon stadium\" and if its capacity matches 41,513.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a stadium with details like name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. I need to go through each row and identify those where the opening year is after 2015.\n\nLet me list out all the stadiums opened after 2015 based on the \"opening\" column:\n\n- New Trabzon Stadium: 2016\n- Istanbul BB (Ba\u015fak\u015fehir Stadi): 2014 (Wait, this was opened in 2014, which is before 2015, so it doesn't qualify)\nWait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at each row's opening year:\n1. Tim Sah Arena - 2014 (doesn't qualify)\n2. Vodafone Arena - 2015 (just at the cutoff, but the claim says after 2015)\n3. New Konya Stadium - 2014\n4. New Trabzon Stadium - 2016 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. New Eski\u015fehir Stadium - 2015\n6. Stadyum Samsun - 2016 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. New Gaziantep Stadium - 2016 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. New Antalya Stadium - 2016 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. New Sakarya Stadium - 2016 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. Malatya Arena - 2015\n11. New Sivas Stadium - 2015\n12. Afyonkarahisar Stadi - 2014\n13. Ba\u015fak\u015fehir Stadi - 2014\n14. Ay - Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Stadium (Karab\u00fck) - 2014\n15. New Sakarya Stadium again - 2016 \u2714\ufe0f (but the capacity here is 25,000)\n16. New Turgutlu Stadium - 2014\n\nSo from this list, the stadiums opened after 2015 are:\n- New Trabzon Stadium: 2016\n- Stadyum Samsun: 2016\n- New Gaziantep Stadium: 2016\n- New Antalya Stadium: 2016\n- New Sakarya Stadium: 2016 (with 25,000 capacity)\nWait, but the claim refers to \"new trabzon stadium\" specifically. So I need to check if this is indeed the one with the highest capacity among those after 2015.\n\nLooking at their capacities:\n- New Trabzon Stadium: 41,513\n- Stadyum Samsun: 34,658\n- New Gaziantep Stadium: 33,200\n- New Antalya Stadium: 33,000\n- New Sakarya Stadium (2016): 25,000\n\nSo the capacities are as follows. The highest among these is 41,513, which belongs to New Trabzon Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that this stadium is \"new trabzon stadium\" with a capacity of 41513. So both parts of the claim seem to be correct based on the table.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that there isn't another stadium opened after 2015 with a higher capacity than New Trabzon Stadium. From the list, none of the other stadiums post-2015 have a higher capacity. So the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The stadium with the largest capacity and opening after 2015 is indeed \"new trabzon stadium\" with a capacity of 41,513.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opening\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "in trabzon , the lowest capacity match have a capacity of 11'000",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Trabzon is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then analyze the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"In Trabzon, the lowest capacity match have a capacity of 11'000.\" Hmm, that's a bit unclear. I think it means that in Trabzon, there is a stadium with a capacity of 10,000 which is the smallest among all matches (stadiums) in Trabzon.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different stadium with details like name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. My first step is to find all entries where the city is \"Trabzon\" because the claim is specifically about Trabzon.\n\nLet me go through the rows:\n\n1. The first row is Timasah Arena in Bursa. Not relevant.\n2. Second row is Vodafone Arena in Istanbul. No.\n3. Third row, New Konya Stadium in Konya. No.\n4. Fourth row, New Trabzon Stadium. City is Trabzon! Capacity is 41,513.\n5. Fifth row, New Eski\u015fehir Stadium. Not Trabzon.\n6. Sixth row, Stadyum Samsun. Nope.\n7. Seventh row, New Gaziantep Stadium. No.\n8. Eighth row, New Antalya Stadium. No.\n9. Ninth row, New Sakarya Stadium. No.\n10. Tenth row, Malatya Arena in Malatya. Not Trabzon.\n11. Eleventh row, New Sivas Stadium. No.\n12. Twelfth row, Afyonkarahisar Stadi in Afyonkarahisar. No.\n13. Thirteenth row, Ba\u015fak\u015fehir Stadi in Istanbul. No.\n14. Fourteenth row, Ay - Y\u0131ld\u0131z Stadium in Karab\u00fck. Not Trabzon.\n15. Fifteenth row, New Sakarya Stadium again in Sakarya. No.\n16. Sixteenth row, New Turgutlu Stadium in Turgutlu. Not Trabzon.\n\nSo the only entry for Trabzon is the fourth row: New Trabzon Stadium with a capacity of 41,513. Now, the claim mentions the lowest capacity match having 11,000. Looking through all the rows, I need to check if any stadium in Trabzon has a capacity of 11,000 or less.\n\nWait, but the only Trabzon entry is 41,513. So there are no other stadiums in Trabzon listed with lower capacities. Therefore, the claim seems incorrect because it suggests that there's a stadium in Trabzon with a capacity of 11,000, which isn't present in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in Trabzon, the lowest capacity match has a capacity of 10,000. However, checking the table, only one stadium is listed for Trabzon (New Trabzon Stadium) with a capacity of 41,513, and no other stadiums in Trabzon are present with lower capacities.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Identify all rows where the city is \"Trabzon.\"\n2. From these, check if any have a capacity of 11,000.\n3. Only one stadium for Trabzon exists with 41,513 capacity; none have 10,000.\n4. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAnswer: FALSE  \nRelevant cells: No relevant cells as no stadium in Trabzon matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
