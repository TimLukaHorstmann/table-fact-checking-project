    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about a specific game is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"the game on march 8 be play by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor).\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need to be checked against the table. The key elements are:\n\n1. The date of the game is March 8.\n2. The home team is Minnesota.\n3. The visitor is Philadelphia.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with different details. So, I'll need to find the row where the date is March 8 and then check the home and visitor columns for that row.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's date column to locate March 8. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: March 1\n- Row 1: March 2\n- Row 2: March 4\n- Row 3: March 6\n- Row 4: March 8\n\nAh, here's the one. The fourth row (index 4) has the date March 8.\n\nNext, I'll check the home team and visitor for this row. From the table:\n\n- Home column: minnesota\n- Visitor column: philadelphia\n\nSo, the game on March 8 is between Minnesota (home) and Philadelphia (visitor), which matches the claim exactly.\n\nNow, to ensure there are no discrepancies, I'll verify if any other columns might affect this conclusion. For example, the score or attendance could be checked for consistency, but since the claim doesn't mention those, they aren't necessary here. The main focus is on the teams and the date.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"edmonton be a visitor on march 9 to philadelphia , with a record of 44 - 7 - 15\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. There are two main points here:\n\n1. Edmonton was a visitor when they played against Philadelphia on March 9.\n2. The game's record for that day is 44 - 7 - 15.\n\nI need to check both of these in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for \"edmonton\" as the visitor and \"march 9\" as the date. \n\nStarting with the first part: Edmonton as the visitor on March 9. I'll go through each row until I find one where the 'visitor' column matches Edmonton and the date is March 9.\n\nChecking each row:\n\n- Row 0: visitor is Philadelphia, not Edmonton.\n- ...\nWait, actually, looking at the table provided, let me list out all the rows with dates around March 9. Hmm, wait, in the table, I see a row for March 9 where the visitor is Edmonton. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the table, here's the relevant part:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>march 9</td>\n  <td>edmonton</td>\n  <td>3 - 5</td>\n  <td>philadelphia</td>\n  <td>myre</td>\n  <td>17077</td>\n  <td>44 - 7 - 15</td>\n</tr>\n\nYes, that's the row for March 9. The visitor is Edmonton, playing against Philadelphia.\n\nNow, checking the score or record part of the claim: 44 - 7 - 15. In the table, the 'record' column for that day shows \"44 - 7 - 15\".\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row index 9 (assuming rows start at 0) for visitor and record columns.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the 'visitor' column for Edmonton on March 9. The relevant row is found, and the 'record' matches \"44 - 7 - 15\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"quebec have a decision of myre , and a record of 44 - 7 - 15\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the decision being 'myre', and the second part is about the record being '44 - 7 - 15'.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there's a row where the visitor is 'quebec' with the decision column as 'myre'. Also, in that same row, the record should be exactly '44 - 7 - 15'.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to find any matches.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- March 1: Visitor is Philadelphia. Not Quebec.\n- March 2: Montreal. No.\n- March 4: Colorado. No.\n- March 6: NY Islanders. No.\n- March 8: Philadelphia. No.\n- March 9: Edmonton. No.\n- March 11: Philadelphia. No.\n- March 12: Philadelphia. No.\n- March 15: Atlanta. No.\n- March 16: Colorado. No.\n- March 20: Toronto. No.\n- March 21: Philadelphia. No.\n- March 23: Boston. No.\n- March 25: NY Islanders. No.\n- March 27: Quebec. Oh, here we go.\n\nSo on March 27, the visitor is Quebec. Now check the decision column: it says 'peeters'. That's not 'myre', so this row doesn't match both parts of the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. The claim specifies 'decision of myre' and 'record of 44 -7-15'.\n\nLooking through all rows again, especially for Quebec:\n\nOn March 27: Visitor is Quebec, decision is peeters, record is 46 -11 -18.\n\nNo match there. Are there any other Quebec entries? Let me check the last few rows.\n\nMarch 29: Philadelphia.\nMarch 30: Atlanta.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a row. Let's see:\n\nThe table has 14 rows from March 1 to March 8, then more up to March 30. I'll list all visitors:\n\n- March 1: Philadelphia\n- March 2: Montreal\n- March 3: Colorado (I think)\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML, each row is a <tr> with td elements for date, visitor, decision, record.\n\nLooking for rows where visitor is Quebec:\n\nYes, March 27: visitor is Quebec. Decision is 'peeters', so not matching myre.\n\nNo other rows have Quebec as the visitor. Therefore, there's no row where the visitor is Quebec, decision is myre, and record is 44-7-15.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the record for March 27. Let me check:\n\nFor March 27: Decision is peeters, record is 46 -11 -18.\n\nSo that doesn't match. Also, no row where visitor is Quebec, decision myre, and record 44-7-15.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no such row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies \"quebec\" having a decision of \"myre\" and a record of \"44 - 7 - 15\". After examining each row, no matching entry was found. The visitor \"quebec\" does not have a decision of \"myre\", nor does it match the specified record.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}",
