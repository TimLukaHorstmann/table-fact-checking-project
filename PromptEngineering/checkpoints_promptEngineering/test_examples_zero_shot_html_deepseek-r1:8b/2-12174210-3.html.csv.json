    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to check if the claim \"the Lynmore Primary School has a coed student body\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what information is needed to verify the claim. The key aspects here are:\n\n1. **Existence of Lynmore Primary School**: Is there an entry for \"Lynmore Primary School\" in the table?\n2. **Student Body Type**: Does the school have a coed (co-ed) student body?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by scanning through each row to see if \"Lynmore Primary School\" appears as the school name. If it does, then I can check the relevant column for the student body type.\n\nGoing row by row:\n\n- Row 0: Western Heights High School\n- Row 1: Sunset Primary School\n- ...\n- Continuing until I reach a row where the school is \"Lynmore Primary School\".\n\nUpon checking, I realize that \"Lynmore Primary School\" isn't present in any of the rows. All entries listed are different schools like \"Sunset Primary School,\" \"Whangamarino School,\" etc., but none are named \"Lynmore Primary School.\"\n\nTherefore, since there's no record of Lynmore Primary School in the table, it doesn't have a coed student body as per the given data. The absence of the school name implies that either it doesn't exist or isn't listed in this dataset.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim can't be fully supported because the school isn't present in the table. Hence, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the lynmore primary school take coed student in year 1 - 8",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the lynmore primary school take coed student in year 1 - 8\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding each part of the claim and then check against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"lynmore primary school.\" Looking at the table, I should see if there's a row for this school. Scanning through the rows, I don't immediately spot \"Lynmore Primary School.\" The closest might be \"Upper Atiamuri School\" or others, but none seem to match \"Lynmore.\"\n\nNext, the claim says they take coed students in years 1-8. So even if the school existed, I'd check the \"Year\" and \"Coed\" columns for that specific row. But since I don't see \"Lynmore Primary School\" in the table, there's no data to support or refute this claim.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each row again carefully. No, I don't think so. The schools listed are all different names, and none match \"Lynmore.\" Therefore, there's no information about Lynmore Primary School taking coed students in the given years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided data as the school does not exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the kaharoa school have a decile of 9 and coed student serve the roturua district in year 7 - 13",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about The Kaharoa School is true based on the provided table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"The Kaharoa School has a decile of 9 and coed student serves the roturua district in year 7 - 13.\" I need to verify if both parts of this claim are supported by the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a school with various attributes like name, decile, year range, and location. The columns relevant here are \"Decile\", \"Year Range\", and possibly others like \"Coed\" or specific location descriptors.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: Decile is 9. I'll scan through each row to find a school named \"The Kaharoa School.\" Scrolling down, I see multiple entries. Wait, there's no entry for \"The Kaharoa School.\" Hmm, that's concerning because if the school isn't in the table, then we can't verify its decile or other details.\n\nMoving on to the second part: coed students serving the Rotorua district from Year 7-13. Again, without finding The Kaharoa School in the table, it's impossible to confirm this. Also, the claim mentions \"roturua\" which might be a typo for \"Rotorua.\" If I look up \"Rotorua District,\" there are schools listed under that location, but none named as The Kaharoa School.\n\nWait, maybe I missed an entry. Let me check again. No, the table provided doesn't have any rows for The Kaharoa School. So both parts of the claim can't be verified because the school isn't present in the data.\n\nTherefore, the claim's truthfulness is questionable since there's no evidence of The Kaharoa School existing in the given table. Thus, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
