    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"jessica shepley receive a winner's share of 14000 when she won the beaver meadow golf course tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. There are three main parts to check:\n\n1. Did Jessica Shepley win the tournament?\n2. Was her winner's share $14,000?\n3. Was the tournament location the Beaver Meadow Golf Course?\n\nLooking at the table, I need to locate Jessica Shepley. Scanning through the 'champion' column, I see her name in the 2011 row. So that's row index 2.\n\nNext, I check the 'winner's share' column for that row. It says $14,000. That matches the amount mentioned in the claim.\n\nThe location of the tournament is listed in the 'tournament location' column. For Jessica Shepley's year, 2011, it's Beaver Meadow Golf Course. So all three parts are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "in 2012 , the champion be from the united state",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2012, the champion be from the united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the year 2012 in the table. Scanning each row, I see that the first row after the header corresponds to 2013, and so on until 2004. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the rows are ordered from 2013 down to 2004. So the first data row is for 2013, next 2012, etc.\n\nWait, no. The table starts with 2013 as the first row in the tbody, so the first data row (row 0) is 2013, then row 1 is 2012, and so on until row 12 is 2004. So for 2012, it's row index 1.\n\nNow, looking at row 1: year is 2012. The champion column has the name \"jenny gleason\". The country column says \"united states\". So the champion in 2012 was Jenny Gleason from the United States. Therefore, the claim that the champion in 2012 was from the United States is TRUE.\n\nI need to check if this supports the claim. Since the champion's country is listed as \"united states\", it fully supports the statement. So I should mark the answer as TRUE and specify the relevant cells.\n\nThe relevant cells are row index 1, column \"champion\" because that's where the name is, but wait, no. The claim refers to the country, so actually, it's the \"country\" column in row 1. Because the claim is about the champion being from a certain country, not their name.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the claim is about the champion's origin, which is the country. So the relevant cells are the country column for 2012 and possibly the year column as well, but the year is given in the claim, so we don't need to check it beyond confirming it's 2012.\n\nSo, the two relevant columns are \"year\" (to confirm the year is 2012) and \"country\" (to confirm it's united states). Alternatively, since the claim specifies the year, maybe just checking the country column is sufficient. But according to the instructions, I should look at each condition in the claim.\n\nThe claim has two parts: the year being 2012 and the champion being from the United States. So both conditions need to be checked.\n\nTherefore, for the year, check the \"year\" column in row 1, which is indeed 2012. For the country, check the \"country\" column in row 1, which is \"united states\". Both conditions are met.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the table for the year 2012 and confirmed that the champion was from the United States.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- The \"year\" column (to confirm it's 2012).\n- The \"country\" column (to confirm it's the United States).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that starting from the year after 2012 (so 2013 onwards), the winner's share in each tournament listed in the table should never be less than 15,000. \n\nLooking at the table, it lists data from 2004 to 2013, with each row representing a different year and various details, including the winner's share. The relevant column for this claim is \"winner 's share\".\n\nI need to check each year after 2012 to see if their winner's share is less than 15,000. According to the table:\n\n- 2004: 9100\n- 2005: 9100\n- 2006: 9800\n- 2007: 10500\n- 2008: 11200\n- 2009: 12600\n- 2010: 15400\n- 2011: 14000\n- 2012: 15000\n- 2013: 15000\n\nWait, actually, the table starts from 2004 to 2013. The claim says \"after 2012\", so I should look at years 2013 onwards. However, in the provided data, the latest year is 2013. So for 2013, the winner's share is 15,000.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at each row's \"year\" and \"winner 's share\":\n\n- 2004: 9100\n- 2005: 9100\n- 2006: 9800\n- 2007: 10500\n- 2008: 11200\n- 2009: 12600\n- 2010: 15400\n- 2011: 14000\n- 2012: 15000\n- 2013: 15000\n\nSo, the claim is about years after 2012. That would be 2013 and onwards. The table only goes up to 2013, so I can check from 2013.\n\nIn 2013, the winner's share is 15,000, which is equal to 15,000. So it's not less than 15,000. \n\nWait, but does \"after 2012\" mean strictly after, like starting in 2014? Because 2012 is included as a year, but perhaps the claim starts from 2013.\n\nBut the table doesn't have data beyond 2013, so I don't need to look further. The only relevant row after 2012 is 2013, which has a winner's share of 15,000. So it meets the condition because it's not less than 15,000.\n\nTherefore, all rows from 2013 onwards (only one in this case) have winner's share equal to or greater than 15,000. Since none are less, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000,\" we need to examine each year after 2012 in the table and check if their winner's share is at least 15000.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The relevant column for this claim is \"winner 's share.\" We will focus on rows where the year is greater than 2012.\n   \n2. **Check Each Year After 2012**:\n   - For the year 2013, the winner's share is 15000.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since all relevant years have a winner's share of at least 15000, the claim holds true.\n\nThe relevant cells are those from the \"winner 's share\" column starting from 2013 onwards.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"champion jenny shin share 14000 dollar when she win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the champion named Jenny Shin in the table. Scanning through each row, I see her listed in the 2010 row. Her country is the United States, which matches part of the claim. \n\nNext, the claim mentions she shares $14,000 when she wins. In the table, under the \"winner 's share\" column for 2010, it says $15,400. Wait, that's not exactly $14,000. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nSo, even though Jenny Shin is indeed the champion from the United States in 2010, her winner's share doesn't match what's stated in the claim. The table shows $15,400, not $14,000. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n\nI need to check if there are any other rows with Jenny Shin. Looking through all the rows, she only appears once in 2010. So that's the only relevant row.\n\nNow, I should map which cells are relevant. The row index for 2010 is 4 (since it starts from 0). The column we're interested in is \"winner 's share\", so that's the 7th column.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should be FALSE because the winner's share doesn't match. And the relevant cells are at row 4 and column \"winner 's share\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is asserting. It seems like it's stating that for all years after 2012 (so starting from 2013 onwards), there are no purses where the winner's share is less than 15,400 dollars. So my task is to check each relevant row in the table and see if any of them, post-2012, have a winner's share below 15,400.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that it starts from 2004 up to 2013. The years go from 2004 to 2013. So after 2012 would be 2013 and maybe beyond, but since the table only goes up to 2013, I'll focus on that.\n\nEach row in the table has a \"year\" column and a \"winner's share\" column. I need to check rows where the year is greater than 2012, which in this case is just 2013. Then, for each of these years, I check if their winner's share is less than 15,400.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- For 2013: The winner's share is 15,000.\n- For 2014 and beyond: Wait, but the table only goes up to 2013. So in this case, after 2012, there's only 2013 left. Now, checking 2013's \"winner's share\" which is 15,000. Is that less than 15,400? Yes, because 15,000 is less than 15,400.\n\nSo the claim states that zero purses after 2012 have a winner's share less than 15,400. But in reality, there is at least one purse (from 2013) where the winner's share was 15,000, which is indeed below 15,400. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not true that zero purses meet this criterion\u2014it actually has one.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The table shows for 2013: purse is 100,000 and winner's share is 15,000. So yes, it's less than 15,400. Therefore, the claim's assertion that there are zero such pursies after 2012 is incorrect because at least one exists.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells would include all rows from 2013 onwards where the winner's share is below 15,400. In this case, only 2013 meets this condition.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
