    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the song with point smaller than 54 , a draw smaller than 4 and a place smaller than 10 be eu mesmo.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It seems like there are three conditions:\n\n1. Song points must be less than 54.\n2. Draw number must be less than 4.\n3. Place must be less than 10.\n\nAdditionally, the song title is specified as \"be eu stesso,\" which might have a typo. Looking at the table, I see that one of the songs is \"eu mesmo\" by t\u00f3 leal. So, I need to check if this specific song meets all three conditions.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 2**: Singer is t\u00f3 leal, song is \"eu mesmo\". Points are 42, draw is 2, place is 8.\n   - Points (42) <54: Yes\n   - Draw (2)<4: Yes\n   - Place (8)<10: Yes\n   So this row matches.\n\nNo other rows have the song \"be eu stesso\" or a similar name. For example, row 2 is the only one with \"eu mesmo.\" \n\nWait, the claim says \"be eu mismo,\" but in the table it's \"eu mesma\" for row 2 and \"be eu stesso\"? Let me double-check the table. No, actually, looking back, row 2 has \"eu mismo\" as the song title. So the correct spelling is \"eu mesmo.\"\n\nTherefore, this row satisfies all three conditions: points less than 54, draw less than 4, and place less than 10.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by this row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"draw\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"elaisa's song 'ai a noite' gets first place.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for elaisa in the singer column. Scanning through each row, I find that elaisa is listed as row 5. So, her row index is 5.\n\nNext, I need to check what her song is. According to the table, her song is \"ai a noite.\" That matches the claim's reference to 'ai a noite,' so that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to verify where she placed. The place column for row 5 has the value 6. Wait, but the claim says it gets first place. Hmm, that doesn't match because 6th place isn't first. So this seems like a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Elaisa is in row 5, her points are 49, and her place is 6. The claim states she got first place. Since 6 \u2260 1, the claim doesn't hold. \n\nSo, the relevant cells would be where her information is: singer (row 5) and song (row 5). But since the placement doesn't match, the overall statement is false.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be FALSE because although elaisa has \"ai a noite\" as her song, she didn't place first.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"singer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"patricia antunes sing the song eu mesmo\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim itself. The user is saying that Patricia Antunes sings a song called \"eu mesma.\" So, my task is to find if there's any information in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: draw, singer, song, points, and place. Since the claim is about the singer and the song, I need to focus on these two columns specifically.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones match both the singer's name and the song title mentioned in the claim. Starting from row 0:\n\n- Row 0: Singer is \"vnia maroti,\" not Patricia Antunes.\n- Row 1: Singer is \"t\u00f3 leal,\" nope.\n- Row 2: Singer is \"patricia antunes.\" Wait, that's our target! And the song here is \"canto em portugu\u00eas.\" Hmm, but the claim mentions \"eu mesmo,\" which isn't this one. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n  \nMoving on:\n\n- Rows 3 to 9: None of these have \"patricia antunes\" as the singer, so no match there.\n\nWait a second, I might have missed something. Let me double-check. The claim is about Patricia Antunes singing \"eu mesmo.\" So I need to see if any row has both her name and that song.\n\nLooking back at row 2: Singer is Patricia Antunes, but the song is \"canto em portugu\u00eas,\" not \"eu mesma.\" So this doesn't match.\n\nIs there another row with her? Let me check the table again. Row 8: Singer is \"l\u00facia moniz,\" and so on. No, I don't see Patricia Antunes singing \"eu stesso\" in any of the rows.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me go through each singer:\n\nRow 2: Patricia Antunes - song \"canto em portugu\u00eas\"\nRow 3: Barbara Reis\n...\nRow 8: L\u00facia Moniz\nRow 9: Pedro Migu\u00e9is\nRow 10: Jo\u00e3o Portugal\n\nNo, none of these have both \"patricia antunes\" and \"eu mesmo.\" So the claim doesn't seem to be fully supported.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I should check if \"eu mesma\" is a typo for \"eu stesso\" or something else. But in the table, the closest is row 2 with \"canto em portugu\u00eas,\" which isn't matching. So even if there was a song called \"eu misma,\" Patricia Antunes isn't singing it here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no entry where Patricia Antunes sings \"eu stesso.\" The only time she appears is in row 2 with a different song.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Patricia Antunes sings \"eu mesmo,\" but according to the table, she sings \"canto em portugu\u00eas\" instead. No matching row supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"singer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
