    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"Alabama be the opponent when they play at Legion Field Birmingham, AL.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any where the opponent is Alabama and the site is Legion Field in Birmingham, AL.\n\nStarting from the first row, September 5: Opponent is Virginia Tech, site is Lane Stadium. Not matching.\n\nSeptember 12: Chattanooga at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium. No match.\n\nSeptember 19: Ohio at Peden Stadium. Nope.\n\nOctober 3: Army at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium. Still not.\n\nOctober 10: UAB same location. No.\n\nOctober 17: Opponent is Alabama, site is Legion Field Birmingham. That matches! So the relevant cell here is row 6 (assuming rows start at 0), column 'opponent'.\n\nWait, let me count the rows correctly. The first data row after the header is row 0, so October 3 is row 4. Then October 17 is row 5 or 6? Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe table has a header (rows <thead>), then body starts with first game as row 0. So row indices go from 0 to 8, with the last data row being November 21 at row 8, and the next row is the footer with all times in Eastern.\n\nSo October 17 is row 6? Wait no: let me list them:\n\nRow 0: Sept 5\nRow1: Sept12\nRow2: Sept19\nRow3: Oct3\nRow4: Oct10\nRow5: Oct17\nRow6: Oct24\nRow7: Oct31\nRow8: Nov5\nRow9: Nov14\nRow10:Nov21\nThen row11 is the header with all times.\n\nSo October 17 is row5. So opponent in row5 is Alabama, site is Legion Field Birmingham AL.\n\nThat matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the relevant cells are row_index=5, column_name='opponent'.\n\nI don't see any other rows where Alabama is the opponent at Legion Field. The last occurrence is only once.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each row for when Alabama is the opponent and the site is Legion Field in Birmingham, AL.\n\nOnly one matching row exists:\n\n- **Row 5**: Opponent is Alabama, Site is Legion Field Birmingham, AL.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by this data, making it TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of football game data, and I need to check if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"On November 14, Louisville plays at Dowdy - Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see where it matches in the table. Let me break it down.\n\nThe date mentioned is November 14. Looking at the table, there's a row for November 14. That\u2019s row index 9. So that's definitely relevant because the date has to match.\n\nNext, the opponent is Louisville. In row 9, the opponent column says \"louisville.\" Since it's lowercase in the claim but uppercase in the table, I need to check if case sensitivity matters here. But usually, names are matched regardless of case, so this should be okay.\n\nThen, the location is Dowdy - Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC. In row 9, the site column says \"dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc.\" The claim has \"Dowdy - Ficklen Stadium\" without the comma after Greenville and with a capital 'N' for North Carolina. Again, I think the structure is similar enough that it's a match.\n\nWait, but in the table, the site is written as \"dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc.\" The claim has a comma after Greenville, so maybe that's different. But looking at other rows, some have commas and others don't. For example, row 1 has \"lane stadium blacksburg , va\" with a comma, while row 2 doesn't have one after Chattanooga. So the presence of a comma might not be consistent, but the key parts are the same.\n\nThe result column in row 9 is \"l45 - 63,\" which I don't think affects whether the game took place because the claim isn't about the score.\n\nAttendance numbers also don't matter for this particular check, as the claim is only about the location and date.\n\nSo putting it all together: the date matches row 9, opponent matches, and the venue's name is present in the site column. Even though there are some minor differences like commas and case, I think it's a sufficient match to consider the claim true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be 80079 crowd attendance when alabama be the opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that when Alabama is the opponent, there was an attendance of 80,079 people at the game. So I need to look for a row in the table where the opponent is Alabama and check if the attendance number matches exactly with 80079.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game. The columns are date, opponent, site, result, and attendance. My main focus will be on the 'opponent' column and the 'attendance' column for this task.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find where Alabama is listed as the opponent. Scanning down:\n\n1. First row: Opponent is Virginia Tech \u2013 not Alabama.\n2. Second row: Chattanooga \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: Ohio \u2013 still no.\n4. Fourth row: Army \u2013 not Alabama.\n5. Fifth row: UAB \u2013 not Alabama.\n6. Sixth row: Alabama \u2013 here we go. This is the game where Alabama was the opponent.\n\nNow, looking at the attendance for this particular game. The number in the 'attendance' column for that row is 80,079. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other rows where Alabama is the opponent. Let's check the remaining rows:\n\n7. Seventh row: Southern Miss \u2013 no.\n8. Eighth row: Houston \u2013 no.\n9. Ninth row: Cincinnati \u2013 no.\n10. Tenth row: Louisville \u2013 no.\n11. Eleventh row: Memphis \u2013 no.\n\nThere are no other entries where Alabama is the opponent. So, only one game matches this condition, and the attendance was indeed 80,079.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. The answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones for September 19 where Alabama was the opponent and the attendance column had 80079.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Opponent being UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham).\n\nI'll need to check each row in the table to see if any match both conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row's \"opponent\" and \"attendance\" columns.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- September 5 vs Virginia Tech: Attendance is 48134. Opponent isn't UAB.\n- September 12 vs Chattanooga: Attendance 34028. Not UAB.\n- September 19 vs Ohio: 19186. No.\n- October 3 vs Army: 40607. Opponent isn't UAB.\n- October 10 vs UAB: Attendance is 31002. This matches both criteria.\n  \nSince there's a row where the opponent is UAB and attendance is 31002, the claim is supported by the table.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows with UAB as the opponent to ensure it's unique, but in this case, UAB appears only once on October 10.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"alabama be the opponent when the attendance be 81079\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that 'Alabama' is the opponent and the attendance for that particular game was 81,079. So, essentially, we're looking for a row in the table where the 'opponent' column is Alabama and the 'attendance' for that same row matches exactly 81,079.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. The table has several columns: date, opponent, site, result, attendance. Each row represents a different game with these details. My focus will be on the 'opponent' and 'attendance' columns.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check for the presence of 'Alabama' as the opponent and see if their corresponding attendance is 81,079.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n\n1. **September 5**: Opponent is Virginia Tech, attendance is 48,134. Doesn't match.\n2. **September 12**: Chattanooga, attendance 34,028. Not Alabama.\n3. **September 19**: Ohio University, 19,186. No match.\n4. **October 3**: Army, 40,607. Not Alabama.\n5. **October 10**: UAB, 31,002. Still not Alabama.\n6. **October 17**: Opponent is Alabama, attendance is 80,079. Hmm, close but not exactly 81,079.\n7. **October 24**: Southern Miss, 24,020. No match.\n8. **October 31**: Houston, 26,821. Not the one.\n9. **November 5**: Cincinnati, 19,098. Nope.\n10. **November 14**: Louisville, 26,258. Doesn't fit.\n11. **November 21**: Memphis, attendance 16,052.

The rows are numbered from 0 to 12, I think. Wait, actually, the last row after the data is another row that says \"all times are in eastern,\" but that's probably a header or something else since it repeats in all columns.

Attendance here is 31,002.\nBut the claim says attendance is 33,002. So this doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in row numbers. Let me list all data rows with their details:\n\nRow indices might be from 0 to n-1 based on how they are presented. Wait, looking back, the table has 14 rows, but the last row (index 13) seems to have \"all times...\" repeated. So perhaps the actual game data is up to index 12.\n\nWait, no: the initial <tbody> starts with a single <tr> for each game, followed by another tr for the footer-like line. Let me recount:\n\nEach <tr> in the tbody is a row. The first tr after thead is the header, but then there are multiple rows for each game.\n\nWait, looking at the HTML structure:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    ... headers\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>...</tr> --> this is one game\n    <tr>...</tr> --> another\n    ...\n    <tr>...all times...</tr> --> last row.\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nSo, the last row (index let's say 13) has \"all times...\" repeated. So the actual data rows are from index 0 to 12.\n\nNow, looking for a row where opponent is UAB and attendance is 33,002.\n\nLooking through each data row:\n\nRow 0: opponent virginia tech\nRow1: chattanooga\nRow2: ohio\nRow3: army\nRow4: uab - opponent UAB, attendance 31,002\nRow5: uab again?

Therefore, the only occurrence of UAB as the opponent has attendance 31,002.\n\nSo, the claim says when attendance is 33,002, UAB is the opponent.

It seems the claim is stating that UAB is the opponent in a game played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.
