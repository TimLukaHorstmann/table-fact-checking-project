    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"mirielle dittmann be the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n- Opponent's name: Mirielle Dittmann\n- Surface: Hard\n- Date: 6 February 2000\n- Location: Wellington, New Zealand\n\nI need to find a row in the table that matches all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an event with details like outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Outcome is winner, date is 2 May 1999. Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 1**: Winner, 11 July 1999. No match.\n3. **Row 2**: Runner-up, 6 February 2000. Opponent is Mirielle Dittmann, location Wellington, hard surface. This matches all criteria except the outcome being runner-up instead of winner. However, the claim doesn't specify the outcome, only that she was the opponent. So this row is relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: Runner-up, 28 May 2000. Doesn't match.\n5. **Row 4**: Runner-up, 14 September 2003. No match.\n6. **Row 5**: Winner, 6 February 2005. Opponent is Mirielle Dittmann in Wellington on hard. This matches all criteria except the date is 2005 instead of 2000. Not a direct match but similar details.\n7. **Row 6**: Winner, 28 August 2005. Doesn't match.\n8. **Row 7**: Winner, 5 February 2006. Opponent is Natsumi Hamamura. Doesn't match.\n9. **Row 8**: Winner, 12 February 2006. Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 as opponent. No match.\n10. **Row 9**: Winner, 20 April 2008. Anna Lubinsky. Doesn't match.\n\nSo the relevant rows are row 2 and row 5. However, row 2 has an outcome of runner-up, while row 5 is a winner in 2005. The claim doesn't specify the outcome but mentions she was the opponent, so both rows might be considered because they show her as an opponent. But since the date in row 5 isn't 2000, only row 2 fully matches the date and location.\n\nWait, no. The claim specifies a specific date: 6 February 2000. Only row 2 has that date. So I should focus on row 2.\n\nIn row 2:\n- Opponent is Mirielle Dittmann.\n- Surface: hard.\n- Date: 6 February 2000.\n- Location: Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nAll conditions are met in this row. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row 2, column \"opponent in final\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data. The relevant cell confirms that Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in the final on a hard surface on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"on 2 may 1999, the surface be hard\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's stating that on a specific date (2 May 1999), the surface was hard. So I need to find out if there's an entry in the table for that date and whether the surface is indeed hard.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns include 'date', 'location', 'surface', among others. My task is to check if 2 May 1999 appears as a date in the table and then verify the corresponding 'surface' value.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the 'date' column for the exact date \"2 may 1999\". Going through each row:\n\n1. First row: 2 May 1999 - Yes, this matches.\n2. Next rows have dates like 11 July 1999, 6 February 2000, etc., but none else match 2 May 1999.\n\nSince only one row has the date \"2 may 1999\", I'll focus on that row. The 'surface' column for that row is 'hard', which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the opponent in final on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand on hard surface be katerina kramperov\u00e1.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nThe key elements are:\n1. Opponent in final\n2. Date: 6 February 2000\n3. Location: Wellington, New Zealand\n4. Surface: hard\n5. Name: Katerina Kramperov\u00e1\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table that matches all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n- The first row is May 1999, so not relevant.\n- Second row is July 1999, nope.\n- Third row: 6 February 2000. This matches the date.\n- Location for this row is Wellington, New Zealand. That's a match.\n- Surface is hard, which aligns.\n- Opponent in final is Mirielle Dittmann. Hmm, that's not Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the rest of the rows to ensure no other row matches all criteria except for the opponent name.\n\nNext rows after 6 February 2000 are:\n- 28 May 2000: different date.\n- 14 September 2003: different date and location.\n- 6 February 2005: Different date (2005 vs. 2000).\n- 28 August 2005: Different date.\n- 5 February 2006: Different opponent, same location but not the target date.\n- 12 February 2006: Same as above.\n- 20 April 2008: Different date and location.\n\nSo the only row that matches all except the opponent is the third row (row index 2). The opponent there is Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina. Therefore, the claim seems incorrect because the opponent in that final isn't Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me check if any other rows have Katerina as the opponent on 6 February 2000 in Wellington on hard surface. Looking through all rows, I don't see her name appearing except for row index 11 (6 February 2005), where she's the winner. But that's a different date.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 is the opponent in final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington with hard surface. So the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to an opponent in a final match on a specific date, location, and surface. After checking each row of the table, none matches all the specified criteria except for the opponent's name being incorrect. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the surface be grass on 2 may 1999",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the surface be grass on 2 may 1999\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that on May 2, 1999, the surface was grass. So I need to check if there's an entry in the table for that specific date where the surface is grass.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. The surface column seems directly related to the claim because it specifies what type of court surface was used.\n\nNow, I'll scan through each row to find the one that matches May 2, 1999. Let's go row by row:\n\n1. First row: date is May 2, 1999. That's exactly the date we're looking for.\n2. Next rows have dates in July 1999, February and May 2000, September 2003, etc., so none of them match May 2, 1999.\n\nSo the first relevant row is index 0 (assuming the rows start from 0). The surface column for this row has a value of \"hard\". Wait, that's not grass. So does that mean the claim is FALSE?\n\nHold on, maybe I should double-check if there are any other relevant cells. Let me see: the date in question is May 2, 1999, so only row 0 matches. The surface there is hard court, not grass. Therefore, the surface wasn't grass on that date.\n\nWait another thought: Could \"surface\" sometimes refer to something else? But in tennis, it typically refers to the type of court surface, like clay, grass, or hard. So if the surface is hard, then it's definitely not grass.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim says the surface was grass on May 2, 1999, but the table shows the surface was hard on that date. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the surface be grass on 2 may 1999,\" we need to check if there's a matching row in the table with that date and surface type.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: Only the first row has the date May 2, 1999.\n2. **Check the surface type**: The surface for this row is \"hard\", not grass.\n\nSince the surface wasn't grass on that date, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
