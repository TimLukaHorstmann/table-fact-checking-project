    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part talks about a girl singles player being Lindaweni Fanetri. The second part mentions that in the same year, the mixed doubles pair is Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nSo, my task is to check each year in the table to see if both these conditions are met in the same row.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010. For each year, I'll check the 'girls singles' column for Lindaweni Fanetri and the 'mixed doubles' column for Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one:\n\n- **2001**: Girls singles are Maria Kristin Yulianti and boys singles are Hendra Setiawan. Mixed doubles are Hendra Setiawan and Greysia Polii. No match here.\n  \n- **2002**: Girls singles is Fransisca Ratnasari, not Lindaweni. Boys singles is Ujang Suherlan Yoga Ukikasah. Mixed doubles are Muhammad Rijal Meiliana Jauhari, which doesn't match.\n\n- **2003**: Girls singles is Wiwis Meilyanna. No match. Mixed doubles are Fran Kurniawan Yulianti, not the pair in question.\n\n- **2004**: Girls singles is Pia Zebadiah. No match. Mixed doubles are Lingga Lie Yulianti.\n\n- **2005**: Girls singles is Bellaetrix Manuputty. No match. Mixed doubles are Abdul Rahman Richi Puspita Dili.\n\n- **2006**: Girls singles is Sylvinna Kurniawan. Mixed doubles are Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto. Wait, that's close, but the mixed doubles here might not be Wifqi Windarto and Debby. Let me check.\n\nWait, in 2007: girls singles is Lindaweni Fanetri! So let's see:\n\n- **2007**: Girls singles is Lindaweni Fanetri. Now check the mixed doubles column for that row. It says Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo, in 2007, both conditions are met: Lindaweni is playing girls singles, and Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta are in mixed doubles. Therefore, the claim is true for that year.\n\nI should also make sure there's no other row where both conditions are true, but looking through each year again, 2007 is the only one with Lindaweni in girls singles and Wifqi/Debby in mixed doubles together.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I identified the relevant cells by checking for Lindaweni Fanetri in the 'girls singles' column and Wifqi Windarto & Debby Susanta in the 'mixed doubles' column. These are found in the 2007 row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim. It says: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia , the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim is asserting. The claim mentions two specific players in doubles matches: a female player named Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia and male players Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita. It seems to suggest that when Ayu is playing in the girl's double, Jones and Dandi are her partners on the boy's double side.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any row in the table where both these conditions are met. So, I'll look for a year, then check each corresponding row to see if it includes both Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia in the girl's doubles and Jones Ralfy Jansen along with Dandi Prabudita in the boy's doubles.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010. I'll go through each row one by one to see if any match the claim.\n\nStarting with 2001: The girl's double is Lilyana Natsir Natalia Poluakan and mixed doubles are Hendra Setiawan Greysia Polii. No match here.\n\n2002: Girl's double is Purwati Meiliana Jauhari, no. Boy's doubles have Ujang Suherlan Yoga Ukikasah, no.\n\n2003: Girl's doubles Pia Zebadiah Nitya Krishinda Maheswari and mixed doubles Fran Kurniawan Yulianti. Not matching.\n\n2004: Girl's double is Pia Zebadiah, which matches part of the claim. Now check boy's doubles: Aditya DwI Putra I Made Agung. That doesn't include Jones Ralfy Jansen or Dandi Prabudita. So no match here.\n\n2005: Girl's singles Bellaetrix Manuputty, not matching Ayu. Boy's doubles Rio Willianto Davin Prawidssa, no match.\n\n2006: Girl's double is Bellaetrix Manuputty Samantha Lintang. Mixed doubles Danny Bawa Chrisnanta Debby Susanto. Not matching.\n\n2007: Girl's singles Lindaweni Fanetri. No.\n\n2008: Girl's double Suci Rizki Andini Tiara Rosalia Nuraidah, no.\n\n2009: Girl's double Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia! Now checking boy's doubles: Jones Ralfy Jansen Dandi Prabudita. Yes, that matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo in 2009, the girl's doubles are Ayu Pratiwi and Suci Rizki Andini Tiara Rosalia Nuraidah, but wait, no. Wait, the table for 2009 shows:\n\n<td>2009</td>\n<td>riyanto subagja</td>\n<td>ana rovita</td>\n<td>jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita</td>\n<td>ayu pratiwi anggi widia</td>\n<td>didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu</td>\n\nWait, the girl's doubles column for 2009 is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia. And the boy's doubles are Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\nSo yes, in row 8 (assuming rows start at index 0), which would be row_index 8, the columns are 'girl double' and 'boy double'. Wait no, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the table's structure: each row has 'year', then girl's double, boy's double, mixed doubles. So for 2009, the girl's double is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia, and the boy's double is Jones Ralfy Jansen Dandi Prabudita.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by this row.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"girl double\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boy double\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"in 2006 , the mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto and the boy single be nugroho andi saputro\".\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with headers for year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. The rows correspond to different years from 2001 to 2010.\n\nI need to focus on the year 2006. So, I should find the row where the year is 2006. Scanning through the table, I see that the sixth row (index 5) has the year 2006.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Mixed doubles in 2006: danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanta.\n2. Boys singles in 2006: nugroho andi saputro.\n\nI'll check each part against the table.\n\nStarting with mixed doubles. In the 2006 row, under mixed doubles, the name is written as \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto\". The claim says \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanta\" (ending with susanta). Wait, in the table, it's susanto. So there might be a typo here. However, I need to check exactly what's written in the table.\n\nLooking again: In 2006, mixed doubles are listed as \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto\". The claim has \"debby susanta\", which is different from \"debby susanto\". So there's a discrepancy here. This might make the claim FALSE, but I should verify both parts before concluding.\n\nNext, boys singles in 2006: The claim says nugroho andi saputro. In the 2006 row, under boys singles, it's written as \"nugroho andi saputro\". So that matches exactly.\n\nSo mixed doubles has a slight difference (last name spelling), but boys singles match perfectly. If the claim requires both parts to be correct for it to be TRUE, then since mixed doubles don't fully match, it would be FALSE. But I should check if the claim is exact or if it allows for minor differences.\n\nWait, perhaps the last names are spelled slightly differently. In the table, it's \"susanto\", and in the claim, it's \"susanta\". Are these the same? Maybe they're different people. Or maybe it's a typo. Without more context, it's hard to say, but I think they're different. So the mixed doubles part doesn't match exactly.\n\nTherefore, while boys singles are correct, the mixed doubles have a discrepancy. Since both parts of the claim need to be accurate for it to be TRUE, this would make the overall claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2006, the mixed doubles were Danny Bawa Chrisnanta Debby Susanta and the boys singles were Nugroho Andi Saputro. \n\nChecking the table:\n- In 2006, boys singles are indeed Nugroho Andi Saputro, matching the claim.\n- However, mixed doubles in the table are listed as \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto\", which is slightly different from the claim's \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanta\". This discrepancy suggests a possible typo or different individual.\n\nSince the boys singles match but mixed doubles don't fully align, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Mixed double\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Boy single\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"in 2007 , the girl double be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati and the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto\". I need to check if this statement is accurate based on the provided HTML table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows representing years from 2001 to 2010. Each row has several columns: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. The claim is about the year 2007, so I should focus on that specific row.\n\nI'll start by locating the 2007 row in the table. Scanning through, the fifth row (row index 6) has the year 2007. Now, let's examine each part of the claim against this row.\n\nThe first part mentions \"the girl double be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\". In the table, the column for girls doubles is likely where female doubles players are listed. Looking at the 2007 row, under \"girls doubles\" we see \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati\". That matches exactly with the claim's first part, so that checks out.\n\nNext, the second part of the claim states \"the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto\". In the table, the \"mixed doubles\" column for 2007 lists \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\". This also matches perfectly with the claim's second part.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by the corresponding cells in the 2007 row, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones for \"girls doubles\" and \"mixed doubles\" in that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"in 2010 , the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia and the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita\". So, the claim is making two statements. One about the girl's doubles player in 2010 being Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia, and another about the boys' doubles team consisting of Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I see that it's an HTML table with columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010. \n\nSince the claim is about 2010, I need to check the row where the year is 2010. Let me find that row. Scanning through the table, the last row before 2010 might be 2009, so looking for the 2010 row. Yes, here it is:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>2010</td>\n  <td>shesar hiren rhustavito</td>\n  <td>ganis nur rahmadani</td>\n  <td>jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita</td>\n  <td>aris budiharti dian fitriani</td>\n  <td>jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico</td>\n</tr>\n\nAlright, so let's analyze the columns relevant to the claim. The claim mentions \"girl double\" and \"boy double\". In the table, these correspond to the girls doubles and boys doubles columns.\n\nLooking at the 2010 row:\n\n- Girls doubles: aris budiharti dian fitriani\n- Boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\n\nNow, let's check the claim against this data. The claim states that the girl double is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia. However, in the 2010 row, the girls doubles are aris budiharti and dian fitriani, not Ayu Pratiwi. So this part of the claim doesn't match.\n\nNext, regarding the boys doubles, the claim says it's Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita. Looking at the 2010 row, the boys doubles are indeed listed as jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita. So this part is correct.\n\nBut since the girl doubles part of the claim doesn't align with the table data, the overall claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to identify which specific cells in the table support or disprove the claim. For the boys doubles, it's the cell in 2010 row under boys doubles column. However, since the girl doubles part is incorrect, that cell doesn't support the claim either.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider whether any cells are relevant at all. Since one part of the claim is correct and another is not, perhaps only the boys doubles cell is relevant because it's correct, while the girls doubles isn't. However, since the overall claim is false, both cells related to 2010 for girls and boys might be considered.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should list all relevant cells that check against the claim. So in this case, the two relevant columns are 'girls doubles' and 'boys doubles' for the 2010 year. Because the claim refers to both, even though one is correct and the other isn't.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The user's example shows that if a condition is not met, then it's false, but I need to indicate which cells are relevant regardless of whether they support or contradict the claim. So for verification, I should check all cells related to the claim. Therefore, in 2010, both girls doubles and boys doubles cells are relevant because the claim refers to both.\n\nSo, the answer is \"FALSE\" because the girl's doubles player doesn't match, but the boys' doubles do. However, since part of the claim is incorrect, it's overall false. The relevant cells are the 2010 row for girls doubles and boys doubles columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the 2010 girl double not matching the table data makes the overall statement false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"girls_doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"boys_doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta after the year 2007\". So, the claim is making two assertions:\n\n1. There exists a row where the 'girls singles' column has Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. In that same row, the 'mixed doubles' column has Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nAnd this should be after the year 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by checking each row for the 'girls singles' entry to see if Lindaweni Fanetri is present. Then, in that same row, check the 'mixed doubles' column for Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nI'll go through each row starting from 2007 onwards since the claim mentions \"after the year 2007\". The years after 2007 are 2008, 2009, 2010. I don't need to check before 2007 because the claim specifies after that year.\n\nLet's check each relevant year:\n\n- **2007**: The 'girls singles' column has Lindaweni Fanetri. Wait, no, looking at the table, in 2007 under 'girls singles', it says Lindaweni Fanetri? Let me double-check. Oh yes, row for 2007: \"lindaweni fanetri\" is indeed there.\n\nNow, check the 'mixed doubles' column for that same row (row index 6). The entry is \"wifqi windarto debby susanta\". So, Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta are listed as the mixed doubles pair. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure if this row is after 2007. Oh no, 2007 is the year itself. The claim says \"after the year 2007\", which might mean strictly after 2007, like 2008 onwards. But the problem is that the table includes 2007 as well. So, does Lindaweni Fanetri and Wifqi Windarto/Debby Susanta appear together in a row where the year is after 2007?\n\nBut wait, in 2007, the year is exactly 2007, not after it. So if the claim specifies \"after the year 2007\", we need to look at rows for years 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n\nWait, but Lindaweni Fanetri is only listed in 2007. Let me confirm:\n\n- **2007**: Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri\n- **2008**: Girls singles: Ana Rovita\n- **2009**: Girls singles: Ana Rovita\n- **2010**: Girls singles: Ganis Nur Rahmadani\n\nSo, Lindaweni Fanetri is only in 2007. Therefore, the row where she appears is 2007, which is not after 2007 but exactly in 2007.\n\nBut the claim says \"after the year 2007\". So perhaps it's looking for a time period beyond 2007. If so, then Lindaweni Fanetri doesn't appear again in later years. Therefore, the 'girls singles' column does not have her after 2007.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting \"after the year 2007\". It could include 2007 itself. Let me check the table structure again.\n\nLooking at the table, rows are for each year starting from 1999 up to 2010. So row index 6 is 2007. The claim says after 2007, so maybe including 2008 onwards? But Lindaweni Fanetri isn't in those later years.\n\nWait no, let me clarify: the 'year' in the table's rows is the year of the event, I assume. So each row represents a specific year, with various players that year.\n\nSo the claim says that after 2007 (so starting from 2008 onwards), when the girl single is Lindaweni Fanetri, which never happens again because she only appears in 2007. Therefore, there's no such row where Lindaweni Fanetri is the 'girls singles' and it's after 2007.\n\nAlternatively, if \"after the year 2007\" includes 2007 itself, then Lindaweni Fanetri is in 2007, but that would be the same year as specified. However, typically, \"after\" implies a later point in time, so strictly after 2007, meaning 2008 onwards.\n\nTherefore, since Lindaweni Fanetri only appears in 2007, and there are no entries for her in any years after 2007, the claim's first condition is not met. Thus, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a girl single named Lindaweni Fanetri was paired with Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta in mixed doubles after the year 2007. By examining the table:\n\n1. **Check for Lindaweni Fanetri**: She appears only in the 2007 row under 'girls singles'.\n2. **Check for Wifqi Windarto/Debby Susanta**: In the same 2007 row, the mixed doubles are indeed listed as \"wifqi windarto debby susanta\".\n\nHowever, since the claim specifies \"after the year 2007,\" we need to check years after 2007. Lindaweni Fanetri does not appear in any subsequent years (2008, 2009, 2010). Therefore, her participation is only in 2007, making the condition of being after 2007 unfulfilled.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Lindaweni Fanetri's participation was not after 2007. No relevant cells meet the criteria beyond 2007.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in 2009 , the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" Wait, that might not make much sense. Let me parse it again.\n\nI think the claim is trying to say two things for 2009. One part mentions \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\" in the mixed doubles, which seems correct because looking at the 2009 row under mixed doubles, I see \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\" So that part checks out.\n\nThe second part says \"hernmansyah be the boy single.\" Wait, but looking at the boys singles column for 2009, the name listed is \"riyanto subagja,\" not hermansyah. Hermonsyah appears in the boys singles for 2008, but not in 2009.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The claim says \"the mixed double consists of didit juang... and hermansyah be the boy single.\" So it's pairing hermansyah as a boy single with someone else? But looking at the table, in 2009, under boys singles, it's riyanto subagja, not hermonsyah. And in the mixed doubles, it's didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\n\nSo the claim is combining two different people: one for mixed doubles and another for boys singles. But it seems like they might have confused the names. So the part about hermansyah being a boy single isn't correct because he was in 2008, not 2009.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim meant that in 2009, both didit juang... and hermansyah are involved in mixed doubles, but no, looking at the table, the 2009 row's mixed doubles has only one name, so it's just didit. Hermonsyah was in the boys singles for 2008.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me read it again: \"the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" Maybe it's trying to say that the mixed doubles are between didit and someone else (hernmansyah?), but no, h doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's a mistake. Because in 2009, the boys singles is riyanto subagja, so hermonsyah isn't there. So the claim is incorrect because it says hermonsyah is the boy single in 2009, which he wasn't\u2014he was in 2008 and 2009's mixed doubles.\n\nWait no, wait: Let me check the table again. For 2009, boys singles is riyanto subagja, not hermonsyah. Hermonsyah was in 2008 as a boy single, but not in 2009. So the claim incorrectly states that hermonsyah is the boy single for 2009.\n\nSo to verify the claim, I need to check two things: mixed doubles and boys singles for 2009.\n\nIn the table, row 2009 has:\n\n- Boys singles: riyanto subagja\n- Mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nThe claim says that in 2009, mixed double is between didit... and hermansyah as boy single. So for mixed doubles, it's correct because the name matches. For boys singles, it's incorrect because the person is riyanto subagja.\n\nWait, but the claim might be mixing up the two. It says \"the mixed double consists of didit...\" which is correct, and then \"hernmansyah be the boy single.\" So maybe it's incorrectly pairing hermonsyah with someone else? Or perhaps it's saying that in 2009, both the boys singles and mixed doubles involve those names.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the mixed double consists of didit... and hermansyah be the boy single.\" That might mean that in the mixed doubles, there are two people: didit and hermansyah. But looking at the table, the 2009 row's mixed doubles only lists one name: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because it suggests that hermonsyah is part of the mixed doubles in 2009 when he isn't\u2014he was in boys singles in 2008 but not in 2009. Or perhaps it's trying to pair him with didit, which isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me parse it again: \"the mixed double consists of didit... and hermansyah be the boy single.\" So the mixed doubles are between two people, one of whom is didit, and the other is hermansyah? But in the table, the 2009 mixed doubles only have didit.\n\nSo that would make the claim incorrect because hermonsyah isn't part of the 2009 mixed doubles. He was a boy single in 2008 but not in 2009.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says that in 2009, the mixed doubles consist of didit and someone else (hernmansyah as a boy single). But looking at the table, in 2009's mixed doubles, it's only didit. So hermonsyah isn't part of it.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it includes hermonsyah in the mixed doubles for 2009 when he was actually only in boys singles in 2008 and not in mixed doubles in 2009.\n\nSo to check this, I need to look at the relevant cells:\n\n- For 2009 (row index 8), check the mixed_doubles column: it's didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu. So that part is correct.\n- Then, the claim also mentions hermonsyah as a boy single. Looking at the boys_singles column for row 2009 (index 8), it's riyanto subagja, not hermonsyah.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly states that in 2009, the mixed doubles include hermonsyah as a boy single, which is wrong. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting again. Maybe the claim meant that in 2009, both didit and hermansyah are involved as singles and doubles. But in reality, didit was only in mixed doubles, and hermonsyah wasn't a single in 2009. So that's incorrect.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to check would be:\n\n- For row 8 (2009), column boys_singles: riyanto subagja.\n- For row 8, column mixed_doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\n\nSo the claim is wrong because it says hermonsyah was a boy single in 2009 when he wasn't. Therefore, answer is FALSE and the relevant cells are those two.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys_singles\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed_doubles\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 2010 , when mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta and debby susanto , the boy single be nugroho andi saputro\"\n\nI need to check two main points from this claim:\n\n1. In 2010, the mixed doubles were played by Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto.\n2. In the same year (2010), the boys' singles were won by Nugroho Andi Saputro.\n\nSo, I'll start by examining the table for the year 2010 because the claim specifies that these events occurred in that year.\n\nLooking at the table's row for 2010:\n\n- Boys Singles: shesar hiren rhustavito\n- Girls Singles: ganis nur rahmadani\n- Boys Doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\n- Girls Doubles: aris budiharti dian fitriani\n- Mixed Doubles: jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim against this row.\n\nFirst part of the claim: In 2010, mixed doubles were Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto. Looking at the mixed doubles column for 2010, the players are Jones Ralfy Jansen and Nurbeta Kwanrico. There's no mention of Danny Bawa Chrisnanta or Debby Susanta there. So this part doesn't seem to match.\n\nSecond part: Boys singles were won by Nugroho Andi Saputro. Checking the boys singles column for 2010, the winner is shesar hiren rhustavito, not Nugroho Andi Saputro.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't align with the data in the table. The relevant cells to check are the mixed doubles and boys singles columns for the year 2010.\n</think>\n\nThe claim fails because the mixed doubles participants and boys' singles winner in 2010 do not match the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"in 2009 , when the girl double be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts and figure out which cells in the table are relevant.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific players: Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati and Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto. It talks about both being part of the girl's doubles and mixed doubles teams, respectively, in 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, and each column corresponds to different types of doubles: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nI'll start by locating Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati in the table. Scanning the 'girls doubles' column for 2009, I find her name in row 2009 under 'girls doubles'. That's one relevant cell: year 2009, girls doubles.\n\nNext, looking at Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanta in the mixed doubles column for 2009. I check the 'mixed doubles' column and see that in row 2009, the mixed doubles entry is indeed \"wifqi windarto debby susanta.\" That's another relevant cell: year 2009, mixed doubles.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that both parts of the claim are correctly supported by the table. The claim states that Anneke was part of the girl's doubles team in 2009, which matches her presence in the girls doubles column for that row. Similarly, Wifqi being in the mixed doubles pair aligns with the mixed doubles column data.\n\nI should also verify that there are no discrepancies or errors in the table entries. For example, making sure that the names correspond correctly to their respective columns and years. Since both players are listed under their respective categories in 2009, the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim is supported by the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
