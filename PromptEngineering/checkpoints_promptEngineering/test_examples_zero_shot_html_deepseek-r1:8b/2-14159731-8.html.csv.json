Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The task is to find out if \"montreal\" is listed as the visitor on March 6th.\n\nI should start by finding the row for March 6. Scanning through the rows, I see that the first data row starts with \"march 1\". Each subsequent row increases the date by a day, so March 6 should be one of these entries.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- March 1: visitor is Philadelphia\n- March 2: NY Rangers\n- March 4: Philadelphia\n- March 6: Montreal\n\nYes, on March 6, the visitor is listed as \"montreal\". That seems to support the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if this information directly supports the claim. The claim says \"montreal be the visitor on march 6\", so the relevant cell is the 'visitor' column for that date.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other possible confusion. For example, could March 6 have multiple entries? Looking at the table, each row corresponds to a single date, so March 6 only appears once.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that \"montreal\" is spelled correctly in the visitor column. Checking the cell, it's indeed \"montreal\", which matches the claim.\n\nSo, putting this together, the relevant cells are the 'visitor' column on row_index 5 (since March 6 is the sixth entry, starting from row 0). Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant_cells should point to that specific cell.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"before march 6 montreal be the visitor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that before March 6, Montreal was the visitor. So I'm looking for any entries in the table where the date is before March 6 and the visitor is Montreal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision, attendance, and record. My focus here is on the 'date' and 'visitor' columns.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if there's a date before March 6 where the visitor is Montreal. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- March 1: Visitor is Philadelphia\n- March 2: NY Rangers\n- March 4: Philadelphia\n- March 6: That's the date in question, but the claim is about before March 6, so I shouldn't include this.\n\nWait, the next row after March 6 is March 8. So before March 6, we have rows up to March 6? No, because each subsequent row increases the date. So before March 6 would be all rows with dates earlier than March 6.\n\nSo let me list out the dates:\n- March 1\n- March 2\n- March 4\n- March 6\n\nNow, check each of these for the visitor being Montreal.\n\nLooking at the 'visitor' column for these rows:\n- March 1: Philadelphia\n- March 2: NY Rangers\n- March 4: Philadelphia\nNone of these have Montreal as the visitor. \n\nWait, but the claim is about \"before march 6 montreal be the visitor.\" So before March 6, meaning on dates earlier than March 6. But in all rows before March 6, the visitors are not Montreal.\n\nTherefore, there's no data supporting the claim that before March 6, Montreal was the visitor. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should identify which cells to check. The relevant_cells would be any row where date is before March 6 and visitor is Montreal. But since none of them have Montreal as the visitor, maybe only rows up to March 6 are relevant. Alternatively, perhaps all rows where date is before March 6 need to be checked for visitor being Montreal.\n\nWait, but in this case, no such rows exist. So I think the relevant cells are all rows where date is before March 6 and visitor is Montreal. But since none have that combination, it's still FALSE.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's no evidence of Montreal being the visitor before March 6.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any row with a date before March 6 has \"montreal\" listed as the visitor. By examining each relevant row, none meet this condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
