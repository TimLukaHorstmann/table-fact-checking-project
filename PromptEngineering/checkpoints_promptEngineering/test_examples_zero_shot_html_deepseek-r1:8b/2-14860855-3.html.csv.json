    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"in 1989 , hb - honda have the most win of any year with 2.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's stating that in 1989, the team \"hb - honda\" has the highest number of wins compared to other teams in that year, and their wins total 2.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to focus on the relevant columns: year, class, team, points, and wins. The claim specifically mentions 1989 and \"hb - honda,\" so I should find the row for 1989 and \"hb - honda.\"\n\nI'll go through each row in the tbody:\n\n1. 1979: Yamaha, 0 wins.\n2. 1980: Yamaha, 0 wins.\n3. 1982: Yamaha, 0 wins; Suzuki, 0 wins.\n4. 1982: Yamaha, 0 wins; Suzuki, 0 wins.\n5. 1983: Yamaha, 0 wins.\n6. 1984: Honda, 0 wins.\n7. 1985: Romer-Juchem, 0 wins.\n8. 1986: Honda-Honda, 0 wins.\n9. 1987: Honda-Honda, 1 win.\n10. 1988: Honda-Honda, 0 wins.\n11. 1989: Honda-Honda, 2 wins.\n12. 1990: Honda-Honda, 0 wins.\n\nSo, in 1989, \"hb - honda\" has 2 wins. Now, I need to check if this is the most among all teams for that year. Let's see other rows for 1989. Wait, the only row for 1989 is the one with \"hb - honda,\" so no other team had any wins in 1989. Therefore, \"hb - honda\" indeed have the highest number of wins (2) for that year.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other teams in 1989. The table only lists 11 rows from 1979 to 1990. Each row corresponds to a specific combination of year and class. So, in 1989, under \"250cc,\" the team is \"hb - honda\" with 2 wins. There's no other team for 1989 because all other classes might be different years or teams.\n\nTherefore, since there are no other teams in 1989 with any wins, \"hb - honda\" has the most wins (which is 2) that year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as \"hb - honda\" had the highest number of wins (2) in 1989 with no other teams having wins that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 1989, hb - honda have the most point of any year with 190.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and focus on 1989. The relevant columns are 'year', 'class', 'team', 'points', and 'wins'. Since the claim is about 1989, I should find the row where the year is 1989.\n\nLooking through the table, there's a row for 1989 in the 8th row (row index 8 if we start counting from 0). The columns I need to check are 'points' and maybe 'wins', but since points are higher, they're more relevant here. \n\nIn that 1989 row, under 'points', it says 190. Now, I need to check if this is the highest points in any year mentioned in the table. So I should look at all other rows to see if any have a higher point value.\n\nGoing through each row:\n- 1979: Yamaha with 3 points\n- 1980: Yamaha with 4 points\n- 1982: Yamaha with 4 points and Suzuki with 0\n- 1983: Yamaha with 14 points\n- 1984: Honda with 14 points\n- 1985: Romer-Juchem with 29 points\n- 1986: HB-Honda with 10 points\n- 1987: HB-Honda with 108 points\n- 1988: HB-Honda with 158 points\n- 1990: HB-Honda with 52 points\n\nLooking at these, the highest points in any year are:\n- 1985: 29 points (Romer-Juchem)\n- 1987: 108 points (HB-Honda)\n- 1988: 158 points (HB-Honda)\n- 1989: 190 points (HB-Honda)\n\nSo, HB-Honda's points in 1989 are indeed the highest among all years listed. No other year has more than 190 points.\n\nAlso, checking for any typos or errors: The team name is \"hb - honda\" which seems correct. The points for 1989 are correctly stated as 190.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because in 1989, HB-Honda had the highest points with 190.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"team suzuki in 1982 be the only listed team to score zero point.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any entries related to Suzuki in 1982. The table has a column called 'team' and another called 'points'. \n\nLooking at each row:\n- 1979: Yamaha, points=3\n- 1980: Yamaha, points=4\n- 1982: Yamaha, points=4\n- Next is Suzuki in 1982 with points=0.\n- Then other years follow.\n\nSo the Suzuki team in 1982 indeed has 0 points. Now, I need to check if they're the only team listed that scored zero points in 1982. Wait, the claim says \"team suzuki in 1982 be the only listed team to score zero point.\" So does any other team have zero points in 1982?\n\nLooking at 1982 rows:\n- The first three rows are before 1982. Then the fourth row is Suzuki with 0 points. In 1983, Yamaha has 14 points, and in 1984, Honda has 14 points. So no other teams in 1982 have zero points.\n\nTherefore, Suzuki is the only team listed with zero points in 1982.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Suzuki is the sole team with zero points in 1982.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"hb - honda be the most listed team with a total of 5 time\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim. It says that the team \"hb - honda\" is the most listed and that they have a total of 5 wins. So I need to check two things: whether \"hb - honda\" appears more times than any other team in the table and whether their total wins add up to 5.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine each row's 'team' column to see which teams are listed and how many times each appears. The table has multiple rows:\n\n1. 1979: yamaha\n2. 1980: yamaha\n3. 1982: yamaha\n4. 1982: suzuki\n5. 1983: yamaha\n6. 1984: honda\n7. 1985: romer - juchem\n8. 1986: hb - honda\n9. 1987: hb - honda\n10. 1988: hb - honda\n11. 1989: hb - honda\n12. 1990: hb - honda\n\nSo, I'll count how many times each team appears:\n\n- yamaha: 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983 \u2192 that's 4 times.\n- suzuki: once in 1982.\n- honda: 1984 and possibly others? Wait, looking again, the 'team' column for 1986 to 1990 shows \"hb - honda\" as the team. Honda itself only appears once in 1984.\n\nWait, but \"hb - honda\" seems to be a single entity here, not separate from Honda. So I think \"hb - honda\" is another name or a different team associated with Honda. So the teams are:\n\n- yamaha\n- suzuki\n- romer - juchem\n- hb - honda\n\nNow, counting each occurrence in the 'team' column:\n\n- yamaha: 4 times\n- hb - honda: from 1986 to 1990, that's 5 times (rows 8,9,10,11,12). Wait, no, rows start at 0. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at row indices starting from 0:\n\nRow 0: yamaha\nRow 1: yamaha\nRow 2: yamaha\nRow 3: suzuki\nRow 4: yamaha\nRow 5: honda (1984)\nRow 6: romer - juchem\nRow 7: hb - honda\nRow 8: hb - honda\nRow 9: hb - honda\nRow 10: hb - honda\nRow 11: hb - honda\nRow 12: hb - honda\n\nWait, no. The rows are from 1979 (row 0) to 1990 (row 12). So \"hb - honda\" starts at row 7 (1986) and continues through row 12 (1990), that's 6 times? Let me count:\n\nRow 7: hb - honda\nRow 8: hb - honda\nRow 9: hb - honda\nRow 10: hb - honda\nRow 11: hb - honda\nRow 12: hb - honda\n\nThat's 6 rows, so \"hb - honda\" appears 6 times.\n\nWait, but I think the initial count was from row 7 to 12, which is 6 instances. So that would make \"hb - honda\" appear more than any other team. Yamaha has 4 times, suzuki once, romer-juchem once, and Honda only once (row5).\n\nSo \"hb - honda\" is indeed the most listed team with 6 occurrences.\n\nNow, checking the second part of the claim: does \"hb - honda\" have a total of 5 wins? Let's look at the 'wins' column for each occurrence of \"hb - honda\".\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 7 (1986): wins=0\nRow8: 0\nRow9:1\nRow10:0\nRow11:2\nRow12:0\n\nSo, adding up their wins: 0+0+1+0+2+0 = 3. That's a total of 3 wins, not 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while \"hb - honda\" is indeed the most listed team (6 times), they do not have a total of 5 wins; they have only 3.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"in 1989 , hb - honda have the least win of any year with 0\". \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to 1989 in the table. Scanning through the 'year' column, I find that 1989 is indeed one of the rows. So, the relevant cell is the one where year=1989.\n\nNext, I check the 'wins' column for that particular row. The value listed under 'wins' for 1989 is 2. Now, the claim says that in 1989, hb - honda had \"0\" wins, which contradicts what's shown here because it actually has 2 wins.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the table. Let me double-check. The row for 1989 shows 'wins' as 2, but the claim says 0. That means the claim is incorrect. But perhaps I should look at other teams or years to see if there's another team with 0 wins in 1989.\n\nLooking through all the rows for 1989, it seems only hb - honda has a win count of 2. All other teams either have 0 or more wins. So, no other team had 0 wins in 1989.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because hb - honda actually had 2 wins in 1989, not 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1989, hb - honda had the least number of wins with 0.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The claim says, \"in 1988 , hb - honda have the most point of any year with 190.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions the year 1988, specifically pointing out \"hb - honda\" as the team having the highest points that year with 190 points.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to locate the row for 1988 and see the points column for \"hb - honda\". The table has several rows, each representing a different year. I'll go through each row until I find 1988.\n\nStarting from the top, the first row is 1979, then 1980, 1982, 1982 again, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and finally 1988. The 1988 row has the year as 1988 in the first column. \n\nNext, I look at the \"team\" column for that row, which is \"hb - honda\". In the points column, it shows 158. Hmm, wait, but the claim says they had 190 points in 1988. That doesn't match. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me double-check the 1989 row because I see that in 1989, \"hb - honda\" has 190 points. Oh, so perhaps the claim is referring to 1989 instead of 1988. But the claim specifically says 1988, so that would make it false.\n\nBut wait again, let me confirm. The table for 1988 shows \"hb - honda\" with 158 points. In 1989, they have 190 points, which is the highest in that year. So if the claim says in 1988 they had 190, that's incorrect because it was actually 158.\n\nSo the claim is false. Now, to find the relevant cells: I need the row index for 1988 and the points column. From the table, the first data row is index 0 (1979), then 1 (1980), 2 (1982), 3 (1982 again?), wait no, each <tr> is a separate row. Let's count them.\n\nThe rows are numbered from 0 as follows:\n\n0: 1979\n1: 1980\n2: 1982\n3: 1982 again? Wait, looking at the table, after 1980 comes another 1982, so that would be row index 2 for 1982. Then row 3 is also 1982, but different class and team. So each <tr> is a separate row. Therefore, 1988 is the ninth row if I count correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list them out with their indices:\n\n- Row 0: 1979\n- Row 1: 1980\n- Row 2: 1982\n- Row 3: 1982 (same year, different data)\n- Row 4: 1983\n- Row 5: 1984\n- Row 6: 1985\n- Row 7: 1986\n- Row 8: 1987\n- Row 9: 1988\n\nYes, so the row index for 1988 is 9. The points for that row are 158 in the \"points\" column.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the row where year=1988 and the points column to check the number of points they had, which was 158, not 190. Therefore, the claim's assertion about 190 points is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be false, and the relevant cells are row index 9 (for 1988) and the \"points\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It claims that every team in the table has scored a minimum of 1 point.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows each representing different years, classes, teams, points, and wins. My task is to check each row's \"points\" column to see if any team has scored less than 1 point.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **1979**: Yamaha 350cc - Points: 3. That's more than 1.\n2. **1980**: Yamaha 250cc - Points: 4. Also above 1.\n3. **1982**: Yamaha 250cc - Points: 4. Okay, still good.\n4. **1982**: Suzuki 500cc - Points: 0. Hmm, that's a problem because it's exactly 0. So this team didn't score any points. That might make the claim false because not all teams scored at least 1 point.\n5. **1983**: Yamaha 250cc - Points: 14. Good.\n6. **1984**: Honda 500cc - Points: 14. Also good.\n7. **1985**: Romer-Juchem 250cc - Points: 29. Okay, that's fine.\n8. **1986**: HB-Honda 250cc - Points: 10. Good.\n9. **1987**: HB-Honda 250cc - Points: 108. That's a lot.\n10. **1988**: HB-Honda 250cc - Points: 158. Still good.\n11. **1989**: HB-Honda 250cc - Points: 190. Fine.\n12. **1990**: HB-Honda 250cc - Points: 52. Good.\n\nSo, looking at all these points, only the Suzuki team in 1982 has a points column with 0. That means not every team scored at least 1 point. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key here is that the \"points\" column must be checked for each row where the value is less than 1. In this case, only the Suzuki 500cc in 1982 has 0 points. So, I should include that specific cell as the relevant one.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE with the relevant cell being row index 3 (since it's the fourth row in 0-based indexing) and column \"points\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"hb - honda be the most listed team , be in more than half of the list.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that the team \"hb - honda\" appears more frequently in the table than any other team and does so in more than half of the rows.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to count how many times each team appears. The teams listed are: yamaha, suzuki, honda (as hb - honda), romer - juchem, and possibly others. \n\nI'll list out all the team names:\n\n1. 1979: yamaha\n2. 1980: yamaha\n3. 1982: yamaha\n4. 1982: suzuki\n5. 1983: yamaha\n6. 1984: honda (hb - honda)\n7. 1985: romer - juchem\n8. 1986: hb - honda\n9. 1987: hb - honda\n10. 1988: hb - honda\n11. 1989: hb - honda\n12. 1990: hb - honda\n\nNow, let's count the occurrences of each team.\n\n- yamaha: appears in rows 1,2,3,5 \u2192 4 times.\n- suzuki: only row 4 \u2192 1 time.\n- honda (hb - honda): rows 6,8,9,10,11,12 \u2192 6 times.\n- romer - juchem: row7 \u2192 1 time.\n\nSo, \"hb - honda\" appears 6 times. The total number of rows is 12. More than half would be more than 6, so exactly 6 isn't enough. Therefore, the claim that \"hb - honda\" is in more than half (more than 6) is false because it's exactly 6.\n\nAdditionally, checking if \"hb - honda\" is the most listed team: yamaha has 4, which is less than 6. So yes, they are the most listed. But since being in more than half isn't met, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the last year listed in the table is 1979\" is true or false. First, I should look at the table provided and identify the years listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"year\" column. Let me list out all the years:\n\n- 1979\n- 1980\n- 1982\n- 1982 (again)\n- 1983\n- 1984\n- 1985\n- 1986\n- 1987\n- 1988\n- 1989\n- 1990\n\nSo the years go from 1979 up to 1990. The first year is 1979, and the last is 1990. Therefore, the claim that the last year is 1979 is incorrect.\n\nNext, I need to find which cells are relevant to verify this. Since the claim refers to the \"last year,\" I should check the row with the highest year value. Looking at the table, the last row (row_index 11) has the year 1990. So the relevant cell is the \"year\" column in that last row.\n\nI should include both the row index and the column name in the relevant_cells list to indicate which part of the data was checked.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
