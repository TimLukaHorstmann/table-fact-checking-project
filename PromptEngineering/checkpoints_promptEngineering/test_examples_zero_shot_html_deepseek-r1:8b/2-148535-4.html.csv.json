    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's talking about four aces and mentions two specific points: at 5 credits, you get 800, and at 1 credit, you only get 160.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where \"four aces\" are mentioned. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a row titled \"four aces.\" That's probably the relevant one. \n\nNow, checking the columns: The first column is 'hand,' which includes various poker hands like royal flush, straight flush, etc. So the fourth aces entry is under its own row. \n\nIn the 'four aces' row, I need to check the values at 1 credit and 5 credits. The first data cell in that row corresponds to 1 credit, and it shows 160. Then, for 5 credits, it's 800. So both points in the claim match exactly what's in the table.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other relevant cells that could affect this. For example, checking if any other hand types might have similar values at these points, but since the claim specifically mentions four aces, only that row is relevant.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the claim checks out because the table supports both 160 at 1 credit and 800 at 5 credits for four aces.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"four aces\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit , the result for 1 credit would be 160.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify what \"four aces\" refer to in the context of poker hands. Looking at the table, there are multiple entries related to four aces:\n\n1. Four aces w / 2,3,4\n2. Four aces\n\nWait, but looking closer, in the table, the rows under \"hand\" include \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\" and \"four aces\". However, when I look at the data:\n\n- The row for \"four aces w / 2,3,4\" has 160, 320, 480, 640, 800 under the columns. So for 1 credit, it's 80? Wait no, looking back, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let me check again. In the table, each row corresponds to a different hand. For example, \"four aces w / 2,3,4\" is one row, and \"four aces\" is another.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The first row after the headers is for royal flush, then straight flush, etc., down to the last rows which are individual hands like full house, flush, straight, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me list all the rows in the tbody:\n\n1. royal flush\n2. straight flush\n3. four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\n4. four 2 , 3 , or 4 w / a - 4\n5. four aces\n6. four 2 , 3 , or 4\n7. four 5 - k\n8. full house\n9. flush\n10. straight\n11. three of a kind\n12. two pair\n13. jacks or better\n14. theoretical return\n\nWait, no, actually, the tbody has 14 rows, each corresponding to different poker hands.\n\nSo for four aces, there are two separate entries:\n\n- Four aces w / 2,3,4\n- Four aces\n\nBut looking at their revenue:\n\nFor \"four aces w / 2,3,4\", the values are 80, 160, 240, 320, 400.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each row has five cells corresponding to 1 credit up to 5 credits.\n\nSo for example, the first row after royal flush is straight flush with 50, 100, etc., and then four aces w /2,3,4 starts at 80, 160, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each row's data:\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- The third row (row_index=2) is \"four aces w / 2 , 3 , or 4\" and has values 80, 160, 240, 320, 400 for 1 to 5 credits.\n\n- The fifth row (row_index=4) is \"four 2 , 3 , or 4 w / a - 4\", with values 160, 320, etc.\n\n- Then the sixth row (row_index=5) is \"four aces\" with values 160, 320, 480, 640, 800.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Let me list them all:\n\nRow indices start at 0 for the first row after thead.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 2: four aces w /2,3,4 \u2192 values [80, 160, 240, 320, 400]\n\nRow 5: four aces \u2192 values [160, 320, 480, 640, 800]\n\nWait, no. Let's list them properly:\n\nLooking at the tbody:\n\n1. royal flush\n2. straight flush\n3. four aces w /2,3,4\n4. four 2,3,4 w /a-4\n5. four aces\n6. four 2,3,4\n7. four 5 -k\n8. full house\n9. flush\n10. straight\n11. three of a kind\n12. two pair\n13. jacks or better\n14. theoretical return\n\nSo for row indices:\n\nRow 0: royal flush \u2192 not relevant.\n\nRow1: straight flush.\n\nRow2: four aces w/2,3,4 \u2192 values 80,160,240,320,400.\n\nRow3: four 2,3,4 w/a-4 \u2192 starts at 160.\n\nRow4: four aces (I think this is row5? Wait no. Let me count:\n\nAfter row2: 3\n\nRow3:4\n\nRow4:5\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the fifth row is \"four aces\".\n\nYes, looking at the list as per the user's table:\n\nIt seems that rows are:\n\n0: royal flush\n\n1: straight flush\n\n2: four aces w/2,3,4\n\n3: four 2,3,4 w/a-4\n\n4: four aces (I think this is row4? Or maybe it's row5. Wait, perhaps I should check the exact order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's table has:\n\nLooking at the initial list, after \"full house\" comes flush, then straight, etc., but in any case, for four aces:\n\nThere are two separate entries: one with \"w /2,3,4\" and another just as \"four aces\".\n\nSo for row 2, which is \"four aces w/2,3,4\", the values for 1-5 credits are 80,160,240,320,400.\n\nFor row 5 (assuming it's the fifth row), which is \"four aces\" with values 160,320,480,640,800.\n\nWait, but in the user's table, the rows are listed as:\n\n3. four aces w /2 ,3,4\n\n4. four 2,3,4 w /a -4\n\n5. four aces\n\nSo row2: four aces w/2,3,4 \u2192 values [80,160,240,320,400]\n\nrow5: four aces \u2192 values [160,320,480,640,800].\n\nWait, but in the user's table, it might be that after four 2,3,4 comes four aces.\n\nSo for row 2: 80,160,240,320,400\n\nRow 5: 160,320,480,640,800.\n\nNow, the claim is:\n\n\"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit.\"\n\nWait, \"yield\" might be a typo, perhaps meaning revenue. So for five credits, four aces would have a revenue of 900.\n\nLooking at row2 (four aces w/2,3,4): when credit=5, the value is 400.\n\nRow5: four aces with credit=5 is 800.\n\nSo neither gives 900.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"four ace\" refers to row2 and row5.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's stated as \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit.\" So 900 when the player has five credits.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor four aces w/2,3,4: at five credits, it's 400.\n\nFor four aces: at five credits, it's 800.\n\nNeither is 900.\n\nSo perhaps there is no row where four aces yield 900 for five credits. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all rows to see if any have a value of 900 when credit=5.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- royal flush: values up to 6000 (for 5 credits)\n\nWait, no, looking at the first data point for royal flush is 50 for 1 credit, increasing by 100 each time? Wait, perhaps I should check all rows:\n\nRow 0: royal flush \u2192 [50, 100, 200, 300, 400]\n\nRow1: straight flush \u2192 same as above.\n\nRow2: four aces w/2,3,4 \u2192 [80,160,240,320,400]\n\nRow3: four 2,3,4 w/a-4 \u2192 [160,320,480,640,800]\n\nRow4: four aces? Or maybe it's something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the relevant row is \"four 5 -k\" which is row6 (if starting at 0) with values for five credits as 400?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nI think I need to list all rows and their data properly.\n\nLet me list each row's data:\n\nRow 0: royal flush \u2192 [50,100,200,300,400]\n\nRow1: straight flush \u2192 same as above.\n\nRow2: four aces w/2,3,4 \u2192 [80,160,240,320,400]\n\nRow3: four 2,3,4 w/a-4 \u2192 [160,320,480,640,800]\n\nRow4: four aces? Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps row4 is \"four 5 -k\", which would be four of a kind with aces.\n\nWait, the user listed:\n\nThe rows as per their message are:\n\n3. four aces w/2,3,4\n\n4. four 2,3,4 w/a-4\n\n5. four aces\n\nSo row5: four aces \u2192 [160,320,480,640,800]\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because for row5, if it's four aces, perhaps the starting point is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting and the rows are as follows:\n\n- 0: royal flush\n\n-1: straight flush\n\n2: four aces w/2,3,4 \u2192 [80,160,240,320,400]\n\n3: four 2,3,4 w/a-4 \u2192 [160,320,480,640,800]\n\n4: four aces (without the \"w/2,3,4\") \u2192 [ ?, ?, ?, ?, ? ]\n\nBut perhaps row4 is another type of hand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the user's list is as follows:\n\nAfter \"full house\" comes flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, jacks or better, theoretical return.\n\nWait, no. The user's list seems to be:\n\n3. four aces w/2,3,4\n\n4. four 2,3,4 w/a-4\n\n5. four aces\n\nSo row5: four aces with five credits \u2192800.\n\nThus, neither of these rows have a value of 900 at five credits.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a row where the revenue for four aces at five credits is 900.\n\nWait, let's check all rows:\n\nRow0: royal flush: 50,100,200,300,400\n\nRow1: straight flush: same as above.\n\nRow2: four aces w/2,3,4: 80,160,240,320,400\n\nRow3: four 2,3,4 w/a-4:160,320,480,640,800\n\nRow4: perhaps four of a kind with other numbers. For example, if it's four 5s -k? So \"four 5s\" \u2192 let's see.\n\nIf row4 is \"four 5s -k\", then at five credits, the value would be higher than row3's 800. Maybe 900?\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of the rows.\n\nBut in any case, based on what I have, four aces w/2,3,4 give 400 for five credits.\n\nFour aces without that modifier give 800.\n\nNeither is 900.\n\nThus, the claim's first part is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, and there is no hand where four aces yield 900 for five credits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different hand, like straight flush or royal flush, but those don't match \"four aces\".\n\nSo, overall, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"four ace yield 900 for five credit\" is not supported by the provided data. In the given table, neither four aces with two, three, and four cards nor four aces alone yield 900 when played at five credits. Instead:\n\n- Four aces with two, three, and four cards yield 400 at five credits.\n- Four aces without the modifier yield 800 at five credits.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect based on the provided information.",
