The claim states: \"On average, there be 2709 crowd attendance when the home team be vida.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions an average attendance of 2709 when the home team is \"vida.\" So, I need to find rows where the home team is \"vida\" and check their attendance values.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The 'home' column lists the teams, so I'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Home team is \"deportes savio\" \u2013 not vida.\n2. Second row: Home team is \"olimpia\" \u2013 not vida.\n3. Third row: Home team is \"vida\" \u2013 this is relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Home team is \"real espana\" \u2013 not vida.\n5. Fifth row: Home team is \"real juventud\" \u2013 not vida.\n\nOnly the third row matches where the home team is \"vida.\" In that row, the attendance is 2709, which matches the claim's figure. \n\nNow, checking for average isn't necessary here because the claim specifies \"on average,\" but in this table, there's only one match where home is vida with attendance 2709. If there were multiple such matches, we would need to calculate an average, but since there's only one, it meets the condition stated.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"vida be the home team during the match with 2709 in attendance.\" So, there are three key elements here:\n\n1. **Team**: The name is \"vida.\"\n2. **Match Details**: There was a match where the attendance was 2709.\n3. **Home Team**: Vida should be the home team.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll examine each row to see if any of them match these conditions.\n\nThe table has five rows, all occurring on \"9 august 2008.\" Each row lists the home team, score, away team, and attendance. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is \"deportes savio,\" score is \"2:1,\" away team is \"hispano,\" attendance is 440.\n   - Vida isn't the home team here, so no match.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Home team is \"olimpia,\" score is \"0:1,\" away team is \"marathon,\" attendance is 1487.\n   - Not vida either.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Home team is \"vida,\" score is \"1:1,\" away team is \"motagua,\" attendance is 2709.\n   - This row matches both the home team being \"vida\" and the attendance being 2709. So, this is the relevant match.\n\n4. **Row 3**: Home team is \"real espana,\" score is \"4:0,\" away team is \"platense,\" attendance is 2168.\n   - Doesn't match vida as home team.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Home team is \"real juventud,\" score is \"2:0,\" away team is \"victoria,\" attendance is 1223.\n   - Again, not relevant here.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 2 has Vida as the home team and an attendance of 2709. Therefore, the claim is true because there's a match where vida is the home team with exactly 2709 attendees. \n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: in Row 2, the columns that are important are \"home\" and \"attendance.\" So, the relevant_cells should include row_index=2 for both \"home\" and \"attendance.\"\n\nI need to make sure I'm formatting this correctly as per the instructions, using a JSON object with the answer and a list of objects each containing row_index (as an integer) and column_name (as a string). \n\nSo, the final JSON should indicate that the answer is \"TRUE,\" and the relevant cells are at row 2 for both home and attendance columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"During the match with a score of 1:1, the attendance was 2709.\" \n\nI should check if there's any row in the table where both the score is 1:1 and the attendance is 2709. Let me look at each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the table, I see five rows. Each row has the following columns: date, home team, score, away team, and attendance.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: \n   - Date: 9 August 2008\n   - Home Team: Deportes Savio\n   - Score: 2:1\n   - Attendance: 440\n   - The score here is 2:1, which doesn't match the claimed 1:1.\n\n2. **Second Row**:\n   - Date: 9 August 2008\n   - Home Team: Olimpia\n   - Score: 0:1\n   - Attendance: 1487\n   - The score is 0:1, not 1:1, so this row doesn't fit.\n\n3. **Third Row**:\n   - Date: 9 August 2008\n   - Home Team: Vida\n   - Score: 1:1\n   - Attendance: 2709\n   - Here, the score is exactly 1:1 and attendance is 2709. This matches the claim perfectly.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**:\n   - Date: 9 August 2008\n   - Home Team: Real Espana\n   - Score: 4:0\n   - Attendance: 2168\n   - The score is 4:0, not 1:1.\n\n5. **Fifth Row**:\n   - Date: 9 August 2008\n   - Home Team: Real Juventud\n   - Score: 2:0\n   - Attendance: 1223\n   - The score here is 2:0, so it doesn't match the claim.\n\nSince I found a row (the third one) where both the score is 1:1 and attendance is 2709, the claim should be TRUE. \n\nNow, to find the relevant cells, I need to note which columns are checked. The relevant columns are 'score' and 'attendance'. Therefore, for that specific row, the relevant_cells would include both these columns.\n\nSo, in terms of row indices (starting from 0), the third row is at index 2 because there are five rows. So, row_index is 2, and the two columns are 'score' and 'attendance'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one row in the table where both the score is 1:1 and attendance is 2709.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"vida be the away team during the match where there be 2709 in attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things: that \"vida\" is the away team and that the attendance was 2709.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match on August 9, 2008. The columns are date, home, score, away, and attendance. \n\nI'll go through each row to find where the attendance is 2709 and check if the away team in that row is \"vida.\"\n\nThe first row has an attendance of 440 with home as \"deportes savio\" and away as \"hispano.\" Not relevant.\n\nSecond row: attendance 1487, away team \"marathon.\" No.\n\nThird row: attendance 2709. Home is \"vida,\" so the away team must be \"motagua.\" Wait, but the claim says \"vida\" is the away team. That's not matching here because in this row, \"vida\" is home.\n\nFourth row: attendance 2168, away \"platense.\" Not relevant.\n\nFifth row: attendance 1223, away \"victoria.\" No match for 2709.\n\nSo the only row with attendance 2709 has \"vida\" as the home team, not the away.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells in the table support the claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"during the match with a score of 1.1 , the attendance be 2000.\" Wait, that score seems odd because scores are usually like home:away or something similar, not decimal points. But maybe it's a typo or formatting issue. Perhaps they meant a score where one team scored 1 and the other 1, making it 1-1.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns: date, home, score, away, and attendance. There are five rows of data for matches on August 9, 2008.\n\nThe claim mentions a match with a specific score of \"1.1\" and attendance of 2000. Hmm, but in the table, all scores are listed as something like \"2:1\", \"0:1\", etc., which are in the format home:away or away:home. There's no score that looks like \"1.1\". So maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: Score is 2:1\n- Row 1: Score is 0:1\n- Row 2: Score is 1:1\n- Row 3: Score is 4:0\n- Row 4: Score is 2:0\n\nNone of these scores are \"1.1\". However, row 2 has a score of \"1:1\", which is close but different from what the claim says. So perhaps there's confusion between \"1:1\" and \"1.1\".\n\nIf I consider that maybe the user intended to refer to \"1:1\" as the score, then I can check the attendance for that row. In row 2, the attendance is 2709, which doesn't match 2000.\n\nAlternatively, if we strictly take the claim as it is, with a score of 1.1 and attendance of 2000, neither of these exact values exist in the table. The closest is the \"1:1\" score with 2709 attendance or perhaps another row with a different score.\n\nTherefore, there's no matching row where both the score is exactly \"1.1\" and the attendance is 2000. So the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each row for a match where the score is exactly \"1.1\" and attendance is 2000.

The claim is: \"the average attendance for matches where the home team be vida be 2609.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions \"average attendance,\" which means we're looking for some sort of calculation across multiple matches. Then it specifies that the home team is \"vida\" and the attendance should be around 2609.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match on August 9, 2008. The columns are date, home, score, away, and attendance. I need to identify which rows have the home team as \"vida.\"\n\nScanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Home is \"deportes savio\" \u2013 not vida.\n- Row 1: Home is \"olimpia\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: Home is \"vida\" \u2013 yes, this one counts.\n- Row 3: Home is \"real espana\" \u2013 no.\n- Row 4: Home is \"real juventud\" \u2013 no.\n\nSo only row 2 meets the condition of home team being \"vida.\" \n\nNext, I check the attendance for that match. The value in row 2 under attendance is 2709. Now, the claim says the average should be 2609. Since there's only one match with vida as home, we can't compute an average. Wait, but maybe it's implying that the attendance was around 2609? But 2709 is actually higher than 2609.\n\nSo, if the claim is about the average attendance for such matches being 2609, and since there's only one match with attendance 2709, we can't compute an average. Without more data points, the average doesn't exist, making the statement incorrect. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant exactly 2609, but that's not what's stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about the average, which requires multiple matches. Since there's only one match with home team vida, we can't compute an average. Therefore, the statement isn't fully supported because it refers to an average without sufficient data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to an average attendance for a specific home team, but since there's only one relevant match, an average cannot be computed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
