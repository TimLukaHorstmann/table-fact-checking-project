    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about the Pittsburgh Penguins winning the Wale Conference Final 4-2 in the 1990/91 season is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: date, visitor, score, home, and record. Each row represents a game with specific dates in May. The teams involved are Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.\n\nThe claim mentions the 1990/91 season, which is likely the Stanley Cup playoffs for that year. The Wale Conference Final might be a typo; perhaps it's meant to say \"Wales\" or \"Western Conference.\" Assuming it refers to the Western Conference Final in the 1990-91 season.\n\nLooking at the table, all dates are in May, and the games listed seem to be part of a series. For example, the Penguins lost on May 3 (4-5 in OT) but then won on May 9 (7-2). However, I'm not sure if these specific games correspond to the Conference Final.\n\nI need to check if any row matches a 4-2 scoreline in the Conference Final for that season. Without more data, it's unclear from the table alone. The table doesn't mention anything about conference finals or specific series outcomes beyond individual game results.\n\nThe claim refers to a final score of 4-2 and a season, but the table doesn't provide information about the overall series outcome or whether they won the Conference Final that year. Therefore, there's no direct evidence in the table to support this claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"only 1 of the 6 games go to overtime.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each game in the table and see if it went into overtime. Overtime in hockey usually means that the game didn't end in regulation time, so the score would have a notation like \"(ot)\" or something similar after the result.\n\nLooking at the 'score' column:\n\n- May 1: 3 - 6. No (ot) mentioned.\n- May 3: 4 - 5 (ot). Here, it says (ot), so this game went into overtime.\n- May 5: 1 - 4. No overtime noted.\n- May 7: 1 - 4. Again, no overtime.\n- May 9: 7 - 2. No overtime.\n- May 11: 3 - 5. No overtime mentioned.\n\nSo, only the second game on May 3rd went into overtime. That makes it 1 out of 6 games. \n\nNow, I need to check which cells are relevant. The row index is based on their order in the table. Each row has a date and the corresponding score. Since only the May 3rd game has (ot), I should note that cell.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be the row for May 3rd under the 'score' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: date, visitor, score, home, and record. Each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions the largest margin of victory being 7-2. So, I need to find out which cells are relevant. The 'score' column seems directly related because it shows the game outcomes. Specifically, \"7 - 2\" would be in that column for a particular row.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. may 1: score is 3 - 6 (visitor scored 3, home scored 6). Visitor is Pittsburgh Penguins, home is Boston Bruins.\n2. may 3: score is 4 - 5 (OT), so no 7-2 here.\n3. may 5: score is 1 - 4. No.\n4. may 7: score is 1 - 4 again. No.\n5. may 9: Here, the score is 7 - 2. Visitor is Pittsburgh Penguins against Boston Bruins.\n6. may 11: score is 3 - 5. Not relevant.\n\nSo, only the row for may 9 has a score of 7-2. Therefore, this supports the claim that this is the largest margin of victory in the table.\n\nI should check if there's any other game with a larger margin, but from the data given, it seems like 7-2 is indeed the highest. So, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"Pittsburgh Penguin win the first 2 games of the Wale Conference Final in the 1990/91 season.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns for date, visitor, score, home, and record. Each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe claim refers to the \"Wale Conference Final,\" which might be a typo. I think it's supposed to be the \"Eastern Conference Final\" or another specific conference final, but since the exact name isn't in the table headers, maybe I need to infer from the data.\n\nLooking at the dates in the table: May 1, May 3, May 5, etc., these seem to fall within a series. The visitor and home teams alternate between Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. So, it's likely that this is a Stanley Cup Final or another playoff series, but not necessarily the Wale Conference Final as mentioned.\n\nThe claim says they won the first two games of the 1990/91 season. I'll check the table for games where the Penguins won. Let's go row by row:\n\n1. May 1: Pittsburgh Penguins visitor, score 3-6. They lost.\n2. May 3: Pittsburgh Penguins visitor, score 4-5 (OT). Lost in overtime.\n3. May 5: Boston Bruins visitor, score 1-4. They won? Wait, no, the home team is Pittsburgh, so if the visitor is Boston and they scored 1-4, that means the home team (Penguins) won because their score is higher. So Penguins won this game.\n4. May 7: Boston Bruins visitor, score 1-4. Again, home team is Penguins, so they won again.\n5. May 9: Pittsburgh Penguins visitor, score 7-2. They won.\n6. May 11: Boston Bruins visitor, score 3-5. Penguins won.\n\nSo in the games listed, the Penguins won on May 5, 7, 9, and 11. The first two games (May 1 and May 3) were losses. Therefore, they didn't win the first two games of whatever conference final this is. \n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"the first 2 game of the Wale Conference Final.\" If it's not about the actual correct conference, maybe the user made a typo. But regardless, based on the table, Penguins lost the first two games.\n\nSo the claim is false because they didn't win the first two games. Therefore, answer should be FALSE.\n\nNext, to find relevant cells: the claim mentions winning games, so I need to look for where the home team's score is higher than the visitor, indicating a win.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. May 1: Visitor (Penguins) scored 3-6 against Bruins. So home team Bruins won. Not relevant.\n2. May 3: Penguins lost again.\n3. May 5: Home team is Penguins; score 4-1 vs Bruins. Penguins won. So this is a win for them, but it's the third game, not first two.\n4. May 7: Similarly, home team won.\n5. May 9: They won again, but that's fifth game.\n6. May 11: They won, sixth game.\n\nNone of the first two games (May 1 and May 3) were wins for Penguins. So the relevant rows are from May 5 onwards, but not the first two. Therefore, no cells are relevant because the claim is about the first two games which they lost. Alternatively, if considering any win, maybe all rows after row 2? But the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant.\n\nThe claim's conditions: winning first 2 games of Wale Conference Final in 1990/91 season. So we need to find if they won those two games. Since they lost both, there's no row where they won as home team in the first two games. Therefore, no relevant cells because their wins start from May 5 onward.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"6 game be play over a 12 day period\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. First, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions that six games are played over 12 days. That could mean that each game takes two days (since 6 games * 2 days = 12 days) or that the total duration from the first to the last game is 12 days.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists multiple games with dates. The goal is to find if there are six games played within any 12-day span. So, I need to look for consecutive dates where six games fit into a 12-day period.\n\nLet me go through each row and note down the dates:\n\n1. May 1\n2. May 3\n3. May 5\n4. May 7\n5. May 9\n6. May 11\n\nWait, that's only six rows, so from May 1 to May 11 is a span of 10 days (since May 1 to May 11 is 10 days later). Hmm, but the claim says 12 days. So maybe I'm missing some games?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more than six games in the table that fit into a 12-day window. Let me count all the games first.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- May 1: Penguins vs Bruins\n- May 3: Penguins vs Bruins\n- May 5: Bruins vs Penguins\n- May 7: Bruins vs Penguins\n- May 9: Penguins vs Bruins\n- May 11: Bruins vs Penguins\n\nThat's six games in total. Now, check the dates:\n\nFrom May 1 to May 11 is 10 days (including both start and end dates). Wait, that's only 10 days. So the duration is less than 12 days.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"6 game be play over a 12 day period.\" Perhaps it's implying that six games are spread out over 12 days, not necessarily all in one continuous block.\n\nWait, but each game is on a specific date, and perhaps some days might have multiple games or something. But looking at the table, each row seems to represent a single game. So if there are six games played within any 12-day period, regardless of how they're spread, that would make it true.\n\nLet me see: The earliest date is May 1, and the latest in the data is May 11. That's only 10 days. Are there more than six games? No, the table shows six rows. So if I look for a 12-day period starting from May 1, does that include any six games?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to six games played over a 12-day period, meaning each game is within those 12 days, not necessarily consecutive.\n\nWait, but in the table, there are only six games. So if all six games occur between May 1 and May 11 (10 days), then it's not spanning 12 days. Therefore, the claim might be false because the duration isn't 12 days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing other games. Let me check if the table has more than six rows. No, the tbody has six <tr> elements, so six games in total.\n\nSo, if the claim is that these six games are spread over a 12-day period, but they only span 10 days, then it's false. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that each game is played over a two-day period, making six games take 12 days. But looking at the dates, each game is on a single day, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for consecutive days where multiple games are played. For example, if each game is on consecutive days, then six games would span five days (since each game is on a separate day). But 5 days can't be 12 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to the total number of days from the first to the last game being 12 days, but in this case, it's only 10 days.\n\nSo, I think the claim is false because the six games are played over a 10-day period, not 12 days. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that six games are played over a 12-day period. By examining the table, we see that there are only six games from May 1 to May 11, which is a span of 10 days. Since this duration is less than 12 days, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that in the 6 games listed, exactly 2 games went into overtime. So, my task is to look through the 'score' column and count how many times the game went into overtime.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a 'score' column for each game. Each score entry has two numbers separated by a dash or parentheses if it's an overtime game. For example, the second row has \"4 - 5 (ot)\", which means it was an overtime game.\n\nSo, I need to identify all the games where the notation \"(ot)\" is present because that indicates an overtime game. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. May 1: Score is \"3 - 6\". No mention of overtime, so this isn't one.\n2. May 3: Score is \"4 - 5 (ot)\". This is an overtime game, so count = 1.\n3. May 5: Score is \"1 - 4\". No overtime mentioned, not a count.\n4. May 7: Score is \"1 - 4\". Again, no overtime, so no change.\n5. May 9: Score is \"7 - 2\". Not an overtime game.\n6. May 11: Score is \"3 - 5\". No overtime indicated.\n\nWait, only the second row has \"(ot)\", which means only one game went to overtime. But the claim says two games. So that would make the claim FALSE because there's actually only one overtime game in the six listed.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if any other scores might have an implicit overtime notation or if I'm missing something. Looking again:\n\n- May 1: No.\n- May 3: Yes, one.\n- May 5: No.\n- May 7: No.\n- May 9: No.\n- May 11: No.\n\nOnly one game is in overtime. Therefore, the claim that two games went to overtime is incorrect. It should be only one.\n\nWait, but looking back at the initial analysis, I might have missed something. Let me recount:\n\n1. May 3: OT\n2. Are there any others? Checking each row again. The other scores don't show \"(ot)\", so only one game. So the claim is indeed FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two of the six games went to overtime.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the largest margin of victory be 5 - 3\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"largest margin of victory.\" A margin of victory refers to the difference between a team's score and their opponent's score in a game. The largest margin would be the highest such difference recorded in the table. \n\nThe claim specifically says \"5 - 3.\" So I need to look for the game where the winning team had a score of 5 points and the opponent had 3, resulting in a margin of 2 (since 5-3=2). But wait, actually, the margin is just the difference, so it's 2. However, the way the claim is phrased is \"5 - 3,\" which might be highlighting that specific scoreline.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with the date, visitor, their score, home team, and the game's record (which I assume is their standing or something else). The relevant columns for this analysis are \"visitor\" and \"score,\" as well as \"home\" and \"score.\" \n\nI need to find all games where either the visitor or the home team had a margin of victory. For each game, calculate the margin by subtracting the opponent's score from the winner's score.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. May 1: Pittsburgh (visitor) vs Boston (home). Scores are 3-6. Margin is 6 - 3 = 3 for Boston.\n2. May 3: Pittsburgh (visitor) vs Boston (home). Score 4-5 in OT. So, the winning team is Boston with a margin of 1 (5-4).\nWait, no, wait: If it's 4-5, then Boston wins by 1 point (since they're the home team). So 5 - 4 = 1.\n3. May 5: Boston (visitor) vs Pittsburgh (home). Score 1-4. Margin is 4 - 1 = 3 for Pittsburgh.\n4. May 7: Boston (visitor) vs Pittsburgh (home). Score 1-4 again, same margin of 3.\n5. May 9: Pittsburgh (visitor) vs Boston (home). Score 7-2. Margin is 7 - 2 = 5 for Pittsburgh.\n6. May 11: Boston (visitor) vs Pittsburgh (home). Score 3-5. So Boston has a score of 3, Pittsburgh 5. Margin is 5 - 3 = 2.\n\nNow, looking at all the margins:\n\n- May 1: 3\n- May 3: 1\n- May 5: 3\n- May 7: 3\n- May 9: 5 (this is the highest)\n- May 11: 2\n\nSo the largest margin of victory in the table is 5, which occurred on May 9 when Pittsburgh beat Boston 7-2. \n\nNow, the claim says \"the largest margin of victory be 5 - 3.\" But wait, the score was 7-2, not 5-3. So does this mean that the margin is 5-3 somewhere else?\n\nLooking again, no row has a score of 5-3. The closest is May 11 with 3-5, which is a margin of 2, but that's a loss for Boston and a win for Pittsburgh with a smaller margin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's saying the largest margin was achieved by a 5-3 scoreline. But in this table, the highest margin is 5 (from 7-2). So the claim is incorrect because there's no game where the score was 5-3; instead, the largest margin came from a 7-2 game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the largest margin of victory in the table isn't achieved by a 5-3 scoreline but rather by a 7-2 scoreline.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"the largest margin of victory be 5 - 3\" is true, I analyzed each game's score to find the largest margin. The highest margin was 5 (from a 7-2 score), not from a 5-3 game.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n**Relevant cells**:\n- The row where the home team scored 7 and the visitor scored 2, resulting in a 5-point margin.\n  - May 9: Pittsburgh Penguins (home) vs Boston Bruins (visitor)\n  - Columns checked: date, score (both teams), and which team was home or visitor.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Pittsburgh Penguins winning an even game in the 1990/91 season of the Western Conference Final is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"pittsburgh penguin win even game of the wale conference final in the 1990 / 91 seaon\". There are a few things to check here:\n\n1. The team name: It refers to the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n2. The event: Winning an even-numbered game in the Western Conference Final.\n3. The season: 1990/91.\n\nLooking at the table, it shows dates, visitors, scores, home teams, and records for several games. Each row represents a different date, with corresponding team details.\n\nI need to find if there's any evidence in the table that supports this claim. Let me go through each relevant aspect.\n\nStarting with the season: The table lists games on dates from May 1 to May 11. Since hockey seasons typically run into the spring and summer months, the 1990/91 season would be during these times, so the dates align.\n\nNext, looking at the team names in the \"visitor\" column: There are entries for both the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Boston Bruins. The claim mentions the Penguins winning an even game, so I need to focus on their games.\n\nNow, the claim specifies \"even game,\" which probably means a game that went into overtime (since that's when a game is considered even if it ends in a tie after regulation). Let me check the scores for the Penguins' games.\n\nIn the table:\n- May 1: Penguins lost 3-6.\n- May 3: Penguins tied 4-5 in OT. So this is an overtime game and resulted in a tie, which would be considered an even game.\n- May 5: Bruins won against Penguins 1-4.\n- May 7: Bruins tied with Penguins 1-4 in OT. Another overtime tie, so another even game.\n- May 9: Penguins won 7-2.\n- May 11: Bruins won 3-5.\n\nSo the Penguins played two overtime games (May 3 and May 7). Each of these would count as an even game since they went into overtime. However, I need to check if the claim refers to a specific game or just any such game in that season.\n\nThe claim says \"win\" but in both the overtime games, the Penguins either tied or lost. Wait, no: On May 3, they tied, so they didn't win. On May 7, they also tied. So actually, the Penguins didn't win any of their overtime games in this table; they either tied or lost.\n\nWait a minute\u2014did I misread that? Let me check again:\n\n- May 3: Pittsburgh Penguins (visitor) played and scored 4-5 against Boston Bruins at home. The result is written as 4-5 (ot), which means they lost in overtime.\n- May 7: They visited again, the game was 1-4 (ot), so same outcome.\n\nSo in both of their overtime games, they didn't win; they lost or tied. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it states that they won an even game. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"even game.\" An even game could mean a game that's tied after regulation, regardless of the outcome. But the claim says they \"won\" the even game.\n\nWait, the term \"win even game\" might be a bit ambiguous. Does it mean they won a game that went into overtime? Or does it refer to games where the score was even in some way?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- May 3: Penguins scored 4, Bruins scored 5 (total of 9 goals). Not sure if that's relevant.\n- May 7: Both teams scored 1 each. So the total is 2 goals, which is an even number.\n\nBut the term \"even game\" here likely refers to overtime games, as those are traditionally considered even games because they go beyond regulation time.\n\nSo in both of their overtime games (May 3 and May 7), the Penguins did not win; they lost. Therefore, there's no evidence in the table that the Penguins won an even game during the 1990/91 season based on these dates.\n\nWait, but the season is 1990/91, so perhaps the playoffs continued beyond May. The games listed go up to May 11, which might just be a part of the playoff series. If the Western Conference Final was later in the year, maybe there's another game where they won an even game. But based on the given table, I can't see any evidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"even game\" refers to games where both teams scored the same number of goals. Looking at the games:\n\n- May 3: Penguins scored 4, Bruins 5. Not equal.\n- May 7: Both scored 1 each. So that's an even score in terms of goals for and against.\n\nBut again, the claim is about winning such a game, which they didn't do on May 7 either; it was a tie.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the claim states they won an even game, but in reality, based on the table, their games didn't result in a win during overtime.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The season aligns with the dates.\n- They played two overtime games (May 3 and May 7).\n- In both, they either tied or lost.\n- Therefore, there's no evidence that they won an even game as per the claim.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Pittsburgh Penguins won an even game in the Western Conference Final during the 1990/91 season. However, upon examining the provided table, it becomes clear that the Penguins played two overtime games (May 3 and May 7), but they did not win either of these games; they tied both. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that they won an even game as stated.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - The table lists games from May 1 to May 11.\n   - The season in question is 1990/91, which aligns with these dates.\n\n2. **Focus on the Pittsburgh Penguins' Games:**\n   - They are listed as visitors on May 3 and May 7.\n   - Both games were overtime games (denoted by \"(ot)\"), resulting in ties or losses.\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim suggests that they won an even game, which typically refers to overtime games where the score might be tied after regulation.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - The Penguins did not win any of their overtime games during this period.\n   - Therefore, there's no basis for the claim as stated based on the provided data.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because the Pittsburgh Penguins did not win any even games (overtime games) during the 1990/91 season according to the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the first 3 of the 6 game be play over an 8 day period.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to be stating that the first three games (out of six) were played within an 8-day span.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, and record. The dates given are May 1, May 3, May 5, May 7, May 9, and May 11. \n\nI need to identify which games are considered the \"first 3\" of the 6 games. Since they're listed in order from May 1 to May 11, I assume the first three would be the earliest ones: May 1, May 3, and May 5.\n\nNext, I should check how many days these three games span. From May 1 to May 3 is 2 days, then May 3 to May 5 adds another 2 days, making it a total of 4 days. However, the claim mentions an 8-day period. That doesn't match because 4 days is less than 8.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"first 3 of the 6 games\" as the first three in some sequence that might not necessarily be consecutive? But looking at the dates, May 1, May 3, and May 5 are consecutive every other day. The next game is on May 5, so from May 1 to May 11, it's actually spread over 10 days (May 1 to May 11 is 10 days inclusive). \n\nWait, no, the first three games are May 1, May 3, and May 5. From May 1 to May 5 is 4 days (including both start and end dates). So that's only a span of 4 days, not 8. Therefore, the claim's assertion that these three games were played over an 8-day period isn't supported by the table data.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the days between May 1 and May 5. From May 1 to May 3 is two days (since they're on consecutive odd dates). Wait no, May 1 to May 2 is one day, May 2 to May 3 is another, so from May 1 to May 3 is two days, then May 3 to May 5 is two more days, totaling four days. So the first three games span from May 1 to May 5, which is four days.\n\nSo the claim says they were played over an 8-day period. But according to the table, the first three are on May 1, 3, and 5, which are within a 4-day window. Therefore, the claim's assertion about an 8-day period isn't correct. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if \"first 3 of the 6 games\" refers to any arbitrary first three or the first three in order. If it's the first three in chronological order, then yes, they're May 1, 3, and 5. The span is from May 1 (day 1) to May 5 (day 5), which is four days. So definitely less than eight days.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the first three games don't take place over an 8-day period as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the first three of six games were played over an 8-day span. By examining the table, the first three games occur on May 1, May 3, and May 5. The time between May 1 and May 5 is four days, not eight. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
