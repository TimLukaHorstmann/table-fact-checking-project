    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30.\" Hmm, first, I should parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that there are no games played where the goals for a team are less than 30.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team and their statistics. The relevant column here is \"goals for\" because the claim is about the number of goals scored by each team.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the \"goals for\" value. \n\n1. Ottawa Hockey Club: 90 goals. That's more than 30, so this game should be included if the claim were true.\n2. Montreal Wanderers: 74 goals. Also above 30.\n3. Montreal Victorias: 76 goals. Still above 30.\n4. Quebec Hockey Club: 57 goals. Above 30.\n5. Montreal Hockey Club: 49 goals. Above 30.\n6. Montreal Shamrocks: 30 goals. Exactly 30.\n\nWait, the claim says \"less than 30.\" So 30 is not less than 30. Therefore, there's no team with goals for less than 30. However, I should check all rows to ensure none have below 30. All teams have at least 30 or more. Shamrocks have exactly 30, so that doesn't count either.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are no games where a team's goals for are less than 30.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals for\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
