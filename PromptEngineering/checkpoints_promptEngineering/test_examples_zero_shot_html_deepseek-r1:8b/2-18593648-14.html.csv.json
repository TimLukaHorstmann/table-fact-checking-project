    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim states: \"2 of the artists get a double-digit percent vote.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what a \"double-digit percent vote\" means. Double-digit percentages would be 10% or higher. So I need to check how many artists have votes (in the 'televote / sms' column) that are 10% or more.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist with their song and the corresponding percentage. The 'artist' column lists the names of the artists. My task is to go through each row, check the 'televote / sms' value, and see if it's a double-digit number (10% or higher).\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Stefan Ilchev - 2.95%: This is below 10%, so not relevant.\n2. Moto - 0.37%: Also below 10%.\n3. Poli Genova - 11.74%: This is above 10%, so this artist qualifies.\n4. Danny Milev - 2.39%: Below 10%.\n5. Ivelina - 2.53%: Below 10%.\n6. Grafa - 3.91%: Still below 10%.\n7. Sahara - 3.20%: Below 10%.\n8. Mariana Popova - 8.45%: Just under 10%, so not quite double-digit.\n9. Jura Tone feat Lady B - 2.03%: Below 10%.\n10. Stefan Dobrev - 1.16%: Below 10%.\n11. Krassimir Avramov - 55.52%: This is well over 10%, so another qualifying artist.\n12. Nora - 5.75%: Below 10%.\n\nSo from this, I see that two artists (Poli Genova and Krassimir Avramov) have double-digit percentages. \n\nNow, the claim says \"2 of the artist get a double digit percent vote.\" Wait, does it mean exactly two or at least two? The data shows exactly two artists meet this criterion.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. Now I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'artist' column has Poli Genova (row 3) and Krassimir Avramov (row 11). So their respective rows are 3 and 11.\n\nI should create a list of objects with each's row index and column name. For example, for Poli Genova, row index is 3 (since the first row is index 0?), wait no: in the table provided, the rows start from 1 to 12, but the user mentioned row indices as 0-based? Wait, looking at the example given by the user:\n\nIn their sample JSON, they had row_index starting at 0 for the first row. So in the HTML table, each <tr> corresponds to a row, and the first one is index 0.\n\nSo in my case, the rows are numbered from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 entries). Wait, but the HTML table has 12 tr elements, so indexes 0 through 11. So Poli Genova is at row 3, Krassimir Avramov at row 10.\n\nWait no: looking back, the first <tr> is row index 0, which corresponds to Stefan Ilchev (row 1 in the table). Wait, perhaps I should map each tr as per their position. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: Stefan Ilchev\n- Row 1: Moto\n- Row 2: Poli Genova\n- Row 3: Danny Milev\n- ...\nWait no, actually, the first row in the tbody is the first artist, so row index 0 is Stefan Ilchev.\n\nSo for Poli Genova, which is third in the list (artist 3), her row index is 2. Similarly, Krassimir Avramov is the 11th artist, which would be row index 10.\n\nWait, maybe I should list them:\n\nRow 0: Stefan Ilchev\n\nRow 1: Moto\n\nRow 2: Poli Genova\n\nRow 3: Danny Milev\n\n...\n\nContinuing up to Row 10: Krassimir Avramov\n\nSo the two artists are at row indices 2 and 10.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the 'artist' column for rows 2 and 10.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"2 of the artist get a double-digit percent vote,\" we check each artist's televote/sms percentage. Poli Genova (11.74%) and Krassimir Avramov (55.52%) meet the threshold, confirming the claim is true.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Double-Digit Percentages**: Look for percentages \u226510%.\n2. **Find Relevant Artists**: Two artists (Poli Genova and Krassimir Avramov) have double-digit votes.\n3. **Determine Relevance**: Their rows (indices 2 and 10 in the 'artist' column) are recorded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verified\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Two artists, Poli Genova and Krassimir Avramov, have televote/sms percentages of 11.74% and 55.52%, respectively, which are double-digit values.\",\n  \"relevant_rows\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"artist\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"artist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 5 artists that only have one name\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll carefully examine the table and the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist along with their song and some other details. The relevant columns for this claim are the 'artist' column because we need to check the names of the artists.\n\nThe claim specifies that there should be 5 artists who only have one name. So I'll go through each artist's name in the table and count how many have only one name.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Stefan Ilchev: He has a first name, so that's two parts? Wait, no, \"Stefan\" is just one name. So yes, one name.\nWait, actually, sometimes people might consider names like \"Stefan\" as having only one name part. So maybe I should count each artist by the number of words in their name.\n\nLet me list them out:\n1. Stefan Ilchev: Two parts? Or just one name. Hmm, maybe it's considered one name.\n2. Moto: One name.\n3. Poli Genova: Two names (Poli and Genova), but sometimes artists might have a single stage name. Wait, \"Poli Genova\" is two parts, so that's two names.\n4. Danny Milev: Two parts? So two names.\n5. Ivelina: One name.\n6. Grafa: One name.\n7. Sahara: One name.\n8. Mariana Popova: Two parts (Mariana and Popova), so two names.\n9. Jura Tone feat Lady B: This is a collaboration, but the main artist is Jura Tone, which might be one name.\n10. Stefan Dobrev: One name.\n11. Krassimir Avramov: One name.\n12. Nora: One name.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me go through each again:\n- Stefan Ilchev: \"Stefan\" is often considered as one name, even though sometimes people have two first names. So maybe it's one name.\n- Moto: Just \"Moto,\" so one name.\n- Poli Genova: \"Poli Genova\"\u2014two parts, so two names.\n- Danny Milev: Two parts (Danny and Milev), so two names.\n- Ivelina: One name.\n- Grafa: One name.\n- Sahara: One name.\n- Mariana Popova: Two names.\n- Jura Tone feat Lady B: Assuming the main artist is \"Jura Tone,\" which is one name.\n- Stefan Dobrev: One name.\n- Krassimir Avramov: One name.\n- Nora: One name.\n\nSo let's count how many have only one name:\nStefan Ilchev (1), Moto (2), Ivelina (5), Grafa (6), Sahara (7), Jura Tone (9), Stefan Dobrev (10), Krassimir Avramov (11), Nora (12). That's 9 artists. Wait, that can't be right because the claim says only 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each artist is considered to have only one name if their full name in the 'artist' column has no spaces or is a single word. So let me check:\n\n1. Stefan Ilchev: \"Stefan Ilchev\"\u2014two words, so two names.\n2. Moto: One word, so one name.\n3. Poli Genova: Two words, two names.\n4. Danny Milev: Two words, two names.\n5. Ivelina: One word, one name.\n6. Grafa: One word, one name.\n7. Sahara: One word, one name.\n8. Mariana Popova: Two words, two names.\n9. Jura Tone feat Lady B: The artist is \"Jura Tone,\" which is one word, so one name.\n10. Stefan Dobrev: One word, one name.\n11. Krassimir Avramov: One word, one name.\n12. Nora: One word, one name.\n\nSo the artists with only one name are Moto (row 1), Ivelina (5), Grafa (6), Sahara (7), Jura Tone (9), Stefan Dobrev (10), Krassimir Avramov (11), and Nora (12). That's a total of 8 artists. But the claim is about having exactly 5 artists with only one name. \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting again. Let me list them clearly:\n- Row 1: Moto \u2192 one name.\n- Row 2: Poli Genova \u2192 two names.\n- Row 3: Razstoyaniya's artist is Moto? Wait no, row 2 is Moto, and the song is razstoyaniya. So the artist is Moto (row 2), which we've already counted as one name.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list each row's artist and determine if it's a single name:\n\nRow 1: Stefan Ilchev \u2192 two names (Stefan and Ilchev) or just one? Sometimes people are known by their first name only, so maybe Stefan is considered one name.\n\nRow 2: Moto \u2192 one name.\n\nRow 3: Poli Genova \u2192 two names.\n\nRow 4: Danny Milev \u2192 two names.\n\nRow 5: Ivelina \u2192 one name.\n\nRow 6: Grafa \u2192 one name.\n\nRow 7: Sahara \u2192 one name.\n\nRow 8: Mariana Popova \u2192 two names.\n\nRow 9: Jura Tone feat Lady B \u2192 \"Jura Tone\" is the artist, so that's one name.\n\nRow 10: Stefan Dobrev \u2192 one name.\n\nRow 11: Krassimir Avramov \u2192 one name.\n\nRow 12: Nora \u2192 one name.\n\nSo now counting the single names:\nRows with one name: rows 1 (Stefan Ilchev\u2014maybe), row2 (Moto), row5, row6, row7, row9, row10, row11, row12. That's 9 artists if Stefan is counted as one name.\n\nBut maybe the claim considers \"Stefan Ilchev\" as two names because it has a first and last name, so perhaps he should not be included in single-name artists. Let me recount:\n\nSingle name artists:\nMoto (row2) \u2192 yes.\nIvelina (row5) \u2192 yes.\nGrafa (row6) \u2192 yes.\nSahara (row7) \u2192 yes.\nJura Tone (row9) \u2192 yes.\nStefan Dobrev (row10) \u2192 yes.\nKrassimir Avramov (row11) \u2192 yes.\nNora (row12) \u2192 yes.\n\nThat's 8. If Stefan Ilchev is considered two names, then it's 7 single-name artists, which still doesn't reach 5. So the claim is incorrect because there are more than 5 artists with only one name in this list.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Perhaps the correct approach is to count how many times \"single name\" occurs in the 'artist' column, regardless of first and last names. For example:\n\n1. Stefan Ilchev: First name (Stefan) plus last name (Ilchev). So two parts \u2192 not single.\n2. Moto: Just Moto \u2192 single.\n3. Poli Genova: Two parts \u2192 not single.\n4. Danny Milev: Two parts \u2192 not single.\n5. Ivelina: One part \u2192 single.\n6. Grafa: One part \u2192 single.\n7. Sahara: One part \u2192 single.\n8. Mariana Popova: Two parts \u2192 not single.\n9. Jura Tone feat Lady B: Main artist is Jura Tone, so one part \u2192 single.\n10. Stefan Dobrev: One part (Stefan) \u2192 single.\n11. Krassimir Avramov: One part (Krassimir) \u2192 single.\n12. Nora: One part \u2192 single.\n\nSo the single-name artists are rows 2,5,6,7,9,10,11,12 \u2192 total of 8 artists. That's more than 5, so the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again:\n\nRow 1: Stefan Ilchev \u2192 two names.\nRow 2: Moto \u2192 one name.\nRow3: Poli Genova \u2192 two.\nRow4: Danny Milev \u2192 two.\nRow5: Ivelina \u2192 one.\nRow6: Grafa \u2192 one.\nRow7: Sahara \u2192 one.\nRow8: Mariana Popova \u2192 two.\nRow9: Jura Tone \u2192 one.\nRow10: Stefan Dobrev \u2192 one.\nRow11: Krassimir Avramov \u2192 one.\nRow12: Nora \u2192 one.\n\nSo 2,5,6,7,9,10,11,12 are single names. That's 8 artists. So the claim that there are exactly 5 is wrong because there are more than 5. Therefore, the initial assessment that the claim is incorrect seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the term \"single name.\" Perhaps sometimes a stage name counts as a single name even if it's a combination of parts. For example, \"Jura Tone\" might be considered a single name, but \"Poli Genova\" isn't because it has two parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some cases, \"Moto\" is considered one name regardless of origin. So based on this analysis, the claim that there are 5 artists with only one name is incorrect because there are more than 5 (in fact, 8).\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the claim is incorrect because there are more than 5 artists listed in the table who have only one name.\n</think>\n\nThe claim stating that there are exactly five artists with only one name is incorrect. Upon reviewing each artist's name:\n\n- **Stefan Ilchev** (1): Considers as having two names.\n- **Moto** (2): Single name.\n- **Poli Genova** (3): Two names.\n- **Danny Milev** (4): Two names.\n- **Ivelina** (5): Single name.\n- **Grafa** (6): Single name.\n- **Sahara** (7): Single name.\n- **Mariana Popova** (8): Two names.\n- **Jura Tone** (9): Single name.\n- **Stefan Dobrev** (10): Single name.\n- **Krassimir Avramov** (11): Single name.\n- **Nora** (12): Single name.\n\nThere are 8 artists with single names, exceeding the claim's count of five. Thus, the assertion is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect as there are more than five artists listed with only one name.",

So, my task is to look through the 'televote / sms' column in the table and count how many times a score is less than 2%.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist with their respective scores. The relevant column here is \"televote / sms\". I'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Stefan Ilchev: 2.95% - this is above 2%, so doesn't count.\n2. Moto: 0.37% - below 2%, count = 1.\n3. Poli Genova: 11.74% - above, doesn't count.\n4. Danny Milev: 2.39% - just under 2%, wait, is 2.39 less than 2? No, because 2.39 is greater than 2 but less than 5. Wait, actually, the claim says \"under 2%\", so strictly less than 2. So 2.39 is not under 2% - it's over. So doesn't count.\n5. Ivelina: 2.53% - same as above, also over 2%, so no.\n6. Grafa: 3.91% - over, no.\n7. Sahara: 3.20% - over, no.\n8. Mariana Popova: 8.45% - over, no.\n9. Jura Tone feat Lady B: 2.03% - just under 2%, yes. So count = 2.\n10. Stefan Dobrev: 1.16% - definitely under, count = 3.\n11. Krassimir Avramov: 55.52% - way over, no.\n12. Nora: 5.75% - over, no.\n\nWait, let me recount. Moto is row 2 with 0.37%, Jura Tone is row 9 at 2.03%, and Stefan Dobrev is row 10 at 1.16%. That makes three artists whose scores are under 2%.\n\nSo the claim says there are five such artists.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to suggest that there are three artists named Stefan in the table. The term \"call stefan\" might mean that these artists are involved or perhaps contacted, but the key part is identifying how many times \"Stefan\" appears as an artist name in the table.\n\nNow, I'll examine each row of the table to find all entries where the artist's name is \"Stefan\". Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Artist is Stefan Ilchev.\n2. Row 10: Artist is Stefan Dobrev.\n3. Any others?

Are there any other rows with \"Stefan\"?\n\nNo, I don't see another entry for Stefan in the table. So, that makes a total of two Stefans.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"there be 3 artist call stefan.\" If there are only two artists named Stefan, then the claim is incorrect because it's stating there are three.\n\nBut perhaps the term \"call\" refers to something else, like votes or televotes? Looking at the table, each row has a \"televote / sms\" column. However, this column doesn't seem relevant to counting the number of artists named Stefan. The artist names are what matter here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are only two artists named Stefan in the table.

The claim is: \"the word 'love' be use in a song 2 time.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see which songs contain the word \"love.\" The relevant column here is \"song,\" so I'll go through that column one by one.\n\nStarting from row 0: The song is \"get up.\" Does that have 'love'? Let me think... No, it's about getting up, not love. So, move on.\n\nRow 1: \"razstoyaniya.\" Doesn't sound like it. Next.\n\nRow 2: \"one lifetime is not enough.\" Hmm, does that have 'love'? Well, it's more about life span, so no.\n\nRow 3: \"nyama vreme.\" Doesn't seem to relate to love. Moving on.\n\nRow 4: \"ready for love.\" Ah! Here we go. The song title explicitly includes \"love.\" So that's one occurrence.\n\nRow 5: \"don't kiss for the money.\" No, that's about not kissing for money, not love.\n\nRow 6: \"chance to love you.\" Okay, this one definitely has 'love' in it. That's the second time we've found a song with 'love.'\n\nRow 7: \"crazy.\" Doesn't have 'love.' Next.\n\nRow 8: \"everlasting.\" Hmm, that could relate to love, but I'm not sure if it's directly using the word. It means lasting forever, so maybe, but let me check the exact wording. The title is \"everlasting,\" which doesn't include 'love,' so no.\n\nRow 9: \"illusion.\" No mention of love here.\n\nRow 10: \"it 's not right.\" No, that's about something not being right.\n\nRow 11: \"illusion.\" Again, no.\n\nRow 12: \"it 's not right.\" Same as above.\n\nWait, but earlier I found two songs with 'love': row 4 and row 6. So that makes two uses of the word 'love' in song titles. Therefore, the claim says it's used twice, which is correct. But wait, let me double-check each song to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking again at each song:\n\n- Row 0: get up \u2192 no\n- Row1: razstoyaniya \u2192 no\n- Row2: one lifetime is not enough \u2192 no\n- Row3: nyama vreme \u2192 no\n- Row4: ready for love \u2192 yes (love)\n- Row5: chance to love you \u2192 yes (love)\nWait, that's two uses. But actually, looking back, I think I miscounted earlier. So, rows 4 and 6 both have 'love' in their song titles.\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nRow4: \"ready for love\" \u2192 love\nRow5: \"chance to love you\" \u2192 love\n\nSo that's two uses. Wait no, row4 is index 4, row5 is index5? Or am I mixing up the indexes.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, each row has a draw number from 1 to 12. So:\n\nRow0: draw=1\nRow1: draw=2\n...\nSo in the table provided, the rows are numbered from 0 to 11 (since there are 12 entries). Wait no, the first row is index 0 with draw=1, up to row11 with draw=12.\n\nBut regardless of indexing, when looking for 'love' in song titles:\n\nRow4: \"nyama vreme\" \u2192 no\nRow5: \"chance to love you\" \u2192 yes\nWait, no. Wait, the user's table has the first row as draw 1, so let me list out all songs with 'love':\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row0 (draw1): get up \u2192 no\n- Row1 (draw2): razstoyaniya \u2192 no\n- Row2 (draw3): one lifetime is not enough \u2192 no\n- Row3 (draw4): nyama vreme \u2192 no\n- Row4 (draw5): ready for love \u2192 yes, 'love' in title\n- Row5 (draw6): chance to love you \u2192 yes, 'love' in title\n- Row6 (draw7): don't kiss for the money \u2192 no\n- Row7 (draw8): don't kiss for the money \u2192 wait, no, row7 is draw8? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the table has 12 rows. The first row (index0) is draw=1, and the last row (index11) is draw=12.\n\nLooking at each song:\n\nRow4: index4, song \"nyama vreme\" \u2192 no\nRow5: index5, song \"chance to love you\" \u2192 yes\nRow6: index6, song \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2192 no\nWait, I think I confused the indexing earlier. Let me go through each row properly.\n\nActually, let's list all songs:\n\n1. get up\n2. razstoyaniya\n3. one lifetime is not enough\n4. nyama vreme\n5. ready for love\n6. chance to love you\n7. don't kiss for the money\n8. crazy\n9. everlasting\n10. illusion\n11. it's not right\n\nWait, so in this list:\n\n- Song 5: \"ready for love\" \u2192 yes\n- Song6: \"chance to love you\" \u2192 yes\n\nSo that's two songs with 'love' in their titles.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"you are tasked to identify how many times the word 'LOVE' appears as a standalone word in the title of the songs. We have observed that it appears twice.\" So the answer would be 2.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other songs with 'love.' For example:\n\n- Song5: \"chance to love you\" \u2192 yes\n- Any others?\n\nLooking at each:\n\n1. get up \u2192 no\n2. razstoyaniya \u2192 no\n3. one lifetime is not enough \u2192 no\n4. nyama vreme \u2192 no\n5. ready for love \u2192 yes\n6. chance to love you \u2192 yes\n7. don't kiss for the money \u2192 no\n8. crazy \u2192 no\n9. everlasting \u2192 no, it's about lasting, not love.\n10. illusion \u2192 no\n11. it's not right \u2192 no\n\nSo only two instances where 'love' appears as a standalone word in song titles.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying how many times the word \"LOVE\" appears as a standalone word in the title of the given songs. Upon reviewing each song title, we find that the word \"LOVE\" appears twice:\n\n1. \"ready for love\"\n2. \"chance to love you\"\n\n**Answer:** The word \"LOVE\" appears **twice** in the titles of the songs.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about various artists and their songs, including the televote/sms percentage and their place. The claim is that \"4 of the artist use a one name song.\" I need to check if this is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a \"one name song.\" From my understanding, a one-name song means that the song's title uses only one word. For example, songs like \"Love\" or \"Crazy\" would be one-word titles, while something like \"Don't Kiss for the Money\" has multiple words.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to see which artists have songs with only one name (i.e., single-word titles).\n\nLooking at the 'song' column:\n\n1. \"get up\" - two words.\n2. \"razstoyaniya\" - likely a single word, but it's in Cyrillic. Since I'm not sure about its meaning, maybe it's considered one name? Wait, no\u2014wait, the claim is about the artist using a one-name song, so it's about the song title being one name, not the artist.\n\nWait, the column is 'song', so each entry there is the song title. So for each row, we check if the song has only one word or is considered as such.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. \"get up\" - two words.\n2. \"razstoyaniya\" - I think this might be a single word, possibly meaning \"Separation.\" So that's one name.\n3. \"one lifetime is not enough\" - multiple words.\n4. \"nyama vreme\" - likely one word, perhaps meaning \"Time Is Short.\" One name.\n5. \"ready for love\" - two words.\n6. \"vrag\" - seems to be one word, possibly meaning \"Enemy.\" So that's a one-name song.\n7. \"don't kiss for the money\" - multiple words with apostrophe, so not one word.\n8. \"crazy\" - single word. One name.\n9. \"chance to love you\" - two words.\n10. \"everlasting\" - single word. One name.\n11. \"illusion\" - single word. One name.\n12. \"it 's not right\" - multiple words, with apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's count how many have songs that are one-word titles:\n\n- Row 2: razstoyaniya (1)\n- Row 4: nyama vreme (1)\n- Row 6: vrag (1)\n- Row 8: crazy (1)\n- Row 10: everlasting (1)\n- Row 11: illusion (1)\n\nWait, that's six songs with one-word titles. But the claim is that \"4 of the artist use a one name song.\" Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nLooking back at each row:\n\nRow 2: razstoyaniya - 1\nRow 4: nyama vreme - 1\nRow 6: vrag - 1\nRow 8: crazy - 1\nRow 10: everlasting - 1\nRow 11: illusion - 1\n\nThat's six artists, but the claim is about four. So either I'm miscounting or perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe some of these songs have more than one word but are considered as single names in the language? For example, \"vrag\" might actually be a single name, not just one word. But regardless, for the purpose of this analysis, it's about the song title being one word.\n\nSo, if there are six artists with one-word song titles, then the claim that four do so is false. However, perhaps I made an error in considering some as two words when they aren't.\n\nLet me check each song again:\n\n1. \"get up\" - two words.\n2. \"razstoyaniya\" - likely one word.\n3. \"one lifetime is not enough\" - multiple.\n4. \"nyama vreme\" - possibly two? Wait, \"vreme\" means time in Bulgarian, so maybe it's \"Nyama Vreme\"\u2014two words? Or is it one? If it's written as \"nyama vreme\" without a space, perhaps it's considered one word? I'm not sure. Similarly for \"razstoyaniya,\" which might be two words if split.\n\nWait, actually, the table lists them as separate entries. For example:\n\n- Row 2: artist is moto, song is razstoyaniya.\n- Row 4: song is nyama vreme.\nSo if it's written without spaces, perhaps they are single words.\n\nBut in reality, \"razstoyaniya\" might be two words, but I'm not certain. Similarly, \"nyama vreme\" could be two words or one depending on context.\n\nSimilarly, \"vrag\" is likely a single word meaning enemy.\n\nSo perhaps rows 2,4,6,8,10,11 have songs that are considered one-word titles. That's six. But the claim says four. So unless some of these are not actually one-word songs, which I might be misjudging, the count could differ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases, the song titles have apostrophes or other punctuation but still count as single words. For example, \"it 's not right\" has an apostrophe but is still considered two words: it and s.\n\nSo, perhaps rows 2,4,6,8,10,11 are six artists with one-word songs.\n\nThus, the claim that four do so would be incorrect. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the number is higher than four.\n\nWait, but let me think again\u2014maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might just consider any song title without spaces as a single name, regardless of language.\n\nIn that case:\n\nRow 2: razstoyaniya - no space, so one word.\nRow4: nyama vreme - no space, so one word.\nRow6: vrag - one word.\nRow8: crazy - one word.\nRow10: everlasting - one word.\nRow11: illusion - one word.\n\nThat's six songs, each with a single word, meaning six artists. So the claim that four do is incorrect; it's actually six.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"you are tasked to...\" so perhaps I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of these are not meant to be considered as one-word titles because they have multiple syllables but still are written without spaces. For example, in English, \"getup\" might be written as one word, but if it's \"get up,\" with a space, it's two words.\n\nBut in the table, for row2: song is razstoyaniya\u2014no space. So perhaps that's considered one word.\n\nSimilarly, nyama vreme\u2014no space, so one word.\n\nThus, rows 2,4,6,8,10,11 are six artists with songs that are single-word titles.\n\nTherefore, the claim that four do is incorrect; the correct number is six.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might consider any song title as a one-name song if it's only one word, regardless of language. So, six artists.\n\nBut the task is to determine whether the number in the claim (four) is accurate or not.\n\nSo, in conclusion, since there are six artists with songs that have single-word titles, the claim that four do is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that four artists use a one-name song is inaccurate. Upon examining each artist's song title, it was found that six artists have songs with only one word: rows 2 (razstoyaniya), 4 (nyama vreme), 6 (vrag), 8 (crazy), 10 (everlasting), and 11 (illusion). Therefore, the correct number of artists using a one-name song is six, not four.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect; there are actually six artists with one-word songs.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be a 70 percentage point difference between first and last place\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It mentions a 70 percentage point difference between the first and last place in the table. My goal is to find if such a difference exists between these two positions.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, and place. The 'place' column seems to indicate the position of each entry. So, the first place would be where place=1, and the last place is where place=12.\n\nTo find the percentage difference between these two positions, I need to look at the 'televote / sms' percentages for the first and last entries. Let's locate those rows.\n\nThe first row has draw 1, artist Stefan Ilchev, song \"Get Up,\" with a televote/sms of 2.95%. The last row is draw 12, Nora, and \"it 's not right\" with a televote/sms of 5.75%.\n\nNow, calculating the difference: 5.75% (last place) minus 2.95% (first place) equals 2.8 percentage points. That's nowhere near 70 percentage points. In fact, it's just about 3 percentage points.\n\nWait a second, that seems way off. Maybe I misread the table. Let me double-check. No, the 'televote / sms' for first is 2.95% and last is 5.75%, so the difference is indeed around 2.8%. That's not 70.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to the positions themselves rather than the percentages. But that doesn't make sense because a 70 percentage point difference in positions would imply something else, which isn't relevant here. The claim specifically mentions percentages, so it must be about the televote/sms column.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I should check if there's any row with 70% in 'televote / sms'. Scanning through, the highest I see is Krassimir Avramov at 55.52%. No one has 70%. So even if we considered other rows, there's no data point near 70%.\n\nAdditionally, the claim says between first and last place, but looking at the 'place' column, it's 1 to 12. The percentage points only go up to around 11 or so, not reaching 70.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the maximum percentage difference between first (2.95%) and last (5.75%) is about 2.8%, nowhere near 70. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests a 70% point difference in percentages between first and last places, but upon checking, the actual difference is only ~2.8%. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the winner has the longest song title\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that the winner of something (probably a competition or a show) has a song with the longest title. So, I need to check which row in the table represents the winner and then see if their song title is the longest.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, place. The 'draw' column seems to be an index, probably indicating the order of entries. The 'place' column might indicate the ranking or position, with lower numbers being higher positions (like 1st place, 2nd place, etc.). So, the winner would likely be in the row with the highest place number or the lowest numerical value in the 'place' column.\n\nLet me check each row's 'place' to see which is the highest. The first row has a 'place' of 7, then 12, 2, 9, 8, 5, 6, 3, 10, 11, 1, 4. Wait, that can't be right because the last row (row 12) has a place of 4, and row 11 has a place of 1. Since 'place' is likely an ordinal position, lower numbers mean higher ranking. So, row 11 has place 1, which is first place. That's probably the winner.\n\nNow, looking at the song titles in each row:\n\nRow 0: get up\nRow 1: razstoyaniya\nRow 2: one lifetime is not enough\nRow 3: nyama vreme\nRow 4: ready for love\nRow 5: vrag\nRow 6: don't kiss for the money\nRow 7: crazy\nRow 8: chance to love you\nRow 9: everlasting\nRow 10: illusion\nRow 11: it's not right\n\nWait, no, row indices are from 0 to 12. So row 11 is index 11, which has a place of 1, making it the winner.\n\nThe song title in row 11 is \"illusion\" and its length is 7 characters (assuming we count each letter). Let's check other rows to see if any have longer song titles.\n\nLooking at all the song titles:\n\n- get up: 6\n- razstoyaniya: 12\n- one lifetime is not enough: 21\n- nyama vreme: 8\n- ready for love: 13\n- vrag: 4\n- don't kiss for the money: 20 (including apostrophe and spaces)\n- crazy: 5\n- chance to love you: 16\n- everlasting: 10\n- illusion: 7\n- it's not right: 12\n\nWait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me count each song title correctly.\n\nRow 0: get up - 6 letters\nRow 1: razstoyaniya - 12 letters\nRow 2: one lifetime is not enough - that's 21 letters (counting each character including spaces)\nRow 3: nyama vreme - 8 letters\nRow 4: ready for love - 13 letters\nRow 5: vrag - 4 letters\nRow 6: don't kiss for the money - let's count: \"don't kiss for the money\" is D-O-N-T- K-I-S-S- F-O-R- T-H-E- M-O-N-E-Y. That's 20 characters (including apostrophe)\nRow 7: crazy - 5 letters\nRow 8: chance to love you - let's see, \"chance to love you\" is C-H-A-N-C-E- space- T-O- space- L-O-V-E- space- Y-O-U. That's 14 characters.\nWait, no: \"chance to love you\" has 13 letters including spaces? Let me count:\n\nc h a n c e   t o   l o v e   y o u \u2192 that's 1+5 (chance) +2 (to) +4 (love) +3 (you) plus the spaces. Wait, actually, each space is a character, so \"chance to love you\" has:\n\nc h a n c e (6) + space (1) + t o (2) + space (1) + l o v e (4) + space (1) + y o u (3). Total: 6+1+2+1+4+1+3 = 18 characters.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The actual song titles in the table are:\n\nLooking back at row indices:\n\nRow 0: get up\nRow 1: razstoyaniya\nRow 2: one lifetime is not enough\nRow 3: nyama vreme\nRow 4: ready for love\nRow 5: vrag\nRow 6: don't kiss for the money\nRow 7: crazy\nRow 8: chance to love you\nRow 9: everlasting\nRow 10: illusion\nRow 11: it's not right\n\nWait, I think I missed row 12 earlier. The table goes up to row 12 (place of 4). So the song titles in rows 0-12 are as above.\n\nNow, \"one lifetime is not enough\" is the longest at 21 characters, \"don't kiss for the money\" is 20 characters, and \"chance to love you\" is 18, \"ready for love\" is 13, \"razstoyaniya\" is 12, \"it's not right\" is 12, and so on.\n\nSo, the longest song title is in row 2: one lifetime is not enough (21 letters), but that's in row 2 which has a place of 2. However, the winner is in row 11 with a place of 1.\n\nLooking at row 11, \"it's not right\" is 12 characters. So, among the songs, the longest song title is 21 characters, owned by the artist in row 2 (place 2). But the winner is row 11 (place 1) with a 12-character song title.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The statement says the winner has the longest song title, but according to this, the winner's song is not the longest. Unless I made a mistake in identifying the winner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"one lifetime is not enough\" is longer, but it's not the winner. So, the claim that the winner has the longest song title would be false.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe the 'place' column indicates something else, like regional rankings or something where 1 might mean the highest in their category. Alternatively, maybe I misread the place numbers.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe 'place' column entries are: 7,12,2,9,8,5,6,3,10,11,1,4 (for rows 0 to 11). So row 11 has place 1, which is first. Therefore, they are the overall winner.\n\nNow, their song title is \"it's not right\" with 12 characters. But earlier in row 2, there's a longer song title, but that's not the winner.\n\nSo, according to this, the winner does NOT have the longest song title; someone else does. Therefore, the original statement would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the 'place' numbers. Maybe the place is based on different criteria. For example, if 1 means the lowest ranking, but that's less likely because usually lower numbers indicate higher positions.\n\nWait, in some contexts, like competitions, a lower numerical value could mean a better rank (like 1st, 2nd). So row 11 with 'place' 1 is indeed first place. Therefore, their song title \"it's not right\" has 12 characters.\n\nBut looking at the other songs:\n\nRow 2: one lifetime is not enough \u2192 21 characters\nRow 6: don't kiss for the money \u2192 20 characters\nRow 8: chance to love you \u2192 18 characters\nRow 4: ready for love \u219213\nRow 1: razstoyaniya \u219212\nRow 11: it's not right \u219212\n\nSo, the longest song title is in row 2, which isn't the winner. Therefore, the initial statement that the winner has the longest song title is false.\n\nUnless I missed something. Maybe \"one lifetime is not enough\" is the winner? But no, their place is 2, which is higher than row 11's 1, meaning row 2 is placed lower (worse) than row 11.\n\nSo, conclusion: The winner has a song title of \"it's not right\", which is only 12 characters. There exists a longer song title by the artist in row 2, but that's not the winner. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe original claim is incorrect. The winner, determined by the 'place' column with row 11 having the lowest value of 1, does not possess the longest song title among the entries. While \"one lifetime is not enough\" and \"don't kiss for the money\" have the longest titles (21 and 20 characters respectively), neither corresponds to the winner's entry.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect; the winner does not have the longest song title.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asking. It says that two songs have their titles in English. So, I should look through the 'song' column of the table and check which ones are in English.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'song' entry. I'll go through each one:\n\n1. Row 0: \"get up\" \u2013 this seems to be in English.\n2. Row 1: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 doesn't look like English.\n3. Row 2: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 definitely English.\n4. Row 3: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 sounds Russian, so not English.\n5. Row 4: \"ready for love\" \u2013 English.\n6. Row 5: \"vrag\" \u2013 likely Russian.\n7. Row 6: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2013 English.\n8. Row 7: \"crazy\" \u2013 English.\n9. Row 8: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 English.\n10. Row 9: \"everlasting\" \u2013 English.\n11. Row 10: \"illusion\" \u2013 Probably Russian.\n12. Row 11: \"it 's not right\" \u2013 English, though it's written with an apostrophe, but still in English.\n\nNow, I need to count how many songs are in English. Let's see:\n\n- Rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 have English song titles. That's eight songs. Wait, that's more than two. But the claim says \"two song title be in english,\" so maybe I misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is a bit ambiguous. It could mean exactly two or at least two. If it's exactly two, then my count of eight would make the claim false. However, if it's at least two, then even though there are more than two, the claim might still hold as true. But typically, when someone says \"two,\" they're referring to exactly two.\n\nLooking back, the claim is in lowercase: \"2 song title be in english.\" Maybe it's a typo and should be \"2 songs\" instead of \"song titles.\" So perhaps the user meant that two song titles are in English, not that each song title has two letters or something else. That makes sense because if each song had to have a two-letter title, there would only be some like \"it 's not right,\" but that's five letters including the apostrophe.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"2 song title be in english.\" Maybe it's miswritten and they meant to say two songs. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that there are at least two song titles in English. If so, then since I found more than two, the claim would be true.\n\nBut another angle: maybe the user intended that each song's title is entirely in English letters. Looking at the 'song' column:\n\n- \"get up\" \u2013 all letters\n- \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 has Cyrillic letters\n- \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 English\n- \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 Cyrillic\n- \"ready for love\" \u2013 English\n- \"vrag\" \u2013 Cyrillic\n- \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2013 English\n- \"crazy\" \u2013 English\n- \"chance to love you\" \u2013 English\n- \"everlasting\" \u2013 English\n- \"illusion\" \u2013 Cyrillic\n- \"it 's not right\" \u2013 mostly English with an apostrophe\n\nSo, excluding those with Cyrillic letters, the songs in English are:\n\nRows 0,2,4,6,7,8,9,11. That's eight songs.\n\nBut wait, row 11: \"illusion\" is likely Cyrillic. Let me check: \"illusion\" \u2013 yes, it's an English word but spelled correctly here? Wait, no, in Cyrillic, the letter '\u043b' would be used for 'l,' but here it's spelled as \"illusion,\" which in Cyrilic would actually be different letters. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nIn any case, there are at least two songs with English titles: rows 0 (\"get up\") and row 2 (\"one lifetime is not enough\"). So even if the claim was exactly two, it's true because there are more than two. But if the user meant exactly two, then maybe it's about two specific songs, but from the table, I can see that at least two are in English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is miswritten and intended to say \"two song titles are in English.\" Therefore, the answer would be TRUE because there are more than two, so it's definitely not false.\n\nWait, but if the claim is exactly two, then since there are eight, it's true that at least two exist. So regardless of whether it's exactly two or at least two, the claim holds as true.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is true, I analyzed the 'song' column for English titles.\n\n- **Row 0**: \"get up\" \u2013 English\n- **Row 1**: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 Not English\n- **Row 2**: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 English\n- **Row 3**: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 Not English\n- **Row 4**: \"ready for love\" \u2013 English\n- **Row 5**: \"vrag\" \u2013 Not English\n- **Row 6**: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2013 English\n- **Row 7**: \"crazy\" \u2013 English\n- **Row 8**: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 English\n- **Row 9**: \"everlasting\" \u2013 English\n- **Row 10**: \"illusion\" \u2013 Not English\n- **Row 11**: \"it 's not right\" \u2013 English\n\nThere are at least two songs with English titles: Row 0 and Row 2. Even if the claim refers to exactly two, since there are more than two, it holds true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true because there are multiple song titles in English.",
