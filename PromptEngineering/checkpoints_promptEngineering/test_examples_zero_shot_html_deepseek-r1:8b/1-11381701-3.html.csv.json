    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"bada have a value of 0.05% on july - 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions \"bada\" and a specific date range \"july - 13\". The value given is 0.05%. So, my task is to find in the table if there's an entry for bada on July 13 with exactly 0.05% as its value.\n\nI'll start by examining the structure of the HTML table provided. The table has several columns: source, date, method, and various OS distributions like iOS, Android, BlackBerry, etc., including \"bada\". Each row represents a different data source or measurement period.\n\nNext, I'll scan through each row to find where \"bada\" is mentioned and what the corresponding value is. Looking at the rows:\n\n1. The first row (row_index 0) mentions \"comscore reports (us only)\" with date \"may - 13\". It doesn't have a \"bada\" column.\n2. The second row (index 1) is about Gartner, May 13, and units sold. No bada here either.\n3. Third row (index 2), also Gartner but for August 13. Again, no bada.\n4. Fourth row (index 3) is IDC, May 13, units shipped. Still no bada.\n5. Fifth row (index 4) is Net Market Share, July 13, browsing data. This is the relevant one because it's July - 13.\n6. Sixth row (index 5) is StatCounter Global Stats, also July 13. No bada here.\n7. Seventh row (index 6) is Wikimedia, March 13. Not relevant.\n\nFocusing on row index 4, Net Market Share for July 13: looking at the columns, under \"bada\" it says 0.05%. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nTo ensure there are no other relevant cells, I'll double-check that there isn't another row with bada and July 13. From the table, only row index 4 has both \"july - 13\" and mentions \"bada\", showing 0.05%. There's another row for StatCounter Global Stats (index 5) on July 13, but it doesn't list \"bada\"; instead, it lists \"symbian / series 40\" as 20.76%, which is a different OS.\n\nTherefore, the claim correctly references bada's value of 0.05% on July 13.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bada\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim states: \"window have a percentage of 1.85% when other be 0.7%.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to compare two percentages: one for \"windows\" and another for \"other\". Specifically, it's asserting that the windows column has 1.85%, and the other column has 0.7%. So, my task is to check if this specific data exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows with different sources like comscore, gartner, IDC, net market share, statcounter, and wikimedia. Each row provides data across various platforms including iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian/Series 40, Bada, Windows, and Other.\n\nI need to identify which row and column correspond to \"windows\" and \"other\". From the table headers, the columns are:\n\n- source\n- date\n- method\n- ios\n- android\n- blackberry\n- symbian / series 40\n- badA\n- windows\n- other\n\nSo, the relevant columns for the claim are \"windows\" and \"other\".\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to find where \"windows\" is present. \n\nStarting with the first data row (row 0), the source is comscore reports (us only). Under \"windows\", it shows 3.00%. That's not 1.85%, so this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 2 is from gartner, date August -13, method units sold. The windows column here is 3.3%. Still not matching 1.85%.\n\nRow 3: same source as before but different date (Aug-13 again? Wait, no, looking back, row indices are a bit confusing because the first row after <thead> is row 0, then rows go on from there. So row numbers correspond to each <tr>, starting from 0.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: comscore\n- Row 1: gartner May-13\n- Row 2: gartner Aug-13\n- Row 3: IDC May-13\n- Row 4: net market share July-13\n- Row 5: statcounter July-13\n- Row 6: wikimedia Mar-13\n\nSo, I'm looking for the row where windows is 1.85% and other is 0.7%.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 4 (net market share) has a method of \"browsing\" with windows showing 0.19%. Not matching.\n\nRow 5 (statcounter): windows show 2.66%, not 1.85%.\n\nRow 6 (wikimedia): windows is 0.7%, but other is also 0.42%. So, the percentages are different from the claim which states that when window is 1.85% and other is 0.7%.\n\nWait, in row 6, \"windows\" is 0.7% and \"other\" is 0.42%. That doesn't match the claim where windows should be higher at 1.85% and other lower at 0.7%. So this row isn't relevant.\n\nLooking through all rows, none have a windows percentage of exactly 1.85%. The closest is row 6 with 0.7%, but that's not 1.85%. So the claim might be false because such data doesn't exist in any row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is trying to compare two different sources or time periods where one has windows at 1.85% and other at 0.7%. But looking through all the rows, no such combination exists.\n\nTherefore, since there's no row where \"windows\" is 1.85% and \"other\" is 0.7%, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each relevant cell in the table for \"Windows\" and \"Other\" columns looking for a combined value of 1.85% for Windows and 0.7% for Other. Since no such data exists, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"windows\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"other\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says, \"international data corporation show that blackberry have a percentage of 2.9% on may - 13.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify the relevant parts. The table has several columns: source, date, method, and various platforms like iOS, Android, BlackBerry, etc. The claim is about BlackBerry's percentage as reported by International Data Corporation in May -13.\n\nLooking through the table rows one by one:\n\n1. The first row is comscore reports (US only). The relevant data here is for US subscribers, so it might not be the same as global stats from IDC. But since the claim mentions \"international data corporation,\" I'll check their entries.\n2. Gartner's May -13 report shows BlackBerry at 3.0%, which doesn't match 2.9%. So that's different.\n3. Gartner's August -13 has BlackBerry at 2.7%, still not 2.9%.\n4. International Data Corporation (IDC) row for May -13: I see the iOS is 75.0%, Android is 2.9%. Wait, that's Android, not BlackBerry. So IDC might have a different figure for BlackBerry? Let me check again.\n5. Net Market Share July -13 has BlackBerry at 2.23%, which doesn't match.\n6. StatCounter Global Stats July -13 shows BlackBerry at 20.76%, way higher than 2.9%.\n7. Wikimedia March -13: BlackBerry is at 3.03%, so no.\n\nWait, I might have missed something in the IDC row. Let me check again. The method for IDC is \"units shipped,\" and their numbers for May -13 show Android at 2.9%. BlackBerry's figure here isn't explicitly mentioned; perhaps it's zero or not listed? So maybe the claim is referring to another source.\n\nLooking back, the claim says \"blackberry have a percentage of 2.9%.\" In the table, I don't see any row for IDC specifically mentioning BlackBerry at 2.9%. Instead, Gartner has May -13 as 3.0%, which is close but not exactly 2.9%.\n\nSo the claim might be incorrect because the exact figure isn't present in the relevant source's (IDC) data.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"android be 25.28% use and window in 1.15%\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. First, I'll break down the claim into two parts: Android being 25.28%, and Windows being 1.15%.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to find where these numbers might appear. \n\nStarting with the first data row (row_index 0), the Android column has 52.40%. That's higher than 25.28%, so this doesn't match the claim. The Windows column here is 3.00%, which is much lower than 1.15%, so that also doesn't fit.\n\nNext, row 1: Gartner May-13 data. Android is 74.4%, way above 25.28%. Windows here is 2.9%, still not matching. \n\nRow 2: Gartner Aug-13. Android jumps to 79.0% and Windows to 3.3%. Both higher than the claim's percentages.\n\nRow 3: IDC May-13. Android is at 75.0%, which doesn't match, and Windows is 0.0%, not 1.15%.\n\nMoving to row 4: Net Market Share July-13. Android here is 25.28%. That matches exactly with the first part of the claim. Now checking Windows for this row, it's 0.19%, which doesn't match the 1.15% in the claim.\n\nRow 5: Statcounter Global Stats July-13. Android is 38.34%, higher than needed, and Windows is 2.66%, not matching.\n\nFinally, row 6: Wikimedia March-13. Android is 25.93%, close but not exactly 25.28%. Windows here is 0.7%, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, the claim's first part (Android at 25.28%) matches row 4 of the table. However, the second part about Windows being 1.15% isn't found in any row. Therefore, only one part is supported, so the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"android\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"windows\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the largest window use percentage comes from net market share\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about which source has the highest percentage for 'window' usage. So, I need to look at the 'windows' column in the table and check the percentages for each row, especially the one labeled 'net market share'.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **First row (comscore reports):** 3.00%\n2. **Second row (gartner - May):** 2.9%\n3. **Third row (gartner - Aug):** 3.3%\n4. **Fourth row (IDC):** 0.0%\n5. **Fifth row (net market share):** 0.19%\n6. **Sixth row (statcounter):** 2.66%\n7. **Seventh row (wikimedia):** 0.7%\n\nWait a minute, the percentages for 'windows' in these rows seem very low, mostly around 0%, except for statcounter which is 2.66%. None of them are particularly high. So if the claim is about the largest percentage, it must be considering that net market share has the highest among all.\n\nBut looking again, perhaps I misread the 'window' column. Let me check each row's 'windows' value:\n\n- comscore: 3.00%\n- gartner May: 2.9%\n- gartner Aug: 3.3%\n- IDC: 0.0%\n- net market share: 0.19%\n- statcounter: 2.66%\n- wikipedia: 0.7%\n\nWait, no row has a significantly higher percentage in the 'windows' column. The highest is 3.3% from gartner August, then 3.00%, then 2.9%, followed by lower percentages.\n\nSo net market share only has 0.19%, which isn't even close to being the largest. Therefore, the claim that \"net market share\" has the largest window use percentage is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I misread 'window' as another column? Let me check if there's a different column for something else. No, the columns are source, date, method, and then various platforms including 'windows'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because net market share doesn't have the highest window use percentage.

I need to determine whether the claim \"bada have a value of 25.28% on may - 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions \"bada\" and specifies the date \"may - 13\". So, my focus should be on finding any cells in the table that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different source, like comscore reports or gartner, and each column corresponds to a specific platform or category. The relevant columns here are \"bada\" and the date \"may - 13\". \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where the date is May - 13. Let's go row by row:\n\n1. First row: source is comscore reports (us only), date is may - 13.\n2. Second row: gartner, may - 13.\n3. Third row: gartner, aug - 13.\n4. Fourth row: international data corporation, may - 13.\n5. Fifth row: net market share, july - 13.\n6. Sixth row: statcounter global stats, july - 13.\n7. Seventh row: wikimedia, mar - 13.\n\nFrom this, the rows with \"may - 13\" are the first, second, and fourth. Now, I'll check if any of these rows have a value under the \"bada\" column.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- First row (comscore reports): The \"bada\" cell is marked as \"n / a\". So no data there.\n- Second row (gartner): There's no mention of \"bada\" in their columns. Their platforms include iOS, android, blackberry, symbian / series 40, bada, windows, and other. In this case, under \"bada\", the value is listed as 0.7%. Wait, but let me check that again.\n- Fourth row (international data corporation): Again, looking for \"bada\" in their columns. The platforms are iOS, android, blackberry, symbian / series 40, bada, windows, other. Their \"bada\" cell is n/a.\n\nWait a second, the second row's source is gartner and date may -13, but under \"bada\", it shows 0.7%. However, the claim specifies \"bada have a value of 25.28% on may - 13.\" That doesn't match with 0.7%.\n\nBut hold on, I think I might have misread the columns. Let me double-check each column name. The columns are source, date, method, ios, android, blackberry, symbian / series 40, bada, windows, other.\n\nSo in row 2 (gartner, may -13), the \"bada\" column has a value of 0.7%. That's not 25.28%.\n\nLooking at all the rows with date May -13:\n\n1. comscore reports: bada is n/a.\n4. international data corporation: bada is n/a.\n\nSo none of these have a bada value of 25.28%. Therefore, there's no row where \"bada\" equals 25.28% on may -13.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked another source. Let me check again. The first row (comscore) has \"n/a\" for bada. The fourth row (IDC) also n/a. Gartner in may -13 has 0.7%. None of these match 25.28%.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by any cell in the table.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in front of me, and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"window have a percentage of 1.80% lower when other be 0.3%.\" Hmm, I need to figure out if that's true based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"window,\" which should refer to the \"windows\" column in the table. The claim is comparing two percentages: one for windows and another for \"other.\" Specifically, it says when other is 0.3%, the window's percentage is 1.80% lower.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different source, and the columns show various platforms like iOS, Android, BlackBerry, etc., including Windows and Other. So, for each row, which corresponds to a source, I need to check if there's a situation where \"Other\" is 0.3% and \"Windows\" is 1.80% lower.\n\nI should go through each row one by one. Let me start with the first row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Source is comscore reports (us only). Other is n/a, so that's not applicable. Windows is 3%, but since other is n/a, we can't use this for comparison.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Gartner, May -13. Windows is 2.9%. Other is 0.3%. Hmm, here, other is 0.3% and windows are 2.9%. So, 2.9 minus 0.3 is 2.6%, which isn't a 1.80% lower. So this doesn't match the claim.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Gartner, Aug -13. Other is 0.2%. Windows are 3.3%. That's a difference of about 3.1%, still not 1.8%.\n\n4. **Row 3**: International Data Corporation, May-13. Other is 0.0%. Windows are 0.0%. So other is 0%, which doesn't meet the 0.3% needed.\n\n5. **Row 4**: Net Market Share, July -13. Windows are 0.19%. Other is 0.05%. Doesn't fit because other isn't 0.3%.\n\n6. **Row 5**: StatCounter Global Stats, July-13. Windows are 2.66%, other is 4.64%. Not relevant since other is higher than windows.\n\n7. **Row 6**: Wikimedia, Mar -13. Windows are 0.7%, other is 0.42%. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed something. Let me go back to Row 1 again. Gartner May-13: Other is 0.3%, windows 2.9%. So the difference is 2.6% higher, not lower. That's not matching 1.8% lower.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"percentage of window have a percentage of 1.80% lower when other be 0.3%.\" Maybe it's saying that when other is 0.3%, the windows are at 1.80%. Let me see if any row has Windows as 1.80% when Other is 0.3.\n\nLooking through the rows, none of them have Windows at exactly 1.80% and Other at 0.3. The closest is Row 1: Windows 2.9%, Other 0.3%. So perhaps the claim is not accurate because there's no row where Windows are 1.80% when Other is 0.3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm interpreting it wrong. Maybe it's saying that the windows percentage is lower by 1.80% compared to other's 0.3%, so total would be 1.80% + 0.3%? But that doesn't fit either because in Row 1, Windows are higher than other.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is stating a relationship between two different sources or data points. For example, when Other is 0.3%, then Windows should be 1.8%. So checking if any row has Other as 0.3% and Windows as 1.8%.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\n- Row 0: Other n/a\n- Row 1: Other 0.3%, Windows 2.9%\n- Row 2: Other 0.2%, Windows 3.3%\n- Row 3: Other 0.0%, Windows 0.0%\n- Row 4: Other 0.05%, Windows 0.19%\n- Row 5: Other 4.64%, Windows 2.66%\n- Row 6: Other 0.42%, Windows 0.7%\n\nNone of these have Windows at exactly 1.8% when Other is 0.3%. So the claim's assertion doesn't hold for any row in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that there are no relevant rows where this condition is met.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when \"Other\" is 0.3%, \"Windows\" should be exactly 1.80% lower. Upon examining each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (Gartner May-13)**: Other = 0.3%, Windows = 2.9%. The difference is +2.6%, not -1.8%.\n\nNo other rows meet the criteria where \"Other\" is 0.3% and \"Windows\" is 1.80% lower.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns**: Looking for \"Windows\" (column_name) and checking when \"Other\" equals 0.3%.\n2. **Scan each row**: Check if any row has \"Other\" at 0.3% and \"Windows\" at 1.80%.\n3. **Conclusion**: None of the rows satisfy both conditions, so the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Windows\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
