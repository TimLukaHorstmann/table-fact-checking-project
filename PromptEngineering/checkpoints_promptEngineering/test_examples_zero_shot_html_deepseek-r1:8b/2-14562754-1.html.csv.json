    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that Laurent Boutonnat did 8 remixes of a song throughout the year 1995.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There's a column called \"remixed by,\" which seems relevant because it lists who did the remixing. The other columns are version, length, album, and year. Since the claim is about the number of remixes done by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995, I should focus on the rows where the year is 1995 and see how many times Laurent Boutonnat appears in the \"remixed by\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one for 1995. \n\n1. The first row after 1995 is a single version with no album listed, and it's attributed to Laurent Boutonnat. So that's one remix.\n2. Next, there's a no voice remix edit, but this time it's co-remixed by Laurent Boutonnat and Bertrand Chtenet. That adds another, making it two so far.\n3. The extra large remix is also done by both of them, so that's three.\n4. Distorded dance mix again by both, bringing the count to four.\n5. New remix edit by them as well, now five.\n6. Single dance mix, same as above, six.\n7. New remix edit (germany) again by both, seven.\n8. German radio edit is also done by them, making it eight.\n\nSo in total, for 1995, Laurent Boutonnat appears in the \"remixed by\" column eight times, all in that year. Each of these entries represents a different remix version. Therefore, the claim seems to be correct based on the table data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"live version of the song be record in the year 2006 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any live versions recorded in 2006 and 2009.\n\nStarting from the top, most entries are remixes or edits without a live version. The first live version is in 1996 (row 10), but that's not relevant since the claim mentions 2006 and 2009.\n\nContinuing down, row 12 has a live version recorded in 2003 (JXL Remix). That's also not matching the years in question.\n\nThen, row 13 is live version from 2006. That matches one of the years mentioned in the claim. So this cell is relevant.\n\nRow 14 is another live version, recorded in 2009. This matches the second year in the claim, so it's also relevant.\n\nI should check if there are any other live versions for 2006 or 2009 that I might have missed. Scanning through, I don't see any others beyond row 13 and 14 that fit those years.\n\nSo, the two rows that support the claim are row 13 (year 2006) and row 14 (year 2009).

The claim says: \"2 remixes of the song were released in 1996 and 2003, by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL respectively.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components.\n\n1. **Two remixes**: So there should be two entries in the table related to remixes.\n2. **Released in 1996 and 2003**: The years mentioned are 1996 and 2003.\n3. **By Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL**: The creators of these remixes are specified.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check for relevant information.\n\n- Starting from the top, most rows refer to various remixes but with different years. For instance, \"live version (recorded in 1996)\" is under 'album' as \"live \u00e0 bercy,\" but it's a live performance, not necessarily a remix by Richard Dekkard.\n  \n- Then I notice the row for \"uk remix\" at index 8: It has a length of 9:00 and was created by Richard Dekkard in 1996. So this seems to fit one part of the claim: a remix by Richard Dekkard released in 1996.\n\nNext, looking for a remix by Junkie XL. The row at index 9 is \"jxl remix\": It's listed under 'album' as \"remixes,\" created by Junkie XL in 2003. This matches the second part of the claim: a remix by Junkie XL released in 2003.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that these are both remixes and not live versions or other types. The \"uk remix\" is clearly a remix, and the \"jxl remix\" is also a remix. Their years match 1996 and 2003 respectively. Both are by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL.\n\nSo, both conditions of the claim are met with the relevant rows: index 8 for Richard Dekkard's 1996 remix, and index 9 for Junkie XL's 2003 remix. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with 7 of the remixes in the year 1995.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find entries related to both Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat in 1995.\n\nStarting from the top, each row has a version name, length, album, remixed by, and year. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 2: single version, remixed by Laurent Boutonnat, 1995.\n- Row 3: no voice remix edit, remixed by both Laurent and Bertrand, 1995.\n- Row 4: extra large remix, same as above, 1995.\n- Row 5: distorted dance mix, same, 1995.\n- Row 6: new remix edit, same, 1995.\n- Row 7: single dance mix, same, 1995.\n- Row 8: new remix edit (germany), same, 1995.\n- Row 9: german radio edit, same, 1995.\n\nSo that's rows 2 through 9. That's 8 entries where either or both remixed by are involved, but the claim mentions both names together with 7 remixes in 1995.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nRows where both Laurent and Bertrand are listed as remixers in 1995:\n\n- Row 3: no voice\n- Row 4: extra large\n- Row 5: distorted dance\n- Row 6: new edit (germany)\n- Row 8: german radio\n\nThat's 5 rows. Additionally, there are two more rows where only Laurent is mentioned in 1995:\n\n- Row 2: single version\n- Row 7: single dance mix\n\nBut the claim specifies both Bertrand and Laurent together, so those might not count.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat\", so both must be present. So rows where only one is mentioned don't qualify.\n\nSo in 1995, how many rows have both names as remixers?\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 3: both\n- Row 4: both\n- Row 5: both\n- Row 8: both\n\nThat's four entries. So the claim says seven, but I only count four where both are present.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me list all 1995 remixes:\n\nLooking at the 'year' column, 1995 entries start from row 0 (album version) to maybe others? Wait no, let's see:\n\nLooking for year 1995:\n\n- Row 0: album version (1995)\n- Row1: single version (1995)\n- Row2: no voice remix edit (1995)\n- Row3: extra large (1995)\n- Row4: distorted dance (1995)\n- Row5: new remix edit (1995)\n- Row6: single dance mix (1995)\n- Row7: new remix edit (germany) (1995)\n- Row8: german radio edit (1995)\n\nSo that's rows 0 to 8 in 1995. Now, for each of these, check if both Laurent and Bertrand are present.\n\nRow 0: album version, remixed by - so no, it's just the album name, not a remix.\n\nWait, looking at row 0: \"album version\" has 'remixed by' as \"-\", meaning no one. So that doesn't count.\n\nRows 1 to 8:\n\n- Row1 (single version): remixed by Laurent only.\n- Row2 (no voice): both.\n- Row3 (extra large): both.\n- Row4 (distorded dance): both.\n- Row5 (new remix edit): both.\n- Row6 (single dance mix): Laurent only.\n- Row7 (new edit germany): both.\n- Row8 (german radio): both.\n\nSo the rows where both are present in 1995: rows2,3,4,5,7,8. That's six entries, right? Wait:\n\nWait row2 is 1995? Let me confirm each row's year:\n\nLooking at each row, their 'year' column:\n\nRow0: 1995\nRow1: 1995\nRow2: 1995 (no voice)\nRow3: 1995\nRow4: 1995\nRow5: 1995\nRow6: 1995\nRow7: 1995\nRow8: 1995\n\nWait no, the table shows row0 as album version (1995), row1 as single version (1995), row2 as no voice (1995), etc., up to row8.\n\nSo for each of these rows from 0 to 8 in 1995:\n\nCheck if remixed by includes both Laurent and Bertrand.\n\nRow0:album version, remixed by \"-\": no\nRow1:single version, remixed by Laurent: no\nRow2:no voice, both: yes (counted)\nRow3:extra large, both: yes\nRow4:distorded dance, both: yes\nRow5:new remix edit, both: yes\nRow6:single dance mix, Laurent only: no\nRow7:new edit germany, both: yes\nRow8:german radio, both: yes\n\nSo that's rows2,3,4,5,7,8 where both are present. That's six entries.\n\nThe claim says \"7 of the remixes in the year 1995.\" So six vs seven; they don't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nRows2-3-4-5-7-8: that's 6 rows where both are present. Plus any others?\n\nWait row0: album version, no remixers\nrow1: single version, only Laurent\nrow2: both\nrow3: both\nrow4: both\nrow5: both\nrow6: only Laurent\nrow7: both\nrow8: both\n\nSo rows2-3-4-5-7-8 are six. So six entries where both are present in 1995.\n\nThe claim says seven, so it's not matching.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in front of me and a claim that I need to verify. The claim is: \"the new remix edit and the single dance mix be both 4 minute and 25 second long.\" My task is to check each part of the claim against the table and figure out if it's true or false.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two specific entries in the table: \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix.\" The claim states that both of these have a duration of 4 minutes and 25 seconds.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to locate these two entries. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the top, I see rows with various versions like album version, single version, no voice remix edit, etc. Scanning down, I find \"new remix edit\" in row 6 and \"single dance mix\" in row 9. Wait, actually, let me count properly because sometimes tables can be long.\n\nWait, looking again: row 0 is the header, so rows start from 1 onwards. Let's list them out:\n\nRow 1: album version\nRow 2: single version\nRow 3: no voice remix edit\nRow 4: extra large remix\nRow 5: distorted dance mix\nRow 6: new remix edit\nRow 7: live version (1996)\nRow 8: jxl remix\nRow 9: live version (2006)\nRow 10: live version (2009)\nRow 11: music video\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The table has more rows. Let me count properly.\n\nLooking back, the table has a tbody with multiple tr elements. Each tr represents a row. So I need to count each tr as a row.\n\nThe first tr after thead is:\n\ntr 0: album version\ntr 1: single version\ntr 2: no voice remix edit\ntr 3: extra large remix\ntr 4: distorted dance mix\ntr 5: new remix edit\ntr 6: single dance mix\ntr 7: new remix edit (germany)\ntr 8: german radio edit\ntr 9: music video\ntr 10: uk remix\ntr 11: live version (1996)\ntr 12: jxl remix\ntr 13: live version (2006)\ntr 14: live version (2009)\n\nWait, that might be. So \"new remix edit\" is in tr5 and tr7? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking at the table provided:\n\nLooking at each tr:\n\n1. album version\n2. single version\n3. no voice remix edit\n4. extra large remix\n5. distorted dance mix\n6. new remix edit\n7. single dance mix\n8. new remix edit (germany)\n9. german radio edit\n10. music video\n11. uk remix\n12. live version (1996)\n13. jxl remix\n14. live version (2006)\n15. live version (2009)\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up earlier. Let me count the trs properly.\n\nEach <tr> is a row. The table starts with:\n\n<tr>\n  ... album version ...\n</tr>\n\nThen another one for single version, and so on. So the first data row is tr1: album version. Then tr2: single version, etc.\n\nWait no, actually in HTML, the tbody has multiple rows. Let me look at the provided table again.\n\nThe table's tbody has:\n\n<tr>\n<td>album version</td>... (tr0)\n<tr>\n<td>single version</td>... (tr1)\n<tr>\n<td>no voice remix edit</td>... (tr2)\n<tr>\n<td>extra large remix</td>... (tr3)\n<tr>\n<td>distorded dance mix</td>... (tr4)\n<tr>\n<td>new remix edit</td>... (tr5)\n<tr>\n<td>single dance mix</td>...

(tr14)\n\nWait, no, that seems too many. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table as provided:\n\nThe first row after thead is:\n\n1. album version\n2. single version\n3. no voice remix edit\n4. extra large remix\n5. distorted dance mix\n6. new remix edit\n7. single dance mix\n8. new remix edit (germany)\n9. german radio edit\n10. music video\n11. uk remix\n12. live version (1996)\n13. jxl remix\n14. live version (2006)\n15. live version (2009)\n\nWait, that's 15 rows. But the table might not have that many. Let me count each tr:\n\n- The first <tr> is for album version: row1\n- Then single version: row2\n- no voice remix edit: row3\n- extra large remix: row4\n- distorted dance mix: row5\n- new remix edit: row6\n- single dance mix: row7\n- new remix edit (germany): row8\n- german radio edit: row9\n- music video: row10\n- uk remix: row11\n- live version (1996): row12\n- jxl remix: row13\n- live version (2006): row14\n- live version (2009): row15\n\nWait, that's 15 data rows. So the entries are from row1 to row15.\n\nNow, looking for \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix.\"\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- new remix edit is in row6.\n- single dance mix is in row7.\n\nSo those are two separate entries. The claim says both are 4 minutes and 25 seconds long.\n\nLooking at their duration columns: each row has a 'Duration' column? Wait, no. Looking back, the table's columns are:\n\nIn the provided table, each row has several columns like \"Row\" (probably the index), then \"Version\", \"Duration\".\n\nWait, looking at the first row after the header:\n\nIt says:\n\n\"<td>album version</td><td>4:25</td><td>3:38</td>...\" etc.\n\nSo the table's columns are: Version, Duration, perhaps another column? Or maybe just two data columns.\n\nWait, no. The user provided a table with three columns: 'Row', 'Version', and 'Duration'. But in reality, looking at the HTML:\n\nThe first row after thead is:\n\n<tr>\n<td>album version</td><td>4:25</td><td>3:38</td>...\nSo that's three td elements. Wait, no, perhaps it's two columns: Version and Duration.\n\nWait, I think the table has four columns: Row index, Version name, Duration, and maybe another column like something else, but from the initial rows, it seems like each row has Version, then Duration.\n\nWait, looking at the first few rows:\n\n1. album version | 4:25\n2. single version | 3:38\n3. no voice remix edit | 2:43\n4. extra large remix | 5:15\n5. distorted dance mix | 4:10\n6. new remix edit | 4:25\n7. single dance mix | 4:25\n8. new remix edit (germany) | 4:20\n9. german radio edit | 3:45\n10. music video | 3:40\n11. uk remix | 4:05\n12. live version (1996) | 5:15\n13. jxl remix | 4:30\n14. live version (2006) | 5:25\n15. live version (2009) | 5:28\n\nWait, that's how it seems. So each row has the Version name and its Duration.\n\nSo for \"new remix edit,\" which is in row6, the duration is 4:25.\n\nFor \"single dance mix,\" which is in row7, the duration is also 4:25.\n\nThus, both entries have a duration of exactly 4 minutes and 25 seconds. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nSo, the task was to determine whether both \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix\" have the same duration. From the table provided, they both do.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis confirms that both versions, \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix,\" have a duration of 4 minutes and 25 seconds.\n\n**Answer:**  \nYes, both \"new remix edit\" and \"single dance mix\" are 4 minutes and 25 seconds long.",

The relevant rows would be those where 'year' is 1995.\n\nNow, counting how many times Laurent Boutonnat was involved in remixes during 1995:\n\n1. Single version\n2. No voice remix edit\n3.

German radio edit\n\nWait, but the claim says \"more than 8.\" Hmm, let me count again.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- The first row is album version, not by Laurent.\n- Then there's single version by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995 (row index 1).\n- No voice remix edit (index 2) - Laurent and Bertrand.\n- Extra large remix (3) same as above.\n- Distorded dance mix (4).\n- New remix edit (5).\n- Single dance mix (6).\n- New remix edit (germany) (7).\n- German radio edit (8).\n\nSo that's 8 entries where Laurent Boutonnat is involved in remixes during 1995.

The first two entries (row 0 and 1) have year 1995, then rows up to 8 also have 1995 except for some that are 1996 or later.\n\nWait no, let's clarify:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: album version, 4:45, 1995\nRow 1: single version, 4:23, 1995\nRow 2: no voice remix edit, 4:20, 1995\nRow 3: extra large remix, 5:02, 1995\nRow 4: distorded dance mix, 5:20, 1995\nRow 5: new remix edit, 4:25, 1995\nRow 6: single dance mix, 4:25, 1995\nRow 7: new remix edit (germany), 4:43, 1995\nRow 8: german radio edit, 3:54, 1995\n\nSo that's rows 0 through 8? Wait no, the 'year' column for row 8 is 1995. So from row index 1 to 8 (since row 0 is album version), but wait, no, each row has a unique index starting from 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all rows where 'year' is 1995 and 'remixed by' includes Laurent Boutonnat.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: single version - Laurent Boutonnat\n- Row 2: no voice remix edit - Laurent & Bertrand\n- Row 3: extra large remix - same as above\n- Row 4: distorded dance mix - same\n- Row 5: new remix edit - same\n- Row 6: single dance mix - same\n- Row 7: new remix edit (germany) - same\n- Row 8: german radio edit - same\n\nSo that's rows 1 to 8, which is 8 entries. Each of these is a remix by Laurent Boutonnat in 1995.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 8,\" so it should be at least 9. But here, there are exactly 8. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Laurent Boutonnat did more than 8 remixes of a song in 1995, we examine each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Single version - Laurent Boutonnat\n2. **Row 2**: No voice remix edit - Laurent & Bertrand\n3. **Row 3**: Extra large remix - same as above\n4. **Row 4**: Distorded dance mix - same\n5. **Row 5**: New remix edit - same\n6. **Row 6**: Single dance mix - same\n7. **Row 7**: New remix edit (germany) - same\n8. **Row 8**: German radio edit - same\n\nThere are exactly 8 entries where Laurent Boutonnat was involved in remixes during 1995, which does not exceed 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"live version of the song be record before 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's about a live version of a song being recorded before 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists various versions of a song with details like length, album, remixers, and year. The columns relevant here are 'version', 'album', 'remixed by', and 'year'. But since the claim is specifically about a live version, I should focus on rows where the version type includes \"live version\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find live versions. Starting from the top:\n\n1. The first few rows mention different remixes but not live versions.\n2. Then I see a row for \"single dance mix\", which isn't a live version either.\n3. Further down, there's a \"music video\" row, still not relevant.\n4. Next is the \"uk remix\" and another live version recorded in 1996. Wait, that's a live version from 1996, which is before 2006. So this would support the claim.\n\nContinuing to check if there are other live versions after 1996 but before 2006:\n\n- In 2003, there's a \"jxl remix\" which isn't a live version.\n- Then in 2006 and 2009, there are live versions recorded in those years. The 2006 one is exactly in 2006, so it doesn't count as before 2006.\n\nSo the only relevant live version before 2006 is the 1996 one. Since there's at least one such record in the table, the claim seems to be TRUE. But wait, I need to check if all live versions are indeed before 2006 or not. The 2006 and 2009 ones are after, so they don't affect the claim, which is about being recorded before 2006.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would include both the \"live version (recorded in 1996)\" row and maybe others if any. But since the claim says \"before 2006\", only the 1996 entry is relevant here.\n</think>\n\nThe live version recorded in 1996 is before 2006, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"live version (recorded in 1996)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"bertrand chtenet laurent boutonnat with less than 7 of the remixes in the year 1995.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is asserting. It seems to be saying that Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat were involved in remixing fewer than seven songs in 1995. So my task is to look through the table and find all the remixes attributed to either of them in 1995.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different version or remix. The columns we're interested in are \"version,\" \"remixed by,\" and \"year.\" Since we're focusing on 1995, I'll only consider rows where the year is 1995.\n\nI start by scanning through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Version is \"album version,\" \"remixed by\" is \"-\", so not relevant.\n2. **Row 1**: Single version, no album mentioned, \"remixed by\" is Laurent Boutonnat. This is a 1995 remix, so count it.\n3. **Row 2**: No voice remix edit, \"remixed by\" includes both Laurent and Bertrand. That's two people, but only looking for their names together. Count this as one remix involving both.\n4. **Row 3**: Extra large remix, same remixers as row 2. Another one.\n5. **Row 4**: Distorded dance mix, same as above. Another count.\n6. **Row 5**: New remix edit, same remixers again.\n7. **Row 6**: Single dance mix, same.\n8. **Row 7**: New remix edit (germany), same.\n9. **Row 8**: German radio edit, same.\n10. **Row 9**: Music video, no individual remixer listed, so skip.\n11. **Row 10**: UK remix is in 1996, so beyond our scope.\n12. **Rows after that are from 1996 and later, so not relevant for 1995.\n\nNow, let's list all the remixes by Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat in 1995:\n\n- Row 1: single version\n- Row 2: no voice remix edit\n- Row 3: extra large remix\n- Row 4: distorted dance mix\n- Row 5: new remix edit\n- Row 6: single dance mix\n- Row 7: new remix edit (germany)\n- Row 8: german radio edit\n\nThat's a total of 8 remixes. Wait, but the claim says \"less than 7,\" which would mean up to 6. However, I've counted eight. But wait, some rows have both Laurent and Bertrand as remixer. For example, rows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 all list both. So does each of these count as one remix where they both worked? Or are we counting them as separate entries?\n\nLooking at the table, each row is a separate version or remix. Even though some have both remixer names, each is a unique entry. Therefore, rows 2 to 8 (excluding others) would be considered separate remixes.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRows with \"remixed by\" as Laurent and Bertrand in 1995 are:\n\n- Row 1: Laurent only\n- Rows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8: Both\n\nThat's 1 (Row1) +7=8. But the claim says \"with less than 7 of the remixes.\" So if there are 8, that would be more than 7, making the claim false.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted. Let me list them:\n\n1. Row1: Laurent\n2. Row2: Both (count as one)\n3. Row3: Both\n4. Row4: Both\n5. Row5: Both\n6. Row6: Both\n7. Row7: Both\n8. Row8: Both\n\nYes, that's 8 entries where they were involved in remixing, so more than 7.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"with less than 7 of the remixes.\" If there are 8, it's indeed not less than 7, making the claim false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bertrand Chtenet and Laurent Boutonnat were involved in fewer than seven remixes in 1995. By examining the table, we find eight remixes involving them, which is more than seven. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed_by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"2 remixes of the song were released after 2003 by Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL respectively.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns are version, length, album, remixed by, and year. The claim mentions two specific people: Richard Dekkard and Junkie XL. So, I should focus on the \"remixed by\" column.\n\nNext, I need to find entries where the remixers are exactly these two and check if their respective remixes were released after 2003. \n\nLooking through the table, I see that Junkie XL's remix is from 2003. The claim says \"after 2003,\" so 2003 doesn't count because it's not after. Wait, does \"after\" mean strictly later than 2003 or including 2003? If it's strictly after, then 2003 wouldn't qualify. \n\nThen, checking for Richard Dekkard: I scan through the \"remixed by\" column and notice that \"uk remix\" is attributed to him in 1996. That's before 2003, so even if we consider including 2003, his remix isn't after 2003.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed another entry for Richard Dekkard. Let me check again. The last entries are mostly Junkie XL and some live versions or others from earlier years. It seems Richard's only entry is the \"uk remix\" in 1996.\n\nSo, neither of them has a remix after 2003. Therefore, the claim that two remixes were released after 2003 by them isn't accurate. One of them (Junkie XL) was in 2003, which doesn't count as after, and Richard's was much earlier.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"remixed by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The versions vary, and for each version, there's a corresponding length in minutes and seconds.\n\nStarting with \"new remix edit,\" I need to find the row where the version is \"new remix edit.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that it appears towards the end of the table. Specifically, it's row index 6 (since we start counting from 0). The length for this version is listed as 4:43. Wait, 4 minutes and 43 seconds is less than 5 minutes because 5 minutes would be 5:00 or more. So that's under 5 minutes.\n\nNext, looking at \"single dance mix,\" I find it in row index 7.
