    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"there be no win when the top 25 and even the top 10 be less than 4.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim. It seems to suggest that whenever both the top 25 and top 10 are less than 4, there are zero wins. So I need to check if every row where 'top - 25' is less than 4 also has 'wins' equal to 0.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify rows where 'top - 25' is less than 4. The columns are: tournament, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, cuts made.\n\nStarting with each row:\n\n1. Masters Tournament: top-25 is 4. So not less than 4.\n2. US Open: top-25 is 3. That's less than 4.\n   - Wins column says 0 here. So this row supports the claim because when top-10 is 1, which is also less than 4? Wait, no. Wait, the claim specifies both top 25 and top 10 being less than 4. In US Open, top-10 is 1 (from the 'top -10' column). So yes, both are less than 4. Wins are 0. Good.\n   \n3. The Open Championship: top-25 is 2. Less than 4.\n   - Check top-10 here: it's 1, which is also less than 4.\n   - Wins are 0. So this row supports the claim.\n\n4. PGA Championship: top-25 is 4 again. Not less than 4.\n5. Totals row: top-25 is 13, so not relevant.\n\nWait, but let me check each row to see if any have top-25 <4 and also have wins >0.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nMasters Tournament: top-25=4 \u2192 doesn't apply.\nUS Open: top-25=3 <4. Check top-10: 1 <4. Wins=0. So condition holds.\nThe Open Championship: top-25=2 <4, top-10=1 <4. Wins=0. Condition holds.\nPGA Championship: top-25=4 \u2192 doesn't apply.\nTotals: top-25=13 \u2192 doesn't apply.\n\nSo all rows where both top 25 and top 10 are less than 4 have wins=0. Therefore, the claim is true because whenever both top 25 and top 10 are below 4, there's no win. So answer should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other rows. Are there any tournaments where top-25 is less than 4? Only US Open (3) and The Open Championship (2). Both have wins=0, so the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read the claim again: \"pga championship when top - 25 be less than 4 have 0 win with cut made 6 and top - 5 be greater than 0.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It seems to make two main statements about the pga championship row in the table.\n\n1. When top - 25 is less than 4, they have 0 wins.\n2. At the same time, top -5 is greater than 0.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll locate the pga championship row. It's the fourth row from the top, with row index 3. Now, I need to check the relevant columns mentioned: 'top -25', 'wins', 'cuts made', and 'top -5'.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The 'top -25' cell for pga championship is 4.\n- 'wins' is 0.\n- 'cuts made' is 8.\n- 'top -5' is 1.\n\nLet's analyze the first part of the claim: top -25 less than 4. Since top -25 is 4, which is not less than 4 (it's equal), this condition doesn't hold true. Therefore, the first statement in the claim isn't accurate because it requires top -25 to be less than 4.\n\nThe second part says that when top -25 is less than 4, they have 0 wins. But since top -25 isn't less than 4 here, this condition doesn't apply. However, even if the condition was met, their 'wins' are indeed 0, which matches. But because the initial condition fails, the overall claim might still be false.\n\nAdditionally, the second part mentions that when top -25 is less than 4, top -5 should be greater than 0. In this case, since the first condition isn't met, we don't need to check this part specifically. However, looking at 'top -5', it's 1, which is indeed greater than 0.\n\nBut since the first condition (top -25 <4) doesn't hold true in reality (it's equal to 4), the overall claim isn't fully supported because it's based on a false premise. Therefore, even though some parts of the claim might be true, the overall statement is not accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks two conditions for the pga championship row. The first condition requires top -25 <4, but in reality, it's 4. Since this condition fails, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
