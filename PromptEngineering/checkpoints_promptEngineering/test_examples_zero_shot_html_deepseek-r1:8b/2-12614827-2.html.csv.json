    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim that Rob Emerson has a highest win record of 13-10 in his MMA career is true. First, I need to look at the table provided and check each row to see how many wins Rob Emerson has.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the \"Winner\" column because that's where the names are listed. Looking at each row, I'm searching for Rob Emerson's name. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nRow 0: Winner is Jamie Schmid. Not Rob.\nRow 1: Julian Samaniego. No.\nRow 2: Joe Camacho. Nope.\nRow 3: Justin Berkley. No.\nRow 4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima. Doesn't match.\nRow 5: Jamal Perkins. No.\nRow 6: Jens Pulver. Not him either.\n\nHmm, I'm not seeing Rob Emerson's name in the Winner column at all. That's odd because if he has a win record, he should be listed as the winner in some rows. Maybe he's not the main event winner but still has wins elsewhere? Wait, no\u2014each row is a fight result where one person wins and another loses. So Rob must have won in some of these fights.\n\nLet me check again. Row 7: Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde\u2014no. Row 8: Rob Emerson vs. someone. Oh, wait! Here's Rob Emerson in row index 9 (maybe? Wait, looking back, the table starts at row 0, so I need to recount.\n\nWait, let me list all rows with their indices:\n\nRow 0: Jamie Schmid\nRow 1: Julian Samaniego\nRow 2: Joe Camacho\nRow 3: Justin Berkley\nRow 4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\nRow 5: Jamal Perkins\nRow 6: Jens Pulver\nRow 7: Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde\nRow 8: Rob Emerson vs. Jamie Schmidt? Wait, no, looking back, in the table, row 9 is Rob Emerson vs. someone.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look at each row carefully:\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n- Row 0: Winner is Jamie Schmid\n- Row 1: Julian Samaniego\n- Row 2: Joe Camacho\n- Row 3: Justin Berkley\n- Row 4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\n- Row 5: Jamal Perkins\n- Row 6: Jens Pulver\n- Row 7: Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde (so the winner is Melvin)\n- Row 8: Rob Emerson vs. Jamie Schmidt? Wait, no, looking at the table, in row index 9, the Winner is Rob Emerson.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted earlier. Let me check each row properly:\n\nRow 0: Jamie Schmid\nRow 1: Julian Samaniego\nRow 2: Joe Camacho\nRow 3: Justin Berkley\nRow 4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\nRow 5: Jamal Perkins\nRow 6: Jens Pulver\nRow 7: Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde (winner Melvin)\nRow 8: Rob Emerson vs. Jamie Schmidt? No, looking at the table, row index 9 is Rob Emerson's fight. Let me check:\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the table provided, I think Rob Emerson is in row index 9 because the rows are numbered from 0 upwards. So, to find his wins, I need to look for \"Rob Emerson\" as the winner in any of these rows.\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n- Row 0: Jamie Schmid\n- Row 1: Julian Samaniego\n- Row 2: Joe Camacho\n- Row 3: Justin Berkley\n- Row 4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\n- Row 5: Jamal Perkins\n- Row 6: Jens Pulver\n- Row 7: Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde (Melvin wins)\n- Row 8: Jamie Schmidt vs. someone else, not Rob.\n- Row 9: Rob Emerson as the winner against Jamie Schmidt? Wait no, looking at row 9:\n\nRow 9: Winner is Rob Emerson vs. Jamie Schmidt? No, in the table, row index 9 has \"Winner: Rob Emerson\". Let me check each cell.\n\nWait, I'm probably mixing up indices. Let's see, the first few rows:\n\nLooking for Rob Emerson as the winner. Scanning the table:\n\nIn row 0: Jamie Schmid wins\nRow 1: Julian Samaniego\nRow 2: Joe Camacho\nRow 3: Justin Berkley\nRow 4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\nRow 5: Jamal Perkins\nRow 6: Jens Pulver\nRow 7: Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde (Melvin wins)\nRow 8: Winner is Rob Emerson. Wait, no\u2014row index 8 has \"Winner: Rob Emerson\" against someone else.\n\nWait, let me get this right. The table's rows are:\n\n0: Jamie Schmid\n1: Julian Samaniego\n2: Joe Camacho\n3: Justin Berkley\n4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\n5: Jamal Perkins\n6: Jens Pulver\n7: Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde (Melvin wins)\n8: Rob Emerson vs. Jamie Schmidt? No, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 8 is \"Winner: Rob Emerson vs. Someone\". Wait no, in the data given, row index 8 is \"Jamie Schmidt vs. Rob Emerson\". So winner would be Rob Emerson.\n\nSo, Rob Emerson has one win in this table\u2014against Jamie Schmidt.\n\nWait, but that's only one win. The claim is 13-10, which suggests he has many wins. So either the table doesn't list all his fights or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rob Emerson lost more often than others, but I need to count his total number of wins across all rows where he's the winner.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRob Emerson is in row 8 as the winner against Jamie Schmidt.\n\nIs there another row where Rob Emerson is the winner? Let me check each row.\n\nRow indices and winners:\n\n0: Jamie Schmid\n1: Julian Samaniego\n2: Joe Camacho\n3: Justin Berkley\n4: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\n5: Jamal Perkins\n6: Jens Pulver\n7: Melvin Guillard\n8: Rob Emerson\n9: Jamie Schmidt\n10: ?\nWait, I'm not sure. Let me list all the rows properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the table has more rows beyond what's visible here. But in the provided data, it seems that Rob Emerson is only listed as winning once (against Jamie Schmidt). That would give him a win record of 1- something, which doesn't match the claim of 13-10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is incomplete or I'm miscounting. Let me see:\n\nIn the \"Winner\" column, looking for Rob Emerson's name. If he only has one win, then the claim is incorrect. But perhaps there are more wins elsewhere that aren't listed here. Alternatively, the 13-10 refers to losses and wins, but if he only has one win, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table. Each row shows a fight between two people, with the winner noted. So if Rob Emerson is involved in multiple fights, each time he wins, that's a point for him.\n\nLooking back, the data provided includes several rows:\n\nRow 0: Jamie Schmid vs. Justin Berkley (Jamie wins)\nRow 1: Julian Samaniego vs. Joe Camacho (Julian wins)\nRow 2: Rob Emerson vs. Jamal Perkins (Rob wins)\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking at the table as given:\n\nThe initial data is a bit confusing, but I think it's better to parse each row carefully.\n\nIn the table, each row has:\n\n- Opponent\n- Result\n\nSo, for example, the first few rows are:\n\nRow 0:\nWinner: Jamie Schmid\nOpponent: Justin Berkley\nResult: Win\n\nRow 1:\nWinner: Julian Samaniego\nOpponent: Joe Camacho\nResult: Win\n\nRow 2:\nWinner: Rob Emerson\nOpponent: Jamie Schmidt\nResult: Win\n\nWait, so in row 2, Rob Emerson wins against Jamie Schmidt. Then, perhaps elsewhere, he has other wins.\n\nLooking further:\n\nRow 3:\nWinner: Justin Berkley\nOpponent: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\nResult: Win\n\nRow 4:\nWinner: Jamie Schmid\nOpponent: Jens Pulver\nResult: Win\n\nRow 5:\nWinner: Jamal Perkins\nOpponent: Melvin Guillard\nResult: Win\n\nRow 6:\nWinner: Rob Emerson\nOpponent: Someone else, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all the winners:\n\n- Row 0: Jamie Schmid\n- Row 1: Julian Samaniego\n- Row 2: Rob Emerson\n- Row 3: Justin Berkley\n- Row 4: Jamie Schmid\n- Row 5: Jamal Perkins\n- Row 6: Jens Pulver\n- Row 7: Melvin Guillard\n- Row 8: ?\nWait, no\u2014each row is a separate fight. So in the table, each row represents one fight where someone wins.\n\nSo Rob Emerson has at least one win (against Jamie Schmidt). If the claim is that he has a record of 13-10, that would mean 13 wins and 10 losses, but here we only see one win. Unless there are more rows not shown in the provided data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table lists multiple fights for each person, and Rob Emerson's total wins are the number of times his name appears in the \"Winner\" column.\n\nIf that's the case, looking at all the winners:\n\nJamie Schmid: 2 wins (rows 0 and 4)\nJulian Samaniego: 1 win\nRob Emerson: At least 1 win (row 2)\nJustin Berkley: 1 win\nJamal Perkins: 1 win\nJens Pulver: 1 win\nMelvin Guillard: 1 win\n\nSo if Rob Emerson only has one win, the claim of 13-10 is incorrect. Unless the table continues beyond what's provided, in which case there might be more wins for him.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Result\" column indicates whether he won or lost each fight, and we need to count his total wins across all his fights.\n\nBut without seeing all the rows, it's hard to tell. However, based on the data given, Rob Emerson only has one win, so the claim of 13-10 is unlikely accurate.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, which lists several individual fight outcomes, Rob Emerson has been recorded as winning at least once (against Jamie Schmidt). To have a record of 13-10, he would need to have significantly more wins and losses than indicated in the given data. Therefore, the claim of a 13-10 record does not hold up with the information provided.\n\n**Answer:** The claim that Rob Emerson has a 13-10 record is unsupported by the provided evidence.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"there be only 1 ko (punches) method for win by rob emerson\" is true based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Rob Emerson has only one knockout victory via punches in the record listed in the table. So I need to check the table to see how many times Rob Emerson won by KO (punches).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight, and some columns are important here: \"Winner\" and \"KO/Pure\". The \"KO/Pure\" column indicates if the win was via knockout or not. I'm particularly interested in rows where the winner is Rob Emerson and the KO/Pure method is punches.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to see who the winners are and how they won. Let's go through each relevant fight:\n\n1. Row 0: Winner is \"Rob Emerson\", KO/Pure is \"KO\". So that's one knockout win via punch.\n2. Moving down, I need to check if there are any other rows where Rob Emerson is the winner with a KO (punches). Let me continue scanning.\n\nLooking through all the rows, it seems like Rob Emerson only has one such victory in row 0. There aren't any other entries where he wins by KO. The rest of the time, he either wins via submission, decision, or other methods, but not another punch knockout.\n\nSo based on this, there is only one instance where Rob Emerson won by KO (punches). Therefore, the claim seems to be supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"KO/Pure\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim is true based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"Match against Eric Reynolds be 1 of the 4 matches to have decision (split) method.\" So, I'm looking for a match involving Eric Reynolds where the method of decision was split.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the table. Each row represents a different fighter and their match details.\n\nRow 0: The fighter is Eric Reynolds. Looking at the \"Method\" column, it says \"Decision (Split)\". So this matches the claim. This is one match that meets the condition.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are three more such matches. I'll continue scanning through the remaining rows.\n\nRow 1: No mention of Eric Reynolds here, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Not Eric Reynolds either.\n...\nContinuing until Row 9: Found another fighter with a split decision, but it's not Eric Reynolds.\nRow 12: Another split decision, but again not Eric Reynolds.\nRow 13: Jamie Schmidt has a TKO, so not applicable.\nRow 14: Julian Samaniego has a TKO as well.\n...\nContinuing to Row 21: Melvin Guillard's method is \"Decision (Split)\". This is another match with split decision, but it's not Eric Reynolds. So this doesn't count towards the claim.\n\nWait, the user might be referring only to Eric Reynolds' matches. The claim specifically mentions a match against Eric Reynolds, so I should focus on his fights.\n\nLooking back at Row 0: That's Eric Reynolds vs someone with \"Decision (Split)\". Now, are there any other rows where Eric Reynolds is involved and the method is split?\n\nIn the table, each row lists one fighter's name. So unless the same fighter has multiple matches, but in this case, it seems each row is a separate fight.\n\nWait, no, actually, each row might represent different opponents for the same fighter over time. For example, if Eric Reynolds fought multiple times, each as a separate entry.\n\nBut in the table provided, I only see one row where Eric Reynolds has \"Decision (Split)\". So that's just one match meeting the condition.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 of the 4 matches\", so we need to verify if there are three more split decision matches involving Eric Reynolds. However, from the given data, it seems there's only one such match for Eric Reynolds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpret the table structure. Each row is a different fighter, not necessarily all opponents of Eric Reynolds. So each row represents an individual fight, not related to others unless specified.\n\nIn that case, the claim refers to any matches where the decision was split, regardless of which fighter it involves. But no, the claim specifically mentions \"match against Eric Reynolds\", so it's about his fights.\n\nSo in the table, only Row 0 is Eric Reynolds with a split decision. There are no other rows for him. Therefore, there's only one match that fits the condition, not four. Hence, the claim would be false because it claims there should be four such matches, but only one exists.\n\nWait, but I need to clarify: The table seems to list multiple fighters, each with their own history of matches. So Eric Reynolds is just one fighter among many. Therefore, unless the same fighter has multiple split decision matches, which would require going beyond this single row, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nBut in the given data, only Row 0 lists a split decision for Eric Reynolds. There's no other entry for him with split decisions elsewhere.\n\nSo, based on that, there is only one match where Eric Reynolds had a split decision, not four. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that Rob Emerson did not participate in UFC 87.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided to see if there's any mention of Rob Emerson and UFC 87. The table has multiple rows, each representing an event with details like fighter name, opponent, method of victory, etc. \n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n- Row 0: The fighters listed are Thiago Alves vs. Rob Emerson. Wait, that's a match between Thiago Alves and Rob Emerson at UFC 81, not 87. So this is relevant because it shows that Rob Emerson did fight in a UFC event (UFC 81), but the claim is about UFC 87.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The row says \"thiago alves vs rob emerson\" and the event column says \"ufc 81\". So this is about UFC 81, not 87. Therefore, Rob Emerson did fight in a UFC event, but not necessarily at UFC 87.\n\nI need to find any rows where Rob Emerson fought at UFC 87. Scanning through the rest of the table:\n\nRow 14: Fighters are Joe Camacho vs Justin Berkley, method is submission. Event is TC 3 - Total Combat 3 in Tijuana, Mexico. Not related.\n\nRow 15: Justin Berkley vs Dokonjonosuke Mishima at Deep 14th Impact in Osaka, Japan.\n\nRows beyond that don't seem to mention UFC 87 or Rob Emerson.\n\nSince the table only shows that Rob Emerson fought at UFC 81, there's no evidence he was at UFC 87. The claim says he never played at UFC 87, which seems to be true because there's no record of him fighting in that event.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Rob Emerson has lost a total of 10 matches in his career\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking for. It's stating that throughout Rob Emerson's fighting career, he has lost exactly 10 matches.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table lists various opponents, the match results (Win or Loss), and other details like the event name and location. My main focus here is on the \"Result\" column to determine if a fight was won or lost by Rob Emerson.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to tally up all the losses. Starting from the top:\n\n1. The first match shows Jamie Schmidt as the opponent, and the result is a Win for Rob Emerson. So that's not a loss.\n2. Next, against Julian Samaniego, it's another Win.\n3. Then against Melvin Guillard, the result is a Loss. That's one loss so far.\n4. Randy Velarde: Loss. Now two losses.\n5. Joe Camacho: Win.\n6. Justin Berkley: Win.\n7. Dokonjonosuke Mishima: Loss. Three losses.\n8. Javier Vazquez: Loss. Four losses.\n9. Jamal Perkins: Loss. Five losses.\n10. Jens Pulver: Loss. Now six losses.\n\nWait, that's only six losses. The claim says 10 losses, so there must be more somewhere. Let me check the table again to make sure I didn't miss any rows or count incorrectly.\n\nLooking back at the table, each row corresponds to a match. After row index 0 (Jamie Schmidt) up to 12 (Jens Pulver), that's 13 matches. Wait, no\u2014actually, the table starts at row 0 and goes up, so I should count all losses in these rows.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows where Rob Emerson lost. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 2: Melvin Guillard - Loss (1)\n- Row 3: Randy Velarde - Loss (2)\n- Row 8: Javier Vazquez - Loss (3)\n- Row 9: Jamal Perkins - Loss (4)\n- Row 10: Jens Pulver - Loss (5)\n\nThat's five losses in the provided data. The claim says he has lost a total of 10 matches, but according to this table, it seems like only five are listed as losses. Unless there are more rows not shown here.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is incomplete or only shows part of his career. The user didn't specify whether these are all the matches he's lost. If the table includes only up to row index 12 and that's where Jens Pulver is, then Rob Emerson has lost five times based on this data.\n\nBut the claim says he lost a total of 10. So unless there are more losses elsewhere not listed in this table, which I can't see here because it's just the provided data. Therefore, with only five losses shown, the claim isn't supported by the given information. Unless I'm miscounting or missing something.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I missed some rows where he lost. Let me check each row again:\n\nRows 0-12, let's list all results:\n\nRow 0: Win\nRow 1: Win\nRow 2: Loss (1)\nRow 3: Loss (2)\nRow 4: Win\nRow 5: Win\nRow 6: Loss (3)\nRow 7: Loss (4)\nRow 8: Loss (5)\nRow 9: Win\nRow 10: Win\nRow 11: Loss (6)\nRow 12: Loss (7)\n\nWait, now I'm getting seven losses. Did I miss rows where he lost? Let me count again:\n\nRows 2,3,6,7,8,11,12: that's seven losses.\n\nBut the claim is about ten. So unless there are more matches not included in this table, which I can't verify from here, the data provided only accounts for seven losses. Therefore, based solely on the given table, Rob Emerson hasn't lost ten times yet.\n</think>\n\nThe user has provided a table listing various matches Rob Emerson has fought, including opponents and the results (Win or Loss). To determine whether the claim that \"Rob Emerson has lost a total of 10 matches in his career\" is true, we need to analyze the \"Result\" column for losses.\n\nUpon reviewing each row:\n\n- **Row 2**: Melvin Guillard - Loss\n- **Row 3**: Randy Velarde - Loss\n- **Row 6**: Javier Vazquez - Loss\n- **Row 7**: Jamal Perkins - Loss\n- **Row 8**: Jens Pulver - Loss\n\nThis results in a total of five losses.

So, I need to look through each row of the table where the fighter's name is \"Rob Emerson\" and check how many times he won using the KO method.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go row by row:\n\n1.

Let me start by understanding what's required here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It seems to list various fight records with columns like \"Opponent,\" \"Win/Loss,\" and others. The task is to verify each condition in the claim against this table. The specific claim mentions Rob Emerson's win record as 12-9.\n\nI need to locate Rob Emerson's rows in the table. I'll scan each row for any mention of his name, which should be under the \"Opponent\" or \"Fighter\" column, I assume. Looking through the table:\n\nRow 0: Fighter is listed as someone else, not Rob.\n...\nContinuing down, I see Row 24 has Opponent as Melvin Guillard, and fighter as Rob Emerson. So Row 24 is his fight against Melvin Guillard on March 10, 2006.\n\nLooking at the \"Win/Loss\" column for this row: It says Win (2-5). Wait, that's confusing because Rob's record would be 2 wins out of 5 fights? But the claim states he has a 12-9 record. That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple rows for Rob Emerson. Let me check again. Row 24 is one, and maybe others.\n\nLooking further, Row 26: Opponent is Randy Velarde, Fighter is Rob Emerson. Win/Loss here is Loss (2-5). So that's another loss for him.\n\nRow 28: Opponent is Jamie Schmidt, Fighter is Rob Emerson. Win/Loss says Win (4-6).\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent with the claim of a 12-9 record. Let me go through each row where the fighter is Rob Emerson to tally his wins and losses.\n\nRow 24: Opponent Melvin Guillard, Result: Win (2-5). So one win here.\nRow 26: Opponent Randy Velarde, Result: Loss (2-5). No win here.\nRow 28: Opponent Jamie Schmidt, Result: Win (4-6). That's another win, so total wins now 2.\nWait, but Row 28 says Win (4-6), meaning in that fight he won, so overall he has more fights elsewhere.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 30: Opponent Julian Samaniego, Result: Win (3-6).\nRow 32: Opponent Melvin Guillard again? Wait, no. Let me check Row 34: Opponent Joe Camacho, Result: Win (2-4). So that's another win.\nRow 36: Opponent Justin Berkley, Result: Win (1-4).\nRow 38: Opponent Dokonjonosuke Mishima, Result: Loss (0-4).\nRow 40: Opponent Javier Vazquez, Result: Loss (0-3).\nRow 42: Opponent Jamal Perkins, Result: Loss (0-2).\nRow 44: Opponent Jens Pulver, Result: Loss (0-1).\n\nWait a second, that's all the rows for Rob Emerson. Let me count his wins and losses:\n\nWins:\n- Row 24: Win\n- Row 28: Win\n- Row 30: Win\n- Row 34: Win\n- Row 36: Win\n\nThat's 5 wins.\n\nLosses:\n- Row 26: Loss\n- Row 32: Wait, no. Looking back, in the table provided by the user, each row has an Opponent and Result. So let me list all Rob Emerson's rows:\n\n1. Rob vs Melvin Guillard (Win 2-5) \u2192 Win\n2. Rob vs Randy Velarde (Loss 2-5) \u2192 Loss\n3. Rob vs Jamie Schmidt (Win 4-6) \u2192 Win\n4. Rob vs Julian Samaniego (Win 3-6) \u2192 Win\n5. Rob vs Joe Camacho (Win 2-4) \u2192 Win\n6. Rob vs Justin Berkley (Win 1-4) \u2192 Win\n7. Rob vs Dokonjonosuke Mishima (Loss 0-4) \u2192 Loss\n8. Rob vs Javier Vazquez (Loss 0-3) \u2192 Loss\n9. Rob vs Jamal Perkins (Loss 0-2) \u2192 Loss\n10. Rob vs Jens Pulver (Loss 0-1) \u2192 Loss\n\nSo from this, Rob has 5 wins and 5 losses? But the claim says 12-9. That doesn't match. Wait, maybe I missed some rows. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow numbers where fighter is Rob Emerson: 24,26,28,30,34,36,38,40,42,44. That's 10 fights. Out of these, he has 5 wins and 5 losses.\n\nBut the claim says 12-9. So unless there are more fights not listed here, which seems unlikely because the table provided only goes up to row 44. Therefore, Rob Emerson's win-loss record in the table is 5-5, not 12-9. This contradicts the claim. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the list above, Wins: Rows 24,28,30,34,36 \u2192 5 wins.\n\nLosses: Rows26,32 (wait, no, row32 is Rob vs someone else? Wait, in the table as provided by the user, each row's fighter is listed, so let me clarify:\n\nLooking back at the table, I think I might have misread some rows. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nRow 0: Opponent=Not sure, Fighter=Someone else.\n...\nWait, actually, in the user's provided data, it seems that the first column is \"Opponent,\" and the second is \"Fighter.\" So for example:\n\nRow 0: Opponent=John Clayton, Fighter=Steve Cappello\nRow 1: Opponent=Jeff Curran, Fighter=Mark Hamper\n...\nContinuing on, I need to find all rows where the Fighter is Rob Emerson.\n\nSo starting from row 24:\n\nRow24: Opponent=Melvin Guillard, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Win (2-5)\nRow26: Opponent=Randy Velarde, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Loss (2-5)\nRow28: Opponent=Jamie Schmidt, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Win (4-6)\nRow30: Opponent=Julian Samaniego, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Win (3-6)\nRow34: Opponent=Joe Camacho, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Win (2-4)\nRow36: Opponent=Justin Berkley, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Win (1-4)\nRow38: Opponent=Dokonjonosuke Mishima, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Loss (0-4)\nRow40: Opponent=Javier Vazquez, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Loss (0-3)\nRow42: Opponent=Jamal Perkins, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Loss (0-2)\nRow44: Opponent=Jens Pulver, Fighter=Rob Emerson, Result=Loss (0-1)\n\nSo that's 10 rows where Rob Emerson is the fighter. Now, each row has a \"Win/Loss\" status.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. Win (2-5) \u2192 He won this fight.\n2. Loss (2-5) \u2192 He lost this fight.\n3. Win (4-6) \u2192 Win.\n4. Win (3-6) \u2192 Win.\n5. Win (2-4) \u2192 Win.\n6. Win (1-4) \u2192 Win.\n7. Loss (0-4) \u2192 Loss.\n8. Loss (0-3) \u2192 Loss.\n9. Loss (0-2) \u2192 Loss.\n10. Loss (0-1) \u2192 Loss.\n\nSo total wins: 5, total losses: 5.\n\nBut the claim is that he has a record of 12-9, which suggests more fights and different numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rows where Rob Emerson is the opponent? No, because in this context, if someone's the fighter, they are the one with the result. So for example, if Rob is fighting against Melvin Guillard, then in that row, he's the fighter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes more than just these 10 fights, but I can't see beyond Row44 as per the user's data.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, Rob Emerson has a 5-5 record in these 10 fights. The claim says 12-9, which doesn't align with what's shown here.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the claim is incorrect because the table indicates Rob Emerson has more wins and losses than stated, or at least not a 12-9 record.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Rob Emerson has a 12-9 win-loss record in his MMA career is **not supported by the provided data**. Upon examining the table, it appears that Rob Emerson fought a total of 10 matches, achieving 5 wins and 5 losses. This contradicts the assertion of a 12-9 record. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim about Rob Emerson's 12-9 record is incorrect based on the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim \"Rob Emerson played at the UFC 87 event three times in his career\" is true by checking the provided table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. The table has columns like Event, Opponent, etc., but the specific columns relevant here are probably the ones related to Emerson's participation in UFC 87 and how many times he competed there.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"Event\" column lists events where Emerson fought. I need to find if UFC 87 is listed there and how many times it appears alongside his opponents.\n\nI'll scan each row for \"UFC 87\". Let's see:\n\n1. In the first row under Event: UFC 87 vs. Mike Russian. So that's one appearance.\n2. Next, another entry: UFC 87 vs. Mike Russian again. Wait, so that would be two times at UFC 87?\n3. Are there any more entries with \"UFC 87\"? Let me check the rest of the table. After that, I don't see any other UFC 87 events listed.\n\nSo, from the table, Emerson fought twice at UFC 87: once against Mike Russian and another time against the same opponent. That means he was there two times at that event, not three as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim stating he played three times is incorrect. The correct number based on the table is two appearances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim: \"Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds be the only match to have decision method.\" I need to verify this using the provided table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions Rob Emerson and Eric Reynolds as the two fighters in a specific match. So, I need to look for their names in the 'Opponent' column because that's where each fighter they faced is listed.\n\nLooking at Rob Emerson's matches: in row 15, his opponent is Jamie Schmidt; row 14, it's Julian Samaniego; and so on. Hmm, wait, actually, Rob Emerson might be a different name. Let me check the table again. The rows are numbered starting from 0, right? So, row 0 is Melvin Guillard vs. Randy Velarde.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread that. The first fighter in each row is probably the one whose record is being listed. For example, row 0: Fighter A vs. Fighter B, with Fighter A's opponent being Melvin Guillard. So maybe Rob Emerson is not in the table as a fighter but perhaps as an opponent elsewhere.\n\nWait no, looking at the table, I see rows where the first cell is the fighter's name. For example, row 0: \"2 - 6\" under score might indicate wins and losses? Or is it something else. Wait, maybe each row shows two fighters facing off, with their win-loss record before that fight.\n\nSo, to find Rob Emerson, I need to look through the first column of each row for his name. Let me scan each row's first cell:\n\n- Row 0: \"Melvin Guillard\"\n- Row 1: \"Randy Velarde\"\n- Row 2: \"Rob Emerson\" \u2013 here we go, Rob Emerson is in row 13 (if counting starts from 0) or maybe I'm miscounting. Wait, let me count properly.\n\nWait, the table has many rows. Let me check each row's first cell:\n\nRow 0: Melvin Guillard\nRow 1: Randy Velarde\nRow 2: Jamie Schmidt\nRow 3: Julian Samaniego\n...\nWait, actually, looking at the data, I see that Rob Emerson is in row 13, with a score of 2-4 against Joe Camacho.\n\nNow, Eric Reynolds is mentioned as the opponent. So I need to look for Eric Reynolds in the 'Opponent' column. Let me check each row's second cell:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Melvin Guillard\nRow 1: Randy Velarde vs. Rob Emerson? Wait no, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each row seems to represent a fighter and their fight history. For example, the first column lists the fighter's name, then the opponent, and then some details about the method of victory or loss.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table more carefully, each row seems to be structured as:\n\n- Fighter A vs. Fighter B\n- Result details (like decision method)\n- Then some other columns like score, event, location.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each row is a fighter's fight history, with their name in the first column and their opponents listed after that. But it's a bit confusing because the table has multiple columns, and the content varies.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the 'Opponent' column specifically. Let me see: for each fighter, their opponent is listed, so Eric Reynolds would be in the Opponent column somewhere.\n\nLooking through the opponents:\n\n- Row 0: Melvin Guillard\n- Row 1: Randy Velarde\n- Row 2: Jamie Schmidt\n- Row 3: Julian Samaniego\n- ...\nContinuing down, I see that in row 9, the opponent is Eric Reynolds. So Rob Emerson's fight against Eric Reynolds is at row 9.\n\nThe claim states that this match was the only one with a decision method. So I need to check if this specific match resulted in a decision and whether any other matches in the table also used a decision method.\n\nLooking at the 'Method' column for this match (row 9), it says \"decision (unanimous)\". So that's one decision.\n\nNow, I need to check all the other matches in the table to see if any others ended with a decision method. If there are other decisions, then the claim is false because it's not the only one.\n\nSo let me go through each row and note the method:\n\n- Row 0: \"Melvin Guillard\" vs. Randy Velarde \u2013 method is \"decision (split)\".\n- Row 1: Rob Emerson vs. Jamie Schmidt \u2013 method is \"tko\".\n- Row 2: Rob Emerson vs. Julian Samaniego \u2013 method is \"tko\".\n- Row 3: Rob Emerson vs. Joe Camacho \u2013 method is \"decision (unanimous)\".\nWait, no, row 13 is Rob Emerson's fight against Joe Camacho.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the rows. Let me instead look for the 'Method' column.\n\nLooking at each row's method:\n\n- Row 0: Decision (split)\n- Row 1: Tko\n- Row 2: Tko\n- Row 3: Tko\n- Row 4: Tka\n- ...\nContinuing this, I notice that several fights end with a decision. For example, Rob Emerson's fight against Jamie Schmidt ended via tko (row 1), which is an abbreviation for Technical Knockout. Similarly, his fight against Julian Samaniego was also a tko.\n\nAdditionally, other fighters have matches decided by split or unanimous decisions as well. So there are multiple instances of decisions in the table, not just Rob Emerson vs. Eric Reynolds.\n\nTherefore, the claim that this match is the only one with a decision method is incorrect because there are others.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because there are multiple fights in the table where the decision method was used, including other matches involving Rob Emerson and other fighters. Therefore, Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds is not the sole instance of a decision method.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; there are other matches that also ended with a decision method, making Rob Emerson's fight against Eric Reynolds not unique in this regard.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim that \"rob emerson have only win 10 match in his career\" is true based on the provided table. First off, I should make sure I understand what's being asked. The user wants me to check each condition of the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant. Then, based on that, decide if the answer is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various matches with different opponents, the outcomes (win/loss), and other details like the event and location. The claim is specifically about Rob Emerson having only 10 wins in his career. So I need to count how many times Rob Emerson has won.\n\nWait, but first, I should check each row to see if any of them pertain to Rob Emerson's career. Each row starts with \"Opponent\" and then the outcome. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Opponent: Melvin Guillard - Result: Loss\n2. Opponent: Randy Velarde - Result: Loss\n3. Opponent: Joe Camacho - Result: Win\n4. Opponent: Justin Berkley - Result: Win\n5. Opponent: Jamie Schmidt - Result: Win\n6. Opponent: Julian Samaniego - Result: Win\n7. Opponent: Dokonjonosuke Mishima - Result: Loss\n8. Opponent: Jamal Perkins - Result: Loss\n9. Opponent: Jens Pulver - Result: Loss\n\nWait, that's only 9 opponents listed here. But the table seems to have more rows beyond this. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table, it starts from row 0 up to row 18 (since it goes from 0 to 19). Each row has \"Opponent\", \"Result\", \"Event\", and \"Location\". I need to see which of these opponents are Rob Emerson's wins.\n\nWait, but in the first column, is it Opponent or Fighter? Let me check: The first row shows \"Melvin Guillard\" as Opponent, so perhaps each row represents a fight where one fighter fought against another. So the first column might be either fighter A or fighter B, depending on the perspective.\n\nWait no, looking at the table structure, it's clear that the first column is Opponent, then Result, Event, and Location. So for each match, there's an opponent, the result of that fight (win/loss), the event name, and location.\n\nSo to check Rob Emerson's wins, I need to look through all these fights to see which ones he won.\n\nWait, but how do I know which fighter is Rob Emerson? The table doesn't explicitly state it; perhaps each row represents a different opponent, and for each fight, one of the fighters is the person in question.\n\nBut wait, in the table, the opponents listed are names like Melvin Guillard, Randy Velarde, Joe Camacho, etc. So I need to see if Rob Emerson is fighting against these opponents or if he's the one winning against them.\n\nWait no, perhaps each row represents a fight that Rob Emerson participated in. So for each match, either he wins or loses. Therefore, I should look through all rows where Rob Emerson was involved and count his wins.\n\nBut without knowing which fighter is Rob Emerson, this becomes tricky. Alternatively, the table might be structured such that each fighter is on one side, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the first column is the opponent, and then the result corresponds to whether they won against Rob Emerson or not. So if a row shows \"Win\", it means Rob Emerson won against that opponent, and if it's \"Loss\", he lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists all of Rob Emerson's fights, with his opponents on the left and his results on the right. So each row represents one of his matches.\n\nWait, but without knowing which fighter is Rob Emerson, I can't be certain. However, given that the claim is about Rob Emerson having only 10 wins, perhaps we should look through all rows where he has a win.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes all of Rob Emerson's matches, and each row shows whether he won or lost against that opponent.\n\nBut looking at the data, I see that in some rows, the opponents are defeating others, but without knowing which fighter is Rob Emerson, it's unclear. However, perhaps the name \"Rob Emerson\" isn't present in the table, so maybe the claim is based on an assumption.\n\nWait, no, the user didn't provide any information about who is Rob Emerson in the context of the table. The table seems to list various matches with opponents and outcomes, but it's unclear which fighter is Rob Emerson unless his name appears as the opponent or winner.\n\nLooking through the opponents listed: Melvin Guillard, Randy Velarde, Joe Camacho, Justin Berkley, Jamie Schmidt, Julian Samaniego, Dokonjonosuke Mishima, Jamal Perkins, Jens Pulver. None of these names are \"Rob Emerson,\" so perhaps Rob Emerson is not among them, which would mean the table doesn't include his matches.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim is about his career. Therefore, perhaps Rob Emerson is not listed as an opponent but as a fighter who has 10 wins against others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents a fight where one fighter won and another lost, and we need to count how many times Rob Emerson has won.\n\nBut without knowing which fighter is Rob Emerson, it's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the table isn't correctly structured for this analysis.\n\nWait, but perhaps the table is misaligned or I'm not interpreting it correctly. Let me look again: each row has four columns. The first seems to be Opponent, then Result, Event, and Location. So if Rob Emerson fought against these opponents, his results would be either Win or Loss in those fights.\n\nBut since none of the opponents are named Rob Emerson, perhaps the claim is incorrect because he hasn't participated in any matches listed here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rob Emerson is not an opponent but another fighter who has 10 wins. But that doesn't align with the claim stating \"Rob Emerson have only win 10 match.\"\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Maybe I need to consider that each row represents a fight where one of the two fighters is Rob Emerson, and the first column is his opponent.\n\nBut without knowing which fighter is Rob Emerson, I can't determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes all matches from various fighters, and we need to count how many times Rob Emerson has won. But again, without his name in any column, it's impossible.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the table doesn't include Rob Emerson at all, meaning he hasn't fought against these opponents. Therefore, if he only has 10 wins, but none of those are listed here, that could be possible.\n\nBut this line of reasoning isn't helping me much. Maybe I should approach it differently: count how many times a fighter named Rob Emerson won in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Melvin Guillard vs someone: Result is Loss for Guillard. So if Guillard lost, perhaps he's not Emerson.\n- Randy Velarde lost.\n- Joe Camacho won.\n- Justin Berkley won.\n- Jamie Schmidt won.\n- Julian Samaniego won.\n- Dokonjonosuke Mishima lost.\n- Jamal Perkins lost.\n- Jens Pulver lost.\n\nWait, so in these rows, the opponents (first column) are losing. So if any of these opponents are Rob Emerson, then he's losing here. But none of them are named Rob Emerson.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is a fight where one fighter won, and the other lost. If we assume that Rob Emerson is fighting against these opponents, then his wins would be the rows where he is the winner.\n\nBut since none of the opponents have names matching Rob Emerson, it's unclear. Perhaps Rob Emerson isn't in this table at all, meaning he hasn't fought any matches listed here.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says he has only 10 wins, but there are no fights listed where he won, that could be true if he has 10 wins elsewhere not listed in this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is incomplete or doesn't include all his fights. So the information provided isn't enough to confirm whether he has exactly 10 wins.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is to check each condition of the claim against the table. Since the table doesn't mention Rob Emerson at all, perhaps the answer is that there's no data to confirm or deny the claim based on this table alone.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe the table is a list of his fights, and we need to count how many times he won. But without his name in any row, it's impossible to know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rob Emerson is a fighter who hasn't participated in any matches listed here, so the claim that he has only 10 wins could be true if those 10 are elsewhere.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the table provided, there's no direct information about Rob Emerson's wins. Therefore, I can't confirm whether he has exactly 10 wins or not. The data is insufficient for this analysis.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Rob Emerson have only win 10 match in his career\" cannot be confirmed or denied based solely on the provided table. The table does not explicitly mention Rob Emerson as either an opponent or a fighter, making it impossible to determine how many matches he has won.\n\n**Answer:** The data provided is insufficient to confirm or deny the claim that Rob Emerson has only 10 wins in his career.",
