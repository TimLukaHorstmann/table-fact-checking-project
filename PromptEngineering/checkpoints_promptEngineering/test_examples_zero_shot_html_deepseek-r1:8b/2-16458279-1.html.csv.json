    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Nick Price is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by breaking down the claim and cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"nick price of zimbabwe be place t4 with a score of 70 to - 2 par.\" So, I need to check each part of this statement against the table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The key points are:\n1. Nick Price is from Zimbabwe.\n2. His placement in the tournament is \"t4\" (which likely stands for tied for 4th place).\n3. His score is 70.\n4. His \"to par\" status is -2.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if Nick Price matches these criteria.\n\nThe table has a column called \"player,\" which should help identify him. Scanning the rows:\n- Row 0: Darren Clarke, Northern Ireland\n- Row 1: Ricky Barnes (a), United States\n- Row 2: Sergio Garc\u00eda, Spain\n- Row 3: Nick Price, Zimbabwe\n- Row 4: Mike Weir, Canada\n- And so on.\n\nSo, Nick Price is in row index 3. Now, check his placement: The \"place\" column shows \"t4\" for him. That matches the claim's \"t4\" placement.\n\nNext, his score is listed as 70. That's correct according to the claim.\n\nFinally, the \"to par\" column for Nick Price says \"-2.\" That aligns with the claim stating a score of 70 to -2 par.\n\nAll the elements of the claim are present and correctly matched in the table. There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy or missing information.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"to par\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"Canada have a low score of 70\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that Canada has a low score of 70. So, my task is to find out if any player from Canada has a score of exactly 70 in the table provided.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table structure. The relevant columns are \"player\", \"country\", and \"score\". These are the key pieces of information needed to verify the claim. \n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to check for any player from Canada with a score of 70. Starting from the first row:\n\n1. Darren Clarke from Northern Ireland has a score of 66.\n2. Ricky Barnes (a) from the United States scored 69.\n3. Sergio Garc\u00eda from Spain has 69 as well.\n4. Nick Price from Zimbabwe scored 70.\n5. Mike Weir from Canada also scored 70.\n\nWait, that's important. Mike Weir is a Canadian player with a score of 70. So, Canada does have a player with that exact score mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking further down the table:\n\n6. Toru Taniguchi from Japan has 71.\n7. David Toms from the US also scored 71.\n8. Tim Clark and Jerry Kelly, Jeff Maggert, and Paul Lawrie all have scores of 72, but they are from South Africa, United States, and Scotland respectively.\n\nSo, only Mike Weir fits both the criteria: he's Canadian with a score of 70.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. Canada does have a player (Mike Weir) who scored exactly 70.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"71 be the lowest score when the country be canada\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that 71 is the lowest score and this happens when the country is Canada. So, I need to check two things: whether there are any players from Canada in the table and if their score is indeed 71 as the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find out which players are from Canada. The 'country' column will help me with that. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. Darren Clarke - Northern Ireland\n2. Ricky Barnes (a) - United States\n3. Sergio Garc\u00ed - Spain\n4. Nick Price - Zimbabwe\n5. Mike Weir - Canada\n6. Toru Taniguchi - Japan\n7. David Toms - United States\n8. Tim Clark - South Africa\n9. Jerry Kelly - United States\n10. Paul Lawrie - Scotland\n11. Jeff Maggert - United States\n\nSo, the only player from Canada is Mike Weir in row 5 (index 4 if starting at 0) with a score of 70 and to-par of -2.\n\nNow, let's check the scores. The claim says 71 is the lowest when the country is Canada. But Mike Weir has a score of 70, not 71. So, even though there's only one Canadian player, their score is higher than 71 in some other rows but lower than others.\n\nWait, actually, I need to consider all scores and see if any Canadian players have 71 as their score. Since Mike Weir has 70, which is lower than 71, the claim might be incorrect because 70 is lower than 71. So, there are no Canadian players with a score of 71; instead, they have 70.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"71 be the lowest score when the country be canada\" is false because the lowest score by a Canadian player is actually 70.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the place when the score be less than 71 and the country be zimbabwe be t2\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that there's a specific placement (t2) where the score is less than 71 and the country is Zimbabwe. So I should look for rows where both conditions are met: place is t2, score <71, country is Zimbabwe.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: place, player, country, score, to par. Let's go through each row to check these conditions.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Place=1, Score=66. Since 66<71 and country isn't Zimbabwe, doesn't meet.\n- Row1: t2 place, Score=69. Country is US, not Zimbabwe.\n- Row2: t2, Score=69 again. Same as above.\n- Row3: t4, Score=70. Not t2.\n- Row4: t4, Score=70 same as above.\n- Row5: t6, 71 which isn't less than 71. So no.\n- Row6: t6, also 71. No.\n- Rows7-10: All t8, so not t2.\n\nWait a minute, I'm scanning each row for place 't2' and score <71. Let me check if any row has both.\n\nLooking again:\nRows with place 't2' are rows1,2 (players Ricky Barnes and Sergio Garc\u00eda). Their scores are 69 and 69. Both less than 71, but their countries are US and Spain, not Zimbabwe.\n\nSo in the table, there's no player who is ranked t2, has a score under 71, and is from Zimbabwe. The only players from Zimbabwe I see are Nick Price (t4, 70) and Jeff Maggert (t8,72). Neither of them are t2 with scores <71.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any row in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, I analyzed each row to check for the conditions: place 't2', score less than 71, and country Zimbabwe. None of the rows meet all three criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the score when the player be toru taniguchi be 70.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asking. It mentions three things: the score, the player, and their country or something about them. Wait, no, actually, the claim specifically refers to \"when the player be toru taniguchi be 70.\" So, it's saying that when Toru Taniguchi plays, his score is 70.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find Toru Taniguchi's row and then check his score. Let me go through each row in the table.\n\nThe table has several rows with different players. The first player is Darren Clarke from Northern Ireland with a score of 66. Next is Ricky Barnes (a) from the United States with a score of 69. Then Sergio Garc\u00eda from Spain also scored 69. Nick Price from Zimbabwe and Mike Weir from Canada both have scores of 70. Toru Taniguchi is next, so I'll look for his name.\n\nWait, Toru Taniguchi's row is the sixth one. The player column says \"toru taniguchi,\" country is Japan, score is 71, and to par is -1. Hmm, but the claim says his score should be 70. So according to the table, he scored 71, not 70.\n\nSo that would mean the claim is FALSE because Toru Taniguchi's score isn't 70 as stated. \n\nNow, to check which cells are relevant. The \"score\" column is important here, specifically for Toru Taniguchi. His row index in the table seems to be 5 (since it's the sixth row, starting from 0). So the relevant cells would be the one where player is Toru Taniguchi and the score column.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because his score isn't 70.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
