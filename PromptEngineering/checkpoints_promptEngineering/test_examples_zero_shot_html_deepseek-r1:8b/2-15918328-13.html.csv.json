    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sonya tayeh be the jazz choreographer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that Sonya Tayeh was the jazz choreographer. So I need to find if there's any information in the table about Sonya Tayeh being associated with the jazz style or as a choreographer.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. The rows represent different dance couples and their performances.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for mentions of \"jazz\" in the style column because that's directly related to the claim. \n\nRow 0: Style is \"viennese waltz\" \u2013 not jazz.\nRow 1: Style is \"jazz\" \u2013 this seems relevant. The choreographer here is Sonya Tayeh.\nRow 2: Style is \"contemporary\" \u2013 not jazz.\nRow 3: Style is \"paso doble\" \u2013 not jazz.\nRow 4: Style is \"mambo\" \u2013 not jazz.\nRow 5: Style is \"hip - hop\" \u2013 not jazz.\n\nSo only Row 1 has the style as jazz. Now, looking at the choreographer column for that row: it's Sonya Tayeh. That directly matches the claim because the choreographer for that performance was Sonya Tayeh and the style was jazz.\n\nI don't need to consider other columns like \"music\" or \"results\" because they don't relate directly to the claim about being a choreographer. The relevant information is in Row 1, specifically under the \"choreographer (s)\" column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"choreographer (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"1 safe result be choreographed by jason gilkison to filet from le r\u00eave.\" So, the claim has two main points. \n\n1. There's at least one \"safe\" result.\n2. This safe result was choreographed by Jason Gilkison.\n3. The dance number is titled \"filet from le r\u00eave.\"\n\nNow, I need to check each part against the table. Let me look through the 'results' column for any entries marked as \"safe.\" From the table:\n\n- Row 2: Results are \"safe.\"\n- Row 4: Results are \"safe.\"\n\nSo there are two safe results.\n\nNext, I'll note which choreographers were involved in these safe results. \n\nFor row 2:\n- Couple: Katee Shean & Joshua Allen\n- Choreographer: Tyce Diorio\n\nFor row 4:\n- Couple: Katee Shean & Joshua Allen\n- Choreographer: Jason Gilkison\n\nSo, the second safe result was choreographed by Jason Gilkison. Now, I need to check if the dance number is \"filet from le r\u00eave.\"\n\nLooking at row 4, under 'music,' it's listed as \"filet from le r\u00eave.\" That matches the third part of the claim.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- There are safe results.\n- One of them was choreographed by Jason Gilkison for \"filet from le r\u00eave.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true. However, I should make sure there's only one instance related to Jason Gilkison and \"filet from le r\u00eave.\" From the table, that's the case\u2014only row 4 fits all three criteria.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells pointing to row 4 in 'choreographer(s)' and 'music' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"choreographer (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"music\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"katee shean joshua allen dance the contemporary piece.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three people: Kat\u00e9e Shean, Joshua Allen, and they are dancing a contemporary piece. So, I need to check if these individuals performed a contemporary style in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a couple and their performance details. Let's go through each relevant row where \"contemporary\" is mentioned as the style.\n\nThe third row has Kat\u00e9e Shean and Joshua Allen. The style listed here is indeed \"contemporary.\" That matches the claim. So this row is relevant.\n\nNow, I should also check if there are any other rows that might affect this conclusion. For example, if another performance by Kat\u00e9e Shean or Joshua Allen in a different style contradicts the claim, but from the table, it seems they only have one entry each. The fourth row is Paso Doble, so not relevant.\n\nTherefore, the main relevant cell is the third row's style column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"style\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"katee shean joshua allen dance to filet from le r\u00eave and be choreographed by tyce diorio.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts. It has two main points:\n\n1. Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced to \"Filet from Le R\u00eave.\"\n2. They were choreographed by Tyce Diorio.\n\nI'll go through each part step by step using the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. Each row represents a different dance performance or result.\n\nStarting with the first point: Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced to \"Filet from Le R\u00eave.\" I'll scan through each row's 'music' column to find if their name is paired with that song.\n\n- Row 0: Couple is Courtney Galiano & Mark Kanemura, music is \"the time of my life - david cook.\"\n- Row 1: Same couple, different style and music.\n- Row 2: Couple is Katee Shean & Joshua Allen. The music here is \"all by myself - celine dion.\" \n- Row 3: Same couple again, with music \"filet from le r\u00eave.\"\n\nSo in row 3, the music matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow for the second point: They were choreographed by Tyce Diorio. Looking at the 'choreographer(s)' column:\n\n- Row 2: Choreographer is Tyce Diorio.\n- Row 3: Choreographer is Jason Gilkison.\n\nSo in row 2, the choreographer matches, but in row 3, it's different.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions that they \"dance to\" and were \"choreographed by.\" So both points need to be true for the same performance. In the table, the dance to \"filet from le r\u00eave\" is in row 3, where the choreographer is Jason Gilkison, not Tyce Diorio.\n\nBut earlier, in row 2, they danced to a different song and were choreographed by Tyce Diorio. So does that mean the claim isn't fully supported because the two facts don't align for the same dance? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is implying that they both did a dance choreographed by Tyce Diorio and also danced to \"filet from le r\u00eave.\" But looking at the table, row 2 has them dancing to \"all by myself\" with Tyce as choreographer, and row 3 is a different dance with Jason.\n\nSo maybe the claim is incorrect because in the same row where they danced to \"filet,\" the choreographer isn't Tyce. Therefore, the two facts (dancing to that song and being choreographed by Tyce) don't both occur for the same couple and performance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the claim, assuming both happened in different rows, but the claim seems to conflate the two without specifying which row or whether it's a single performance. Therefore, since in the specific row where they danced to \"filet,\" the choreographer was someone else, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"choreographer (s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"music\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"katee shean joshua allen dance to all by myself celine dion in the paso doble style.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three specific things: the dancers (Katee Shean and Joshua Allen), the song (\"All By Myself\" by Celine Dion), and the dance style (Paso Doble).\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different performance or couple. The columns are: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match the claim.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura\n- Style: viennese waltz\n- Music: the time of my life - david cook\n- Choreographer: jason gilkison\n- Results: kanemura eliminated\n\nThis doesn't match the claim because the couple is different, and the style isn't Paso Doble.\n\nSecond row:\n- Couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura\n- Style: jazz\n- Music: the garden - mirah\n- Choreographer: sonya tayeh\n- Results: kanemura eliminated\n\nAgain, doesn't match because of different couple and style.\n\nThird row:\n- Couple: katee shean joshua allen\n- Style: contemporary\n- Music: all by myself - celine dion\n- Choreographer: tyce diorio\n- Results: safe\n\nHere, the couple matches, but the style is Contemporary, not Paso Doble. So this doesn't fit.\n\nFourth row:\n- Couple: katee shean joshua allen\n- Style: paso doble\n- Music: filet from le r\u00eave\n- Choreographer: jason gilkison\n- Results: safe\n\nThis matches both the couple and style, but the music is different. The claim mentions \"all by myself,\" which isn't here.\n\nWait, actually, in the third row, the music is \"all by myself - celine dion,\" which does match that part of the claim. But the style there is Contemporary, not Paso Doble. So maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking at the fourth row: style is Paso Doble and couple is correct, but music doesn't match the claim's song. The claim specifies \"all by myself\" which is in row 3, but that row's style is Contemporary, not Paso Doble.\n\nSo perhaps there's no single row where all three elements of the claim are met: the specific couple, the specific song, and the specific style.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says they dance to \"all by myself\" in Paso Doble. So does any row have that combination?\n\nLooking at row 3: it has the correct couple and song but wrong style. Row 4: correct couple and style but wrong song. No row where all three are correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported because none of the rows match all three aspects: couple, song, and style.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"katee shean joshua allen dance to all by myself celine dion in the paso doble style,\" we need to check if there's a row where the couple is Katee Shean & Joshua Allen, the music is \"all by myself\" by Celine Dion, and the style is Paso Doble.\n\n- **Row 3**: Couple matches, but style is Contemporary.\n- **Row 4**: Style matches, but song doesn't match.\n\nNo row meets all three criteria.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"katee shean joshua aleen dance a jazz style and be safe\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several rows and columns. The relevant columns seem to be 'couple', 'style', 'music', 'choreographer (s)', and 'results'. Each row represents a different performance or couple.\n\nThe claim mentions \"katee shean joshua aleen\". Wait, I notice that in the table, it's spelled as \"katEE shean joshua allen\" with an extra E. So the name might be misspelled. That could be a red flag because if the names don't match exactly, the claim might not hold.\n\nLooking at the table, under the 'couple' column, one of the rows is \"katee shean joshua allen\". Let's check the rest of that row to see what it says about the style and results. The 'style' for this row is 'contemporary', which doesn't match the claim's 'jazz'. Hmm, so that might not be the right row.\n\nWait, another row also has \"katee shean joshua allen\". Let me check that one. The 'style' here is 'paso doble', which again doesn't match 'jazz'. So neither of these two rows have a style of jazz.\n\nI need to find a row where the couple is spelled correctly as \"katEE shean joshua allen\" and the style is jazz. Looking at other couples, I see there's one with \"katee shean joshua allen\" again, but 'style' is 'contemporary'. Another couple is \"chelsie hightower stephen twitch boss\", which doesn't match the name in the claim.\n\nWait a minute, the claim might have a typo. It says \"joshua aleen\", but the table has \"joshua allen\". So even if I find a row with the correct style and choreographer, the names don't fully match because of the typo. That would mean the claim isn't entirely accurate.\n\nLet me check for any rows where 'style' is jazz. Scanning through the table, the second row has 'jazz' as the style. The couple there is \"courtney galiano mark kanemura\", which doesn't match the claim's couple name.\n\nSo, in summary, I'm looking for a row where:\n1. The couple is exactly \"katEE shean joshua allen\".\n2. The style is 'jazz'.\n3. The results are 'safe'.\n\nFrom the table, there's no such row because the correct names don't match and the style isn't jazz in any matching rows. Also, the typo in the name makes it hard to find a relevant row.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect. There's no evidence in the table that supports all parts of the claim accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"style\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the choreographer(s) for the style jazz be tyce diorio and sonya tayeh.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There's a table with headers: couple, style, music, choreographer(s), and results. Each row seems to represent a different performance or dance routine.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"style\" being jazz and the associated choreographers. So I should focus on rows where the style is jazz. Let me scan through each row:\n\n1. The first two rows have styles like viennese waltz and jazz, but the second one is jazz. Wait, actually, the first row has a style of viennese waltz, so that's not relevant. The second row's style is jazz.\n\nLooking at the second row: \n- Style: jazz\n- Choreographer(s): jason gilkison\n\nWait, the claim says the choreographers should be tyce diorio and sonya tayeh, but here it's just jason gilkison alone. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again. The second row is:\n- Couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura\n- Style: jazz\n- Music: the garden - mirah\n- Choreographer(s): sonya tayeh\n\nOh wait, no. Wait, in the table provided, let me recount each row properly.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's message, the table has 6 rows. Let me list them out with their styles and choreographers:\n\n1. Style: viennese waltz; Choreographer(s): jason gilkison\n2. Style: jazz; Choreographer(s): sonya tayeh (row index 1)\n3. Style: contemporary; Choreographer(s): tyce diorio\n4. Style: paso doble; Choreographer(s): jason gilkison\n5. Style: mambo; Choreographer(s): tony meredith and melanie lapatin assisting\n6. Style: hip-hop; Choreographer(s): tabitha and napoleon d'umo\n\nWait, so the claim is about the style \"jazz\" having choreographers tyce diorio and sonya tayeh.\n\nLooking at row 1 (second row overall), which has style jazz, the choreographer is sonya tayeh. There's no mention of tyce diorio here. So that doesn't match the claim.\n\nWait, but in another part, maybe row 2 (third overall) has style contemporary with choreographer tyce diorio. But the claim is about style jazz, so that's a different style.\n\nSo, the only row for jazz is row 1, where the choreographer is sonya tayeh, not including tyce diorio. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it lists both tyce and sonya as choreographers for jazz when only sonya is listed.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the choreographer(s) for the style jazz be tyce diorio and sonya tayeh,\" we examine each row where the style is \"jazz\" in the table. The relevant rows are:\n\n1. **Row 1 (second overall):**\n   - Style: jazz\n   - Choreographer(s): sonya tayeh\n\nThis row shows that only sonya tayeh was the choreographer for the jazz style, not tyce diorio as stated in the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the table does not support the inclusion of both choreographers mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"choreographer (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
