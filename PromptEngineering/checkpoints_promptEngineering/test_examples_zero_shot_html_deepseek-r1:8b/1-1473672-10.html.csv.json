    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Rene Lambert is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"rene lambert play right wing and be draft with the 146th pick.\" So there are two main parts here. One is about his position, and the other is about his draft pick number.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start with Rene Lambert's details. Scanning through each row, I see that row 146 corresponds to Rene Lambert. Let me confirm: row index starts at 0, so the first data row is 0, which is Garry Howatt, then 1 for Steve Lyon, and so on. So row 145 is Steve Lyon, then 146 is Rene Lambert. Yes, correct.\n\nNow, checking his position. The 'position' column for row 146 says \"right wing.\" That matches the first part of the claim: he plays right wing. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the draft pick number. The 'pick' column shows the numbers in order from 144 onwards. For Rene Lambert at row 146, the 'pick' is 146. Wait a second, in the table, each row has a 'pick' number, starting at 144 and going up to 151. So row 0 is pick 144, row 1 is 145, so row 146 would be pick 150? Wait no, wait let me count again.\n\nWait, the first data row after the header is row 0 (Garry Howatt) with pick 144. Then Steve Lyon is row 1 (pick 145), Rene Lambert is row 2 (pick 146). Oh, so in the table, each tr starts from index 0 for Garry Howatt as row 0. So row 0: pick 144, row 1: 145, row 2:146, etc. So for Rene Lambert, his row index is 2, and the pick number is 146.\n\nWait no, looking at the table:\n\nThe first tr after thead is the first data row (Garry Howatt) with td 144. Then Steve Lyon next with 145, then Rene Lambert with 146. So in the table, the 'pick' column for each row increments correctly. So for row index 2 (third data row), pick is 146.\n\nSo the claim says he was drafted with the 146th pick. According to the table, that's correct because his pick number is 146.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The 'pick' column in the table has numbers starting at 144 and going up by 1 each row. So the first data row (row index 0) is pick 144, next row (index 1) is 145, then row 2 is 146. Therefore, Rene Lambert is indeed picked 146th.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported: he plays right wing and was drafted with the 146th pick.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"right wing , rene lampert , be pick 145th\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table. The claim has three main parts:\n\n1. \"right wing\" \u2013 This refers to a position in hockey.\n2. \"rene lampert\" \u2013 This seems to be a name of a player.\n3. \"be pick 145th\" \u2013 This likely means that Rene Lambert was picked 145th overall.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to see if this information is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table's columns: pick, player, position, nationality, nhl team, and college / junior / club team.\n\nI need to find a row where:\n- The \"player\" column matches \"rene lampert\".\n- The \"position\" column matches \"right wing\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 144:\n- Player: garry howatt\n- Position: left wing\n\nNot matching.\n\nRow 145:\n- Player: steve lyon\n- Position: defence\n\nNope.\n\nRow 146:\n- Player: rene lambert\n- Position: right wing\n\nYes! This matches both the player name and position mentioned in the claim. Now, checking the pick number. The \"pick\" column in this row is 145, which aligns with the claim stating he was picked 145th.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 146, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 146, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 146, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
