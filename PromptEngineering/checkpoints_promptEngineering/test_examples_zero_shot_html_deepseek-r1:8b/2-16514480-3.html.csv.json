    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read the claim again: \"nick faldo be the only player list who be play for england , while ian woosnam be play for wale\". Wait, that seems a bit confusing with the wording. Maybe it's saying that Nick Faldo is the only player listed as playing for England, and Ian Woosnam plays for Wales.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the \"country\" column lists where each player is from. Let me go through each row to check if any other players besides Faldo are from England.\n\nStarting with the first few rows: Greg Norman from Australia, Nick Faldo from England, David Frost from South Africa, Phil Mickelson from the US, Lee Janzen and Bob Tway also from the US, Scott Hoch, McCarron, and Singh from various countries. Then Corey Pavin and Ian Woosnam from Wales.\n\nSo, in row 2, it's Nick Faldo, England. Then, looking further down, at row 10, I see Ian Woosnam is from Wales. Wait, the claim says \"while ian woosnam be play for wale\"\u2014so that part seems correct because he's listed as Wales.\n\nBut the first part says Faldo is the only player playing for England. However, looking through all the rows, no one else besides Faldo is listed as England. So, if the claim says that Faldo is the only one from England, that would be TRUE based on the table provided.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The country column shows each player's nationality. Only Nick Faldo has England as his country in the table. So yes, he's the sole player listed for England. And Ian Woosnam is indeed from Wales.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct. The answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be where both players are listed: row 2 (Faldo) and row 10 (Woosnam).\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks that Nick Faldo is the only player from England and Ian Woosnam is from Wales. Both conditions are met in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim says, \"greg norman and nick faldo be list on place 1 and 2, respectively.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two players: Greg Norman and Nick Faldo. They are supposed to be listed at positions 1 and 2 in the table. So, I need to check their placement and their details.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a place (like 1, 2, t3, etc.), player name, country, score, and to par. I should focus on the 'place' column for Greg Norman and Nick Faldo to see where they are ranked.\n\nStarting with Greg Norman: Scanning down the rows, the first entry is row 0 (since it starts from 0) where place is 1. The player's name here is Greg Norman. So that matches part of the claim\u2014Greg is at position 1.\n\nNext, Nick Faldo. Looking through the table, I see that row 1 has place 2 and the player is Nick Faldo. That fits because the claim says he should be at place 2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there aren't any other entries for them. Scanning further, Greg Norman doesn't appear again in another row, so position 1 is only his. Similarly, Nick Faldo's name only appears once in row 1 as position 2.\n\nSo both players are correctly placed at positions 1 and 2 respectively. There\u2019s no conflicting information or errors here. The scores and other details don\u2019t seem to affect this particular claim about their placement.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about Greg Norman is true based on the table provided. The claim says: \"greg norman be list to have be play for australia , and have - 12 stroke to par.\" First off, I notice that the user might have made some typos in the claim, like \"be list\" probably meaning \"be listed\" or \"be placed,\" and \"stroke to par\" seems correct. So, translating this, the claim is saying two main things about Greg Norman: he's listed as playing for Australia, and his score is -12 stroke to par.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a list of players with their places (like 1st, 2nd, etc.), names, countries, scores, and strokes to par. My task is to check each part of the claim against this table.\n\nStarting with the first part: Greg Norman being listed as playing for Australia. Scanning through the 'player' column in the table, I see the first row has \"greg norman\" and his country is \"australia.\" So that checks out. That means the first part of the claim is supported by the data.\n\nNow, the second part: having -12 stroke to par. Looking at the 'score' column, for Greg Norman's row, it says \"63 + 69 = 132.\" Wait, but in the 'to par' column, it shows \"-12.\" Hmm, so does that mean his score is -12 relative to par? I think in golf terminology, scores can be strokes above or below par. So if he has a score of 132 and the course par is likely higher than that, leading to him being -12. For example, if the course par for the tournament is 144 (which is common for professional events), his score of 132 would indeed be -12. So the 'to par' column correctly reflects that.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"at least 5 of the player list be play for the united state.\" First, I should understand what this means. It seems like the claim is asserting that at least five players in the list are from the United States.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there's a column called \"country\" where each player's nationality is listed. My task is to go through each row and count how many players have their country as \"United States.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Greg Norman - Australia\n2. Nick Faldo - England\n3. David Frost - South Africa\n4. Phil Mickelson - United States (that's 1)\n5. Lee Janzen - United States (now 2)\n6. Bob Tway - United States (3)\n7. Scott Hoch - United States (4)\n8. Scott McCarron - United States (5)\n9. Vijay Singh - Fiji\n10. Corey Pavin - United States (6)\n11. Ian Woosnam - Wales\n\nSo, players from the United States are Phil Mickelson, Lee Janzen, Bob Tway, Scott Hoch, Scott McCarron, and Corey Pavin. That's a total of 6 players.\n\nThe claim says \"at least 5,\" so 6 is more than enough. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns are \"player\" and \"country.\" For each player from the United States, their row index and country column need to be noted. Let me list them:\n\n- Row 4 (index 3): Phil Mickelson, United States\n- Row 5 (index 4): Lee Janzen, United States\n- Row 6 (index 5): Bob Tway, United States\n- Row 7 (index 6): Scott Hoch, United States\n- Row 8 (index 7): Scott McCarron, United States\n- Row 10 (index 9): Corey Pavin, United States\n\nWait, the row indices in the table start at 0? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the HTML, each tr has a position like <tr>, and the first is index 0. So, for example:\n\nRow 1: greg norman, australia \u2192 index 0\nRow 2: nick faldo, england \u2192 index 1\n...\nRow 4: Phil Mickelson \u2192 index 3\nRow 5: Lee Janzen \u2192 index 4\nRow 6: Bob Tway \u2192 index 5\nRow 7: Scott Hoch \u2192 index 6\nRow 8: Scott McCarron \u2192 index 7\nRow 10: Corey Pavin \u2192 index 9\n\nSo the relevant rows are indices 3,4,5,6,7,9. For each of these, I need to note \"player\" and \"country\" columns.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include:\n\n- {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"player\"}, no, wait: No, only for players from US. So index 3 is Phil Mickelson, column player; index4 Lee Janzen, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I got confused with indices. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table's tbody:\n\nThe first tr has place=1 \u2192 row_index=0\nSecond tr: place=2 \u2192 row_index=1\nThird: t3 \u2192 row_index=2\nFourth: t3 \u2192 row_index=3\nFifth: t5 \u2192 row_index=4\nSixth: t5 \u2192 row_index=5\nSeventh: t7 \u2192 row_index=6\nEighth: t7 \u2192 row_index=7\nNinth: t7 \u2192 row_index=8\nTenth: t10 \u2192 row_index=9\nEleventh: t10 \u2192 row_index=10\n\nSo, the players from US are at row indices 3 (Phil Mickelson), 4 (Lee Janzen),5 (Bob Tway),6 (Scott Hoch),7 (Scott McCarron), and 9 (Corey Pavin). Wait, that's six players. So row indices 3,4,5,6,7,9.\n\nTherefore, for each of these rows, the columns are \"player\" and \"country.\" But wait, the claim is about the player list being from the US, so the relevant cells would be the ones indicating the country is US. Or perhaps, the 'player' column isn't necessary; maybe just the country. Wait, the claim is about players being from the US, so the relevant column is \"country.\" But the instruction says to include row_index and column_name that verifies the condition.\n\nSo, for each player from US, their row index and country (which is the same as the claim's condition) need to be noted. Therefore, the relevant cells are those where country is United States.\n\nLooking back, in the table:\n\nRow 3: Phil Mickelson \u2192 US\nRow4: Lee Janzen \u2192 US\nRow5: Bob Tway \u2192 US\nRow6: Scott Hoch \u2192 US\nRow7: Scott McCarron \u2192 US\nRow9: Corey Pavin \u2192 US\n\nSo row indices 3,4,5,6,7,9 have country as United States.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For each of these rows, their \"country\" column is the one that verifies they're from US. So perhaps I should include both 'player' and 'country'? Or maybe just 'country' since it's about the player's origin.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about the players being from US, so to verify each individual player's country, we need their \"country\" data. Therefore, for each player from US, I can include both row index, column name 'player', and column name 'country'. Alternatively, perhaps just 'country' because that's what the condition is based on.\n\nBut according to the problem statement: You are tasked with identifying which cells would be relevant in determining whether the claim is true. So, each player from US has a \"country\" cell that shows their origin. Therefore, those cells (each with row index and column name 'country') are the ones confirming the condition for each such player.\n\nBut wait, perhaps to verify each occurrence of a US player, you need both the row index and country column. Or maybe just country.\n\nHmm, I think the columns relevant are \"player\" and \"country.\" Because if you're trying to confirm that the player is from the US, you might need to check their 'player' name (to link them) but actually, in this context, perhaps it's sufficient to look at the 'country' column.\n\nBut according to the instruction, I think for each player, we should list their row index and which column (i.e., country) is relevant. So each player from US would have a cell with their row index and \"country\" as the column.\n\nSo, in total:\n\nFor Phil Mickelson: row 3, country\nLee Janzen: row4, country\nBob Tway: row5, country\nScott Hoch: row6, country\nScott McCarron: row7, country\nCorey Pavin: row9, country\n\nWait, but Corey Pavin is at index9? Let me check the table:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe HTML shows the rows as:\n\n1. tr with place=1 \u2192 row_index=0\n2. place=2 \u2192 1\n3. t3 \u2192 2\n4. t3 \u2192 3 (Phil)\n5. t5 \u21924 (Lee)\n6. t5\u21925 (Bob)\n7. t7\u21926 (Scott H)\n8. t7\u21927 (Scott M)\n9. t7\u21928 (Vijay)\n10. t10\u21929 (Corey P)\n11. t10\u219210 (Ian)\n\nSo Corey Pavin is row_index=9.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row 3: Phil Mickelson's country\n- row4: Lee Janzen's country\n- row5: Bob Tway's country\n- row6: Scott Hoch's country\n- row7: Scott McCarron's country\n- row9: Corey Pavin's country\n\nThus, each of these cells is in the \"country\" column and has a value of \"United States.\"\n\nSo to answer, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n[ { \"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"country\" }, { \"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"country\" }, { \"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"country\" }, { \"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"country\" }, { \"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"country\" }, { \"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"country\" } ]\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the final answer is to list these cells as above.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each player's nationality. Six players from the United States meet the condition, making the claim true. The relevant cells are those indicating their country as \"United States.\"\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\" }\n]\n```",

The claim says: \"david frost be the only player listed who play for south africa , while vijay singh be play for fiji.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant information. Let me scan each row to see if any players are from South Africa or Fiji.\n\nLooking at the 'country' column:\n\n- Row 2: player is David Frost, country is South Africa.\n- Row 6: Vijay Singh, country is Fiji.\n\nSo, David Frost is listed as being from South Africa. Now, I need to check if he's the only player from South Africa in the table. Scanning through all rows:\n\n1. Greg Norman - Australia\n2. Nick Faldo - England\n3. David Frost - South Africa\n4. Phil Mickelson - United States\n5. Lee Janzen - United States\n6. Bob Tway - United States\n7. Scott Hoch - United States\n8. Scott McCarron - United States\n9. Vijay Singh - Fiji\n10. Corey Pavin - United States\n11. Ian Woosnam - Wales\n\nOnly David Frost is from South Africa, so he's the only one. That part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNext, checking about Vijay Singh: The claim says he plays for Fiji. Looking at his row, yes, his country is Fiji. So that also checks out.\n\nWait, but the way the claim is phrased might have a mistake. It says \"while vijay singh be play for fiji.\" There's a typo there\u2014\"be play\" should be \"play.\" But regardless of the typo, the content is correct: Vijay is from Fiji.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are true based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that David Frost is the only player listed who plays for South Africa and that Vijay Singh plays for Fiji. From the table:\n\n- David Frost is indeed the only player from South Africa.\n- Vijay Singh is listed as playing for Fiji.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"only 3 of the player list be play for the united state.\" Hmm, first off, I should probably check if there's a typo in the claim. It mentions \"be play,\" which doesn't sound right. Maybe it's supposed to say \"belong\" or \"play\"? But I'll go with the given wording.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find out how many players are from the United States. So, each row has a 'country' column, and some of those countries are the United States. Let me go through each player one by one.\n\nFirst, Greg Norman is from Australia\u2014so that's not the U.S. Nick Faldo is from England, so no. David Frost is from South Africa, no. Phil Mickelson is from the United States\u2014that's one. Lee Janzen and Bob Tway are both from the United States as well, so that's three so far.\n\nWait, Scott Hoch, Scott McCarron, and Vijay Singh are all from the United States too. That brings the total to six. Corey Pavin and Ian Woosnam are also from the U.S., making it eight players in total from the United States.\n\nSo the claim says only 3, but there are actually more than that\u2014like at least eight.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a certain claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"bob tway be the only player list who be play for england , while corey pavin be play for wale.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. My main focus here is on verifying two things from the claim. \n\nThe first part of the claim says that Bob Tway is the only player listed who plays for England. So I need to check if any other players besides Bob Tway are associated with England in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'country' column, I'll go through each row to see which players are from England. The first row is Greg Norman from Australia, so that's not England. Next is Nick Faldo from England\u2014so that's one player. Then we have David Frost from South Africa and Phil Mickelson from the United States. Lee Janzen and Bob Tway are both from the US. Scott Hoch, Scott McCarron, and Vijay Singh are also from the US or Fiji. Corey Pavin is from the US as well, and Ian Woosnam is from Wales.\n\nSo, in the table, I see Nick Faldo and possibly others? Wait, no, let me recount. Bob Tway is listed twice at t5 and t5, but each player is unique per row. So the only other England player is Nick Faldo. That means Bob Tway isn't the only one; there's also Nick Faldo playing for England.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the table, the second row is Nick Faldo from England, and then later rows don't have any more players from England except Bob Tway? No, wait, no. Let me check each player's country:\n\n1. Greg Norman - Australia\n2. Nick Faldo - England\n3. David Frost - South Africa\n4. Phil Mickelson - US\n5. Lee Janzen - US\n6. Bob Tway - US\n7. Scott Hoch - US\n8. Scott McCarron - US\n9. Vijay Singh - Fiji\n10. Corey Pavin - US\n11. Ian Woosnam - Wales\n\nSo, the only players from England are Nick Faldo and... wait, no, is Bob Tway from England? Wait, in the table, Bob Tway's country is listed as United States. So the only player from England is Nick Faldo. Therefore, the claim says that Bob Tway is the only player from England, but there's also Nick Faldo, so that part is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check each row. The second row is Nick Faldo from England. Then looking further, the other players: t3 is David Frost from South Africa, Phil Mickelson from US, Lee Janzen and Bob Tway are both US. Scott Hoch, McCarron, Singh are also US or Fiji. Corey Pavin and Ian Woosnam are US and Wales respectively.\n\nSo, only Nick Faldo is from England in the table. Therefore, the claim that Bob Tway is the only player from England is FALSE because Nick Faldo is also listed as playing for England.\n\nNow, moving to the second part of the claim: \"while corey pavin be play for wale.\" So Corey Pavin is from the United States, according to the table. But the claim says he plays for Wales. That's incorrect. So both parts of the claim are false.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The claim is: \"bob tway be the only player list who be play for england , while corey pavin be play for wale.\" So Bob Tway should be the only one from England, and Corey Pavin from Wales.\n\nIn the table, Bob Tway's country is United States, so he isn't from England. Nick Faldo is from England, but he's not mentioned in the claim. Also, Corey Pavin is from the US, not Wales. So both claims are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the overall answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns involved are 'player' and 'country'. For Bob Tway, his row index is 5 (since rows start at 0?), wait no\u2014the table has rows from 1 to 11, but in the code it's zero-indexed? Wait, looking back, the first row is <tr> with td 1, so maybe it's 1-based. But in the JSON example, they use row_index starting from 0.\n\nWait, the user provided an example where relevant_cells are [{\"row_index\":0, ...}, {\"row_index\":1,...}]. So it seems that row indices start at 0 for the first row.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nThe first row after <thead> is the first data row, which corresponds to place=1. So in the JSON example, row_index starts from 0. Therefore, each tr has a row index starting from 0.\n\nSo, Bob Tway is in rows 5 and 6 (since he's at t5 and t5 again?), but wait no. Wait, looking at the table:\n\nThe players are:\n\n1. Greg Norman\n2. Nick Faldo\n3. David Frost\n4. Phil Mickelson\n5. Lee Janzen\n6. Bob Tway\n7. Scott Hoch\n8. Scott McCarron\n9. Vijay Singh\n10. Corey Pavin\n11. Ian Woosnam\n\nBut wait, each tr corresponds to a single player, so the first data row is index 0, with place=1.\n\nSo Bob Tway's rows are at indices 5 and 6 (assuming duplicate?), but perhaps it's better to check if he appears only once or twice.\n\nWait, in the table structure, I see each player is listed once per row. So if a player has the same rank, they might be duplicated, but in this case, all places are unique except Bob Tway is mentioned twice? Wait no, looking at the code:\n\nIn the initial table description, it's likely that each tr corresponds to one player, so:\n\nRow 0: place=1, player=Greg Norman\nRow1: Nick Faldo\nRow2: David Frost\nRow3: Phil Mickelson\nRow4: Lee Janzen\nRow5: Bob Tway\nRow6: Scott Hoch\nRow7: Scott McCarron\nRow8: Vijay Singh\nRow9: Corey Pavin\nRow10: Ian Woosnam\n\nWait, that would be 11 rows. So if Bob Tway is at row5 and maybe another, but I think in the table, each player appears once.\n\nSo for Bob Tway, his row index is 5 (assuming 0-based). His country is US, so to verify the claim that he's from England, we look at column 'country' of row5: it says \"United States\". So that's incorrect. Therefore, cell row5 in 'player' column is Bob Tway.\n\nSimilarly, for Corey Pavin, his row index is 9 (since place=10). His country is US. The claim says he plays for Wales, so we look at 'country' of row9: \"United States\". So that's incorrect too.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Bob Tway: player column, row5\nCountry column, row5\n\nFor Corey Pavin: player column, row9\nCountry column, row9\n\nSo in JSON, we should include these four cells as they are relevant to disproving the claim.\n\nPutting it all together, since both claims are incorrect (Bob isn't only from England and Corey isn't from Wales), the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells are Bob Tway's player and country details, and Corey Pavin's player and country details.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to verify two claims about players' countries based on the provided table. \n\n1. **Claim 1**: Bob Tway is the only player listed who plays for England.\n2. **Claim 2**: Corey Pavin plays for Wales.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Claim 1**: Nick Faldo, not Bob Tway, is the only player from England in the table.\n- **Claim 2**: Corey Pavin is actually from the United States, not Wales.\n\nBoth claims are incorrect. The relevant data cells to support this conclusion are Bob Tway's and Corey Pavin's entries in both the 'player' and 'country' columns.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column\": \"player\", \"value\": \"Bob Tway\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column\": \"country\", \"value\": \"United States\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9, \"column\": \"player\", \"value\": \"Corey Pavin\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9, \"column\": \"country\", \"value\": \"United States\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"david frost and scott mccarron be list on place 1 and 2, respectively.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row represents a player's performance.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: David Frost and Scott McCarron. So, I need to find their rows in the table.\n\nLooking through the 'player' column:\n\n- The first row is Greg Norman.\n- Second row is Nick Faldo.\n- Third row is David Frost (t3).\n- Fourth row is Phil Mickelson.\n- Fifth row is Lee Janzen and Bob Tway (both t5).\n- Sixth row is Scott Hoch, Scott McCarron, and Vijay Singh (all t7).\n- Seventh row is Corey Pavin and Ian Woosnam (t10).\n\nWait, so where is David Frost? He's in the third row with a place of t3. Similarly, Scott McCarron is also in the sixth row with t7.\n\nThe claim says David Frost should be on place 1 and Scott McCarron on place 2. But looking at their actual places: David Frost is t3, not 1, and Scott McCarron is t7, not 2.\n\nSo this means both parts of the claim are incorrect. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: I need to identify which cells in the table support or contradict the claim. Since the claim refers to place numbers and player names, the relevant columns would be 'place' and 'player'. The rows are where David Frost and Scott McCarron are located, which are row 2 (t3) for David Frost and row 5 (t7) for Scott McCarron.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For David Frost: Place is t3 (row index 2), player column.\n- For Scott McCarron: Place is t7 (row index 5), player column.\n\nThus, these are the cells that show their actual places and confirm their positions in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Greg Norman is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"greg norman be list to have be play for wale , and have - 3 stroke to par.\" Hmm, there are a few issues here. The name is misspelled as \"greg norman\" instead of \"Greg Norman,\" and the sentence structure seems off. But I think the main points are that Greg Norman should be listed to play for Wales and have a score with \"-3 stroke to par.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each part of the claim. Let me go through it.\n\nStarting with the first part: is Greg Norman playing for Wales? The table lists players under different columns, but the 'country' column seems important here. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Australia\n- Row 1: England\n- Row 2: South Africa\n- Row 3: United States\n- Row 4: United States\n- Row 5: United States\n- Row 6: United States\n- Row 7: Fiji\n- Row 8: United States\n- Row 9: Wales\n- Row 10: United States\n\nWait, the 9th row has Ian Woosnam from Wales. So Greg Norman isn't listed as playing for Wales. The claim says he should be, which is incorrect.\n\nNext part: having a \"-3 stroke to par.\" The 'to par' column shows each player's score relative to par. Let me check Greg Norman's entry. Looking at row 0, the 'player' is Greg Norman, country Australia, and 'to par' is -12. So his score is 132, which is significantly below par.\n\nThe claim mentions \"-3 stroke,\" but in golf terms, \"stroke\" can refer to a penalty or a score. However, the term might be used incorrectly here. The table uses 'to par,' which shows how many strokes above or below par the player is. So Greg Norman has -12, not -3.\n\nPutting it together: The claim says Greg Norman is playing for Wales and has a -3 to par. But according to the table, he's playing for Australia with a -12 to par. Neither part of the claim matches his actual performance in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Greg Norman plays for Wales and has a score of -3 to par. The table shows he plays for Australia and has a score of -12. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"ian woosnam be the only player list who be play for south africa , while lee janzen be play for fiji.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided to find relevant information. The table has several columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. My focus is on verifying two parts of the claim:\n\n1. Ian Woosnam is listed as the only player who played for South Africa.\n2. Lee Janzen played for Fiji.\n\nI'll start by locating Ian Woosnam in the table. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see his name in row 9 (since it's zero-indexed or not? Wait, let me check. The first row is index 0, so row 9 would be the tenth row). His country is Wales. So according to the table, he plays for Wales, not South Africa. That already contradicts the first part of the claim because the claim says he's the only one playing for South Africa.\n\nNext, looking at Lee Janzen. He's in rows 4 and 5 (t5 and t5). His country is listed as United States in both cases. So he plays for the US, not Fiji. The second part of the claim suggests that Lee Janzen plays for Fiji, which doesn't match the table.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other players play for South Africa. In the table, scanning through the 'country' column, I see players from various countries like Australia, England, South Africa (no, wait, let me confirm. Oh yes, David Frost and Phil Mickelson are from South Africa? Wait no, looking back: row 2 is Nick Faldo from England, row 3 is David Frost from South Africa, and Phil Mickelson from the US. So actually, only David Frost is from South Africa besides any others. But according to the claim, it's saying that Ian Woosnam is the only one playing for South Africa, which isn't true because David Frost is also listed as South African.\n\nWait, no, looking again at the table: the country column for David Frost is \"south africa\" (lowercase). So he's from South Africa. That means there are at least two players from South Africa in the list: David Frost and perhaps others? Let me check all rows. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 0: Greg Norman, Australia\n- Row 1: Nick Faldo, England\n- Row 2: David Frost, South Africa\n- Row 3: Phil Mickelson, US\n- Row 4: Lee Janzen, US\n- Row 5: Bob Tway, US\n- Row 6: Scott Hoch, US\n- Row 7: Scott McCarron, US\n- Row 8: Vijay Singh, Fiji\n- Row 9: Corey Pavin, US\n- Row 10: Ian Woosnam, Wales\n\nSo only David Frost is from South Africa besides any others? Wait, no. Let me check again. I think only David Frost is listed as South Africa. So the claim says that Ian Woosnam is the only one playing for South Africa, which isn't correct because David Frost is also there.\n\nWait, no, the table shows that David Frost is from South Africa (row 2), and the other players are either US, Australia, England, etc. So the first part of the claim says Ian Woosnam is the only one playing for South Africa, which is incorrect because David Frost is also listed as South African.\n\nSo, the first part is wrong. Then, Lee Janzen is from the US, not Fiji, so that's also incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other players from South Africa. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking through the 'country' column:\n\n- Australia: Greg Norman\n- England: Nick Faldo\n- South Africa: David Frost\n- United States: Phil Mickelson, Lee Janzen, Bob Tway, Scott Hoch, Scott McCarron, Corey Pavin, Ian Woosnam\n- Fiji: Vijay Singh\n\nSo yes, only David Frost is from South Africa. Therefore, the claim's first part is wrong because it says Ian Woosnam is the only one playing for South Africa, which he isn't\u2014he plays for Wales.\n\nAdditionally, Lee Janzen plays for the US, not Fiji, so that part is also incorrect.\n\nSo overall, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Ian Woosnam is the only player from South Africa and that Lee Janzen is from Fiji. The table shows that David Frost is the only other player from South Africa, making the first part of the claim false. Lee Janzen is also listed as playing for the United States, not Fiji.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
