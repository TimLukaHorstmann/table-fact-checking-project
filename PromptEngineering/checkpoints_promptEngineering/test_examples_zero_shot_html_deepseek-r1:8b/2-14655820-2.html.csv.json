    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Packers' games at Lambeau Field during the 1974 season is true or false. The claim says, \"of the 4 game the packer play at lambeau field during the 1974 season , they only win 1.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check what exactly the claim is stating. It's talking about four games the Packers played at Lambeau Field in 1974 and that they only won one of them. So my task is to look through the table provided and verify if this statement holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists all the games for what seems like the 1974 season, with details like week number, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. The columns are: week, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance.\n\nI need to focus on the 'venue' column specifically because the claim is about games played at Lambeau Field. So I'll go through each row and note which ones have \"lambeau field\" as their venue.\n\nLet's go row by row:\n\n1. Week 1: Opponent is Minnesota Vikings, venue is Lambeau Field. Result was a loss.\n2. Week 4: Opponent is Buffalo Bills, venue is Lambeau Field. They lost this game too.\n3. Week 8: Opponent is Washington Redskins, venue is Lambeau Field. Again, they lost.\n4. Week 11: Opponent is San Diego Chargers, venue is Lambeau Field. Wait, that's four games at Lambeau Field.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"of the 4 game the packer play at lambeu field during the 1974 season , they only win 1.\" So according to this, there are four games at Lambeau Field, and the Packers won only one. But looking at the table:\n\n- Week 1: Result is l 32 -17 \u2192 loss.\n- Week 4: Result is l 27 -7 \u2192 loss.\n- Week 8: Result is l 17 -6 \u2192 loss.\n- Week 11: Result is w 34 -0 \u2192 win.\n\nSo out of these four games, the Packers only won one. That seems to align with the claim.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not miscounting. The table has 14 rows from week 1 to week 14. Let's list all the games at Lambeau Field:\n\n- Week 1: Loss\n- Week 4: Loss\n- Week 8: Loss\n- Week 11: Win\n\nYes, that's four games. So the claim is saying they won only one, which is correct because they lost three and won one.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are indeed only four games at Lambeau Field in the season. Scanning through all the rows:\n\nWeeks 1,4,8,11 have Lambeau Field as the venue. That's four games. The claim refers to \"the 4 game\" which matches these four.\n\nSo each of these four games: three losses and one win. Therefore, the Packers only won one of the four games they played at Lambeau Field in 1974. So the claim is true.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing any other games at Lambeau Field. Let me check all the 'venue' entries:\n\nLooking through each row's venue column:\n\nWeek 1: Lambeau\nWeek 2: Not listed here, but maybe elsewhere? No, this table seems to list all weeks.\nWeek 3: Atlanta Stadium\nWeek 5: Some other stadium?\nWait, no, in the given table, only weeks up to 14 are shown, and each week's venue is specified. So the only games at Lambeau Field are weeks 1,4,8,11.\n\nTherefore, four games total, with one win.\n\nSo yes, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as it accurately reflects that the Packers won only one of their four games at Lambeau Field during the 1974 season. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully reading and understanding both the claim and the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"In the 1974 season, the Packers win with the largest point spread against the San Diego Charger on November 24.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim is asserting. It's stating that during the 1974 football season, when the Green Bay Packers played against the San Diego Chargers on November 24, they achieved a win with the largest point spread against that opponent on that specific date.\n\nNow, looking at the table, it seems to be a schedule of games for the 1974 season. The columns include week, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. The key here is to check if there's a game where the Packers played the Chargers on November 24, 1974, and whether that game had the largest point spread compared to other games against the Chargers in that season.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table step by step:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Minnesota Vikings. Not relevant.\n- Week 2: Baltimore Colts. No.\n- Week 3: Detroit Lions. No.\n- Week 4: Buffalo Bills. No.\n- Week 5: Los Angeles Rams. No.\n- Week 6: Chicago Bears. No.\n- Week 7: Detroit Lions again, but that's a loss. So not relevant for a Packers win.\n- Week 8: Washington Redskins. No.\n- Week 9: Chicago Bears. No.\n- Week 10: Minnesota Vikings again. Win, but against whom? Opponent is Vikings here.\n- Week 11: San Diego Chargers. This seems relevant. Let's check the date and result.\n\nLooking at week 11, the opponent is indeed the San Diego Chargers. The date is November 24, 1974. The result is a win with a score of 34-0. So Packers won this game.\n\nNow, I need to check if this was the largest point spread against the Chargers in the season. To do that, I should look for all games where the Packers played the Chargers and compare their point spreads.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Week 11: Packers vs Chargers, result w34-0.\n- Are there any other weeks where Packers played Chargers? Let's check each row.\n\nLooking through the entire table, the only week where Packers face Chargers is week 11. So there's only one game between them in the 1974 season. Therefore, by default, if they won that game, it's automatically their largest point spread against that opponent because there are no other games to compare.\n\nBut wait, I should ensure that this was indeed a win with a large point spread compared to any previous meetings. Since there's only one meeting, it's trivially the largest. However, sometimes \"point spread\" refers to the difference between the two teams' scores. In this case, Packers won 34-0, so the spread is 34 points. If there were other games against Chargers in different seasons, but here we're only looking at the 1974 season.\n\nSo, within the context of the 1974 season, Packers playing Chargers only once, and that was a 34-point victory. Therefore, the claim holds true as it's the largest point spread against them on that date.\n\nI should also consider if the term \"largest point spread\" refers to the highest margin of victory or something else, but in this context, I think it refers to the point differential, which is indeed 34 points. Since there are no other games against Chargers in that season, this is accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the packer game with the lowest attendance be against baltimore on september 22.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that among all the Packers games listed in the table, the one with the lowest attendance was played against the Baltimore Colts on September 22. So, to verify this, I need to find two things: which game had the lowest attendance and who the opponent was for that game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week of the Packers' games in 1974. The columns relevant here are 'week', 'date', 'opponent', and 'attendance'. \n\nI'll start by listing out all the attendances for each game to find the lowest one. Here's the data:\n\n- Week 1: 56,267\n- Week 2: 41,252\n- Week 3: 47,292\n- Week 4: 56,267\n- Week 5: 47,499\n- Week 6: 50,623\n- Week 7: 51,775\n- Week 8: 56,267\n- Week 9: 46,567\n- Week 10: 47,924\n- Week 11: 56,267\n- Week 12: 42,030\n- Week 13: 47,475\n- Week 14: 10,020\n\nFrom this list, the lowest attendance is 10,020 in week 14 against the Atlanta Falcons. That means the game with the lowest attendance isn't against Baltimore but against Atlanta.\n\nNow, looking at the claim again, it specifies that the low-attendance game was against Baltimore on September 22. But from the table, week 2 (September 22) was against the Baltimore Colts and had an attendance of 41,252, which is higher than some other games but not the lowest. The lowest attendance was in week 14, so the claim's opponent doesn't match the actual game with the lowest attendance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the Packers' game with the lowest attendance wasn't against Baltimore on September 22. Instead, it was against Atlanta in November.\n\nSo, to answer, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim refers to the game's opponent (Baltimore) and the date (September 22). Looking at the table, week 2 corresponds to September 22, 1974, and the opponent was the Baltimore Colts. So the relevant cells are the row for week 2 (row index 1) in columns 'opponent' and 'date'. But since the claim is false, I should only include the cells that support the claim's assertion.\n\nWait, but since the claim is incorrect, maybe I shouldn't include it as TRUE. The instruction says to return whether the claim is true or false and then list the relevant cells. So in this case, answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells would be those mentioned in the claim: opponent (Baltimore) and date (September 22). That corresponds to row index 1 (since it's week 2), columns 'opponent' and 'date'.\n\nSo the JSON should indicate that the answer is FALSE and list those two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Packers losing by 15 points or more twice against the Minnesota Vikings and the Buffalo Bills is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the claim fully. The user claims that during the 1974 season, the Packers lost by 15 points or more two times: once against the Minnesota Vikings and once against the Buffalo Bills. \n\nNow, looking at the table, it's a list of games from week 1 to week 14 in 1974. Each row has details about the opponent, result, venue, and attendance. The columns relevant here are 'opponent', 'result', and possibly 'week' and 'date', but those might not be necessary unless needed for comparison.\n\nI'll need to check each game where the Packers played against Minnesota Vikings and Buffalo Bills and see if they lost by 15 points or more in any of those games. \n\nStarting with the Minnesota Vikings: scanning through the table, I see that the Packers played them on week 1 and week 10. In week 1 (row index 0), the result was a loss with the score 32-17. To find out how many points they lost by, I subtract the Packers' points from the Vikings'. So, 32 - 17 = 15. That means the Packers lost by exactly 15 points.\n\nNext, looking at week 10 (row index 9), the Packers played the Vikings again and won 19-7. Since it's a win, that game isn't relevant for losses. So only one game against the Vikings where they lost by 15 points.\n\nNow checking against the Buffalo Bills: from the table, I see two games. Week 4 (row index 3) was a loss with the score 27-7. Calculating the point differential: 27 - 7 = 20. So the Packers lost by 20 points here, which is more than 15.\n\nAdditionally, week 8 (row index 7) involved the Bills again, but it looks like that's against Washington Redskins based on the opponent column. Wait, no, let me check: row index 3 is Buffalo Bills in October, and row index 7 is Washington Redskins. So only one game against the Bills where they lost by more than 15 points.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I think I might have miscounted. Let's list out all Packers' games:\n\nWeek 1: vs Vikings, lost 32-17 \u2192 15 point loss.\nWeek 4: vs Bills, lost 27-7 \u2192 20 point loss.\nOther relevant opponents are Bears, Lions, Colts, etc., but the claim is only about Vikings and Bills.\n\nSo, the Packers lost by 15 or more points twice: once against Vikings (week 1) and once against Bills (week 4). \n\nBut wait, in week 10 vs Vikings, they won, so that's not a loss. So only two losses meet the criteria: one against Vikings and one against Bills.\n\nWait again, looking at the table:\n\nRow index 0: Packers vs Vikings, lost by 15.\nRow index 3: Packers vs Bills, lost by 20.\nAre there any other games where they lost by 15 or more? Let's check all losses to be thorough.\n\nLooking through each game where Packers lost (opponent has a higher score):\n\nRow 0: Vikings, 32-17 \u2192 15\nRow 3: Bills, 27-7 \u2192 20\nRow 6: Colts, 24-21 \u2192 3\nRow 9: Vikings, 19-7 \u2192 win\nRow 12: 49ers, 7-6 \u2192 loss? Wait, no. Score is SF 7-6, so Packers won by 1 point.\n\nWait, row 13 is Falcons, but that's a different opponent.\n\nSo, only two games where Packers lost by 15 or more points: against Vikings in week 1 and Bills in week 4.\n\nThus, the claim states they lost by 15 or more twice, once against each of those teams. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that the Packers indeed lost by 15 points or more twice against Minnesota Vikings and Buffalo Bills during the 1974 season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the month where the packer play the most game in the 1974 season be october november , with 4 each.\" So, the claim is suggesting that October and November are the months with the highest number of games played by the Packers in the 1974 season, specifically four games each.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists all the games for what seems to be a team, possibly the Green Bay Packers, against various opponents from September to December 1974. Each row represents a week, and the columns include week number, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance.\n\nMy task is to verify whether October and November indeed have four games each, which would mean that those months tie for the highest number of games in the season. So I need to count how many games occurred in each month mentioned and see if both October and November have at least four games.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows correspond to October and November. Let's list out the weeks and their respective dates:\n\n- Week 1: September 15, 1974\n- Week 2: September 22, 1974\n- Week 3: September 29, 1974\n- Week 4: October 6, 1974\n- Week 5: October 13, 1974\n- Week 6: October 21, 1974\n- Week 7: October 27, 1974\n- Week 8: November 3, 1974\n- Week 9: November 10, 1974\n- Week 10: November 17, 1974\n- Week 11: November 24, 1974\n- Week 12: December 1, 1974\n- Week 13: December 8, 1974\n- Week 14: December 15, 1974\n\nNow, I'll categorize these weeks by month:\n\n- September: Weeks 1-3 (3 games)\n- October: Weeks 4-6 and Week 7 (4 games in total: Weeks 4,5,6,7)\n- November: Weeks 8-10 and Week 11 (4 games: Weeks 8,9,10,11)\n- December: Weeks 12-14 (3 games)\n\nSo, both October and November have four games each. Let me confirm this by checking the relevant rows.\n\nFor October:\n- Week 4: Opponent Buffalo Bills\n- Week 5: Los Angeles Rams\n- Week 6: Chicago Bears\n- Week 7: Detroit Lions\n\nFour games in October.\n\nFor November:\n- Week 8: Washington Redskins\n- Week 9: Chicago Bears\n- Week 10: Minnesota Vikings\n- Week 11: San Diego Chargers\n\nAgain, four games in November.\n\nNow, checking if any other month has more than four games. September has three, December also three. So October and November tie with the highest number of games at four each.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct because both October and November have four games each, making them the months with the most games in the 1974 season for the Packers.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\":\"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"Opponent\"}, {\"row_index\":11, \"column_name\":\"Opponent\"}]}",

The key points are:\n\n1. The Packers lost the game.\n2. It was against the San Diego Chargers.\n3. It had the largest point spread in their season.\n4. The date was November 24, 1974.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of games for the Packers, including details like opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant columns: week, opponent, result, and date.\n\nNext, I need to find any game where the Packers lost against the San Diego Chargers on November 24. Scanning through the 'opponent' column, I see that week 11 was against the San Diego Chargers. Wait, but in week 12, they played the Philadelphia Eagles, and in week 13, the San Francisco 49ers. So, week 11 is against the Chargers.\n\nLooking at week 11, which occurred on December 1, 1974 (not November 24), so that's not the date mentioned in the claim. Therefore, there is no game on November 24 against the Chargers listed in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Therefore, there is no game on November 24 against the Chargers.\n\nHence, the claim's date doesn't match any game in the table where the Packers played the Chargers.\n\nAdditionally, even if they did play on November 24, I need to check the result. The Packers won some games and lost others. Since the claim says they lost with a large point spread, but without that specific game existing in the table, it can't be confirmed.\n\nTherefore, since there's no such game on November 24 against the Chargers where the Packers lost, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the packer game with the highest attendance be against baltimore on september 22.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's stating that there was a Packers game with the highest attendance where they played against the Baltimore team on September 22. So, to verify this, I should look for a game where the opponent is the Baltimore Colts (I assume since it's referred to as \"Baltimore\") and check if it took place on September 22, 1974. Also, I need to see if that particular game has the highest attendance compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week, starting from week 1 to week 14 in 1974. The columns include week number, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. \n\nI'll go through each relevant aspect of the claim step by step.\n\n1. **Highest Attendance**: I need to find which game had the highest attendance. To do this, I can look at all the games in the table and identify the one with the maximum attendance number.\n\n2. **Opponent is Baltimore**: The opponent's name in the table is \"baltimore colts.\" So I'm looking for rows where the opponent column has this exact text.\n\n3. **Date is September 22, 1974**: I need to check if any game against Baltimore happened on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Week 2: September 22, 1974 vs. Baltimore Colts.\n- The attendance for this game is 41,252.\n\nNow, checking other games:\n\nWeek 1: Attendance 56,267 (vs Vikings)\nWeek 2: 41,252 (vs Colts)\nWeek 3: 47,292\nWeek 4: 56,267 (vs Bills)\n... and so on. \n\nIt seems that the highest attendance overall is 56,267 in week 1 and week 4, both against the Vikings at Lambeau Field.\n\nWait, but the claim is about a game with the highest attendance being against Baltimore on September 22. However, the highest attendance games are against the Vikings, not the Colts. Therefore, the claim might be false because the highest attendance isn't against Baltimore.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\n- Week 2: Against Baltimore, attendance 41,252.\n- Week 1: Against Vikings, 56,267 (higher than others except week 4 same as week 1).\nSo yes, higher attendances are against the Vikings.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the highest attendance game isn't against Baltimore on September 22. It's actually a different opponent with lower attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because while there was a game against the Baltimore Colts on September 22, it did not have the highest attendance compared to other games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Packers' 1974 season is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the month where the Packers play the least games in the 1974 season be October and November, with 6 each.\"\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the table to see how many games the Packers played each month. The table lists all the games for weeks 1 through 14, which likely correspond to months from September to December.\n\nI'll go through each row and note the week number, date, opponent, and result, but specifically focusing on the month. Let's map each game to its respective month:\n\n- Week 1: September 15, 1974\n- Week 2: September 22, 1974\n- Week 3: September 29, 1974\n- Week 4: October 6, 1974\n- Week 5: October 13, 1974\n- Week 6: October 21, 1974\n- Week 7: October 27, 1974\n- Week 8: November 3, 1974\n- Week 9: November 10, 1974\n- Week 10: November 17, 1974\n- Week 11: November 24, 1974\n- Week 12: December 1, 1974\n- Week 13: December 8, 1974\n- Week 14: December 15, 1974\n\nNext, I'll count the number of games in each month:\n\n- **September**: Weeks 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 games\n- **October**: Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7 \u2192 4 games\n- **November**: Weeks 8, 9, 10, 11 \u2192 4 games\n- **December**: Weeks 12, 13, 14 \u2192 3 games\n\nSo, the Packers played a total of 14 games in the 1974 season. According to the table:\n\n- September: 3 games\n- October: 4 games\n- November: 4 games\n- December: 3 games\n\nThe claim says they played the least number of games in October and November, each with 6 games. However, from the count above, both October and November have 4 games each, not 6. September and December also have fewer games (3 each), but they are tied for the lowest, which is lower than 4.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nWeeks 1-3: September \u2192 3 games\nWeeks 4-7: October (weeks 4,5,6,7) \u2192 4 games\nWeeks 8-11: November (weeks 8,9,10,11) \u2192 4 games\nWeeks 12-14: December \u2192 3 games\n\nSo September and December have 3 games each, while October and November have 4. Therefore, the least number of games is 3, not 6 as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the Packers played more than 6 games in both October and November (they actually played 4 each), which means the months with the least games were September and December, not October and November. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Packers played the least number of games in October and November with 6 each is incorrect. The table shows that both October and November had 4 games each, which is more than the minimum of 3 games in September and December.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Month\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Month\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Packers' wins in the 1974 season is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"during the 1974 season, the packer win by 25 points or more twice, against the minnestota viking and the buffalo bill.\" So, the claim is making two specific assertions:\n\n1. The Packers won two games in the 1974 season where they scored a margin of 25 points or more.\n2. These two wins were specifically against the Minnesota Vikings and the Buffalo Bills.\n\nI'll need to verify both parts using the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a week with details about the opponent, result, etc. The key columns here are \"week\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"attendance\". \n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: 25-point or more wins. To find this, I'll need to look at the \"result\" column, which shows the score outcomes in the format like \"l 32 - 17\" or \"w 20 - 13\". The numbers after 'w' are the Packers' score and before 'l' are the opponent's score. So, I should extract both scores for each game where the result is a win (denoted by 'w').\n\nLet me go through each row to find wins with a margin of at least 25 points:\n\n- Week 2: Opponent is Baltimore Colts. Result is \"w 20 - 13\". Packers scored 20, opponents 13. Difference is 7, which is less than 25.\n- Week 3: Detroit Lions, \"w 21 - 19\". Difference is 2, not enough.\n- Week 4: Buffalo Bills, \"l 27 - 7\". Packers lost, so no.\n- Week 5: Los Angeles Rams, \"w 17 - 6\". Difference is 11, too small.\n- Week 9: Chicago Bears, \"w 20 - 3\". Difference is 17, still less than 25.\n- Week 10: Minnesota Vikings, \"w 19 - 7\". Difference is 12, not enough.\n- Week 11: San Diego Chargers, \"w 34 - 0\". Packers scored 34, opponents 0. That's a 34-point margin, which is more than 25.\n- Week 12: Philadelphia Eagles, \"l 36 - 14\". Packers lost, so no.\n- Week 13: San Francisco 49ers, \"l 7 - 6\". Lost again.\n- Week 14: Atlanta Falcons, \"l 10 - 3\". No win here.\n\nFrom this, I can see that the Packers only had one game where they won by 25 points or more: Week 11 against the San Diego Chargers with a score of 34-0. That's just one instance, not two as claimed in the first part of the statement. So already, the claim seems to be incorrect on this front.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the claim: that these two wins were against Minnesota Vikings and Buffalo Bills. From the table, I'll check the opponents where the Packers won by 25 or more points. \n\n- Week 11: Opponent is San Diego Chargers.\n- In other games, the only times they won significantly were Week 2 (Colts), Week 3 (Lions), Week 5 (Rams), Week 9 (Bears), and Week 10 (Vikings). Wait, in Week 10, Packers scored 19-7 against Vikings. That's a win by 12 points, which is less than 25.\n\nWait, the claim says two wins: against Minnesota and Buffalo. Let me check if they won against both.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Against the Vikings: Only one game in Week 10 where Packers won, but margin was 19-7, so not by 25.\n- Against the Bills: In Week 4, Bills played Packers, and it was a loss for Packers (27-7). They didn't win that game.\n\nSo, actually, the Packers never won against the Vikings by 25 or more points. The only significant win was against Chargers, not Vikings or Bills. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each opponent where Packers won by 25+ points: Only Week 11 against Chargers (34-0). So no, they didn't have two such wins. Therefore, the first part is false.\n\nAs for the second part, the claim says they beat Vikings and Bills. But in the table, they never beat Vikings by 25 or more. They only won against Chargers, Rams, Bears, Colts, Lions, but none of those are Vikings or Bills with a margin over 25.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made two points: that Packers won twice by 25+ points and that these wins were against Vikings and Bills. Upon reviewing the table, only one game (Week 11 vs Chargers) met the margin criteria, and neither Vikings nor Bills were defeated by Packers with such margins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
