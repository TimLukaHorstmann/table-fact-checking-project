    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim and then checking each condition against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 14489\". So, two conditions here: one about the record being 4-4 and another about the attendance being 14,489.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the attendance value of 14,489 in the table. The \"attendance\" column is one of the columns provided, so I can scan each row's attendance to see if any match that number.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 21597 (no)\nRow 2: 15229 (no)\nRow 3: 20462 (no)\nRow 4: 18372 (no)\nRow 6: 19141 (no)\nRow 7: 12683 (no)\nRow 8: 13002 (no)\nRow 9: 14489 (yes, found in row 9)\n\nSo, the attendance of 14,489 is present in row 9. Now I need to check what the \"record\" was for that game.\n\nIn row 9, under the \"result\" column, it's written as \"l 25 - 45\". Wait, but the claim refers to the record being 4-4. The \"record\" column is separate from the result. So I need to look at the \"record\" column for row 9.\n\nLooking at the \"record\" column values:\n\nRow 1: 1 - 0\nRow 2: 2 - 0\nRow 3: 2 - 1\nRow 4: 3 - 1\nRow 6: 3 - 2\nRow 7: 4 - 2\nRow 8: 4 - 3\nRow 9: 4 - 4 (yes, found in row 9)\nRow 10: 4 - 5\n... and so on.\n\nSo for row 9, the record is indeed 4-4. Therefore, both conditions of the claim are met at that specific game: attendance was 14,489 and the record was 4-4 when they played against Houston Oilers on November 6, 1960.\n\nWait a second, but I should double-check if there are any other games with attendance 14,489. Scanning through all rows again:\n\nOnly row 9 has attendance of 14489. So that's the only relevant game to check both conditions.\n\nTherefore, since both the record and attendance in that particular game match the claim, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions November 6, 1980, as the only tied game in that year. However, upon examining the table, all the dates listed are from September to December 1960. There's no entry for November 6, 1980. This suggests that either the claim is incorrect or there might be missing data.\n\nNext, I'll check if any row corresponds to a tied game in 1960. Scanning through the 'result' column, most games end with a win (w) or loss (l). However, on row 12, the result is \"t 38 - 38\", which indicates a tie. The date for this game is November 27, 1960.\n\nThe claim specifies that November 6, 1980, is the only tied game in that year. But since all games in the table are from 1960 and not 1980, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's a tied game (November 27, 1960) in the same season, contradicting the idea that November 6, 1980, was the only one.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the game on november 13 , 1960 be held at the cotton bowl site.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row corresponding to November 13, 1960. Scanning down, I see row number 10 has the date as November 13, 1960.\n\nNext, I need to check where that game was played. The 'game site' column for row 10 lists the cotton bowl. That matches the claim's location.\n\nAlso, the opponent in that game is the Dallas Texans, but the claim doesn't mention the opponent, so that part is irrelevant.\n\nThe result shows a loss for the Bears, but again, the claim doesn't specify the outcome, just the location.\n\nSo, all relevant cells confirm that the game was indeed held at the Cotton Bowl on November 13, 1960. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the team's record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 9928.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nThe claim has two conditions:\n1. The team's record must be 4 - 4.\n2. The attendance at the game must be 9928.\n\nSo I need to find a row in the table where both these conditions are met simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week of games with various details: week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if any meet both conditions.\n\nStarting from row 1:\n- Record is 1 - 0. Not 4 - 4.\n- Attendance is 21597. Not 9928.\n\nRow 2:\n- Record is 2 - 0. No.\n- Attendance is 15229. No.\n\nRow 3:\n- Record is 2 - 1. No.\n- Attendance is 20462. No.\n\nRow 4:\n- Record is 3 - 1. Close but not 4 - 4.\n- Attendance is 18372. No.\n\nSkipping to row 6:\n- Record is 3 - 2. No.\n- Attendance is 19141. No.\n\nRow 7:\n- Record is 4 - 2. Getting closer, but not 4 - 4.\n- Attendance is 12683. No.\n\nRow 8:\n- Record is 4 - 3. Still not 4 - 4.\n- Attendance is 13002. No.\n\nRow 9:\n- Record is 4 - 4. This matches the first condition.\n- Attendance is 14489. Not 9928. So this row doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nRow 10:\n- Record is 4 - 5. Doesn't match.\n- Attendance is 21000. No.\n\nRow 11:\n- Record is 4 - 6. No.\n- Attendance is 20778. No.\n\nRow 12:\n- Record is 4 - 6 - 1. Unusual format, not 4 - 4.\n- Attendance is 7785. No.\n\nRow 13:\n- Record is 4 - 7 - 1. Doesn't match.\n- Attendance is 5861. No.\n\nRow 14:\n- Record is 4 - 8 - 1. No.\n- Attendance is 9928. This matches the second condition, but the record isn't 4 - 4; it's 4 - 8 - 1.\n\nSo none of the rows have both a record of 4 - 4 and an attendance of 9928 at the same time.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 9: Record is 4 - 2 vs. needed 4 - 4. No.\nAttendance is 12683 vs. needed 9928. No match.\n\nRows 10-14 don't have record 4 - 4 except row 12 and 13, but their records aren't 4 - 4 either.\n\nWait, perhaps the attendance of 9928 is only in row 14. But row 14's record isn't 4 - 4. So no match there.\n\nIs there any row where both are true? It seems not. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no such game in the table that satisfies both conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that none of the rows meet both conditions simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"On November 13, 1960, the game site was the Cotton Bowl and the attendance was over 21,000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the game site being the Cotton Bowl, and the second part is about the attendance exceeding 21,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of games, with details like week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. My task is to find the relevant rows and columns that support or refute the claim.\n\nStarting with the game site: The claim specifies November 13, 1960. I'll look for that exact date in the table. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n- Week 1: September 9\n- Week 2: September 18\n- Week 3: September 23\n- Week 4: October 2\n- Week 6: October 16\n- Week 7: October 23\n- Week 8: October 30\n- Week 9: November 6\n- Week 10: November 13\n\nAh, there's a row for week 10 with the date November 13, 1960. That's the relevant row.\n\nNext, I check the 'game site' column for that row. The entry is \"cotton bowl.\" So the game site part of the claim matches this information. \n\nNow, checking the attendance: The table shows a number in the 'attendance' column for that specific week 10. Looking at the data, week 10 has an attendance of 21,000. The claim says the attendance was \"over 21,000.\" Now, I need to interpret what \"over 21,000\" means here. If it's strictly over, then 21,000 exactly would not qualify. But sometimes in attendance figures, 21,000 might be considered as over a certain threshold. However, based on the data given, week 10 has exactly 21,000 attendees.\n\nSo, does 21,000 count as \"over 21,000\"? It depends on whether the claim considers it strictly above or at least 21,000. Since the exact number is 21,000 and not higher, if the claim requires strictly over, then this would be false. However, sometimes in such contexts, being exactly equal might still be considered as \"over\" in a broader sense. But I think for the purpose of this task, we should take it as needing to be above 21,000.\n\nTherefore, since week 10's attendance is exactly 21,000, it doesn't meet the condition of being over 21,000. This would make the claim FALSE based on the attendance part.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check: The table for week 10 shows 'attendance' as 21,000. So if the claim says \"over 21,000,\" then strictly speaking, it's not over\u2014it's equal. Therefore, the attendance condition is not met.\n\nSo both parts of the claim must be true for the overall claim to be TRUE. Since the game site matches but the attendance doesn't exceed 21,000, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",
