    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"in the 2008 - 09 manchester city fc season , marcello trotta be the only 1 with a transfer fee.\" So the claim is saying that Marcello Trotta was the sole player in Manchester City's 2008-09 season with a transfer fee.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists transfers from various clubs. Each row has details like date, position, player name, club they came from, and the transfer fee.\n\nI need to check two main things: whether Marcello Trotta was indeed involved in a transfer during that season and if he was the only one with a transfer fee.\n\nStarting with Marcello Trotta. Scanning through the table, I see a row where the player is \"marcello trotta\" (all lowercase). Wait, no, actually, looking again: the first row has \"Marcello Trotta\" with capital letters. So yes, that's Marcello Trotta.\n\nThe date for his transfer is September 2008, which falls within the 2008-09 season. His position is 'fw' (forward), and he came from Napoli. The transfer fee is listed as 750,000. So he did have a transfer fee during that season.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players in the table also had transfer fees during the same season. The next rows are for October 2008 transfers: Oliver Nicholas (fee free), Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart both with 'undisc' which might mean undisclosed or not disclosed. Then Jeremy Helan has an undisc fee, and Gunnar Nielsen's fee is free.\n\nSo besides Marcello Trotta, there are a few other players with transfer fees? Wait, looking again: the first row is September 2008, so that's within 2008-09. The next player with a transfer fee is in February 2009\u2014wait, no, the date for Jeremy Helan is 17 Feb 2009 and Gunnar Nielsen is 25 Feb 2009, which would be later in the season but still part of the 2008-09 season.\n\nSo in the 2008-09 season, Marcello Trotta had a transfer fee. However, there are other players who also moved with transfer fees: Jeremy Helan and Gunnar Nielsen both have 'free' as their transfer fee. Wait, no\u2014wait, free usually means no fee, but 'undisc' might mean the fee wasn't disclosed or was undetermined. So if 'undisc' is considered a transfer fee, then there are more players with fees.\n\nBut looking at the table, only Marcello Trotta has a specific numerical value (750,000). The others either have 'free' or 'undisc'. Now, the claim says \"transfer fee,\" which could mean any non-zero amount. If 'undisc' is considered as having a transfer fee, then there are multiple players with fees in that season.\n\nBut I think typically, transfer fees are usually reported numerically unless it's specifically noted otherwise. So perhaps 'undisc' means the fee wasn't disclosed or was zero. Therefore, only Marcello Trotta had a confirmed transfer fee during the 2008-09 season.\n\nSo, does that mean he was the only one? Wait, Jeremy Helan and Gunnar Nielsen have 'free', which might indicate they were free transfers. So their fees are zero. The others (Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart) also have 'undisc', which could be undetermined or zero. Therefore, Marcello Trotta is the only player with a transfer fee in that season.\n\nThus, the claim seems to be true based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each row for players with transfer fees during the 2008-09 season. Only Marcello Trotta has a confirmed transfer fee of 750,000. Other players either have 'free' or 'undisc', which likely means no transfer fee.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim states: \"in the 2008 - 09 manchester city fc season , 3 player be transfer in october.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions the 2008-09 Manchester City FC season, specifically looking at transfers that happened in October and involve three players.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it lists several transfers with dates ranging from September 2008 to February 2009. Each row has details like date, position, player, from club, and transfer fee.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if there were three players transferred by Manchester City in October 2008.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **First row**: Date is September 2008. Since the claim refers to October transfers, this might not be directly relevant unless the season is considered to start in September, but typically, seasons start in August or September. However, it's better to stick to the claim's specificity about October.\n\n2. **Second row**: Date is October 12, 2008. The position is 'df' (defender), player is Oliver Nicholas from Arsenal. This seems relevant as it fits the time frame and involves a transfer in October.\n\n3. **Third row**: Date is October 20, 2008. Position is 'mf' (midfielder), player is Alex Pla from UD Cornell\u00e0. Another relevant transfer in October.\n\n4. **Fourth row**: Same date as third row, another player Jorge Guinovart transferred from UD Cornell\u00e0. This would make it the second or third player depending on how we count, but it's definitely within the same month and season.\n\n5. **Fifth row**: Date is February 17, 2009. This is later in the season, so not relevant for October transfers.\n\n6. **Sixth row**: Date is February 25, 2009. Also irrelevant as it's after the claimed month.\n\nNow, let's count how many players were transferred by Manchester City in October 2008:\n\n- Second row: Oliver Nicholas\n- Third row: Alex Pla\n- Fourth row: Jorge Guinovart\n\nThat makes three players transferred in October 2008. However, wait a second: Are these players transferred *to* Manchester City or *from* Manchester City? Looking at the 'from club' column:\n\n- Second row: from Arsenal\n- Third and fourth rows: from UD Cornell\u00e0\n\nNone of them are from Manchester City. Wait, that's an important point. The claim is about transfers involving Manchester City FC, specifically players joining them. But in the table, the transfers are outgoing from other clubs to Manchester City? Or incoming?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me clarify: the 'from club' column indicates where the player was coming from before the transfer. So, if a player is transferring to Manchester City, their 'from club' would be their previous club.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Second row: Oliver Nicholas is moving from Arsenal to Manchester City (since his position is 'df', which could be defender).\n- Third and fourth rows: Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart are moving from UD Cornell\u00e0 to Manchester City.\n- The first row: Marcello Trotta moved from Napoli to Manchester City? Wait, the table doesn't specify where they're going. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the 'from club' column. It might represent the club the player is transferring *from*, meaning their previous club. So if a player is moving to Manchester City, their 'from club' would be another team.\n\nSo in the table:\n\n- September 2008: Marcello Trotta moved from Napoli (so he's joining Manchester City? Or leaving it?)\nWait, but the position is 'fw', which might mean forward. If he's transferring from Napoli, perhaps he was with them and moving elsewhere, not necessarily to Manchester City.\n\nSimilarly, Oliver Nicholas transferred from Arsenal in October 2008. So he joined Manchester City as a defender.\n\nAlex Pla and Jorge Guinovart transferred from UD Cornell\u00e0 in October 2008, so they likely moved to Manchester City as midfielders.\n\nSo in October 2008, Manchester City made three transfers: Oliver Nicholas (defender), Alex Pla, and Jorge Guinovart. That's three players.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"3 player be transfer in october\". But wait, the third and fourth rows are both on October 20, so that's two players on the same day. So total of three players: Oliver, Alex, and Jorge.\n\nBut wait, I thought Manchester City was a Premier League team, and typically their transfers would involve significant players, but I'm not sure about the specifics of their 2008-09 season. However, based on the table, there are indeed three players transferred in October 2008, so the claim seems to be supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Manchester City players is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table and then identify the relevant cells in the table that support the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"in the 2008 - 09 manchester city fc season , alex pla and jorge guinovart both play the mf position.\" So, we need to verify if both players were part of Manchester City during that season and played as midfielders (MF).\n\nLooking at the table, I notice it lists player transfers with details like their positions (pos), their names, clubs they transferred from, and transfer fees. The columns are: date, pos, player, from club, transfer fee.\n\nI need to focus on the rows where Manchester City is involved as either the 'to club' or 'from club.' Since the claim is about Manchester City's 2008-09 season, I should check for players who joined or left Manchester City during that time and their positions.\n\nStarting with Alex Pla: I'll look through the table to see if there's a row where the player is \"alex pla.\" Scanning each row:\n\n1. First row: Player is Marcello Trotta; not relevant.\n2. Second row: Oliver Nicholas from Arsenal; no.\n3. Third and fourth rows: Both players are Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart, both from UD Cornell\u00e0 as 'undisc' (undisclosed) transfer fee, but the columns show their positions as MF.\n\nWait, but looking at the third row: player is \"alex pla,\" position \"mf,\" transferred from UD Cornell\u00e0. Similarly, fourth row: \"jorge guinovart\" also with \"mf.\" The 'from club' for both is UD Cornell\u00e0.\n\nNow, I need to determine if these players were part of Manchester City in the 2008-09 season. Since the table lists their transfer from UD Cornell\u00e0, it implies they moved to another club. If the 'to club' is Manchester City, then these players would have been part of that season.\n\nLooking at the fifth row: J\u00e9r\u00e9my Helan joined Rennes; sixth row: Gunnar Nielsen moved from Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer.\n\nSo, in the table provided, the relevant rows for Manchester City are likely not present because the 'from club' is either Napoli, Arsenal, UD Cornell\u00e0, Rennes, or Blackburn Rovers. None of these are Manchester City, which suggests that Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart didn't join Manchester City from another club during this period.\n\nWait, but maybe they were already at Manchester City before 2008-09? The table starts in September 2008 and goes into February 2009. If the players were part of Manchester City prior to that season, then their positions would be relevant.\n\nHowever, the claim specifies \"in the 2008-09 season,\" implying they joined or were active during that time. But based on the table, both players moved from UD Cornell\u00e0, so if the 'to club' is not Manchester City, they wouldn't have been part of it in that season.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be false because Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart weren't playing for Manchester City in the 2008-09 season. They were at UD Cornell\u00e0, which isn't Manchester City.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the table only shows transfers into Manchester City. Looking again: The first transfer is Marcello Trotta from Napoli to somewhere; second is Oliver Nicholas from Arsenal; third and fourth are Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart from UD Cornell\u00e0; fifth is J\u00e9r\u00e9my Helan joining Rennes, and sixth is Gunnar Nielsen moving to Blackburn Rovers.\n\nSo none of these transfers are into Manchester City. Therefore, Alex Pla and Jorge Guinovart didn't join Manchester City during the 2008-09 season, so they wouldn't have played for them that season. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\nHence, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, to identify the relevant cells: The rows where these players are listed as MF might not be directly linked to Manchester City, but since their positions are MF and it's about their role at Manchester City, those cells are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The rows represent different transfers, each with details about when the player moved, their position, the player's name, their previous club, and the transfer fee.\n\nMy task is to find out if exactly three players in this table have an 'undisclosed' transfer fee. I need to check each row for the 'transfer fee' column to see if it says \"undisc\" (I assume that's the abbreviation for 'undisclosed').\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **First row**: Transfer fee is 750,000. Not undisc.\n2. **Second row**: Fee is free. Not undisc.\n3. **Third row**: Undisc. So, one player here.\n4. **Fourth row**: Also undisc. That's two players now.\n5. **Fifth row**: Undisc as well.

That makes three players with undisclosed fees.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that all these transfers are part of the 2008-09 Manchester City season. The dates in the table range from September 2008 to February 2009. Since the claim is about the 2008-09 season, which typically runs from August 2008 to May/June 2009, the given data seems relevant.\n\nTherefore, three players have an 'undisc' transfer fee.

The claim says: \"In the 2008-09 Manchester City FC season, 2 players have a free transfer fee.\" \n\nFirst, I should check the structure of the table. It has columns for date, pos, player, from club, and transfer fee. There are six rows in the tbody.\n\nThe key points to verify are:\n1. The season is 2008-09, specifically Manchester City FC.\n2. Two players had a free transfer fee in that season.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Date is Sep 2008, position fw, player Marcello Trotta, from club Napoli, fee 750000. Not free.\nRow 1: Date Oct 12 2008, pos df, player Oliver Nicholas, club Arsenal, fee free. So this is one player with a free transfer.\nRow 2: Oct 20 2008, mf, Alex Pla, Ud Cornell\u00e0, undisc. Not free.\nRow 3: Same date and position as row 2, Jorge Guinovart also from Ud Cornell\u00e0, undisc. Not free.\nRow 4: Feb 17 2009, df, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Helan, Rennes, undisc.

That's the second player with a free transfer.\n\nSo both Oliver Nicholas and Gunner Nielsen have free transfers in this season. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant. The columns that matter are 'player' and 'transfer fee'. So for each of these two players, their row indices are 1 and 5, and column names are 'transfer fee'.\n\nI should list these as relevant cells in a JSON object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". \n\nWait, but the claim is about the season being Manchester City FC. Looking at the table, none of the players are from Manchester City. The clubs listed are Napoli, Arsenal, Ud Cornell\u00e0, Rennes, Blackburn Rovers. None mention Manchester City. Does that matter? Hmm, maybe I need to check if any players transferred to or from Manchester City in this period.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The table might be about transfers into Manchester City, so the 'from club' would be their previous clubs. So, for example, if a player is moving to Manchester City, their 'from club' would be their previous team. But in the given table, the players are going from clubs like Napoli, Arsenal, etc., but none from Manchester City.\n\nWait, that's confusing. The claim says \"2008-09 Manchester City FC season,\" so maybe the players transferred into Man City. So the 'from club' would be their previous team before joining Man City.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: From Arsenal to Man City (if this is a transfer to Man City, then fee is free.\nRow 5: From Blackburn Rovers to Man City, fee free.\n\nSo both Oliver Nicholas and Gunner Nielsen moved to Manchester City with free transfers.

The table has columns: date, pos, player, from club, transfer fee. So \"pos\" stands for player's position.\n\nThe claim says that in that season, every player had a different position. That means no two players share the same position. So I need to check if all the \"pos\" entries are unique.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row has pos 'fw' (forward). That's one unique position.\n2. Second row is 'df', which I think stands for defender, so that's another unique position.\n3. Third and fourth rows both have 'mf', which I believe is midfielder. So here we have two players with the same position.\n4. Fifth row is 'df' again, so now we've had three players in different seasons? Wait, no, all these are in the 2008-09 season. So fifth row is another defender, making it three defenders if that's the case. Wait, actually looking back, second row is also a defender. Hmm, wait: row 2 is 'df', and row 5 is 'df' again. That means two players with the same position in the same season, which would contradict the claim.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nRow 0: fw (forward)\nRow 1: df (defender)\nRows 2-3: mf (midfielder) \u2013 so two midfielders\nRow 4: df (defender)\nRow 5: gk (goalkeeper)\n\nSo the positions are: forward, defender, midfielder x2, defender again, goalkeeper.\n\nSo there are at least two players with the same position (midfielder and defender). Therefore, the claim that each player has a different position is false.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The \"pos\" column is key here. Each row in this column needs to be checked for duplicates. So all rows have their 'pos' cell relevant because any duplication would disprove the claim.\n\nBut actually, perhaps only the ones that duplicate are relevant? Or maybe all of them need to be considered because we're checking each position.\n\nWait, no. To verify the claim, I need to check if all positions are unique. So all entries in the 'pos' column must be checked for duplicates.\n\nSo for each row, the 'pos' cell is relevant because that's where the position is stated. Therefore, every row has a relevant cell in terms of verifying the 'pos'.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim refers to whether each player has a different position from others in the same season. So we need to check all 'pos' entries for uniqueness.\n\nThus, all rows have their 'pos' column as relevant because any duplication would break the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, I analyzed the \"pos\" column for duplicate positions. Since there are multiple players with the same position (e.g., two midfielders and two defenders), the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let's start by understanding the claim: \"in the 2008 - 09 manchester city fc season , marcello trotta be the only 1 with a transfer fee.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim to understand what it's stating. It mentions Marcello Trotta being the only player with a transfer fee in that specific season for Manchester City FC.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a transfer event with details like date, position, player, from club, and transfer fee. My task is to check if Marcello Trotta is indeed the sole player with a transfer fee during the 2008-09 ManCity season.\n\nI'll go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant season**: The claim refers to the 2008-09 Manchester City season. I need to look for any players from ManCity in that season, especially Marcello Trotta.\n\n2. **Check if Marcello Trotta is in the table**: Scanning the 'player' column, yes, there's a row with \"marcello trotta\" as the player. The date is \"sep 2008,\" which would fall within the 2008-09 season since the season typically starts in August or September.\n\n3. **Examine his transfer fee**: Looking at that row, the transfer fee is 750,000. That's a valid number and indicates he had a transfer fee.\n\n4. **Check if there are other players with transfer fees from ManCity in that season**: I need to see if any other players with ManCity as their 'from club' have transfer fees during the 2008-09 season.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- The first row is September 2008, but the player is Marcello Trotta, moving from Napoli. So his fee is 750k.\n- The second row is October 2008, Oliver Nicholas moving from Arsenal with a free transfer.\n- Third and fourth rows are in October 2008, players moving from UD Cornell\u00e0 with undisc fees; not related to ManCity.\n- Fifth row: February 2009, Jeremy Helan moving from Rennes with undisc fee.\n- Sixth row: February 2009, Gunnar Nielsen moving from Blackburn Rovers with a free transfer.\n\nNone of these other players are from Manchester City. So, in the table, only Marcello Trotta is associated with ManCity and has a transfer fee during that season.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if there might be another player from ManCity in the 2008-09 season who had a transfer fee. The table doesn't show any other ManCity players besides Trotta with fees. So, he seems to be the only one.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE because only Marcello Trotta has a transfer fee listed for ManCity during that season.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row in the provided table for the 2008-09 Manchester City season. Only Marcello Trotta had a transfer fee, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"In the 2008-09 Manchester City FC season, all players have a transfer fee.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each row in the table to see if every player has a transfer fee listed.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to be about transfers from other clubs to Manchester City or elsewhere. The 'pos' column stands for position, and 'from club' indicates where the player was coming from. \n\nI need to verify each player's row in the context of the 2008-09 season. Wait, the claim is specific to Manchester City, so I should focus on players who moved to Manchester City during that season.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. sep 2008: Marcello Trotta from Napoli with a transfer fee of 750,000. So this is a transfer into Manchester City.\n2. 12 oct 2008: Oliver Nicholas from Arsenal as a free transfer. Another player coming in.\n3. 20 oct 2008: Two players from UD Cornell\u00e0 without a fee (undisc). Are these transfers to or from? The 'to club' isn't clear here, but since they are moving into the league, perhaps they have fees. But their fee is marked as undisc, which might mean it's not recorded.\n4. 17 feb 2009: J\u00e9r\u00e9my Helan from Rennes with undisc fee.\n5. 25 feb 2009: Gunnar Nielsen from Blackburn Rovers as a free transfer.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Manchester City players in the 2008-09 season. So I need to see if all players who joined Manchester City that season had transfer fees.\n\nLooking at each player:\n\nMarcello Trotta: Yes, fee of 750k.\nOliver Nicholas: Free, so no fee.\nAlex Pla and Jorge Guinovart from UD Cornell\u00e0: Their fee is undisc. If they were transferred into Manchester City, then their fees would be relevant. But the table might not show all transfers or the fee details if it's not applicable.\n\nWait, the 'from club' column indicates where they came from. So, for Marcello and Oliver, their 'from club' is Napoli and Arsenal, so they were moved into Manchester City. The other two were coming from UD Cornell\u00e0, which is a lower league club in Spain. It's possible that these transfers are internal or within the same league, so maybe no fee was paid, hence undisc.\n\nBut the claim says \"all players have a transfer fee.\" So if any player didn't have a fee (like free transfers), then the claim is false.\n\nOliver Nicholas and Gunnar Nielsen were transferred as free agents. Marcello had a fee, but others like J\u00e9r\u00e9my Helan are marked as undisc. Wait, in row 4, it's undisc, which might mean the fee wasn't disclosed or it was zero, but it's still a transfer. So if the claim is that all players have a transfer fee, then those with free transfers don't meet this condition.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the ones where the transfer fee isn't free or undisc. So for each player who moved to Manchester City during that season, I need to check their transfer fee.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Transfer fee is 750000 - yes.\nRow 1: Free - no.\nRow 2 and 3: Undisc - unclear, but likely no fee.\nRow 4: J\u00e9r\u00e9my Helan's fee is undisc.\nRow 5: Gunnar Nielsen's transfer fee is free.\n\nSo the players without a transfer fee are Oliver Nicholas, Jorge Guinovart, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Helan, and Gunnar Nielsen. Therefore, not all players have a transfer fee, so the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are all rows where the player was transferred into Manchester City (rows 0,1,2,3,4,5) because the claim is about that season. Each of these should be checked for their transfer fees.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
