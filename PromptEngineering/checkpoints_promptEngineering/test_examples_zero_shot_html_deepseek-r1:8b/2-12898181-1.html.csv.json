    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says: \"builder number 1063 - 1065 with rr class a1 have a year earlier than 1916.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three builder numbers (1063-1065) and specifies that they belong to the rr class a1. Also, the year needs to be before 1916 for the claim to hold.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where \"builder nos\" are in the range 1063-1065 and the \"rr class\" is a1. Then check if their year is earlier than 1916.\n\nStarting with the \"builder nos\" column: it ranges from 3387-3391, then 3392-3396, etc., so I'm looking for rows where \"builder nos\" are exactly 1063-1065. Scanning through the table, I see a row in 1914 where builder nos are 1063-1065 and rr class is a1. That's one relevant row.\n\nNow, checking the year: 1914 is indeed earlier than 1916. So this row supports the claim.\n\nAre there other rows? Let me check the rest of the table. The next occurrence with \"rr class\" a1 is in 1916 and 1918. In 1916, builder nos are 1119-1120, which doesn't fall into 1063-1065. In 1918, they're building with Robert Stephenson & Co., so no. So only the 1914 row matches.\n\nTherefore, there's at least one relevant row that satisfies the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for rows where \"builder nos\" are 1063-1065 and \"rr class\" is a1. Only the 1914 row fits, with a year earlier than 1916.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"builder nos\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"rr class\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim is: \"the rr number of hudsweel clarke before 1914 be 15 and 18 - 22\". Hmm, I think there might be a typo here\u2014probably meant \"Hudswell Clarke\" instead of \"hudsweel clarke\". So, the claim is talking about the RR numbers for Hudswell Clarke locomotive builders before 1914.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let's go through each row to find relevant information. The table has columns: year, rr class, rr nos, builder, builder nos, and gwr / br nos.\n\nFirst, I need to identify rows where the builder is \"Hudswell Clarke\" and the year is before 1914. Let me scan each row:\n\n1. First row (row 0): year is 1910, builder is Robert Stephenson & Co.\n2. Second row (row 1): same as above.\n3. Third row (row 2): year is 1911, builder is Hudswell Clarke.\n4. Fourth row (row 3): year is 1914, which is the cutoff mentioned in the claim, so probably not included since \"before 1914\" implies up to 1913.\n5. Fifth row (row 4): year is 1916, which is after 1914.\n6. Sixth row (row 5): year is 1918.\n\nSo only row 2 (year 1911) is before 1914 and has Hudswell Clarke as the builder. Now, let's check the \"rr nos\" for that row: it's listed as \"15 , 18 - 22\". Wait, there's a comma here\u2014does that mean 15 and 18-22? Or maybe it's two separate ranges?\n\nThe claim says \"the rr number... be 15 and 18 - 22\". So the expected numbers are 15 and 18-22. In the table, row 2 has \"rr nos\" as \"15 , 18 - 22\", which seems to match exactly: 15 and then 18-22.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's written as two separate ranges: 15 and 18-22. So if the table shows both 15 and the range 18-22 together separated by a comma, that would cover both parts mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the rr numbers listed for Hudswell Clarke before 1914 include 15 and 18-22.\n\nHence, the claim seems to be TRUE because the relevant row (row 2) matches the criteria: builder is Hudswell Clarke, year is 1911 (before 1914), and the rr nos are exactly 15 and 18-22.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rr nos\"}]}",

The claim is: \"the rr number of robert stephenson & co and year before 1914 be 15 , 18 - 22\".\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two things: the RR number for Robert Stephenson & Co and the year being before 1914, specifically looking at the numbers 15, 18-22.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the builder is \"robert stephenson & amp; co\" and the year is less than 1914. The relevant columns are 'year', 'rr nos' (which stands for RR number), 'builder', and others, but the key ones here are year and rr nos.\n\nThe table has these rows:\n\n1. 1910: builder is Robert Stephenson & Co, rr nos 10-14\n2. 1910: same builder, rr nos 115-119\n3. 1911: different builder, Hudswell Clarke\n4. 1914: same as row 4, different RR class\n5. 1916: Hudswell again with a higher year\n6. 1918: Robert Stephenson & Co again\n\nSince the claim mentions \"before 1914\", I should look at rows where the year is less than 1914. That narrows it down to 1910, 1911, and 1914. Wait, 1914 is exactly 1914, so before that would be up to 1913. So only 1910 and 1911.\n\nNow, for Robert Stephenson & Co in those years:\n\nIn 1910, their RR nos are 10-14 and 115-119. The claim mentions \"15 , 18 - 22\". I'm not sure about the format here; perhaps it's a typo or specific range. But in 1910, their numbers don't include 15 or 18-22.\n\nIn 1911, the builder is Hudswell Clarke, so that doesn't apply either.\n\nThe next occurrence of Robert Stephenson & Co is in 1918, which is after 1914, so it's not relevant here.\n\nSo looking at all rows before 1914 where the builder is Robert Stephenson & Co, there are only 1910 entries. Their RR nos are 10-14 and 115-119, which don't match 15 or 18-22.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no data supporting it in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rr nos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rr nos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"builder\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"builder\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"the builder number with rr class of a1 and year less than 1916 be 946 - 951.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the claim into its components:\n\n- Builder number\n- RR class: a1\n- Year: less than 1916\n\nSo I need to find in the table any rows where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: year, rr class, rr nos, builder, builder nos, and gwr/br nos.\n\nI should go through each row and check if it satisfies all three conditions:\n\n1.

Doesn't meet because RR class isn't a1 and year is correct but RR class is wrong.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0, so no.\n\nRow 2: year=1911, rr=a, builder=hudswell clarke. No match for RR class or builder.\n\nRow 3: year=1914, rr=a1, builder=hudswell clarke. Year is above 1916? Wait, 1914 is less than 1916, so condition met. Now check the builder number range: builder nos are 1063-1065. The claim refers to 946-951, which doesn't match. So this row has a1 and year <1916 but the builder numbers don't fit.\n\nRow 4: year=1916, rr=a1, builder=hudswell clarke. Year is not less than 1916; it's equal, so condition fails.\n\nRow 5: year=1918, rr=a1, builder=robert stephenson & co. Year is more than 1916, so doesn't meet.\n\nWait, row 3 has a1 and year 1914, which is less than 1916. The builder nos are 1063-1065. The claim says the builder number should be 946-951. So this row's builder numbers don't match.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that in rows 3 and 4, the RR class is a1. But in row 3, year=1914 (which is less than 1916) but builder nos are 1063-1065, not matching. In row 4, year=1916 which doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nAre there any rows where RR class is a1, year <1916, and builder nos are 946-951?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 2: builder is hudswell clarke, but RR class is a, so no.\n\nRows 3 and 4 have a1, but their builder numbers don't match. So there's no row that satisfies all three conditions: rr class a1, year less than 1916, and builder number 946-951.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are no such rows in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any row meets all three criteria:\n\n1. **RR Class**: 'a1'\n2. **Year**: Less than 1916\n3. **Builder Number Range**: 946-951\n\nChecking each relevant row:\n\n- Rows with RR class 'a1' are 3 and 4.\n  - Row 3: Year=1914 (valid), Builder Nos=1063-1065 (does not match)\n  - Row 4: Year=1916 (invalid)\n\nNo rows meet all three conditions, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"builder nos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
