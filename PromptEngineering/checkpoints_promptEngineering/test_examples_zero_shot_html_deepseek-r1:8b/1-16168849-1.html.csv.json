    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about St Andrews University's student enrollment is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says: \"the number of student enrol at st andrew university be 600.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find St Andrews University. Scanning down the list, I see it's in row 10 with the name \"st andrews university\". Now, I need to check the column that has the enrollment numbers. Looking at each column header, the relevant one here is likely \"student enrol\" or something similar. \n\nIn the table, the columns are: index, school name, type (public/private), student count, etc. The fifth column seems to be labeled as something like \"enrol\" or \"students.\" Specifically, for St Andrews University in row 10, the student count is listed under a column named \"knights,\" but wait, that's actually the mascot or team name. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.\n\nWait, no, looking again, each row has columns: index, school name, type (public/private), student enroll, and so on. Wait, perhaps the exact column name is different. Let me check the table structure again.\n\nLooking at the HTML code, each row has elements like <td> for each cell. For example, in the first row, the cells are: index, school name, type, student count, year, conference. So it's likely that the fourth column (index 3) is the student count.\n\nSo for St Andrews University, which is in row 10, the relevant cell is at index 3, which should be the student enrollment number. Looking at the table data, for row 10: st andrews university has 600 students. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the number of student enrol at st andrew university be 600\" is TRUE because the table shows 600 under the student count column for St Andrews University.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"student enroll\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about a college team is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the college team whose nickname be blue hose join the conference in the year 1965.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three key points:\n\n1. The college team has a nickname.\n2. The nickname is \"blue hose.\"\n3. They joined the conference in the year 1965.\n\nSo, my task is to find a row in the table that matches all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one, checking for the nickname and the year they joined the conference.\n\nStarting from row 0: The nickname isn't \"blue hose.\" It's the University of North Carolina at Pembroke with the Braves. So, not this one.\n\nRow 1 is Presbyterian College. Their nickname is \"Blue Hose,\" which matches part of the claim. Now, I need to check when they joined the conference. According to the table, Presbyterian College joined in 1965 under the Big South Conference. That matches the second part of the claim as well\u2014joining in 1965.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure there's no other team with \"blue hose.\" Scanning through the rest of the rows, I don't see another nickname that's \"blue hose.\" It seems unique to Presbyterian College.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cells are row 9 (row_index: 9) and column_name: \"nickname,\" as well as column_name: \"join_year.\"\n\nI think that's it. No other rows fit all three criteria mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"join_year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n1. The college has the nickname \"blue hose\".\n2. It joined in 1972.\n3. It is a member of the \"sac\".\n\nI'll start by looking for any colleges with the nickname \"blue hose\". Going through each row in the table:\n\n- Row 13: Presbyterian College has the nickname \"Blue Hose\".\n  \nSo, this college fits the first part.\n\nNext, I need to check when it joined. The table shows that Presbyterian College's joining year is 1965. But the claim says they joined in 1972. This discrepancy suggests something might be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. Yes, Presbyterian College's row has \"1965\" under joining date, not 1972. That means the claim's statement about the joining year is incorrect.\n\nBut before concluding it's false, perhaps there are multiple colleges with the nickname \"blue hose\"? Let me check other rows. Scanning through, I don't see any other college with \"blue hose\". So Presbyterian College seems to be the only one.\n\nSince the nickname matches but the joining year doesn't, and the claim also mentions being a member of SAC. Looking at the table again, Presbyterian College's membership is listed as \"big south (ncaa division i)\". There's no mention of SAC for them.\n\nWait, SAC stands for Southern Athletic Conference. Checking other colleges in the table, some have SAC. For example, rows like row 15: Queens University of Charlotte has SAC. But that college's nickname isn't blue hose.\n\nSo Presbyterian College is not part of SAC based on the table; they're part of big south.\n\nTherefore, even if there was a joining date mismatch, the membership also doesn't align with the claim.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because while there is a college with \"blue hose\" nickname, it's not Presbyterian College, or the dates and memberships don't match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Join Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Membership\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the given claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. \n\nThe claim says: \"the conference for the college that leaves in 1974 , and again in 1989 , be the aac (naia).\" So I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which colleges left in 1974 and again in 1989. To do that, I'll go through each row of the table and look for the years when a college closed or left.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Mars Hill College left in 1975.\n- Newberry College left in 1972.\n- UNC Pembroke left in 1992.\n- Presbyterian College left in 1972.\n- St Andrews University left in 2012.\n- Western Carolina University left in 1976.\n- Lenwood University isn't listed, but others like Longwood and Mars Hill have their own years.\n\nWait, I might be missing some. Let me check each row carefully:\n\n1. Mars Hill College: Left in 1975 (row index 8).\n2. Newberry College: Left in 1972 (row index 13).\n3. St Andrews University: Left in 2012 (row index 17).\n4. Presbyterian College: Left in 1972 (row index 15).\n5. Western Carolina University: Left in 1976 (row index 20).\n6. UNC Pembroke: Left in 1992 (row index 16).\n\nI don't see any college that left both in 1974 and 1989 specifically. The closest is Mars Hill leaving in 1975, but not exactly 1974. Wait, maybe I need to check each row again.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me go through the table more carefully:\n\nRow 0: Queens University of Charlotte \u2013 no.\nRow 1: No.\n... Up to row 8 (Mars Hill): Left in 1975.\nRow 9: No.\nRow 10: No.\nRow 11: No.\nRow 12: No.\nRow 13: Newberry left in 1972.\nRow 14: No.\nRow 15: Presbyterian left in 1972.\nRow 16: UNC Pembroke left in 1992.\nRow 17: St Andrews left in 2012.\nRow 18: Western Carolina left in 1976.\nRow 19: No.\nRow 20: Mars Hill left in 1975.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused rows. Let me list the row indices correctly:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Queens University of Charlotte \u2013 no.\n- Row 1: Presbyterian College \u2013 left in 1972.\n- Wait, no, row indices are based on the order in the HTML. So let's count properly.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list all colleges with their leaving years:\n\nFrom the table:\n- Mars Hill College (row index 8): Left in 1975.\n- Newberry College (row index 13): Left in 1972.\n- Presbyterian College (row index 15): Left in 1972.\n- UNC Pembroke (row index 16): Left in 1992.\n- St Andrews University (row index 17): Left in 2012.\n- Western Carolina University (row index 20): Left in 1976.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list each college with their leaving year:\n\n1. Queens University of Charlotte: No mention.\n2. Mars Hill College: Left in 1975.\n3. Longwood University: No.\n4. UNC Pembroke: Left in 1992.\n5. Presbyterian College: Left in 1972.\n6. St Andrews University: Left in 2012.\n7. Western Carolina University: Left in 1976.\n\nHmm, I don't see any college that left in both 1974 and 1989. The claim refers to a college leaving in those specific years. So perhaps the answer is false because no such college exists in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I missed one. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking through the 'left' column:\n\n- Mars Hill College: 1975\n- Newberry College: 1972\n- Presbyterian College: 1972\n- UNC Pembroke: 1992\n- St Andrews University: 2012\n- Western Carolina University: 1976\n\nNo college left in 1974 or 1989, except maybe Mars Hill in 1975 is close to 1974 but not exactly.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the conference for the college that leave in 1974 , and again in 1989 , be the aac (naia)\". So the college must have left in both 1974 and 1989? Or perhaps it's referring to leaving in those years from different periods. But looking at the table, no college has both 1974 and 1989 as leaving years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the college left once in 1974 and again in 1989. But I don't see any college that left twice, except perhaps Mars Hill, but it only left once in 1975.\n\nTherefore, there is no college in this table that left both in 1974 and 1989. So the conference for such a college would not be AAC (naia).\n\nWait, maybe the AAC (naia) is mentioned as the conference, so perhaps the college was part of AAC before leaving? Or perhaps after.\n\nBut since there's no college in the table that left both in those years, the statement is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is false.\n\nAlternatively, I might have misread some row indices. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table provided:\n\nLooking for rows where a college left:\n- Mars Hill College: 1975\n- Newberry College: 1972\n- Presbyterian College: 1972\n- UNC Pembroke: 1992\n- St Andrews University: 2012\n- Western Carolina University: 1976\n\nNo college left in 1974 or 1989. So the answer is no such college exists, making the statement false.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim refers to a college that left in 1974 and again in 1989, but none of the listed colleges did so. Therefore, the conference wouldn't be AAC (naia) for such a college.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine if there is a college that left in both 1974 and 1989, which would have the AAC (NAIA) as its conference. Upon reviewing the provided data, none of the colleges listed left in those specific years. Therefore, the statement does not hold true.\n\n**Answer:** There is no college in the provided list that left in both 1974 and 1989, so the conference cannot be AAC (NAIA).",
