    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"hoboken , new jersey be where a private school that be found in 1870 be locate.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into its components. It mentions Hoboken, New Jersey, and specifies that it's a location of a private school established in 1870.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different institution with details like name, location, type (public or private), year founded, etc. My task is to find cells related to this claim.\n\n1. **Location**: The claim mentions Hoboken, New Jersey. So I need to look for rows where \"Location\" contains \"Hoboken, New Jersey.\"\n\n2. **Type**: It's a private school, so I should check the column named \"Type\" to see if it matches \"Private.\"\n\n3. **Year Founded**: The claim specifies 1870 as the founding year, so I need the row where \"Year Founded\" is 1870.\n\nNow, let me go through each relevant cell:\n\n- **Location (Hoboken, New Jersey)**: Looking at the table, there's a row with \"Stevens Institute of Technology\" located in Hoboken, New Jersey. This seems to fit the location part.\n  \n- **Type**: For Stevens Institute of Technology, the type is listed as private. That matches the claim.\n\n- **Year Founded**: Checking the year founded column, it shows 1870 for Stevens Institute of Technology. Perfect match here too.\n\nSo all three conditions are satisfied by this row: Hoboken, New Jersey location, a private school, and established in 1870.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells confirming the claim are found in the \"Location\", \"Type\", and \"Year Founded\" columns for Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"Location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"Type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"Year Founded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the claim \"Stevens Institute for Technology be based in Rapid City, South Dakota\" is true by looking at the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the institution is Stevens Institute of Technology. Scanning down the list, I see it's in row 22 (since counting starts from 0). Now, I need to check what city it's located in. According to the table, Stevens Institute of Technology is based in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nThe claim says it's based in Rapid City, South Dakota. That doesn't match because the actual location in the table is Hoboken, NJ. So the claim seems incorrect. \n\nNext, I should identify which columns are relevant here. The relevant column would be the \"Location\" or specifically the \"City\" where the institution is situated. In this case, both the claim and the table use a city attribute, so I need to highlight that.\n\nI don't think any other columns like \"Year Founded\" or \"Type of Institution\" are necessary here since the main point is the location discrepancy.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The answer should be FALSE because the Stevens Institute isn't in Rapid City. The relevant cells would be row 22 and column \"City.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"City\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the claim that \"air force institute of technology be a private institute found in 1889\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by breaking down each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the institution is called \"air force institute of technology.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that it's at row index 0. So that's my starting point.\n\nNext, I need to verify two main aspects: whether it's a private institute and when it was founded, which is given as 1889.\n\nStarting with the type of institution, I look at the \"Type\" column for row 0. The entry here says \"public.\" Hmm, that contradicts the claim which states it should be private. So already, this seems off. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check. No, the table clearly shows \"public\" for air force institute of technology.\n\nNow, about the founding year. The claim says it was founded in 1889. Looking at row 0's columns, there's a column named \"Year Founded,\" and the value is 1899. Wait, that doesn't match 1889 either. So both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nI should also check if there's any other column or row that might affect this, but in this case, it seems straightforward. The relevant cells for this verification would be the \"Type\" and \"Year Founded\" columns at row index 0.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the air force institute of technology, we need to check two specific details: its type (public vs. private) and its founding year.\n\n1. **Type**: The table shows it as public.\n2. **Founding Year**: It was founded in 1899, not 1889.\n\nSince both conditions don't meet the claim, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Year Founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
