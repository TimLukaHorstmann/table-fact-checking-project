    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is specifically about track number 9 having a song title of \"just a little bit\". \n\nFirst, I should locate track number 9 in the table. Each row represents a track, starting from track 1 up to track 23. So track 9 would be the ninth row. Let me count: 1,2,3,... up to 9. Yep, that's the one.\n\nNext, I need to look at the song titles column for track 9. According to the table, the song title for track 9 is listed as \"just a little bit\". So that matches exactly with the claim.\n\nNow, considering the instructions, I have to figure out which cells are relevant. The row index is 8 because the first track (row) is 1, so track 9 would be in row index 8 (since it starts at 0). The column we need is \"song title\". So the relevant cell is at row_index 8 and column_name \"song title\".\n\nPutting that together, since the song title does match, the claim is TRUE. But I also have to structure this as a JSON object with \"answer\" as \"TRUE\" and list the relevant cells. The relevant_cells will include only the cell that confirms the song title.\n\nI don't need to consider other columns or rows because the claim is only about the song title for track 9. So no additional cells are needed beyond what's necessary to confirm this specific part of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"track 23 have a title : just a little bit.\" So, I need to check if track number 23's song title matches that in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like track, recorded, original issue, song title, and time. My main focus is on the 'song title' column for each row corresponding to track 23.\n\nI need to locate track 23 in the table. Let me scan through each row until I find where the first cell (track number) is 23. \n\nLooking at the rows, I see:\n\n- Track 20: song title \"she thinks i still care\"\n- Track 21: song title \"danny boy\"\n- Track 22: song title \"love coming down\"\n- Track 23: song title \"he'll have to go\"\n\nSo, track 23's song title is \"he'll have to go,\" not \"just a little bit.\" \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check. Let me count the tracks again to ensure I didn't miss any. The tracks go up to 23, and each row increments correctly. Track 20 starts with \"unreleased alternate take\" and so on until track 23, which is under 'moody blue' as the original issue.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim that track 23 has the title \"just a little bit\" is definitely FALSE because it actually has \"he'll have to go.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"song title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
