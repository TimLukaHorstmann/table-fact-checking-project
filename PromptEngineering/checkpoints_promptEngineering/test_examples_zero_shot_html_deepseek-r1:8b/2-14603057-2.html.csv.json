The claim specifies that \"plain\" should be in Class A for two specific school years: 1988-89 and 1989-90.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the headers are \"school year,\" followed by several classes: a, aa, aaa, aaaa. Since the claim is about Class A (column name \"a\"), I need to focus on that column.\n\nNext, I'll identify the rows corresponding to the school years mentioned. The first row (row_index 0) is for 1988-89, and the second row (row_index 1) is for 1989-90.\n\nNow, I'll look at the \"a\" column for these two rows:\n\n- For 1988-89 (row 0), under \"a,\" the value is \"plain.\" That's good.\n- For 1989-90 (row 1), under \"a,\" the value is also \"plain.\" That's correct as well.\n\nSince both specified school years have \"plain\" in Class A, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row indices 0 and 1 in the \"a\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"a\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"lindsay be class a and elkhart be class aa during the 2010 - 11 school year.\" So, I'm looking for evidence of two things in the 2010-11 school year. Specifically, I need to find Lindsay listed under Class A and Elkhart listed under Class AA.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. The table has a header with years and categories (Class A, Class B, etc.), but from looking at the data, it seems each row represents a different school year. Each cell in the columns corresponds to a specific category for that school year.\n\nI should start by identifying which row corresponds to the 2010-11 school year. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 18: 2008 - 09\n- Row 19: 2009 - 10\n- Row 20: 2010 - 11\n\nYes, row 20 is for the 2010-11 school year.\n\nNow, looking at row 20, let's check each column:\n\n1. **Class A**: The cell in this row under Class A is \"lindsay\". That matches part of the claim.\n2. **Class AA**: Under Class AA, the cell is \"elkhart\". This also aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both conditions are met in row 20. Therefore, the claim is supported by these specific cells in the table.\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows that might affect this result, but since we're focusing on the 2010-11 year, only row 20 is relevant here.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are Class A and Class AA for row 20.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Class A\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Class AA\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the 1995 - 96 school year class a go to rule and the class aa go to stamford.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. It mentions two things for the 1995-96 school year: \n1. Class A goes to Rule.\n2. Class AA goes to Stamford.\n\nI should look at the table provided to find out what classes went where in that specific school year. The table has a header with years and class names, so I need to focus on the row corresponding to 1995-96.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- From the table, each row represents a different school year.\n- Scanning down, I see rows for 2001-02, 2002-03, etc., but I'm looking for 1995-96. Hmm, I don't immediately see a row labeled \"1995 - 96.\" That's odd. Wait, maybe it's listed further up? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I skipped over the earlier rows. Let me recount:\n- The first few rows after the header are for years starting from 2001-02 onwards. There's no 1995-96 row in this table. \n\nIf there's no entry for 1995-96, then the information about that year isn't present. Therefore, I can't confirm whether Class A went to Rule and Class AA went to Stamford because the data for that specific year is missing.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim can't be fully supported by the provided table data. Hence, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the 1995-96 school year, we need to check if there's an entry for that year in the table. Upon examining the table, it starts from 2001-02 and doesn't include 1995-96.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"plain be name class a for the 2004 - 05 school year\" is true or false by checking the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that in the 2004-05 school year, the class A is named \"plain\" at some level. The table has several columns: school year, class a, class aa, etc. So, the relevant column here would be 'class a' because that's where the name of the class for each level is listed.\n\nNext, I need to look through the table and find the row corresponding to the 2004-05 school year. Let me scan the rows until I find the one with \"2004 - 05\". \n\nOnce I've found that row, I check the 'class a' column. In that row, the value under 'class a' is \"argyle\". So, for class A in 2004-05, the name is \"argyle\", not \"plain\".\n\nNow, comparing this to the claim, which says the name should be \"plain\", it doesn't match. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate based on the information provided in the table.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cell would be the one where the school year is 2004-05 and the column is 'class a'. So, row index would correspond to the row number for that school year. I should check if the table lists each school year sequentially starting from 2002 or so. But regardless of the exact numbering, the key point is that in 2004-05, class A is \"argyle\", not \"plain\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false because the claim doesn't hold true according to the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"class a\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim: \"the name of the class aa be stamford with class a of westbrook and school year of 1995 - 96.\"\n\nSo, there are three parts to this claim:\n\n1. **Class AA is Stamford**\n2. **Class A is Westbrook**\n3. **School Year is 1995 - 96**\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nStarting with the first point: Class AA being Stamford. I'll look for rows where the class is \"AA\" and see what the name is. Scanning through the table, in row 15 (2001-02), class AA is Bridgeport, not Stamford. Wait, let me check again. No, actually, looking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: Class A - Plains, Class AA - Elkhart\nRow 1: Class A - Nazareth, Class AA - Bridgeport\n...\nWait, I think I might have missed some rows. Let me go through them carefully.\n\nLooking for any row where Class AA is Stamford. Hmm, I don't recall seeing Stamford in the Class AA column. Wait, maybe it's not there. For example, in row 22 (2007-08), Class A is San Isidro, and Class AA is Bridge City. So, no Stamford in Class AA.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the name of the class aa be stamford.\" Maybe it's referring to a different column? No, the columns are fixed: each row has School Year, Class A, and Class AA. So, if we're looking for Class AA being Stamford, but in the table, I don't see any instance where Class AA is Stamford. So this part might be false.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing it. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: School Year 2001-02, Class A Nazareth, Class AA Bridgeport\nRow 1: 2002-03, Class A Plains, Class AA Bridgeport\n...\nWait, maybe in a later year? For example, row 23 (2010-11): Class A Lindsay, Class AA Argyle. No Stamford.\n\nSo, perhaps there's no instance where Class AA is Stamford. Therefore, the first part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nMoving on to the second point: Class A being Westbrook. I need to check if any row has Class A as Westbrook with a certain school year. Looking at the table, when does Class A have Westbrook? Let me scan through:\n\nRow 22 (2007-08): Class A San Isidro\nRow 23 (2010-11): Class A Lindsay\n\nWait, in row 20 (2006-07), Class A is Garden City, not Westbrook.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me check for \"Westbrook\" in the Class A column. Looking through each row:\n\nI don't see \"Westbrook\" listed as any Class A. The closest is maybe Henrietta Midway or Lindsay, but not Westbrook.\n\nSo, if the claim says Class A is Westbrook, that's incorrect because I don't see Westbrook in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the school year matters too? Let me think. If the claim mentions a specific school year (1995-96), I should check rows around that time.\n\nLooking at the table, the earliest years are 2001-02 and go up to 2010-11. There's no row for 1995-96 in the provided data. The table starts from 2001 onwards, so the school year mentioned in the claim isn't present. Therefore, that part is also incorrect.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Class AA being Stamford: Not found.\n- Class A being Westbrook: Not found.\n- School Year 1995-96: Not present in the table.\n\nSo, each part of the claim doesn't hold true based on the table data provided.

The claim is: \"garden city be the name of the class a with school session 2004 - 05\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions three specific things:\n1. The term is \"garden city\".\n2. The class is \"class a\".\n3. The school year is 2004 - 05.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school year, and each column corresponds to a different class level (A, B, etc.). So, I need to find in which row the school year is 2004-05 and check what class A's name is for that row.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the rows to locate the one with \"2004 - 05\". As I go through each row:\n- The first few rows are from 2001-02 onwards. Then I see a row labeled \"2004 - 05\". That's the relevant row.\n  \nNext, within that row, I need to look at the column for \"class a\". Let me check each column in that row. The columns are named based on the class levels (A, B, etc.), so \"class a\" would be the first column.\n\nLooking at the data under \"2004 - 05\", the first cell is labeled as \"garden city\".

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"session 1992 - 93 be the school year with class aaa of mcallen and class aaaa of longview pine tree.\" So I need to check if in the 1992-93 school year, there are entries for both class aaa being McAllen and class aaaa being Longview Pine Tree.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are \"Session\" (which seems to be the school year), then classes from \"Class 1\" up to \"Class 5\", I assume, but looking at the data, it's more like Class 1, 2, etc., with specific names assigned.\n\nI need to focus on the rows for the session 1992-93. So let me scan through each row until I find the one where Session is \"1992 - 93\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first few sessions are 2001-02, then 2002-03, and so on. Wait, maybe I need to check from the top. Let's see:\n\nThe table starts with session 1992-93 as row number... wait, no. Wait, looking at the rows provided: the earliest is 1992-93? Or does it start earlier?\n\nWait, actually, the first row in the provided data is 2001-02, then 2002-03, up to 2010-11. Wait, that can't be right because the user's example shows a session from 1992-93 as part of their task.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again. The user provided a table with sessions starting from 1992-93 down to 2010-11. So, in the table, each row represents a school year, and for each session, there are columns for different classes.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the row where Session is \"1992 - 93\".\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- The first row is 2001-02\n- Then 2002-03\n- Then 2003-04\n- Wait, no. Let me recount: the table provided by the user starts with session 2001-02, then 2002-03, up to 2010-11.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim is about 1992-93. So either I'm missing something or perhaps the table provided in the question doesn't include all the rows. Wait, no\u2014the user included a long list starting from session 2001-02 and going up to 2010-11. But the claim refers to 1992-93. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nIn the table provided, the first few sessions are:\n\n2001-02\n\n2002-03\n\n2003-04\n\n... up to 2010-11.\n\nSo the session 1992-93 is not present in this list. That can't be right because the claim refers to it. So perhaps I misread the table, or maybe the user's table starts from 2001-02 but includes earlier sessions as well?\n\nWait, no\u2014the user's table starts with \"Session 2001 - 02\" and goes up to \"2010 - 11\". Therefore, there is no row for 1992-93 in the table. But that contradicts the claim, which refers to session 1992-93.\n\nSo if the table doesn't have a row for 1992-93, then the claim cannot be verified because the relevant data isn't present. Therefore, the answer would be \"FALSE\" because the required information is missing from the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the columns. Let me check again: each row has multiple class names. For example, looking at 2001-02:\n\nClass 1: Garden City\n\nClass 2: Argyle\n\nClass 3: Bridge City\n\nClass 4: Longview Pine Tree\n\nClass 5: Paris Chisum\n\nWait, but in the problem, we need to check for class aaa being McAllen and class aaaa being Longview Pine Tree.\n\nSo class \"aaa\" is likely one of the columns. Looking at how the columns are named, they go from Class 1 up to Class 5, but perhaps each column has a specific name like Class 1, Class 2, etc., or perhaps the names are different.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, their relevant_cells include \"Revenue\" and \"Employees\", which suggests that columns have names beyond just class numbers. So I need to look for columns named \"Class aaa\" and \"Class aaaa\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nEach row has multiple columns. Let me see if any column is labeled as Class aaa or Class aaaa.\n\nFor example, in the 2001-02 session, the classes are Garden City (probably Class 1), Argyle (Class 2), Bridge City (Class 3), Longview Pine Tree (Class 4), and Paris Chisum (Class 5).\n\nBut I don't see columns with names like \"Class aaa\" or \"Class aaaa\". So perhaps the table's columns are named differently, such as in order from Class 1 to higher.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are numbered, not named. For example:\n\nEach row has columns labeled as \"Class 1\", \"Class 2\", etc., up to \"Class 5\".\n\nSo, for session 1992-93, we need to find if any of these classes are McAllen and Longview Pine Tree.\n\nBut since the table provided by the user doesn't include the 1992-93 row, perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I misread the columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table does have the 1992-93 row but it's further down, and I need to scan all rows until I find the correct session.\n\nBut looking at the user's provided data:\n\nIt starts with \"Session: 2001 - 02\" as the first row. So unless the table is much longer, which isn't indicated here, perhaps the 1992-93 session is not present.\n\nThus, since the required data (session 1992-93) is missing from the table, the answer would be \"False\" because we can't verify whether in that session class aaa is McAllen and class aaaa is Longview Pine Tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the classes are named. Maybe each row has columns for different grades or levels, not specific to classes.\n\nBut without knowing exactly which column corresponds to \"Class aaa\", it's impossible to determine from the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the context of the problem, \"Class 1\" is Class 1, and so on, up to higher classes. But again, since session 1992-93 isn't present in the table, we can't check.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is that the information is missing, leading to the conclusion that the claim can't be verified.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying if in session 1992-93, \"Class aaa\" is McAllen and \"Class aaaa\" is Longview Pine Tree. However, upon examining the provided table, there's no row for session 1992-93. This absence means the necessary data to confirm or deny the claim isn't available.\n\n**Answer:** False",

The claim states: \"pharr - san juan - alamo be the class aaaa of school session 2001 - 02.\"\n\nFirst, I'll understand the structure of the table. It has headers for school years from 1988-89 up to 2010-11. Each row corresponds to a specific school year and lists several classes: A, AA, AAA, AAAA, etc.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"pharr - san juan - alamo\" as the class AAAA during the 2001-02 school session. So I need to find this string in the table under the column \"Class aaaa\" for the year 2001-02.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for 2001-02. Looking through the table, I find that 2001-02 is row number... let me count. Starting from 1988 as row 0, each subsequent year increments by one. So 2001 would be around row 13 or so. Wait, actually, it's better to go step by step:\n\n1988-89: row 0\n1989-90: 1\n...\n2001-02: Let me count:\nFrom 1988 (row 0) to 2001 is 14 years. So 2001-02 would be row 13.\n\nNow, in that row, the columns are Class A, Class AA, Class AAA, Class AAAA. I need to check if \"pharr - san juan - alamo\" appears in the Class AAAA column.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFor row 13 (2001-02), the classes are:\nClass A: nazareth\nClass AA: elkhart\nClass AAA: bridgeport\nClass AAAA: san antonio southwest\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. The claim says \"pharr - san juan - alamo\" is Class AAAA for 2001-02, but according to the table, it's \"san antonio southwest.\"\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the rows. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from row 0 as 1988-89, each subsequent year increases by one. So:\n\nRow 13 would be 2001 (since 1988 +13 = 2001). So yes, row 13 is 2001-02.\n\nIn that row, Class AAAA is \"san antonio southwest.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states \"pharr - san juan - alamo\" as Class AAAA for 2001-02, but the actual value in the table is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check another source or way to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I misread the row. Let me look at row 13 again:\n\nLooking at the table, around row 20, which is 2001-02:\n\nAt row 20:\nClass A: nazareth\nClass AA: elkhart\nClass AAA: bridgeport\nClass AAAA: san antonio southwest\n\nSo yes, it's \"san antonio southwest,\" not \"pharr - san juan - alamo.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the actual Class AAAA for 2001-02 is \"san antonio southwest,\" not the one mentioned in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row index of 20 (assuming rows start at 0), but wait, earlier calculation might differ. Wait, row 13 is 2001-02?\n\nWait, perhaps my initial count was off. Let me recount the rows properly.\n\nStarting from 1988 as row 0:\n\nEach year increments by one, so each row corresponds to a school year starting in that year minus one.\n\nSo row 0: 1988-89\n\nRow 1: 1989-90\n\n...\n\nRow n: 1987 + n = the starting year.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list them:\n\nRow 0: 1988-89\n\nRow 1: 1989-90\n\nRow 2: 1990-91\n\nRow 3: 1991-92\n\nRow 4: 1992-93\n\nRow 5: 1993-94\n\nRow 6: 1994-95\n\nRow 7: 1995-96\n\nRow 8: 1996-97\n\nRow 9: 1997-98\n\nRow 10: 1998-99\n\nRow 11: 1999-00\n\nRow 12: 2000-01\n\nRow 13: 2001-02\n\nYes, so row 13 is 2001-02.\n\nIn that row, the Class AAAA is \"san antonio southwest.\"\n\nSo the claim's pharr - san juan - alamo is incorrect here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false, and the relevant cells are row 13, column aaaa.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"pharr - san juan - alamo\" is Class AAAA for the 2001-02 school session. By checking the table, it's clear that this isn't the case; instead, \"san antonio southwest\" holds that position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column\": \"Class aaaa\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mission veteran memoria be the aa class with lindsay\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"mission veteran memoria\" as being the AA class in conjunction with Lindsay. So, I need to look for cells where both \"mission veteran memoria\" and \"Lindsay\" appear together in the same row, specifically in the 'class aa' column.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it's an HTML table with columns for school year, class 1, class 2, ..., up to class unspecified. Wait, actually, each row has multiple class levels\u2014so perhaps I need to identify which columns correspond to specific class tiers. The term \"aa class\" suggests a specific tier, which might be the second column if we're starting from 'a' as the first.\n\nWait, no, in typical school ranking systems, 'A' is higher than 'B', but sometimes it's used differently. The user refers to \"aa class,\" so that would likely be the second level, maybe corresponding to a specific column in the table.\n\nLooking at the columns: each row has multiple entries, like \"Mission Veterans Memorial\" and \"Lindsay.\" I need to see if these two names appear together in the same row under the 'class aa' column.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- The first few rows don't have both \"Mission Veteran Memoria\" and \"Lindsay\" together.\n- Scanning down, I find a row where \"mission veterans memorial\" is listed. Let's check which columns it appears in. For example, in the 2006-07 row, mission veterans memorial is under class level 4 (assuming columns go from 1 to higher numbers). But Lindsay is in another column, maybe as class 1 or something else.\n- Wait, in the 2010-11 row, I see \"Lindsay\" and \"mission veterans memorial.\" Let me check the specific columns.\n\nLooking at the 2010-11 row:\n\n- The first column (probably school name) has Lindsay.\n- Further down the columns, I see mission veterans memorial listed. Wait, no, in that same row, it's under class level 4.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"mission veteran memoria\" being the aa class with Lindsay. So we need to check if both are present in the same row and specifically in the 'aa' column.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let me clarify: each row has multiple class levels, so perhaps 'class 2' is different from 'class aa.' But given that the user refers to \"aa class,\" it's more likely a specific tier. So I need to look for a row where both \"mission veteran memoria\" and Lindsay are in the same row, specifically under the 'aa' column.\n\nLooking again, perhaps in the 2010-11 row:\n\n- Lindsay is the main school name.\n- mission veterans memorial is listed as class level 4 (if columns start at 1 from the left).\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean it's in the 'aa' tier. Alternatively, maybe \"aa\" corresponds to a specific column index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"mission veteran memoria\" appears in the 'class aa' column alongside Lindsay in another row. Let me check more rows.\n\nIn the 2006-07 row, mission veterans memorial is in class level 4 and Lindsay isn't present.\n\nIn the 2010-11 row, Lindsay is the main school, but mission veterans memorial is listed as class level 4, which might not be 'aa.'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for a row where both are in the same column. For example, if \"mission veteran memoria\" and Lindsay are both under 'class aa' in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about Lindsay being associated with mission veterans memorial as the aa class. So, perhaps in the same row, mission veterans memorial is listed in a higher class tier than Lindsay.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this:\n\nThe claim states that \"mission veteran memoria\" is the aa class (probably second tier) and is associated with Lindsay. So, we need to find a row where both are present, with \"mission veteran memoria\" in 'aa' and Lindsay possibly in another column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Lindsay is the main school name, and mission veteran memoria is under 'aa' in that same row.\n\nLooking for such a combination:\n\nI think I found it in the 2010-11 row. Let me check:\n\nIn the 2010-11 row, the first entry is \"mission veterans memorial\" as class level 4, but Lindsay is listed as the main school name in column 1. So, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the columns are laid out with each subsequent class tier to the right. So, class a might be first, then class aa, etc. If that's the case, the 'aa' class would be the second column from the left.\n\nLooking for rows where both \"mission veteran memoria\" and Lindsay appear in the same row, specifically with \"mission veteran memoria\" in the second column.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure of the columns. Each row might have multiple entries, so perhaps \"mission veteran memoria\" is in a specific column, and Lindsay is elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that mission veterans memorial is the aa class (column) for Lindsay's school.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing without seeing the actual table. But based on the information I have, I think there might not be a row where both \"mission veteran memoria\" and Lindsay are present in the same 'aa' column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the 2010-11 row, mission veterans memorial is under class level 4, which would mean it's a higher tier than aa. So that wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that both \"mission veteran memoria\" and Lindsay need to appear together in the same row, with \"mission veteran memoria\" specifically in the 'aa' class column.\n\nIf such a row exists, then the statement is correct; otherwise, it's incorrect.\n\nAfter checking multiple rows, I don't find a specific instance where both are present in the same 'aa' column. Therefore, the answer would be that the statement isn't accurate based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"Mission Veterans Memorial is the AA class with Lindsay\" does not hold true for any row in the provided data.\n\nAnswer: The statement is incorrect based on the information provided.",
