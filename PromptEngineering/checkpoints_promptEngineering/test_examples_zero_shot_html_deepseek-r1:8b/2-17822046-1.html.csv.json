    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"none of the latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. There are five rows, each representing a different film submission from Latvia.\n\nI need to check if any of these films were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. The claim says none were, so I have to verify this by looking at the 'result' column in the table.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 1992: Result is \"not nominated.\"\n2. 2008: Also \"not nominated.\"\n3. 2010: Again, \"not nominated.\"\n4. 2012: Same as above.\n5. 2013: The result is listed as \"tbd,\" which I think means \"to be determined\" or possibly \"pending.\" This could imply the result hasn't been decided yet or that it's still in progress.\n\nSo, for each row except 2013, the result is clearly \"not nominated.\" In 2013, the result isn't specified\u2014just \"tbd.\" I'm not sure if \"tbd\" means the film wasn't nominated or if it's just undecided. If \"tbd\" indicates that the submission was still pending or the result hasn't been announced yet, then technically, there's no explicit confirmation of a nomination in any row.\n\nBut wait, if a film is submitted and the result is \"tbd,\" does that mean it wasn't nominated, or could it be that it's just not listed? I think in this context, since none of the rows explicitly state \"nominated\" for Best Foreign Language Film, regardless of 2013's status, the overall claim that none were nominated holds true.\n\nSo, to check which cells are relevant: the 'result' column is key here. All the entries except perhaps 2013 don't show a nomination, so each row's result cell needs to be checked. That means for all rows, the column \"result\" is relevant because it directly indicates whether they were nominated or not.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because none of the films in the table were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"mother , i love you and gulf stream under the iceberg be submit 1 year after the other.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to suggest that two films were submitted one year apart. Specifically, it mentions \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" So, I need to find these two films in the table and check their submission years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a film with details like the ceremony year, film titles, original title, director, and result. The columns relevant here are 'film title used in nomination' and 'year (ceremony).' \n\nI'll go through each row to identify which ones match the film titles mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 0: The film is \"the child of man.\" Doesn't match either film in the claim.\nRow 1: Film is \"defenders of riga.\" Not matching.\nRow 2: Film is \"hong kong confidential,\" also not matching.\nRow 3: Film is \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" This matches one of the films in the claim. Its ceremony year is 2012, which is row index 3.\n\nRow 4: Film is \"mother , i love you.\" This matches the second film in the claim. Its ceremony year is 2013, which is row index 4.\n\nNow, I need to check if these two films were submitted one year apart. The first submission was in 2012 and the second in 2013. That's exactly a one-year difference. \n\nSo, both films are present in the table with the correct years, and they are indeed submitted one year after each other.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the 'film title used in nomination' column for \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" These correspond to rows 4 and 3 respectively.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table lists information about film submissions over the years for some ceremony, and each row has details like the year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and the result.\n\nThe claim is: \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what this claim is saying. It mentions \"defender of riga\" being submitted more than a decade after the previous submission. So I'm looking for when \"defenders of riga\" was submitted and how long it was between that submission and the next one.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that in 2008 (the 81st ceremony), the film is listed as \"defenders of riga.\" The original title is \"r\u012bgas sargi,\" which translates to \"Defenders of Riga.\" So this must be the same movie submitted under a different title.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's another entry for \"defenders of riga\" in the table. Scanning through each row, it seems like 2008 is the only year with that exact film title used in nomination. The next closest is 2010 with \"hong kong confidential,\" which doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. In 2012, there's \"gulf stream under the iceberg,\" and in 2013, \"mother , i love you.\" None of these are \"defenders of riga.\" So the next submission after 2008 would be... wait, actually, is there another entry for \"defenders of riga\"? I don't see any other row with that exact title. \n\nSo if it was submitted in 2008 and then not again until more than a decade later, but since there's no next submission, maybe the claim isn't fully supported. Or perhaps the user meant comparing to a previous submission, but without another entry, I can't confirm a decade gap.\n\nWait, perhaps \"defenders of riga\" was submitted again in 2023 or something, but it's not in the table. So based on the given data, there's only one submission in 2008, so no second submission after that to measure a decade difference. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect as there's no evidence of another submission.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me check each row again:\n\n- 1992: \"the child of man\"\n- 2008: \"defenders of riga\"\n- 2010: \"hong kong confidential\"\n- 2012: \"gulf stream under the iceberg\"\n- 2013: \"mother , i love you\"\n\nNo other entries for \"defenders of riga.\" So the claim is about a film being submitted more than a decade after its previous submission, but if there's only one submission, then it can't be more than a decade after anything. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nSo the answer would be FALSE because there's no evidence of another submission for \"defenders of riga\" that is over a decade later.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"defenders of riga\" was submitted more than a decade after its previous submission. However, the table shows only one submission in 2008. Since there are no subsequent submissions for this film to measure a decade gap against, the claim isn't supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"2 of the Latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the table represents. It seems to list films submitted by Latvia for various ceremonies (like the Oscars), along with details such as the year, the title used in the nomination, the original title, the director, and whether they were nominated or not.\n\nThe claim is about two Latvian submissions being nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. So I need to check if there are two entries in the table where 'result' is \"tbd\" (to be determined) because that might indicate a pending decision, but more importantly, it's related to whether they were actually nominated.\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the table, each row has a 'result' column. The possible values are either \"not nominated\" or \"tbd\". For example:\n\n- 1992: not nominated\n- 2008: not nominated\n- 2010: not nominated\n- 2012: not nominated\n- 2013: tbd\n\nSo, the claim is about two submissions being nominated. But in the given table, only one submission (from 2013) has a 'result' of \"tbd\", which might mean it's still pending or under consideration but hasn't been officially announced yet as either nominated or not.\n\nWait, maybe the 'result' column indicates whether they were actually nominated. So if it's \"not nominated,\" that means they didn't get the nomination. If it's \"tbd,\" perhaps it's still up in the air, so we can't confirm a nomination yet.\n\nBut the claim is about two submissions being nominated, meaning their 'result' should be \"nominated\" or some positive indication. However, looking at the table, none of the submissions are explicitly marked as \"nominated.\" The 2013 entry is only \"tbd.\"\n\nSo, does \"tbd\" count as a nomination? Probably not yet confirmed. So in the current state of the table, there's only one submission that might be considered (the 2013 one), but it's still pending.\n\nTherefore, as per the data provided, there are zero submissions that have been officially nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. The other four are explicitly \"not nominated.\" The 2013 entry is still unclear but not confirmed yet.\n\nSo the claim that two Latvian submissions were nominated isn't supported by the table data. It's either false or partially true if we consider pending cases, but I think in this context, only confirmed nominations count.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should analyze the claim. It mentions that there are 5 Latvian films submitted in the 21st year (which would be 2021) for the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film. So I need to check if such a submission exists based on the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several films with their years of nomination, titles, original titles, directors, and results. The years range from 1992 (65th ceremony) up to 2013 (86th ceremony). There are five entries in total, each corresponding to a different year.\n\nThe claim is about the \"21st\" year, which I think refers to the 2021 Academy Awards ceremony. However, looking at the table, there's no entry for the year 2021 or any recent years beyond 2013. The latest film in the table is from 2013 (86th ceremony), and the next ceremonies after that would be 87th (2014), 88th (2015), etc., up to the 94th in 2022, which would be the 21st Academy Awards if counting from 2000. Wait, actually, the 1st ceremony was in 1928, so the 94th would be in 2022-23, but I think the 21st ceremony would be 1949 (since 1928 +20=1948). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no. The \"year (ceremony)\" is likely referring to the year of the Academy Awards ceremony itself. For example, in the table, the entries are like 1992 (65th), meaning it was the 65th Academy Awards held in 1992. So if the claim says \"21st,\" that would be the 21st ceremony, which would have been in 1949 (1928 +20=1948, but maybe they count differently). However, looking at the table, there are no entries for 1949 or any year close to that.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the claim is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted as films from Latvia submitted in the 21st year of something else, like their independence or another milestone. Alternatively, it's about the number of submissions: five Latvian films submitted in 2021 for consideration. But according to the table, there are only five films listed, all with years ranging up to 2013.\n\nWait, no, the table has five rows, each corresponding to a different film and their respective ceremonies (like 1992, 2008, etc.). So it's showing five films that were submitted or nominated in those years. The claim is about \"5 Latvian film[s] in 21 year be submit,\" which likely refers to five films from Latvia submitted in the 21st year of something\u2014possibly the 21st Academy Awards ceremony, but that was in 1949, and the table doesn't go that far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of films submitted in a particular year, like 2021. But looking at the table, there are no entries for 2021 or any recent years beyond 2013. So if the claim is about five films submitted in 2021, that's not supported by the table because the latest film in the table was from 2013.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit.\" Maybe it's saying that in 21 years, five films have been submitted. But looking at the table, each film is a separate submission. So maybe the claim is stating that there are five submissions from Latvia, and they all happened in the 21st year, which again doesn't align with the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"21\" refers to the 21st Academy Awards ceremony, which would be in 1949. But the table only goes back to 1992, so that's not covered either.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of films submitted from Latvia in a specific year. The claim is about five films being submitted in the 21st year, but looking at the table, each film has its own year. For example, \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" was submitted in 2012 (85th ceremony), which is 2012, not 2021.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo and meant the 91st Academy Awards (which would be 2018) or another year. But regardless, based on the table provided, the latest film submission from Latvia was in 2013. So there are only five films listed in total, but they were submitted in different years.\n\nThe claim says \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit,\" which could mean that in a particular year (like 2021), five films were submitted. However, the table doesn't include any submission for 2021 or any recent years beyond 2013. Therefore, there's no evidence in the table to support the claim.\n\nMoreover, looking at the relevant columns: \"year (ceremony),\" which would be the year of the Academy Awards ceremony, and whether five films were submitted in that year from Latvia. Since the latest film in the table is from 2013, and the next ceremonies after that would be beyond the data provided, we can't confirm such a submission.\n\nAdditionally, checking each row: all the films are either \"not nominated\" or have a result of \"tbd.\" None of them indicate success in the Best Foreign Language Film category. So even if there were five submissions, they didn't win.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, the claim that five Latvian films submitted in 2021 (or any specific year) for the Academy Award is not supported. The table only shows five films, each from different years up to 2013, none of which are 2021.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were five Latvian films submitted in the 21st year for the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film. However, upon examining the provided table, all entries correspond to years between 1992 and 2013, with no film submissions or nominations occurring in 2021 or any 21st-year context beyond what's already listed. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE\n\n**Relevant Cells**: All rows (0-4) are checked for any submission in 2021 or relevant years, but none apply as all films are from earlier years.

The claim says, \"2 of the 5 films were directed by Aigars Grauba.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has five rows, each representing a film nominated for something, presumably. Each row includes information about the year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and the result, which is \"not nominated\" in all cases except maybe the last one, but looking closely, it's still marked as \"tbd\" which I think means \"to be determined,\" so maybe that's not a completed decision yet.\n\nThe claim focuses on directors. Specifically, it mentions Aigars Grauba. So my first task is to check how many films in the table were directed by Aigars Grauba.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. 1992: Director is J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.\n2. 2008: Director is Aigars Grauba.\n3. 2010: Director is M\u0101ris Martinsons.\n4. 2012: Director is Yevgeni Pashkevich.\n5. 2013: Director is J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nFrom this, only the 2008 row has a director named Aigars Grauba. So that's one film directed by him.\n\nWait, the claim says \"2 of the 5 films.\" But I've only found one so far. Maybe I missed something? Let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't overlook any other Aigars Grauba credits.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: Director is J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.\n- Row 1: Director is Aigars Grauba.\n- Rows 2,3,4 don't list Aigars Grauba as the director. So only one film is directed by him.\n\nHmm, so does that mean the claim is false? Because it states there are two films directed by Aigars Grauba, but according to the table, there's only one.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread something. Let me check the original data again.\n\nThe table has five rows:\n\n1. 1992: J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds\n2. 2008: Aigars Grauba\n3. 2010: M\u0101ris Martinsons\n4. 2012: Yevgeni Pashkevich\n5. 2013: J\u0101nis Nords\n\nNo, only one director is Aigars Grauba. So the claim says two films, but I only found one.\n\nBut wait, maybe the original claim refers to something else? Or perhaps there's a typo in the table? No, according to the data provided, only one film is directed by Aigars Grauba.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"2 of the 5 films were directed by Aigars Grauba\" is false because only one film (2008) meets this criterion.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones where the director is Aigars Grauba. That's row 1 (row_index:1) and column_name: \"director.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON should include these details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"mother , i love you and defender of riga be submit 1 year after the other.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: one about \"mother, i love you\" and another about \"defender of riga.\" The claim suggests that these two submissions are made in consecutive years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a film submission with details like the ceremony year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. I need to find the rows where the film titles match either \"mother , i love you\" or \"defender of riga.\"\n\nStarting with \"mother , i love you,\" I search the 'film title used in nomination' column. The fifth row (row index 4) has this exact title: \"mother, i love you.\" So that's relevant.\n\nNext, for \"defender of riga,\" I check the same column and find it in the second row (row index 1): \"defenders of riga\" is listed as the film title. Wait, but the claim refers to \"defender of riga.\" There's a slight difference in wording\u2014the film title uses plural: \"defenders,\" while the claim uses singular: \"defender.\" I need to check if this discrepancy matters.\n\nThe instruction says to verify each condition in the claim against the table. So, the exact film titles must match. Since the claim refers to \"defender of riga\" and the table has \"defenders of riga,\" they don't exactly match. Therefore, the second part of the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nBut wait, the claim uses \"and\" between the two films, implying that both were submitted one year apart. So even if the titles don't perfectly match, maybe it's about their submission years relative to each other. However, since the user instruction is to check against the cells in the table, and only exact matches are considered relevant, the film title must be an exact match.\n\nTherefore, \"defender of riga\" isn't exactly in the table as per the claim\u2014it's listed as \"defenders of riga.\" So this part doesn't hold. Thus, even though both films were submitted, their titles don't exactly align with the claim, making the overall statement false.\n\nWait no, actually, looking again: The second row is for 2008 (81st), film title is \"defenders of riga,\" original title is \"r\u012bgas sargi.\" The claim refers to \"defender of riga.\" So perhaps it's a translation issue or wording difference. But the instruction says to check against the table as given, so if the exact title doesn't match, then it's not relevant.\n\nTherefore, only the first part of the claim is correct, but since the second part isn't fully supported, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"mother , i love you and defender of riga be submit 1 year after the other,\" we need to check each part against the table:\n\n1. **\"mother, i love you\"**:\n   - Found in row index 4 under 'film title used in nomination'.\n   \n2. **\"defender of riga\"**:\n   - The film's title is \"defenders of riga,\" not exactly matching the claim.\n\nSince only the first part matches exactly, but the second doesn't, the overall claim isn't fully supported.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade before the next submission.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and which cells in the table are relevant. Let me break it down.\n\nThe term \"defender of riga\" seems to refer to a film title used in a nomination. Looking at the table, I see that one of the entries under this column is \"defenders of riga.\" That's probably the key cell related to the claim.\n\nNext, the phrase \"be submit more than a decade before the next submission.\" This suggests that there was a submission (nomination) in 2008 for \"defenders of riga,\" and then another submission for the same film or possibly another one from the same director more than ten years later. \n\nLooking at the table, I see the row for 2008 with \"defenders of riga\" as the film title used in nomination. Now, checking subsequent rows to see if there's another entry from this film or perhaps another submission by the same director after 2008. \n\nWait, the same director is aigars grauba, but I don't see any other entries for him beyond 2008. So maybe the claim is about the time between submissions. But in the table provided, there's no next submission for \"defenders of riga\" or another film by the same director more than ten years later. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a decade gap between two submissions by different films, but I don't see that either. For example, if there was a submission in 2008 and another in 2019, that would be over a decade. But looking at the table up to 2013, there's no such entry.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about submitting the same film more than once, but I don't see any repeated film titles beyond what's already listed. \n\nSo, putting it together: The only relevant cell seems to be the one for 2008 where \"defenders of riga\" was submitted. Since there's no evidence in the table of another submission by aigars grauba or the same film being submitted more than ten years later, the claim might not hold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false because the required condition isn't met based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is where \"defenders of riga\" was submitted in 2008. No subsequent submission for that title or by the same director within a decade is present in the table. Thus, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a given claim about the table is true or false and identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" Breaking this down, it's stating that there were five Latvian films submitted in 2011 (since \"11 year\" likely refers to 2011) for consideration in the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I'll check each row to see if any entries match the criteria. The columns of interest are \"year (ceremony)\", \"film title used in nomination\", and possibly others like \"director\" or \"result\".\n\nStarting with 2011, there's no row in the table that corresponds exactly to this year. The closest years listed are 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. Since the claim refers to a specific year (11th, which is 2011), and there's no matching row, I need to consider if this claim is accurate.\n\nNext, checking for Latvian films in the Best Foreign Language Film category. The table lists several films: \"the child of man\", \"defenders of riga\", \"hong kong confidential\", \"gulf stream under the iceberg\", and \"mother , i love you\". I need to verify if these were submitted in 2011 or if there were five such submissions that year.\n\nLooking at each film:\n\n1. \"the child of man\" was submitted in 1992.\n2. \"defenders of riga\" in 2008.\n3. \"hong kong confidential\" in 2010.\n4. \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" in 2012.\n5. \"mother , i love you\" in 2013.\n\nNone of these films were submitted in 2011. Additionally, each film is only listed once, which means there's no match for five films in that year. The claim mentions \"five Latvian films,\" but the table shows only one entry per year, and none correspond to 2011.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"original title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"director\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
