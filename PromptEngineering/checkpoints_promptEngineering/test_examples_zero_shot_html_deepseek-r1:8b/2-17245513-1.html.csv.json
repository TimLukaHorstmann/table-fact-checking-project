    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"t7 be the place of peter oosterhuis , who win 7500\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"t7\" refers to a specific place in the tournament, probably the 7th position or something similar. \"Peter Oosterhuis\" is a person, and his country is mentioned as England in the table. The money part is \"7500\".\n\nNow, I'll look at the HTML table provided. Each row has columns: place, player, country, score, to par, money.\n\nI need to find Peter Oosterhuis in the table. Let me scan each row's player column:\n\n- Row 1: lou graham\n- Row 2: john mahaffey\n- Row 3: frank beard\n- Row 4: ben crenshaw\n- Row 5: hale irwin\n- Row 6: bob murphy\n- Row 7: jack nicklaus\n- Row 8: peter oosterhuis\n- Row 9: pat fitzsimons\n- Row 10: arnold palmer\n- Row 11: tom watson\n\nOkay, Peter Oosterhuis is in row index 8 (since rows start from 0). Now, looking at his details:\n\n- Place: t7\n- Country: England\n- Score: 69 + 73 + 72 + 75 = 289\n- To par: +5\n- Money: 7500\n\nSo, the claim says that \"t7\" is Peter Oosterhuis's place and he wins 7500. Let me check each part.\n\nFirst, the place is t7. In row 8, the place is indeed t7. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the money column shows 7500 for Peter Oosterhuis. The claim mentions \"who win 7500\", which I assume means he won that amount. So that's correct too.\n\nPutting it together: The place of Peter Oosterhuis is t7, and he has 7500 in the money column. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this. The relevant cells are where Peter Oosterhuis is located because those will show his place (t7) and his money (7500).\n\nSo, row index for Peter is 8. In that row, the columns are:\n\n- td>t7 (place)\n- td>Englan d (country)\n- td>69 +73+72+75=289 (score)\n- td>+5 (to par)\n- td>7500 (money)\n\nBut since the claim only mentions place and money, I should extract those. However, to verify his placement, we need to check that t7 is indeed his place, which it is.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row 8, column \"place\" with value t7\n- row 8, column \"money\" with value 7500\n\nWait, but in the table, each score and money is given as a string like \"74 +72...\", so the money cell is where he gets 7500. So yes, those are the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis , who have 10875\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things: \n1. That Peter Oosterhuis's place is t7.\n2. That his money is 10,875.\n\nI'll start by looking for Peter Oosterhuis in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that in the fourth row (row index 3), there's a player named Peter Oosterhuis from England. His place is listed as t7, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to verify his money. In the same row, under the \"money\" column, it says 7500. The claim mentions 10,875, which doesn't match 7,500. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nNow, focusing on what the claim is asserting about Peter Oosterhuis: it claims that he has 10,875 money. However, in the table, his money is listed as 7500. Since this part of the claim isn't supported by the table data, I have to conclude that the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. For Peter Oosterhuis, the row index is 3 (since it's zero-indexed), and the relevant columns are \"place\" and \"money\". So the relevant cells are those two in row 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
