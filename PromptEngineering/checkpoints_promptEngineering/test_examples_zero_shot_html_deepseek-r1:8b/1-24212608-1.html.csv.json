    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and the specific instructions provided. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"in 2010 , there be 9.37 million viewer for the broadcast.\" So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that supports this statement.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are 'broadcast date' and 'viewers (millions)'. The year in question is 2010, so I need to find the row where the broadcast date is 2010 and check if the viewers column matches 9.37 million.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: 2005 - Not relevant.\n2. Row 2: 2006 - No.\n3. Row 3: 2007 - No.\n4. Row 5: 2009 - No.\n5. Row 6: 2010 - Broadcast date is 2010. Viewers are 9.37 million. That's a match.\n6. Rows 7,8: Later years, so not relevant.\n\nSince there's a matching row for 2010 with viewers as 9.37 million, the claim should be TRUE. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The 'broadcast date' column is at index 1 (since it's the second column) and the 'viewers (millions)' is the fifth column, which has an index of 4 if we start counting from 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me count correctly: the columns are episode, broadcast date, bbc one presenter(s), starring, radio 1 presenter, viewers. So, each row has six columns. The 'broadcast date' is the second column (index 1) and 'viewers' is the sixth (index 5).\n\nSo for Row 6, the relevant cells are the ones at row_index 6 (since rows start from 0), but looking at the table, the rows are numbered starting from 1 as episode numbers. Wait, no: in the HTML, the first row after thead is row 0? Or does it start from 1?\n\nWait, no. In the HTML, each <tr> is a row. The first one is index 0, then 1, etc. So Row 6 corresponds to episode number 6. Let me confirm:\n\n- First tr: row_index 0, episode 1\n- Second tr: row_index 1, episode 2\n- ...\n- Sixth tr: row_index 5, episode 6.\n\nYes, so the sixth tr (row_index 5) is the one for episode 6 in 2010. So the relevant cells are at row_index 5 and column_name 'viewers (millions)'.\n\nWait no, the claim is about 2010, which is the broadcast date of 2010. So looking for the row where broadcast_date is 2010. The sixth tr has broadcast date 2010, so that's row 6 in the table? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the HTML, the rows are as follows:\n\n- <tr>1</td>: broadcast date 2005\n- <tr>2</td>: 2006\n- ...\n- <tr>5</td>: 2009\n- <tr>6</td>: 2010\n\nWait no, in the HTML, each <tr> has a <td> for the episode number. So:\n\nRow 1: episode 1, broadcast date 2005.\nRow 2: episode 2, 2006.\n...\nRow 6: episode 6, 2010.\n\nYes. So the row with broadcast date 2010 is at row_index 5 (since it's the sixth row after thead). Wait no, wait: in the HTML, the first tr inside tbody is the first data row, so:\n\n- First <tr>: row_index 0, episode 1, 2005.\n- Second: row 1, episode 2, 2006.\n...\nSixth: row 5, episode 6, 2010.\n\nSo the relevant cells are at row_index 5 and column 'viewers (millions)' which is the fifth column. Wait, columns:\n\nColumns in order:\n1: episode\n2: broadcast date\n3: bbc one presenter(s)\n4: starring\n5: radio 1 presenter\n6: viewers (millions)\n\nSo 'viewers' is column 6, but perhaps it's better to refer by column_name as given.\n\nIn the table, the columns are:\n\n- episode\n- broadcast date\n- bbc one presenter(s)\n- starring\n- radio 1 presenter\n- viewers (millions)\n\nSo for row 5 (episode 6), the broadcast date is 2010 and viewers are 9.37 million.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are at row_index 5, column 'viewers (millions)'. But wait, the claim refers to both the year 2010 and the viewers number.\n\nSo I need to check two things: whether the broadcast date is 2010 and whether the viewers are 9.37 million. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. The cell where broadcast_date is 2010 (column_name 'broadcast date', row_index 5).\n2. The cell for viewers in that same row (column_name 'viewers (millions)', row_index 5).\n\nTherefore, the two relevant_cells are both at row_index 5 but different column_names.\n\nWait, no: the claim is specifically about 2010 and 9.37 million. So I need to find the cell where broadcast date is 2010 and viewers are 9.37.\n\nSo in the table, the sixth row (row_index 5) has both 2010 and 9.37 million viewers.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 5\n  - column_name: 'viewers (millions)'\n- row_index: 5\n  - column_name: 'broadcast date'\n\nWait no, but in the HTML, each tr is a single row, so to get both pieces of data for that year and viewers, we need two cells. But since the claim mentions both the year and the number, both are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the two cells to report are:\n\n1. The broadcast date cell (row 5, column 'broadcast date').\n2. The viewers cell (row 5, column 'viewers (millions)').\n\nSo in total, two relevant cells at row_index 5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from the specified row in the table. The relevant information confirming the claim is found in the following cells:\n\n1. **Broadcast Date:** At row index 5 (sixth row), the broadcast date is listed as 2010.\n2. **Viewers (millions):** In the same row, the number of viewers for that year is recorded as 9.37 million.\n\nThese data points align with the claim, confirming that in the year 2010, there were approximately 9.37 million viewers.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is verified by the data from row index 5 of the table, specifically:\n\n- **Broadcast Date:** 2010\n- **Viewers (millions):** 9.37\n\nThese values correspond to the year and viewer count mentioned in the claim, thus confirming its accuracy.\n\n\\boxed{True}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about an episode of a show is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"there be one episode broadcast in 2010.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and see what information it provides. The table has several columns: episode number, broadcast date, BBC One presenter(s), starring, Radio 1 presenter, and viewers in millions. My task is to check each part of the claim against this data.\n\nThe claim mentions an episode that was broadcast in 2010. So I need to look for any row where the broadcast date is 2010. The table has multiple rows, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 1: 2005\n- Row 2: 2006\n- Row 3: 2007\n- Row 4: 2009 (since episode numbers are non-consecutive, maybe there's a mistake or missing data)\n- Wait, actually, looking back, the table has rows for episodes numbered 1 to 8, but skips some numbers like 4. So, I need to check each row's broadcast date.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The table's <tbody> has seven <tr> elements, which correspond to episode numbers 1 through 7 and then 8. Wait, actually, looking at the rows:\n\nThe first row is episode 1 (2005), then 2 (2006), 3 (2007), then 5 (2009), 6 (2010), 7 (2011), 8 (2012). So, there's no episode 4. But for this problem, the exact numbering might not matter; what matters is the broadcast date of each row.\n\nSo, I'm specifically looking for a row where the broadcast date is 2010. Let me check each row:\n\n- Episode 5: 2009\n- Episode 6: 2010 \u2192 This is the one we need.\n- So, yes, there's an episode (number 6) that was broadcast in 2010.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says \"one episode broadcast in 2010.\" From the table, there is indeed an episode with broadcast date 2010, which is row 5 (but labeled as episode 6). So, this supports the claim.\n\nHowever, I should also check if any other columns might affect this. The claim is about the existence of such an episode, so the key column is \"broadcast date.\" But maybe there are other details like presenters or viewers that could be relevant? Let me think.\n\nThe claim doesn't mention anything about the presenter or viewers; it's solely about the broadcast date. So, as long as there's at least one episode with a 2010 broadcast date, the claim is true. \n\nLooking again, the sixth row (episode 6) has a broadcast date of 2010, so that's the relevant cell.\n\nWait, but in the table, the rows are numbered from 1 to 8, but the episodes have numbers 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. So, episode 6 is row 5? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the <tbody>:\n- First tr: episode 1 (2005) \u2192 row index 0\n- Second tr: episode 2 (2006) \u2192 row index 1\n- Third tr: episode 3 (2007) \u2192 row index 2\n- Fourth tr: episode 5 (2009) \u2192 row index 3\n- Fifth tr: episode 6 (2010) \u2192 row index 4\n- Sixth tr: episode 7 (2011) \u2192 row index 5\n- Seventh tr: episode 8 (2012) \u2192 row index 6\n\nSo, the fifth tr in the tbody is actually the sixth episode, which has a broadcast date of 2010. So the relevant cell is at row_index=4, column_name=\"broadcast date\".\n\nTherefore, since there's an episode with broadcast date 2010, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains an episode (episode 6) that was broadcast in 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table structure.\n\nThe claim says: \"nihal be the radio 1 presenter for the broadcast that have 9.73 million viewers.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different episode with various details. The columns are:\n- episode\n- broadcast date\n- bbc one presenter(s)\n- starring\n- radio 1 presenter\n- viewers (millions)\n\nI need to check two main things: \n1. Is there a broadcast with exactly 9.73 million viewers?\n2. For that broadcast, is the radio 1 presenter \"nihal\"?\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the 'viewers (millions)' column to find if any row has 9.73 as the value.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 1: 6.43\n- Row 2: 6.06\n- Row 3: 5.35\n- Row 4: 7.65\n- Row 5: 9.37\n- Row 6: 9.37\n- Row 7: 10.67\n- Row 8: 9.73\n\nAh, there's a row with viewers as 9.73 million.

Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"nihal be the most popular radio 1 presenter for the broadcast that have 9.73 million viewers.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what each part means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\n1. **\"nihal be the most popular radio 1 presenter\"**: This implies two things:\n   - Nihal is a radio 1 presenter.\n   - He is more popular than other presenters in his role.\n2. **\"for the broadcast that have 9.73 million viewers\"**: This means we're looking at a specific broadcast (episode) where the number of viewers is exactly 9.73 million.\n\nSo, I need to look for an episode with 9.73 million viewers and check if Nihal is the most popular radio 1 presenter in that particular broadcast.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The table has columns: episode, broadcast date, bbc one presenter(s), starring, radio 1 presenter, viewers (millions).\n- The episodes listed are from 1 to 8, with some numbers missing. For example, episode 5 is in 2009, and so on.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any have a viewer count of 9.73 million.\n\nChecking the 'viewers' column:\n- Episode 1: 6.43\n- Episode 2: 6.06\n- Episode 3: 5.35\n- Episode 5: 7.65\n- Episode 6: 9.37\n- Episode 7: 10.67\n- Episode 8: 9.73\n\nOh, episode 8 has viewers of 9.73 million. So that's the relevant broadcast.\n\nNow, for episode 8:\n- radio 1 presenter is \"nihal\"\n\nI need to check if Nihal is the most popular radio 1 presenter in this episode. However, looking at the table, I see that from episodes 5 to 8, the radio 1 presenter is consistently \"nihal.\" There's no other name mentioned for radio 1 presenter except 'n / a' in earlier episodes, but starting from episode 5 onwards, it's Nihal.\n\nWait, in the table, for each row:\n- Episode 2: radio 1 presenter is n/a\n- Episode 3: n/a\n- Episode 5: nihal\n- Episode 6: nihal\n- Episode 7: nihal\n- Episode 8: nihal\n\nSo in episode 8, the radio 1 presenter is Nihal. But since all episodes from 5 to 8 have Nihal as their radio 1 presenter, does that mean he's the most popular for those broadcasts? Wait, but each broadcast might have different presenters.\n\nWait, actually, in the claim, it says \"for the broadcast that have 9.73 million viewers.\" So only episode 8 meets this condition. In that specific broadcast, the radio 1 presenter is Nihal. There's no other presenter mentioned for that episode, so Nihal is the presenter there.\n\nTherefore, in the context of that specific broadcast, Nihal is indeed the radio 1 presenter, and since there's only one, he is automatically the most popular.\n\nWait, but the term \"most popular\" implies comparison. But if it's the same person every time, then yes, he's the most popular by default because there's no one else to compare. So the claim would be true.\n\nBut let me double-check the table again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Episode 1: N/A\n- Episode 2: N/A\n- Episode 3: N/A\n- Episode 5: Nihal\n- Episode 6: Nihal\n- Episode 7: Nihal\n- Episode 8: Nihal\n\nYes, only episode 8 has the viewer count of 9.73 million and the radio 1 presenter is Nihal. So in that specific broadcast, he is the most popular since there are no others.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"nihal\" is the most popular radio 1 presenter for the episode with 9.73 million viewers. Checking the table, episode 8 has 9.73 million viewers and lists nihal as the radio 1 presenter. Since there are no other presenters mentioned for this episode, nihal is indeed the most popular.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"radio 1 presenter\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has several columns and rows with data, and the claim specifically mentions something about the BBC One presenter for the 2010 broadcast being Mylene Klass.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. The table has headers like episode number, broadcast date, BBC One presenter(s), starring, radio 1 presenter, and viewers in millions. Each row corresponds to a different year, from 2005 up through 2012.\n\nThe claim is about the BBC One presenter for the 2010 broadcast being Mylene Klass. So I need to look at the row where the broadcast date is 2010 and check who the BBC One presenter was in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, the years go from 2005 (episode 1) up to 2012 (episode 8). Let's find the row for 2010. Scanning through, I see episode 6 with a broadcast date of 2010. So row index 5 (since we start counting rows at 0 in code but here it seems like each <tr> is an incrementing number, so probably row index starts at 1? Wait, the first row is 2005 and it's labeled as episode 1, then next is episode 2, etc. So the row indices might correspond to the episode numbers minus 1 if we're using zero-based indexing.\n\nWait, in the given table, each <tr> represents a new row, starting with episode 1. So the first <tr> after <thead> is episode 1, then episode 2, and so on. So for 2010, which is episode 6, that's the sixth row in the table.\n\nLooking at that row (episode 6), I see the broadcast date is 2010, the BBC One presenter is Jake Humphrey, not Mylene Klass. Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"the bbc one presenter for the 2010 broadcast be myleene klass.\" So according to the table, in 2010, the BBC One presenter was Jake Humphrey.\n\nSo that means the claim is incorrect because the presenter at that time was Jake, not Mylene. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. The table shows that for episode 6 (2010), the BBC One presenter is Jake Humphrey. Mylene Klass was the presenter in earlier episodes like 2009 and 2011. So yes, in 2010, it's Jake.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the ones in row 5 (since rows start at 0) for the \"bbc one presenter (s)\" column.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"more than one episode be broadcast in 2010\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim says there were more than one episodes broadcast in 2010. So, I should look for any row where the \"broadcast date\" is 2010 and check how many episodes that corresponds to.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with its details. The \"broadcast date\" column shows the year each episode was aired. I'll go through each row to find those where the broadcast date is 2010.\n\nScanning the rows:\n- Row 1: 2005\n- Row 2: 2006\n- Row 3: 2007\n- Row 4: 2009\n- Row 5: 2010\n- Row 6: 2010\n- Row 7: 2011\n- Row 8: 2012\n\nSo, rows 5 and 6 have a broadcast date of 2010. That means two episodes were aired in 2010.\n\nNow, the claim says \"more than one,\" which means two or more. Since there are exactly two episodes in 2010, that's more than one. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"broadcast date\" column is where the years are listed, so each row with a broadcast date of 2010 is important. Specifically, rows 5 and 6. Also, the \"episode\" numbers for these rows are 5 and 6, but since the claim doesn't mention specific episode numbers, the key columns are just \"broadcast date.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 5 (index 4?), wait, no\u2014row indices start at 0 in programming but here they're listed as row 1 to row 8. Wait, looking back, the rows are numbered starting from 1: <tr>1</td>, etc. So row 5 is the fifth entry, which is index 4 if we count from 0, but according to the JSON example, it's row_index as an integer, so probably 5 and 6.\n\nWait, in the table, the first row is labeled 1, then 2, up to 8. So for row 5: broadcast date 2010, and row 6: same. Therefore, their row indices are 5 and 6 (since they're the fifth and sixth rows). So in JSON, \"row_index\" would be 5 and 6.\n\nSo, I need to create a list of objects with \"row_index\" as 5 and 6, and column_name as \"broadcast date\".\n\nWait, no: looking at the table's HTML, each <tr> is a row. The first <tr> is episode 1, so row 0 in the JSON would correspond to index 1? Or maybe not; perhaps the rows are numbered starting from 0 or 1.\n\nWait, the JSON example given has row_index as 0 and 1, but the table shows episodes 1-8. So I think each <tr> is a single row, so for the first row (episode 1), row_index would be 0, and so on up to episode 8 being row 7.\n\nBut in the problem statement's example, it's not clear how they got row indices as 0 and 1. Wait, in the example provided:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nBut in the table, the first row is episode 1. So perhaps the rows are indexed starting from 0 as per their position in the table body.\n\nSo, let's list all rows:\n\nRow 1: index 0 (episode 1)\nRow 2: index 1 (episode 2)\n...\nRow 5: index 4 (episode 5)\nRow 6: index 5 (episode 6)\n\nSo, for the two episodes in 2010 (rows 5 and 6), their indices are 4 and 5. But wait, no\u2014row 5 is episode 5, which would be row_index 4, because it's the fifth element starting from 0. Similarly, episode 6 is row_index 5.\n\nWait, but in the table, the first row after <thead> is:\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n... etc.\n\nSo, the first row (episode 1) is index 0, then 2nd row (episode 2) is index 1, and so on. So for episode 5: it's the fifth row in the tbody, which would be index 4. Episode 6: sixth row, index 5.\n\nSo, the two relevant rows are at indices 4 and 5, and their column to check is \"broadcast date\".\n\nTherefore, the JSON should list these cells.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}]}",

I'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Episode 1, 2005, Clare Balding, Doug Segal\n- Row 2: Episode 2, 2006, Myleene Klass, Gethin Jones, Natasha Kaplinsky & Alesha Dixon\n- Row 3: Episode 3, 2007, Myleene Klass, Gethin Jones, Natasha Kaplinsky & Nick Knowles\n- Row 5: Episode 5, 2009, Myleene Klass\n- Row 6: Episode 6, 2010, Jake Humphrey\n- Row 7: Episode 7, 2011, Jake Humphrey\n- Row 8: Episode 8, 2012, Gabby Logan\n\nThe claim mentions \"gethin jones , natasha kaplinsky & nick knowles\". This matches the description in Row 3. So, the relevant row is Row 3.\n\nNext, I need to check if the viewers for this episode are 6.06 million. Looking at the \"viewers (millions)\" column in Row 3, it shows 5.35 million. That's not equal to 6.06 million.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rows. Oh no, actually, the claim says Gethin Jones, Natasha Kaplinsky, and Nick Knowles. But in Row 3, it's Myleene Klass hosting, with Gethin Jones, Natasha Kaplinsky, and Nick Knowles as the starring presenters. So yes, the episode is number 3.\n\nBut the viewers for that episode are 5.35 million, not 6.06. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states the viewers are 6.06 when they're actually 5.35.\n\nWait again, I'm a bit confused because in Row 2, Gethin Jones and Natasha Kaplinsky are there along with Alesha Dixon. So maybe the claim refers to that episode instead. Let me check:\n\nRow 2: Episode 2, 2006, Myleene Klass, Gethin Jones, Natasha Kaplinsky & Alesha Dixon. Viewers: 6.06 million.\n\nAh, here we go. The claim mentions \"gethin jones , natasha kaplinsky & nick knowles\", but in Row 2, it's Gethin, Natasha, and Alesha. So the claim might be referring to a non-existent episode or mixing up information. Wait, no, the claim specifically includes Nick Knowles, which isn't in Row 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"gethin jones , natasha kaplinsky & nick knowles episode\". In the table, the only time Gethin and Natasha appear together with Nick is in Row 3, but that's a different year. So, maybe the claim is referring to an episode that doesn't exist or is mistakenly referencing data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about an episode where Gethin, Natasha, and Nick are all present, which would be Row 3. However, the viewers for that episode are 5.35 million, not 6.06. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the viewers being 6.06 is false.\n\nWait, but in Row 2, the viewers are 6.06 million. If the claim mistakenly refers to Gethin and Natasha with Nick when they were only together in Row 3, which has a different number of viewers, then the claim is incorrect. Alternatively, if the claim is referring to Row 2, then it's correct in terms of viewers but incorrect in the presenter names.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim mentions three presenters: Gethin Jones, Natasha Kaplinsky, and Nick Knowles. In the table, Row 3 has all three as starring presenters for Episode 3 in 2007, but that episode had 5.35 million viewers.\n\nRow 2 has only Gethin and Natasha along with Alesha, not Nick. So there's no row where all three are present except perhaps a hypothetical one that doesn't exist in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is likely incorrect because either:\n\n1. It refers to Episode 3 (2007) but claims 6.06 viewers when it's actually 5.35.\n2. It refers to a non-existent episode with all three presenters and 6.06 viewers.\n\nIn either case, there's no matching episode in the table that has both the exact presenter trio and the viewer number stated. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the viewers for the specified presenters are not 6.06 million but 5.35 million.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is about Episode 2 (2006), which does have 6.06 viewers, but the claim incorrectly includes Nick Knowles as a presenter who wasn't there. So again, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the claim's assertion about the viewers and possibly the presenters doesn't align with the data in Row 3 or any other row.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing the given information to determine if the claim is accurate. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that there is an episode featuring Gethin Jones, Natasha Kaplinsky, and Nick Knowles with 6.06 million viewers.\n\n2. **Review the Table**: Examine each row for the presence of all three presenters and the corresponding viewer numbers.\n   - **Row 3 (Episode 3)**: Features Gethin, Natasha, and Nick as starring presenters but has 5.35 million viewers.\n   - Other rows either feature subsets or different presenters with varying viewer counts.\n\n3. **Assess the Claim**: The claim refers to a specific trio of presenters and a viewer number. However:\n   - There's no episode in the table where all three are presenters together, except Row 3, which doesn't match the viewer count.\n   - Even if considering an incorrect row (like Row 2), the presenter list doesn't include Nick Knowles.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim is false because there's no matching episode with both the specified presenters and viewer number.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is false; there is no such episode with those presenters and 6.06 million viewers.",
