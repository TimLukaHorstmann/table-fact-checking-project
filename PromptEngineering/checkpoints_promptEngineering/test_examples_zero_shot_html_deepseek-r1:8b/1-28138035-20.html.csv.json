    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"timo boll win the ittf pro tour men single 3 time between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Timo Boll won the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles three times within the years from 1997 to 2012. So, I need to check if there are three instances where \"Timo Boll\" is listed under the \"men singles\" column and the year is between 1997 and 2012.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year and location, with columns for men's singles, women's singles, etc. The relevant column here is \"men singles.\" I'll go through each row to find entries where Timo Boll won in the years specified.\n\nStarting from 1997: In row 1997 (row_index 12), under \"mens singles,\" it says \"jan - ove waldner.\" So, not Timo Boll.\n\nIn 1998 (row 13): Kong linghui, so no.\n\n1999 (row 14): Vladimir Samsonov, nope.\n\n2000 (row 15): Wang liqin, no.\n\n2001 (row 16): Chang peng - lung, no.\n\n2002 (row 17): Kalinikos Kreanga, not Timo Boll.\n\n2003 (row 18): Timo Boll. So that's one win in 2003.\n\n2004 (row 19): Chen qi, nope.\n\n2005 (row 20): Timo Boll again. That's two wins now.\n\n2006 (row 21): Wang liqin, no.\n\n2007 (row 22): Wang hao, no.\n\n2008 (row 23): Ma lin, not Timo Boll.\n\n2009 (row 24): Oh sang - eun, no.\n\n2010 (row 25): Timo Boll. That's three wins now in 2010.\n\n2011 (row 26): Seiya Kishikawa, nope.\n\n2012 (row 27): Jun Mizutani, not Timo Boll.\n\nSo, from 1997 to 2012, Timo Boll won men's singles in 2003, 2005, and 2010. That makes three wins within that timeframe. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table. Each occurrence of \"Timo Boll\" in the \"men singles\" column between 1997 and 2012 should be noted. Let's list them:\n\n- Row 18 (2003)\n- Row 20 (2005)\n- Row 25 (2010)\n\nEach of these corresponds to Timo Boll winning the men's singles.\n\nSo, in the JSON response, I need to include each of these as relevant cells with their row indices and column name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"men singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"men singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"men singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It says that Yokohama hosted the ITTF Pro Tour four times between 1997 and 2012. So, I need to find out how many times Yokohama was a host for the ITTF events during those years mentioned.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and location, along with details about singles and doubles players. The relevant columns are \"year\" and \"location\". \n\nI'll go through each row from 1997 to 2012 and check if the location is Yokohama. \n\nStarting from 1997: \n- The first row in 1997 has location 'chiba', so that's not Yokohama.\n\nNext, 2000:\nWait, I need to make sure I go year by year. Let me list out all rows from 1997 onwards and note the location when it is Yokohama.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1997: chiba\n- 1998: wakayama\n- 1999: kobe\n- 2000: kobe\n- 2001: yokohama\n- 2002: kobe\n- 2003: kobe\n- 2004: kobe\n- 2005: yokohama\n- 2006: yokohama\n- 2007: chiba\n- 2008: yokohama\n- 2009: wakayama\n- 2010: kobe\n- 2011: kobe\n- 2012: kobe\n\nNow, let's count the number of times Yokohama was the host:\n\n- 2001: 1\n- 2005: 2\n- 2006: 3\n- 2008: 4\n\nSo that's four times. The claim says \"four times between 1997 and 2012\". Since the first occurrence is in 2001 and the last in 2008, all within the timeframe, it seems correct.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure the time frame includes 1997 to 2012. So from 2001 to 2008, that's four times. The claim mentions between 1997 and 2012, so yes, those four years fall within that range.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2001 - 2008, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2005, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2006, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2008, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"wang nan be the only female to win 3 year in a row in womens single at the ittf pro tour\" is true based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It says that Wang Nan is the sole female who won three consecutive years in the women's singles category at the ITTF Pro Tour. So, I need to check if there's any other woman who has achieved a three-peat (winning three times consecutively) in the same event.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, and under \"women's singles\" we can see the winner for that year. The location might not be directly relevant here, so I'll focus on the \"women's singles\" column.\n\nI need to identify if Wang Nan has won three consecutive years and whether any other woman has done the same. To do this, I should examine each row from 2000 onwards since the earliest year in the table is 1999.\n\nStarting from 2000:\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2002: Kim Kyung-Ah\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the \"women's singles\" column for each year:\n\nLet me correct that by looking at each row's \"women's singles\" entry.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n1999: Wang Nan (yes)\n2000: Wang Nan\n2001: Wang Nan\nWait, but in 2002, it's Kim Kyung-Ah. So let me list them out properly:\n\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1997: Wang Chen\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2002: Kim Kyung-Ah\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\n- 2005: Zhang Yining\n- 2006: Wang Yuegu\n- 2007: Wang Nan\n- 2008: Zhang Yining\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei\n- 2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nWait, now I see that in 1999, Wang Nan won. Then in 2000, she won again, but wait, the next year is also Wang Nan? Wait no, looking back at the table:\n\nWait, actually, each row is a different year. So for example, 1998's \"women's singles\" is Li Ju, and so on.\n\nBut let me clarify by listing each year with their respective winners in women's singles:\n\nLooking through each row from 1997 to 2012 (since the claim mentions years around that period):\n\n- 1997: Lee Eun-Sil\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2002: Kim Kyung-Ah\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\n- 2005: Zhang Yining\n- 2006: Wang Yuegu\n- 2007: Wang Nan\n- 2008: Zhang Yining\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei\n- 2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nWait, no. The \"women's singles\" column for each year:\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n1998: Lee Eun-Sil (No, wait, looking back, in 1997 it's Lee Eun-Sil, but I'm focusing on women's singles.\n\nActually, let me correct this by listing all years and their respective winners:\n\n- 1997: Lee Eun-Sil\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2002: Kim Kyung-Ah\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\n- 2005: Zhang Yining\n- 2006: Wang Yuegu\n- 2007: Wang Nan\n- 2008: Zhang Yining\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei\n- 2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list each year correctly:\n\nLooking at the table row by row for \"women's singles\":\n\n1997: Lee Eun-Sil\n1998: Li Ju\n1999: Wang Nan\n2000: Wang Nan\n2001: Wang Nan\n2002: Kim Kyung-Ah\n2003: Guo Yue\n2004: Zhang Yining\n2005: Zhang Yining\n2006: Wang Yuegu\n2007: Wang Nan\n2008: Zhang Yining\n2009: Park Mi-Young\n2010: Wang Yuegu\n2011: Feng Tianwei\n2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nNow, focusing on Wang Nan's wins:\n\nShe won in 1999, 2000, 2001. So that's three consecutive years (1999, 2000, 2001). Wait, no: 1999 is her first win, then 2000 and 2001 as well? Let me check the exact table.\n\nLooking back at the original table:\n\nThe \"women's singles\" column for each year:\n\n- 1997: Lee Eun-Sil\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2002: Kim Kyung-Ah\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\n- 2005: Zhang Yining\n- 2006: Wang Yuegu\n- 2007: Wang Nan\n- 2008: Zhang Yining\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei\n- 2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nSo, from 1999 to 2001, Wang Nan won three times in a row. That's consecutive wins for three years: 1999, 2000, 2001.\n\nNow, the claim says \"wang nan be the only female to win 3 year in a row\". So I need to check if any other woman has done this.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- Wang Nan: 1999, 2000, 2001 (three consecutive)\n- Zhang Yining: 2004, 2005\n- Wang Yuegu: 2006, then again in 2010\n- Feng Tianwei: 2011\n- Shen Yanfei: 2012\n\nNone of the other women have three consecutive wins. So Wang Nan is unique in that aspect.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. For example, looking at Zhang Yining:\n\nShe won in 2004 and 2005 (two consecutive). Not three.\n\nWang Yuegu: won in 2006 and again in 2010, but not consecutively in the same years.\n\nOthers don't have three.\n\nTherefore, Wang Nan is indeed the only female to win three times in a row in women's singles at the ITTF Pro Tour based on this table.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Wang Nan is the sole female to win three consecutive years in women's singles at the ITTF Pro Tour, we analyze the data from 1997 to 2012. Wang Nan won in 1999, 2000, and 2001, which are three consecutive years. No other female achieved this feat during this period.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is \\boxed{TRUE}.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kobe host the most ittf pro tour in between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"Kobe hosting the most ITTF Pro Tour events between 1997 and 2012.\" So, Kobe is acting as a host for these tournaments during those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and location, along with information about singles and doubles players. The columns relevant to hosts might be in the 'year' or 'location' but actually, I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, it could relate to the locations where events are held, so if Kobe is consistently hosting more events than others during 1997-2012, that would support the claim.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row has a 'year location' column, which likely indicates the host city for that event. For example, in 2012, it's Kobe; in 2009, it's Wakayama, etc. So, to see if Kobe hosts the most ITTF Pro Tour events between 1997 and 2012, I need to check how many times each location is mentioned in those years.\n\nSo, my first task is to identify all rows where the year is between 1997 and 2012. Let's list them:\n\n- 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nWait, the claim is from 1997 to 2012, inclusive. Now, I need to count how many times each location appears in these rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Kobe: Let's check each row:\n  - 2012: Kobe\n  - 2011: Kobe\n  - 2010: Kobe\n  - 2009: Wakayama\n  - 2008: Yokohama\n  - 2007: Chiba\n  - 2006: Yokohama\n  - 2005: Yokohama\n  - 2004: Kobe\n  - 2003: Kobe\n  - 2002: Kobe\n  - 1999: Kobe\n  - 1998: Wakayama\n  - 1997: Chiba\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each row from 1997 to 2012:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1997: chiba\n- 1998: wakayama\n- 1999: kobe\n- 2000: kobe\n- 2001: yokohama\n- 2002: kobe\n- 2003: kobe\n- 2004: kobe\n- 2005: yokohama\n- 2006: yokohama\n- 2007: chiba\n- 2008: yokohama\n- 2009: wakayama\n- 2010: kobe\n- 2011: kobe\n- 2012: kobe\n\nSo, let's count the number of times each location appears:\n\n- Kobe:\n  - 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012 \u2192 That's 8 instances.\n  \n- Wakayama:\n  - 1998, 2009 \u2192 2 instances.\n\n- Chiba:\n  - 1997, 2007 \u2192 2 instances.\n\n- Yokohama:\n  - 2001, 2005, 2006, 2008 \u2192 4 instances.\n\nSo, in the years from 1997 to 2012, Kobe hosted 8 times, while Yokohama had 4, Wakayama had 2, and Chiba had 2. So, Kobe is the most frequent host in those years.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported as TRUE because Kobe indeed hosted the most ITTF Pro Tour events between 1997 and 2012.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to find which cells are relevant. Each row's 'year location' is important, so for each occurrence where the host is Kobe in that timeframe, those rows are relevant.\n\nSo, looking back at each relevant year:\n\n- 1999: row index 8\n- 2000: row index 9\n- 2002: row index 11\n- 2003: row index 12\n- 2004: row index 13\n- 2010: row index 14\n- 2011: row index 15\n- 2012: row index 16\n\nWait, actually, the table starts from 1997 as row 0? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table, each row is a year starting from 1997, so row_index=0 is 1997, then 1 for 1998, and so on up to row_index=20 for 2012.\n\nSo, in the table provided, each row has a 'year' and 'location'. So, I need to find all rows where the location is Kobe and the year is between 1997-2012. From my earlier count, that's 8 instances:\n\nLooking at the table, the rows are as follows (row_index:0-20):\n\n0:1997 Chiba\n\n1:1998 Wakayama\n\n2:1999 Kobe\n\n3:2000 Kobe\n\n4:2001 Yokohama\n\n5:2002 Kobe\n\n6:2003 Kobe\n\n7:2004 Kobe\n\n8:2005 Yokohama\n\n9:2006 Yokohama\n\n10:2007 Chiba\n\n11:2008 Yokohama\n\n12:2009 Wakayama\n\n13:2010 Kobe\n\n14:2011 Kobe\n\n15:2012 Kobe\n\n16: (probably beyond the table, but up to 2012, row_index=15 is 2012).\n\nWait, I think I miscounted. Let me list all rows with location as Kobe and year between 1997-2012:\n\nRow 2:1999 Kobe\n\nRow3:2000 Kobe\n\nRow5:2002 Kobe\n\nRow6:2003 Kobe\n\nRow7:2004 Kobe\n\nRow13:2010 Kobe\n\nRow14:2011 Kobe\n\nRow15:2012 Kobe\n\nSo, that's 8 rows (row indices 2,3,5,6,7,13,14,15).\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include these row indices and their column name, which is \"year location\" but in the table it's written as \"year location\", so column_name would be \"Year Location\".\n\nWait, looking at the JSON example, the keys are row_index (int) and column_name (string). In the provided table, each row starts with 'year' then 'location', so the first column is \"year\" and the second is \"location\". So, for relevant cells, we're interested in the 'location' column because that's where the host city is indicated.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the claim is about Kobe hosting the most ITTF Pro Tour events, which would relate to the location (host city). So, each row has a 'year location', so the second column is the location. Therefore, for each occurrence where the location is Kobe, we need to mark those rows as relevant.\n\nTherefore, in the table, the relevant cells are all the rows where the location is Kobe and the year is between 1997-2012.\n\nThus, the row indices would be:\n\nLooking back at the list of rows:\n\nRow 2:1999\n\nRow3:2000\n\nRow5:2002\n\nRow6:2003\n\nRow7:2004\n\nRow13:2010\n\nRow14:2011\n\nRow15:2012\n\nSo, those are 8 rows. So in terms of row indices (assuming starting from 0 as 1997), the indices would be 2,3,5,6,7,13,14,15.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells array would have each of these row indices with column_name being \"location\".\n\nHence, the JSON should include:\n\nrelevant_cells: [\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\":15, \"column_name\":\"location\"}\n]\n\nSo, that's 8 entries.\n\nBut wait, in the table provided, there are more rows beyond 2012. For example, row_index=16 is 2013, etc., but since we're only concerned with years up to 2012, those are included as above.\n\nThus, summarizing:\n\n- Task: Determine if Kobe hosted the most ITTF Pro Tour events between 1997 and 2012.\n- Analysis: Counted each location's frequency in that timeframe. Kobe had 8, Yokohama 4, Wakayama 2, Chiba 2.\n- Conclusion: True\n- Relevant cells: All rows where location is Kobe within this period (row indices 2,3,5,6,7,13,14,15).\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Kobe hosted the most ITTF Pro Tour events between 1997 and 2012 is supported by analysis of the provided data.

Year is 2007, which is within 1997-2012.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in between 1997 and 2012,\" so maybe they mean years after 1997 up to 2012. So 2007 is included. Let me note that down.\n\nNext rows:\n\n- 2006 yokohama: No.\n- 2005 yokohama: No.\n- 2004 kobe: No.\n- 2003 kobe: No.\n- 2002 kobe: No.\n- 2001 yokohama: No.\n- 2000 kobe: No.\n- 1999 kobe: Year is 1999, which is within the range. Location is Kobe, so not Chiba.\n- 1998 wakayama: No.\n- 1997 chiba: Yes, location is Chiba and year is 1997.\n\nSo in total, there are two rows where Chiba was the host between 1997 and 2012:\n\n1. 2007 chiba\n2. 1997 chiba\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the claim says \"host at chiba\" which might imply that Chiba hosted it multiple times, but the important thing is whether any of those years were within the specified range.\n\nSo yes, both 1997 and 2007 are within 1997-2012. Therefore, the claim is supported because there are entries for Chiba during that time period.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the claim says \"in between 1997 and 2012.\" So does it include 1997 or not? The wording can be a bit ambiguous. Sometimes \"between\" is interpreted as excluding the endpoints. But in this context, I think including them makes more sense because they're specifying a range that likely includes all years from 1997 up to 2012.\n\nTherefore, since Chiba hosted in both 1997 and 2007, which are within the given period, the claim is true.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to find which cells correspond to these rows. The columns we care about are \"year location\" for the year and the specific column (like mens singles, etc.) for each event.\n\nWait, no. The columns after \"year location\" are the different tournaments or categories. But the claim doesn't specify a particular category, just that Chiba hosted the 2 ITTF Pro Tour between those years. So any of the events in Chiba during those years would be relevant to verify the hosting.\n\nSo for each of those rows (1997 and 2007), all the columns after \"year location\" would be relevant because they represent different events hosted at Chiba during that time, confirming that Chiba was indeed a host for the ITTF Pro Tour in those years.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For 1997 chiba: row_index 14 (assuming rows start from 0), columns: year location, mens singles, womens singles, mens doubles, womens doubles.\n- For 2007 chiba: row_index 6, same columns.\n\nWait, let me check the table structure. The first column is \"year location\", then next four are the events. So for each relevant row, all five columns (including year location) are part of the relevant cells because they show that Chiba hosted those events in those years.\n\nSo, to list them:\n\n1997 chiba: row 14, all columns.\n2007 chiba: row 6, all columns.\n\nTherefore, the \"relevant_cells\" would be each cell for these two rows across all five columns.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify which event or category, just that Chiba hosted it. So any of those events in those years confirm the hosting. Therefore, yes, all cells are relevant because they show the events hosted at Chiba during the specified time.\n\nSo the JSON should include for each of these rows, all columns as relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"2 ITTF Pro Tour be host at Chiba between 1997 and 2012,\" we check the table for rows where the location is \"Chiba\" within that timeframe. There are two such rows: 1997 and 2007. Each of these rows includes all columns, as they confirm Chiba's hosting during those years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mens doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"mens doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about Wang Liqin winning the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles three times between 1997 and 2012 is true or false. The table provided has information on various years, locations, and the winners for both men's and women's singles and doubles.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It says that Wang Liqin won the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles three times between 1997 and 2012. That means I need to look through the table for each year from 1997 up to 2012 and check how many times Wang Liqin is listed in the \"men's singles\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. The \"year location\" column gives the year, and the \"mens singles\" column lists the winner of that event for men's singles. So my focus should be on the \"mens singles\" column across these years.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the relevant rows where the year is between 1997 and 2012. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 2008: The \"men's singles\" winner is listed as \"ma lin\". Not Wang Liqin.\n- 2009: \"oh sang - eun\", not him.\n- 2010: \"timo boll\", nope.\n- 2011: \"seiya kishikawa\", still not.\n- 2012: \"jun mizutani\", so again, not Wang Liqin.\n\nNow, looking at the earlier years:\n\n1997: The winner is \"jan - ove waldner\". Not Wang Liqin.\n1998: \"kong linghui\", nope.\n1999: \"vladimir samsonov\", not him either.\n2000: \"wang liqin\" \u2013 yes, that's one win.\n2001: The winner is \"chiang peng - lung\", so no.\n2002: \"kalinikos kreanga\", not Wang Liqin.\n2003: \"timo boll\", nope.\n2004: \"chen qi\", still not.\n2005: \"timo boll\" again, not him.\n2006: \"wang liqin\" \u2013 that's the second win.\n2007: \"wang hao\", not Wang Liqin.\n2008: As mentioned before, it's \"ma lin\".\nWait, I think I might have missed some years between 1997 and 2012. Let me list all years from 1997 to 2012:\n\n1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- 1997: Not Wang Liqin.\n- 1998: Kong Linghui.\n- 1999: Vladimir Samsonov.\n- 2000: Wang Liqin \u2013 first win.\n- 2001: Chiang Peng-lung.\n- 2002: Kalinikos Kreanga.\n- 2003: Timo Boll.\n- 2004: Chen Qi.\n- 2005: Timo Boll.\n- 2006: Wang Liqin \u2013 second win.\n- 2007: Wang Hao.\n- 2008: Ma Lin.\n- 2009: Oh Sang-eun.\n- 2010: Timo Boll.\n- 2011: Seiya Kishikawa.\n- 2012: Jun Mizutani.\n\nSo in the years from 1997 to 2012, Wang Liqin won in 2000 and 2006. That's two wins, not three as the claim states. Therefore, the claim is incorrect. The answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each time Wang Liqin won, his name appears in the \"mens singles\" column for that year. So I'll look up those rows and note their row indices.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- 2000: Row index is 7 (since counting starts from 0, right? Wait, no. The first row is 1997, which would be row index 0. So 1997:0, 1998:1, 1999:2, 2000:3, and so on.\n\nWait, the table starts with 1997 as the earliest year. Let me count each row's index:\n\n- Row 0: 1997\n- Row 1: 1998\n- Row 2: 1999\n- Row 3: 2000 (Wang Liqin win)\n- Row 4: 2001\n- Row 5: 2002\n- Row 6: 2003\n- Row 7: 2004\n- Row 8: 2005\n- Row 9: 2006 (Second Wang Liqin win)\n- Row 10: 2007\n- Row 11: 2008\n- Row 12: 2009\n- Row 13: 2010\n- Row 14: 2011\n- Row 15: 2012\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 3 (2000) and row 9 (2006). Therefore, I'll include those two as the relevant_cells.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is \"FALSE\" because there are only two wins by Wang Liqin in the specified timeframe. The relevant cells are at indices 3 and 9 for men's singles.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the ittf pro tour be host in kobe 4 time between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's saying that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Kobe four times between 1997 and 2012. So, my goal is to find out how many times Kobe hosted the events during those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, with columns for men's singles, women's singles, etc., but the first column seems to be \"year location,\" which indicates both the year and the location. The relevant part here is the location, specifically whether it's Kobe or not.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows where the location is Kobe and within the years 1997 to 2012. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1998: Wakayama\n- 1999: Kobe\n- 2000: Kobe\n- 2001: Yokohama\n- 2002: Kobe\n- 2003: Kobe\n- 2004: Kobe\n- 2005: Yokohama\n- 2006: Yokohama\n- 2007: Chiba\n- 2008: Yokohama\n- 2009: Wakayama\n- 2010: Kobe\n- 2011: Kobe\n- 2012: Kobe\n\nWait, the claim is about four times. Let me count how many times Kobe hosted between 1997 and 2012.\n\nFrom the list above:\n- 1999: Kobe (1)\n- 2000: Kobe (2)\n- 2002: Kobe (3)\n- 2003: Kobe (4)\n- 2004: Kobe (5) \u2013 Wait, that's five times. Hmm, did I miscount?\n\nWait no, the table goes from 1997 onwards, but let me check each relevant year:\n\nLooking at rows starting from 1997:\n- 1998: Wakayama (not Kobe)\n- 1999: Kobe\n- 2000: Kobe\n- 2002: Kobe\n- 2003: Kobe\n- 2004: Kobe\n\nWait, that's five times in total. But the claim says four times between 1997 and 2012. So perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me list all the rows where location is Kobe:\n\nLooking through each row:\n- 1999: Kobe (1)\n- 2000: Kobe (2)\n- 2002: Kobe (3)\n- 2003: Kobe (4)\n- 2004: Kobe (5)\n- 2010: Kobe (6)\n- 2011: Kobe (7)\n- 2012: Kobe (8)\n\nWait, that's way more than four. So the claim is saying it was hosted four times between 1997 and 2012. But according to this, it's actually hosted multiple times beyond four.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"host in kobe 4 time,\" so perhaps it's hosted there four times during that period. But from the table, it seems Kobe was a host location more than four times between those years.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row where location is Kobe:\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n- 1999: Yes\n- 2000: Yes\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2003: Yes\n- 2004: Yes\n- 2010: Yes\n- 2011: Yes\n- 2012: Yes\n\nThat's eight times, which is way more than four. So the claim that it was hosted four times is incorrect; it was actually hosted multiple times beyond four in that period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering only one event per year, but even then, if they hosted once each time, that would still be more than four times.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Kobe more than four times between 1997 and 2012.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Kobe four times between 1997 and 2012. By examining the table, we find that Kobe hosted the events multiple times beyond four within this timeframe. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"year location\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Zhang Yining be the only female to win 3 year in a row in women's single at the ITTF Pro Tour.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It\u2019s stating that Zhang Yining is unique in achieving three consecutive wins in the women's singles division over three years. So, I need to check if there are any other female players who have done this.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are 'year location' and the 'women's singles' column. The 'year location' tells me which year each player won, and the 'women's singles' gives the name of the winner for that year.\n\nI need to look through each row in the women's singles column to see if any female players besides Zhang Yining have won three times consecutively over three different years. \n\nStarting from 2008 onwards:\n\n- 2008: Zhang Yining\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei\n- 2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nNone of these players seem to have won three times in a row. Let me check further back.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for three consecutive wins. So, for instance, if a player won in 2008, 2009, and 2010, that's three years. But looking at the table starting from 2008:\n\n- 2008: Zhang Yining\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n\nSo, Zhang only won once, in 2008. The next year was a different player.\n\nLooking for consecutive wins:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the same player winning three years in a row. So, if a single player's name appears in three consecutive years in the women's singles column.\n\nLet me scan through each row from top to bottom and check if any female names repeat consecutively over three rows.\n\nStarting with 2012: Shen Yanfei\n2011: Feng Tianwei\n2010: Wang Yuegu\n2009: Park Mi-Young\n\nNo repetition here. Moving down:\n\n2008: Zhang Yining is alone, so no consecutive.\n\nLooking further back:\n\n1998: Li Ju\n1997: Wang Chen\n\nNot relevant to Zhang.\n\nWait, earlier years might have different names. Let me go step by step through the years starting from 2000 onwards since that's when Zhang Yining likely would have competed more.\n\nIn 2000: Wang Liqin\n1999: Wang Nan\n1998: Kong Linghui\n\nNot Zhang.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The claim is about three consecutive wins in a row, so the same player winning in three years consecutively.\n\nLooking for any female who has won in three consecutive years. Let's see:\n\nCheck each year and see if the same woman appears in the next two years.\n\nFrom 2008 onwards:\n\n2008: Zhang Yining\n2009: Park Mi-Young\n2010: Wang Yuegu\n\nNo, so Zhang only won once.\n\nLooking for other players who might have done this. For example, looking at Feng Tianwei:\n\nShe won in 2011, but let's see the previous years:\n\n2012: Shen Yanfei\n2011: Feng Tianwei\n2010: Wang Yuegu\n\nNot three in a row.\n\nWhat about Park Mi-Young?\n\n2009: Park Mi-Young\n2010: Wang Yuegu\n\nNope, not consecutive.\n\nLooking at Wang Yuegu:\n\nShe won in 2010. Let's check the next years:\n\n2011: Feng Tianwei, so no.\n\nWang Liqin won in 1998 and 1997. Not three in a row.\n\nLi Ju in 1998: No, she only won once in that year, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently by checking each player's wins over the years.\n\nBut since the table doesn't provide the full history of all players, maybe it's better to focus on whether any other female besides Zhang has three consecutive wins.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about Zhang being the only one who achieved three in a row. So I need to check if any other player did that as well.\n\nWait, another way: look for the same name in three consecutive years in the women's singles column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Liqin\n\nNo repeats here.\n\n- 2001 is not in the table.\n- 2002: Not shown, but maybe not relevant.\n\nWait, looking from 2004 onwards:\n\nAssuming that in 2005, the winner was someone else. But since the table doesn't show all years, perhaps it's limited to what's provided.\n\nIn the given table, the earliest is 1997. So let me list out the women's singles winners starting from 1997:\n\n1997: Lee Eun-sil\n1998: Li Ju\n1999: Wang Nan\n2000: Wang Liqin\n2001: Not shown\n2002: Not shown\n2003: Not shown\n2004: Not shown\n2005: Not shown\n2006: Not shown\n2007: Not shown\n2008: Zhang Yining\n2009: Park Mi-Young\n2010: Wang Yuegu\n2011: Feng Tianwei\n2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nLooking for any female who appears three times in a row.\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998: Lee Eun-sil, then Li Ju. Not the same.\n\nLi Ju in 1998, but next year is Wang Nan. So no.\n\nWang Nan in 1999, then Wang Liqin in 2000. Different names.\n\nThen, from 2011-2012:\n\n2011: Feng Tianwei\n2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nNo repetition.\n\nLooking back to Zhang Yining: she only won once in 2008, so no consecutive wins before or after.\n\nSo, it seems that Zhang Yining has only won once. Therefore, she hasn't won three times in a row.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Zhang Yining be the only female...\" So if no other female has done this, then the claim is true because she's unique even if she hasn't achieved three in a row? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim is stating that Zhang Yining is the only female to have won 3 years in a row. But from the table, it seems no one has done so, including her. Therefore, the statement would be false because there's no one who has achieved three consecutive wins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because no one has done it, but Zhang is not the only one because she hasn't done it either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase: The claim is that Zhang Yining is the only female to have won three times in a row in the women's singles at ITTF Pro Tour.\n\nSo, if no one has ever achieved three consecutive wins, then the statement would be false because it claims she did, but perhaps she hasn't.\n\nAlternatively, if someone else did achieve this, then the claim is false as well.\n\nBut from the table, looking for any player who won in three consecutive years:\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010: Zhang (2008), Park (2009), Wang (2010). Not the same person.\n\nLooking further back:\n\n1997: Lee Eun-sil\n1998: Li Ju\n1999: Wang Nan\n2000: Wang Liqin\n\nNo, different names each year.\n\nSo perhaps no one has done three in a row. Therefore, both Zhang Yining and others (if any) haven't done it. But the claim says she is the only one who did it, which would be incorrect because either she didn't do it or someone else also hasn't done it.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Maybe in 2005 or other years, someone had three in a row, but it's not shown here. Since the table doesn't have all the data, perhaps we can't confirm.\n\nBut given the information provided, which is from 1997 to 2012, no one has won three times in a row.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Zhang Yining is the only female to do so would be incorrect because she hasn't done it either. So the answer would be that the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is correct if it's stating that she's unique without necessarily having done it, but that doesn't make sense. The statement implies she did it three times in a row, which isn't supported by the data given.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the statement is incorrect because neither Zhang Yining nor any other female has achieved three consecutive wins in the women's singles at ITTF Pro Tour based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Zhang Yining is the only female to have won three times consecutively in the women's singles category of the ITTF Pro Tour is **false**. Based on the available data from 1997 to 2012, no player, including Zhang Yining, has achieved three consecutive wins. Therefore, the statement lacks factual basis and does not hold true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because neither Zhang Yining nor any other female has won three times in a row in the women's singles category based on the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the provided HTML table. The claim says, \"Kobe hosts the most ITTF Pro Tour in between 2004 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It's stating that Kobe hosted more ITTF Pro Tour events than any other location during the years from 2004 to 2009. So, I need to look into the table and see if this is supported.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year and location, along with different singles and doubles participants. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'year' and 'location.' But since the claim is about Kobe hosting the most tours, I should focus on the 'location' column to see how often Kobe hosted compared to other locations.\n\nI'll go through each row from 2004 to 2009 to check where the tournaments were held:\n\n- 2004: Kobe\n- 2005: Yokohama\n- 2006: Yokohama\n- 2007: Chiba\n- 2008: Yokohama\n- 2009: Wakayama\n\nFrom this, Kobe hosted in 2004 and also in 2009, but looking at the exact years between 2004 and 2009, it's only two instances. Now, I need to see if any other location hosted more tournaments during these years.\n\nWait, the claim is about \"the most,\" so I need to count how many times each location hosted. From the data:\n\n- Kobe: 2004, 2009 (2 times)\n- Yokohama: 2005, 2006, 2008 (3 times)\n- Chiba: 2007 (1 time)\n- Wakayama: 2009 (1 time)\n\nSo, Yokohama hosted more tournaments in the given period than Kobe. This suggests that Kobe did not host the most ITTF Pro Tour events between 2004 and 2009; instead, Yokohama hosted more.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there are other locations with higher counts or if any location hosted more than Yokohama. From the table, it seems Yokohama is the clear leader in hosting during those years. Therefore, Kobe did not host the most.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\n- 2004: Kobe\n- 2005: Yokohama\n- 2006: Yokohama\n- 2007: Chiba\n- 2008: Yokohama\n- 2009: Wakayama\n\nSo, that's three times for Yokohama and two for Kobe. So, the claim is false because Kobe hosted fewer than Yokohama in this period.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"hosted the most,\" so if another location hosted more, then it's false. Thus, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"2 ittf pro tour be host at yokohama in between 1997 and 2012\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted at Yokohama somewhere between 1997 and 2012. So, I need to check if there's any event in Yokohama during those years where ITTF events took place.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various tournaments from the year 1998 up to 2012. Each row has information about the location, mens singles, womens singles, etc. The locations mentioned include Kobe, Wakayama, Chiba, and Yokohama.\n\nI'll focus on the rows where the location is Yokohama. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- 2008: Yokohama\n- 2007: Chiba\n- 2006: Yokohama\n- 2005: Yokohama\n- 2004: Kobe\n- 2003: Kobe\n- 2002: Kobe\n- 2001: Yokohama\n- 2000: Kobe\n- 1999: Kobe\n- 1998: Wakayama\n\nSo, the years when the location is Yokohama are 2008, 2006, and 2005. The claim mentions \"in between 1997 and 2012,\" which includes these years.\n\nNow, I need to see if any of these events are labeled as ITTF Pro Tour. The table columns for each event include \"year location,\" but it doesn't explicitly state whether it's a Pro Tour event. Wait, actually, the column names like \"mens singles\" and \"womens singles\" might indicate that this is indeed an ITTF tournament. Typically, such events are part of the Pro Tour.\n\nLooking at the rows for Yokohama:\n\n- 2008: No specific mention of ITTF Pro Tour, but the location is Yokohama.\n- 2006: Same here.\n- 2005: Also in Yokohama.\n\nBut I need to confirm if these were indeed ITTF Pro Tour events. Since the table doesn't specify, I might have to infer that any tournament listed under these years and locations with singles and doubles matches is part of the Pro Tour.\n\nWait, actually, the presence of both singles and doubles columns in each row suggests that it's a significant event, likely a Grand Slam or a major ITTF event. Since the claim refers to \"ITTF pro tour,\" which includes events like the World Table Tennis Championships and other tournaments, it's plausible that these are Pro Tour events.\n\nNow, considering that the locations for 2005, 2006, and 2008 in Yokohama have both singles and doubles competitions, it supports the claim that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted there during those years. \n\nAdditionally, the claim specifies \"in between 1997 and 2012.\" The earliest Yokohama event in the table is 1998, but since 1997 is close, maybe they consider it within the timeframe. However, 1998's location is Wakayama, so not directly relevant.\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of ITTF events (as inferred from the singles and doubles columns) in Yokohama during 2005, 2006, and 2008, which fall between 1997 and 2012, the claim seems to be supported.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"2 ittf pro tour be host at yokohama in between 1997 and 2012,\" we analyze the relevant rows in the table where the location is Yokohama. These occur in 2005, 2006, and 2008, all within the specified timeframe. The presence of both singles and doubles competitions suggests these are significant ITTF Pro Tour events.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2005, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2006, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2008, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
