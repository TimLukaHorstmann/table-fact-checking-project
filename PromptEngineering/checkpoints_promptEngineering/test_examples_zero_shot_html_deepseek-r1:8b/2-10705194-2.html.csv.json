    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to check if the claim \"the record of opponent jeremija sander be 8 - 2\" is true based on the provided table. First, I should figure out who \"jeremija sander\" refers to in the context of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there's a fighter named \"Jeremija Sander\" or possibly \"Curtis Stout\" and others. Wait, actually, scanning each row, I spot that there is a fighter with the last name \"Sander\". Let me check: yes, row 6 has a fighter named \"Travis Fowler\", but looking further down, I see row 8 has \"Curtis Stout\", row 14 is \"Bubba Mcdaniel\", and others. Hmm, perhaps I need to look specifically for \"Jeremija Sander\".\n\nWait, the table might have an opponent named \"Jeremija Sander\". Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with columns like \"Opponent\", \"Record Before Fight\", etc. So, I'll check each row to see if there's a fighter named \"Jeremija Sander\" and what their record is before that particular fight.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is someone else, not Jeremija.\n...\nContinuing down, I don't immediately spot \"Jeremija Sander\". Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each row again.\n\nWait, in the table provided, I think I might have misread. Let me check row 9: Opponent is Fabio Leopoldo, record is 7-1. Then row 10: Opponent is Curtis Stout, with a record of 7-0. Row 11: Opponent is Travis Fowler, 6-0.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me make sure. The user mentioned \"opponent jeremija sander\". So, perhaps in the table, one of the opponents is named \"Jeremija Sander\".\n\nLooking again, row 7 has an opponent with record 8-2: \"7 - 1\" for Fabio Leopoldo. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me see each row's \"Opponent\" column and their records:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is someone else, not relevant.\n...\nLooking at the rows, I think I need to identify if any row has \"Jeremija Sander\" as the opponent with a record of 8-2.\n\nWait, perhaps in row 6: Opponent is Harvell Hunter, record 5-0.\nRow 7: Opponent is Fabio Leopoldo, record 7-1.\nRow 8: Opponent is Curtis Stout, record 7-0.\nRow 9: Opponent is Travis Fowler, record 6-0.\nRow 10: Opponent is someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Alternatively, maybe the claim refers to a fighter named \"Jeremija Sander\" whose record is 8-2. So, looking through each row for any fighter with that name and record.\n\nBut in the table, the fighters listed are:\n\n1. Ryan Lopez (1-0)\n2. Chester Lauchner (2-0)\n3. Joe Bunch (3-0)\n4. Bubba Mcdaniel (4-0)\n5. Harvell Hunter (5-0)\n6. Travis Fowler (6-0)\n7. Curtis Stout (7-0)\n8. Travis Stout (7-0)\n9. Fabio Leopoldo (7-1)\n10. Jeremija Sander (has this name in the table? Let me check.)\n\nWait, looking at row 14: Opponent is Joe Bunch with record 3-0.\nRow 15: Opponent is Chester Lauchner, 2-0.\nRow 16: Ryan Lopez, 1-0.\n\nHmm, I'm not seeing \"Jeremija Sander\" as a fighter in this table. Maybe the claim refers to an opponent, so perhaps looking for a row where the opponent has a record of 8-2.\n\nWait, looking at the claim again: it says the \"opponent jeremija sander be 8 - 2\". So, if \"jeremija sander\" is the opponent in one of these fights with a record of 8-2, then the claim would be true.\n\nLooking through each row's \"Opponent\" column:\n\nFor example, row 1: Opponent is someone else.\nRow 7: Opponent is Fabio Leopoldo, 7-1.\nRow 9: Opponent is Curtis Stout, 7-0.\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the table includes a fighter named \"Jeremija Sander\" with a record of 8-2.\n\nBut in the provided table, all fighters have records starting from 1-0 upwards to higher numbers but none at 8-2 that I can see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each row again:\n\nRow 0: Opponent - someone else.\nRow 1: Opponent - someone else.\n...\nContinuing down, I don't see \"Jeremija Sander\" as an opponent with record 8-2.\n\nWait, maybe the table was not fully provided. Alternatively, perhaps \"Jeremija Sander\" is not in the table, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Curtis Stout\" is being referred to as \"Jeremija Sander\", which would be incorrect. Or maybe there's a typo.\n\nWait, in row 10: Opponent is Curtis Stout with record 7-0. So if the claim says the opponent is 8-2, that wouldn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, I don't see any entry where the opponent is \"Jeremija Sander\" with a record of 8-2. Hence, the claim seems to be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the record of opponent jeremija sander be 8 - 2\" is not supported by the provided table. After reviewing each row, there is no entry where \"Jeremija Sander\" is listed as an opponent with a record of 8-2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; there is no record in the table for \"Jeremija Sander\" as an opponent with a 8-2 record.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Jeremija Sanders' opponent's record being 8-4 is true based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table to see if there's an entry for \"Jeremija Sanderson\" or similar. Since the user mentioned \"opponent,\" I should focus on the opponent's side of each fight.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is someone else, not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is Fabio Leopoldo, but his record is 7-1.\n3. Row 2: Opponent is Curtius Stout with a record of 6-0.\n4. Continuing this way might take too long, so maybe I can scan for the name \"Jeremija Sanderson.\"\n\nWait, in row 7 (index 7), the opponent's name is \"travis fowler\" with a record of 5-0. No match yet.\n\nThen, row 10: Opponent is Chester Lauchner, not relevant.\n\nRow 11: Opponent is Ryan Lopez, nope.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed it. Let me check again. Oh, in row 8 (index 8), the opponent's name is \"travis fowler\" with a record of 6-0. Hmm, still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking for \"Jeremija Sanderson.\" Let me search each row's opponent column:\n\nRow 2: Fabio Leopoldo - 7-1\nRow 8: Travis Fowler - 5-0 (wait, no, in the table provided, it's row 6 with 6-0 and row 9 with 5-0)\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me look at each opponent:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is someone else.\n- Row 1: Fabio Leopoldo (7-1)\n- Row 2: Curtius Stout (6-0)\n- Row 3: Harvell Hunter (4-0) but n/a for time.\n- Row 4: Bubba Mcdaniel (3-0)\n- Row 5: Joe Bunch (2-0)\n- Row 6: Chester Lauchner (1-0)\n- Row 7: Ryan Lopez (record not shown, perhaps)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list each row's data clearly:\n\nRow Index | Opponent             | Record | Result\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n0 | [Opponent] | [Record] | Win/Loss\n1 | Fabio Leopoldo | 7-1 | Loss via Decision (Split)\n2 | Curtius Stout | 6-0 | Win via KO\n3 | Harvell Hunter | 4-0 | Win, time n/a\n4 | Bubba Mcdaniel | 3-0 | Win via Submission\n5 | Joe Bunch | 2-0 | Win via TKO\n6 | Chester Lauchner | 1-0 | Win via Sub (Verbal)\n7 | Ryan Lopez | Opponent's record? | Win via Sub (Punches)\n... and so on.\n\nWait, in row 7, it says \"opponent\" as Ryan Lopez, but does the table show Ryan Lopez's record? I think not. Then further down:\n\nRow 14: Opponent is Jeremija Sanderson. Wait, no, looking for when the opponent is \"Jeremija Sanderson.\" Let me check each row.\n\nWait, in row 8 (index 8), the name is \"travis fowler\" with a record of 5-0.\nRow 9: Opponent is Harvell Hunter, but he's 4-0.\nHmm, maybe I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for when Jeremija Sanderson is fighting.\n\nWait, actually, in row 8 (index 8), the name is \"travis fowler\" with a record of 5-0. No match yet.\n\nThen, looking further down:\n\nAt index 15: Opponent is someone else.\nIndex 16: Opponent is Fabio Leopoldo again, but already checked.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for the specific row where Jeremija Sanderson's opponent is recorded as 8-4.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nI see that in row 0, it's about another fighter.\nRow 1: Opponent Fabio Leopoldo with 7-1.\nRow 2: Opponent Curtius Stout with 6-0.\nRow 3: Harvell Hunter, 4-0.\nRow 4: Bubba Mcdaniel, 3-0.\nRow 5: Joe Bunch, 2-0.\nRow 6: Chester Lauchner, 1-0.\nRow 7: Ryan Lopez, not shown.\nThen, rows continue with other fighters.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing the row where Jeremija Sanderson's opponent is listed. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table provided doesn't include Jeremija Sanderson fighting against someone with a record of 8-4, meaning that the claim might be false.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, there is no evidence indicating that Jeremija Sanders' opponent has a record of 8-4. Therefore, the claim appears to be incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is not supported by the data in the table.",
