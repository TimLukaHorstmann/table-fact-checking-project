    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"kazakhstan be award 2 more silver medal than japan\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that Kazakhstan has two more silver medals than Japan. So, I'll need to look for the number of silver medals each country has in the table and compare them.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various nations along with their gold, silver, bronze, and total medal counts. The relevant columns here are \"silver\" and \"nation\". My task is to find the row corresponding to Kazakhstan and Japan and extract their silver medal counts.\n\nI'll scan through each row in the table:\n\n1. Iran: 4 silver medals.\n2. South Korea: 1 silver medal.\n3. Kazakhstan: 3 silver medals.\n4. Qatar: 2 silver medals.\n5. China: 1 silver medal.\n6. Saudi Arabia: 2 silver medals.\n7. Japan: 1 silver medal.\n8. Chinese Taipei: 0 silver medals.\n9. Indonesia: 0 silver medals.\n\nWait, the table has two entries for rank 8. The first is Chinese Taipei with 0 silver medals, and then Indonesia also with 0. But I'm looking for Kazakhstan and Japan. \n\nFrom the above, Kazakhstan has 3 silver medals, and Japan has 1. So, the claim says Kazakhstan has two more than Japan. Let's do the math: 3 (Kazakhstan) minus 1 (Japan) equals 2. That seems to support the claim.\n\nHowever, I should double-check each country's silver medal count to ensure accuracy. For Kazakhstan, it's listed as 3 in row 3, and for Japan, it's 1 in row 7. So yes, the difference is indeed two medals.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the table, there are two entries with rank 8: Chinese Taipei and Indonesia both have 0 silver medals. Does this affect anything? No, because we're focusing on Kazakhstan and Japan, so those rows are irrelevant to the claim.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there might be any other interpretations or possible mistakes. For instance, is there a chance that I misread the number of medals for either country? Let me verify:\n\n- Kazakhstan: Silver = 3\n- Japan: Silver = 1\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 - 1 equals 2, meaning Kazakhstan has two more silver medals than Japan.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, the claim is supported and should be considered TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the \"silver\" column for both Kazakhstan and Japan in the table. Kazakhstan has 3 silver medals, while Japan has 1, which is a difference of 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"4 out of 9 nations receive no gold medals\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total. Each row represents a nation with their medal counts.\n\nThe claim says that 4 out of 9 nations have no gold medals. So, I need to count how many nations have zero golds.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Iran - gold is 9 \u2192 has gold\n2. South Korea - gold is 2 \u2192 has gold\n3. Kazakhstan - gold is 1 \u2192 has gold\n4. Qatar - gold is 1 \u2192 has gold\n5. China - gold is 1 \u2192 has gold\n6. Saudi Arabia - gold is 0 \u2192 no gold\n7. Japan - gold is 0 \u2192 no gold\n8. Chinese Taipei - gold is 0 \u2192 no gold\n9. Indonesia - gold is 0 \u2192 no gold\n\nWait, the table shows ranks from 1 to 8 and then a \"total\" row. So, there are 8 nations with their own rows, but the claim refers to 9 nations. That might be confusing.\n\nLet me count again. The rank goes up to 8, then the total is another row. So, there are 8 nations listed before the total. But the claim says 4 out of 9, which implies there's a ninth nation beyond the initial 8. However, looking at the table, the last data row before \"total\" is rank 8 (Indonesia). The next rows are the totals.\n\nSo, in the table provided, there are only 8 nations listed. If the claim refers to 9 nations, maybe it's including a ninth one that's not shown here, like another country not in the list. But based solely on the given data, we have 8 rows with nation names, so the total number of nations is 8 plus potentially others, but the table doesn't show them.\n\nWait, no. The initial rank starts at 1 and goes to 8, then there's a row for \"total\". So, it's only 9 rows in total, including the totals. But the first eight are the individual nations. So, the claim says 4 out of 9 receive no gold medals.\n\nLooking at the 8 nations:\n\n- Saudi Arabia: 0 gold\n- Japan: 0 gold\n- Chinese Taipei: 0 gold\n- Indonesia: 0 gold\n\nThat's 4 nations with zero gold medals in their respective rows. So, based on the table, it seems accurate that 4 out of 9 have no gold.\n\nBut wait, the rank goes up to 8, so there are 8 nations before the totals. If the claim is about 9 nations, maybe including the \"total\" row? But the \"total\" isn't a nation. So perhaps the confusion is in how the table is structured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total includes all nations, but in this case, the table shows only 8 nations, so the ninth would be missing. However, the data provided doesn't include a ninth nation beyond the initial 8 plus the totals.\n\nBut looking at the claim again: \"4 out of 9 nations receive no gold medal.\" If we consider that there are 8 nations in the table (ranks 1-8), plus possibly another one not shown, making it 9, but based on the data given, only 8 have been listed.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML code, I see two rows with rank 8: Chinese Taipei and Indonesia. That's a mistake because each nation should have a unique rank. So, in reality, there are 7 unique ranks before the total row. Then, the totals row is separate.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct number of nations listed is 9 (from rank 1 to 8 plus the total), but that can't be right because the total isn't a nation. Therefore, it's likely a typo in the table, having two rows with rank 8, which might mean that there are only 7 unique nations plus some duplicates.\n\nBut regardless of that confusion, based on the given data, I have to determine if the claim is true or false using the information provided in the table. The relevant cells would be those where gold is zero.\n\nIn the table, the rows with rank 6 (Saudi Arabia), 7 (Japan), 8 (Chinese Taipei), and another row with rank 8 (Indonesia) all have gold as 0. So that's four nations: Saudi Arabia, Japan, Chinese Taipei, Indonesia.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are indeed 4 nations out of those listed in the table that received no gold medals.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"4 out of 9 nations receive no gold medal\" is true based on the given HTML table:\n\n1. **Identify relevant data**: Look for cells where the 'gold' column is 0.\n2. **Count occurrences**: There are 4 such rows (Saudi Arabia, Japan, Chinese Taipei, Indonesia).\n\nThe claim is supported by these four instances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the 5th ranked nation receives more bronze medals than the 4th ranked nation.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has a header with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. Then there are nine rows of data, plus a total row.\n\nI need to identify where the 5th and 4th ranked nations are in the table. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Iran - rank 1\nRow 2: South Korea - rank 2\nRow 3: Kazakhstan - rank 3\nRow 4: Qatar - rank 4\nRow 5: China - rank 5\nRow 6: Saudi Arabia - rank 6\nRow 7: Japan - rank 7\nRow 8: Chinese Taipei - rank 8\nRow 9: Indonesia - rank 8 (wait, that's two rows with rank 8? That might be a typo, but I'll go with it)\nRow 10: Total\n\nSo the 5th ranked nation is China, and the 4th ranked nation is Qatar. The claim says China has more bronze medals than Qatar.\n\nLooking at their bronze counts:\n- China: 4 bronze\n- Qatar: 2 bronze\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. If China has 4 and Qatar has 2, then yes, China has more. But wait, the user said \"receives more bronze medal\" so it's singular. Bronze is plural in the table, but I think it just means the total number.\n\nSo according to this, China (5th) has more bronze medals than Qatar (4th). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check the relevant cells. The user wants the cells that are relevant for verification. So I need to get the row indices and column names of the 5th and 4th ranked nations' bronze counts.\n\nChina is rank 5, so row index 5 (if we start counting from 0). Wait, no, in the table, the first row after thead is row 1? Or does it start at 0?\n\nLooking back, the user's example has relevant_cells as [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}], so probably they are considering the rows starting from 0.\n\nSo in the given table, the first row after thead is index 0. So:\n\nRow 0: Iran (rank 1)\nRow 1: South Korea (rank 2)\n...\nRow 4: Qatar (rank 5? Wait no, rank 4 is Qatar.\n\nWait, let me list them with their ranks and indices:\n\nRank | Nation       | Row Index\n1    | Iran        | 0\n2    | South Korea | 1\n3    | Kazakhstan  | 2\n4    | Qatar       | 3\n5    | China       | 4\n6    | Saudi Arabia|5\n7    | Japan       |6\n8    | Chinese Taipei|7\n8    | Indonesia  |8\nTotal | ...        |9\n\nWait, that can't be right because rank starts at 1. So the rows after thead are:\n\ntr>td 1</td><td>iran</td>... which is row index 0.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: Rank 1 - Iran\nRow 1: Rank 2 - South Korea\nRow 2: Rank 3 - Kazakhstan\nRow 3: Rank 4 - Qatar\nRow 4: Rank 5 - China\nRow 5: Rank 6 - Saudi Arabia\nRow 6: Rank 7 - Japan\nRow 7: Rank 8 - Chinese Taipei\nRow 8: Rank 8 - Indonesia\n\nSo the 5th ranked nation is China, which is row index 4.\n\nThe 4th ranked nation is Qatar, row index 3.\n\nNow, their bronze medal counts:\n\nChina (row 4): 4 bronze\nQatar (row 3): 2 bronze\n\nSo China has more. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that in the table, it's indeed China and Qatar. Let me check the table again.\n\nYes, row 5 is rank 6: Saudi Arabia; row 4 is rank 5: China.\n\nSo their bronze medals are:\n\nChina: 4\nQatar: 2\n\nThus, China has more than Qatar. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be the bronze column for both nations. So for row index 3 (Qatar), bronze column; and row index 4 (China), bronze column.\n\nSo in JSON, that's:\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"bronze\"}\n]\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is TRUE with these relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"Saudi Arabia receive less total medal than the 5th ranked country.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which countries are in the 5th and maybe other relevant rankings. Looking at the table, it's ordered from rank 1 to 8. So the 5th ranked country is China because looking at the table:\n\nRank 1: Iran\nRank 2: South Korea\nRank 3: Kazakhstan\nRank 4: Qatar\nRank 5: China\n\nSo the 5th ranked country has a total of 6 medals according to the table.

Their total medals are 2 as per the 'total' column. \n\nNow, comparing Saudi Arabia's total (2) with China's total (6). The claim says Saudi Arabia has less than the 5th ranked country. Since 2 is indeed less than 6, that seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no mistakes in the table reading.

The claim says, \"4 nation be award less than 2 bronze medal.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim means. \"4 nation\" probably refers to a specific country ranked 4th in the table. Looking at the table, there's a row with rank 4 and the nation is Qatar. So, I'm focusing on Qatar here.\n\nNext, \"be awarded less than 2 bronze medals.\" In the table, each row has columns for gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. For Qatar (rank 4), the number of bronze medals is listed as 2. Wait, that's exactly 2, not less than 2. So, if the claim says \"less than 2,\" but the actual number is equal to 2, then the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check other rows just in case. The table has rank 4 as Qatar with bronze=2, and another row for Indonesia at rank 8 also with bronze=1.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that every single nation listed in the table has received at least one gold medal. So, my task is to check each row (which represents a nation) and see if there's at least one gold medal in their record.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. The key column here is \"gold\" because the claim is about receiving at least one gold medal. So, I'll focus on the \"gold\" column for each row except the header and the total row.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Iran: They have 9 gold medals. That's more than one, so they're good.\n2. South Korea: 2 gold medals. Also meets the requirement.\n3. Kazakhstan: 1 gold medal. Exactly one, which is acceptable.\n4. Qatar: 1 gold medal. Same as above.\n5. China: 1 gold medal. They have one, so that's fine.\n6. Saudi Arabia: 0 gold medals. Hmm, this is where it gets tricky. If a nation has zero golds, does that mean they didn't receive any? Yes, so this is a problem.\n7. Japan: 0 gold medals. Another issue here because the claim requires at least one.\n8. Chinese Taipei: 0 gold medals. Same as above.\n9. Indonesia: 0 gold medals. Again, no golds.\n\nWait, but looking closely, I see that rows 6 to 9 are for Saudi Arabia, Japan, Chinese Taipei, and Indonesia. Each of these has a \"gold\" value of 0. That means none of them received any gold medals.\n\nNow, the claim says \"every nation,\" which would include all the countries listed. Since there are some nations with zero golds, the claim isn't true for those specific rows.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to check each row's \"gold\" column except the total. The relevant cells are all the \"gold\" columns where the value is less than 1 because that's where the issue lies. Specifically, Saudi Arabia (row 6), Japan (row7), Chinese Taipei (row8), and Indonesia (row9) have zero gold medals.\n\nTherefore, these rows disprove the claim.

The claim is \"kazakhstan be awarded a total of 3 gold medals.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total. Each row represents a nation's performance with their medal counts. The last row is the total, which probably sums up all the medals across nations.\n\nI need to find out if Kazakhstan has been awarded 3 gold medals in total. So I should look at the 'gold' column for Kazakhstan and also consider any other relevant columns that might affect this count.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that Kazakhstan is ranked 3rd. Their row shows: rank=3, nation=kazakhstan, gold=1, silver=3, bronze=2, total=6. So their total medals are 6, which includes one gold medal. The claim says they have a total of 3 gold medals, but according to this, it's only 1.\n\nWait, the claim says \"total of 3 gold medals.\" Does that refer to total medals or just gold? I think it's about the gold medals. So if Kazakhstan has 1 gold medal, the claim is incorrect. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there another row for Kazakhstan? No, each nation is listed once except for a couple at rank=8, but that's China/Chinese Taipei and Indonesia, so no duplication for Kazakhstan. Therefore, Kazakhstan only has 1 gold medal.\n\nSo the claim is false because they have only 1 gold medal, not 3. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant to support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be the one where nation=kazakhstan and the column 'gold', as that's the data point used to verify the count.\n\nI think row_index starts from 0 for Iran (row 1 in rank), but looking at the HTML, the first row after <thead> is Iran with rank=1. So the rows are indexed starting at 1? Or maybe the user counts them as 0-based. Wait, no, in the example given, the answer's relevant_cells start from 0, which implies that the first row (Iran) is index 0.\n\nWait, let me check: the first row after <tbody> starts with rank=1 for Iran, which would be row_index=0 if we start counting from 0. So yes, each tr is a row and their indices are 0-based in the output. So Kazahnstan's row is where rank=3, which is the third tr. Let me count:\n\nFirst row: Iran (index 0)\nSecond: South Korea (1)\nThird: Kazakhstan (2)\nFourth: Qatar (3)\nFifth: China (4)\nSixth: Saudi Arabia (5)\nSeventh: Japan (6)\nEighth: Chinese Taipei (7) and Indonesia (8)\n\nWait, no, the eighth row is split into two? Wait, looking at the HTML:\n\nThere are 9 rows in total. The first is rank=1 to 8, then the last row is rank=\"total\". So Iran is index 0, South Korea 1, Kazakhstan 2, Qatar 3, China 4, Saudi Arabia 5, Japan 6, Chinese Taipei 7, Indonesia 8, and then the total at index 9.\n\nWait no, in the table provided, there are 8 data rows before the total. So:\n\nRow 0: Iran\n1: South Korea\n2: Kazakhstan\n3: Qatar\n4: China\n5: Saudi Arabia\n6: Japan\n7: Chinese Taipei\n8: Indonesia\n\nThen row 9 is the total.\n\nSo for Kazakhstan, it's at index 2, and the column 'gold' is 1.

So, the 5th ranked nation is the one in row 5.\n\nNext, I need to check how many bronze medals this nation has. In the table, each row represents a country and has columns for gold, silver, and bronze medals. For the 5th ranked nation (row 5), according to the table, China has 4 bronze medals.\n\nNow, I should see if this is indeed the least among all nations. To do that, I need to look at all the countries in the table and find out how many bronze medals each has. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Iran: 2\n- South Korea: 0\n- Kazakhstan: 2\n- Qatar: 2\n- China: 4\n- Saudi Arabia: 0\n- Japan: 2\n- Chinese Taipei: 1\n- Indonesia: 1\n\nWait, the total row shows that bronze medals sum up to 14.

Therefore, the claim that the 5th ranked nation receives the least amount of bronze medals is false.\n\nI also need to check if there are any relevant cells. The relevant parts of the table would be the row for the 5th ranked nation and possibly the column for bronze medals. So, the relevant_cells should include row 5 (China) in the bronze column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify that the fifth-ranked nation has the least number of bronze medals.\n\n1. **Identify the 5th ranked nation**: This is China, located in row 5 of the table.\n\n2. **Check the bronze medal count for China**: According to the table, China has 4 bronze medals.\n\n3. **Compare with other nations**: Other countries have bronze counts as follows:\n   - Iran: 2\n   - South Korea: 0\n   - Kazakhstan: 2\n   - Qatar: 2\n   - Saudi Arabia: 0\n   - Japan: 2\n   - Chinese Taipei: 1\n   - Indonesia: 1\n\n4. **Determine the least bronze medals**: The countries with the least are South Korea (0) and Saudi Arabia (0), both having fewer than China's 4.\n\nSince China does not have the least, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells**: The row for China (rank 5) in the bronze column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Saudi Arabia win the most gold medals\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the structure of the table. It has columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total. The rows list different nations along with their medal counts.\n\nThe claim in question is about Saudi Arabia winning the most gold medals. So, my focus should be on finding the number of gold medals Saudi Arabia has won, as well as comparing it to others if necessary.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to Saudi Arabia. Scanning each row:\n\n1. Iran - 9 golds\n2. South Korea - 2 golds\n3. Kazakhstan - 1 gold\n4. Qatar - 1 gold\n5. China - 1 gold\n6. Saudi Arabia - 0 gold\n7. Japan - 0 gold\n8. Chinese Taipei - 0 gold\n9. Indonesia - 0 gold\n\nFrom this, it's clear that Saudi Arabia has won 0 gold medals. Now, to check if they have the most, I need to see if any other nation has fewer or equal. Looking at all the nations:\n\n- Iran: 9 golds (highest)\n- South Korea: 2\n- Kazakhstan: 1\n- Qatar: 1\n- China: 1\n- Saudi Arabia: 0\n- Japan: 0\n- Chinese Taipei: 0\n- Indonesia: 0\n\nNo nation has fewer than 0, so technically, Saudi Arabia ties with the lowest. The claim says they \"win the most,\" but \"most\" implies having more than others. Since no one has negative medals, and everyone has at least 0, it's incorrect to say they have the most.\n\nAlternatively, if \"most\" were interpreted as having the highest count among those with positive medals, then Saudi Arabia would not qualify since Iran has the most. But in general, the phrasing suggests a comparison against all, which includes those who might have zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Saudi Arabia does not have more golds than others; they actually have none.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"4 nation be award only 1 total medal.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim to understand exactly what it's saying. It seems like the claim is trying to state that four specific nations have a total of only one medal each. So, for each of these four countries, their 'total' column value should be 1.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I'll check each row where the rank is 4 because the claim mentions \"4 nation.\" Wait, no, actually, the claim says \"4 nations,\" so it's referring to the first four ranks. So, the four top-ranked countries are Iran (rank 1), South Korea (2), Kazakhstan (3), and Qatar (4). \n\nI need to look at each of these four countries' 'total' medal counts. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with Iran: Their total medals are 15. That's definitely more than 1, so that already contradicts the claim. But since the claim specifies \"4 nation be award only 1 total medal,\" I need to check all four to see if they all have a total of 1 or not.\n\nWait, maybe I misread it. The claim says \"4 nation be awarded only 1 total medal.\" So perhaps each of these four nations has a total of 1 medal. Let me check:\n\n- Iran: Total is 15 \u2192 Not 1.\n- South Korea: Total is 3 \u2192 Not 1.\n- Kazakhstan: Total is 6 \u2192 Not 1.\n- Qatar: Total is 5 \u2192 Not 1.\n\nSo, all four have more than one total medal each. That would make the claim false because it's asserting that these four nations have only 1 total medal each, which isn't true.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rank vs. the nations. The table has ranks from 1 to 8 and then the totals. So the \"4 nation\" refers to the four top-ranked countries. Each of them should have only one total medal according to the claim.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n- Rank 1: Iran, Total 15 \u2192 Not 1.\n- Rank 2: South Korea, Total 3 \u2192 Not 1.\n- Rank 3: Kazakhstan, Total 6 \u2192 Not 1.\n- Rank 4: Qatar, Total 5 \u2192 Not 1.\n\nAll of these totals are more than one. Therefore, the claim is false because none of these four nations have only one total medal.\n\nSo, to answer, I need to check which cells are relevant. The 'total' column for each of these four nations must be checked. So for Iran (row_index 0), South Korea (1), Kazakhstan (2), and Qatar (3), their 'total' value is in the 'total' column.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would include all four rows for the 'total' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that each of the top four-ranked nations has only one total medal. However, checking each of these nations (Iran, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Qatar) shows their total medals are 15, 3, 6, and 5 respectively\u2014none equal to one. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
