    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the Andrean Fighting '59ers is true or false based on the given table. The claim states that their enrollment is 587.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the HTML table provided. It has several columns: school, location, mascot, enrollment, and others like ihsaa class and county. \n\nThe relevant part for the claim is the \"enrollment\" column because it directly relates to the number mentioned in the claim. So, I need to find the row where the school is Andrean.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n- Row 0: School is andrean.\n- Rows 1 to 6: Other schools like griffith, highland, etc., so they can be ignored for this specific claim.\n\nNow, focusing on row 0, I check the \"enrollment\" column. The value there is 587. That matches exactly with the claim made.\n\nSo, the enrollment figure of 587 is indeed present in the table under the Andrean school's enrollment data. Therefore, the claim should be considered TRUE.\n\nI don't need to look at other columns like location or mascot because the claim is only about enrollment. The rest might be relevant for other claims but not necessary here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
