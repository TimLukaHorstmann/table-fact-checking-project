Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying and then check it against the table.\n\nFirst, the term \"first episode\" refers to the initial episode in a series. In the table, episodes are labeled as one, two, three, four, five. So, the first episode would logically be \"one.\"\n\nNext, the date given in the claim is 7 / 02 / 08. Looking at the table, I need to find which row corresponds to the first episode and then check the date listed there.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: episode one with date 7/02/08.\n- Row 1: episode two on 7/21/08.\n- And so on up to row 4 for episode five on 8/05/08.\n\nSo, the first episode is in row index 0. The date for this row matches exactly what's stated in the claim: 7 / 02 / 08.\n\nTherefore, both the episode number and the date align with the first episode as per the table. There's no conflicting information elsewhere that would suggest another episode aired earlier or on that specific date.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"espn2 air episode one on 7 / 21 / 08\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim and comparing it with the information in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"espn2,\" which refers to the network. Looking at the table, all episodes listed are airing on ESPN2, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim says \"air episode one.\" So I'm looking for episode one in the 'episode' column. Scanning through each row, the first row has 'one' as the episode number. That's relevant because it's about episode one.\n\nThe date mentioned is 7 / 21 / 08. I need to see if there's a row with this exact date. Looking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: Date is 7/02/08\n- Row 1: 7/21/08 (This matches)\n- Row 2: 7/31/08\n- Rows 3 and 4: 8/05/08\n\nSo, row 1 has the date 7/21/08. Therefore, episode one aired on that date.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim states that ESPN2 aired episode one on 7/21/08. The table confirms that there's an episode named 'one' airing on that exact date on ESPN2. So the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",
