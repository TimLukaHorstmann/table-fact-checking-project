    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"monika cassens play women 's single , at the czechoslovakian international , 4 time\". I need to verify if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n1. Monika Cassens plays women's singles.\n2. She participated in the Czechoslovakian International.\n3. She did so four times.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find cells that mention Monika Cassens and see if she played women's singles at the Czechoslovakian International multiple times.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Monika Cassens\" in each row of the table. Let me go through each year from 1984 onwards since the claim mentions four times, which likely refers to four appearances.\n\nStarting with 1990: In the row for 1990 (row index 17), I see columns like 'Name', 'Singles', 'Doubles'. The 'Name' column has \"Monika Cassens\". Now, checking if she participated in singles. Yes, in that row, under 'Singles', it says \"1st round\". So this is one appearance.\n\nNext, 1991: In row index 20, the 'Name' is \"Monika Cassens\" again. The 'Singles' column shows \"Q2\". So another appearance, making it two times so far.\n\nMoving to 1992: Row index 22, 'Name' is also \"Monika Cassens\". Here, under 'Singles', it's \"1st round\". That's three appearances.\n\nNow, checking for a fourth time. Going back through the years: 1984 (row 27) has \"Monika Cassens\" in 'Name' but I don't see a specific mention of singles; maybe she didn't participate that year or perhaps her participation isn't detailed here. Similarly, other rows might not show her participating again.\n\nWait, looking at row 17 (1990), 20 (1991), and 22 (1992) are three times. The table doesn't explicitly show a fourth appearance for Monika Cassens in the Czechoslovakian International in singles. Maybe she didn't participate four times as claimed. Or perhaps I missed a row.\n\nLet me double-check rows beyond 1993, but the provided table stops at 1992 (row index 22). If there's no fourth occurrence, then the claim is FALSE because it states \"4 time\" which would require four appearances, but only three are visible here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"time\" refers to something else, like years or overall participation, but based on the table, she played singles at least three times. Without a clear indication of a fourth, the claim might be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "edgar michalowski play men 's single , 3 time at the czechoslovakian international",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"edgar michalowski play men 's single , 3 time at the czechoslovakian international\" is true based on the provided table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe name \"edgar michalowski\" seems to be a person, likely involved in some sport or competition, possibly tennis given the mention of \"single.\" The term \"play men's single\" probably refers to participating in men's singles matches. The part about \"3 time at the czechoslovakian international\" suggests that Edgar Michalowski participated three times in an event called the Czechoslovakian International.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it seems to list participants or winners over several years from 1986 onwards. Each row has multiple columns with names, possibly indicating different categories or aspects like singles, doubles, mixed doubles, etc. The columns might include things like \"Name\" and perhaps \"Event\" or \"Category.\"\n\nI need to check each relevant row to see if there's a match for \"Edgar Michalowski\" in the context of men's singles three times at the Czechoslovakian International.\n\nStarting from 1986, I'll go through each year. For each row, I should look for \"Edgar Michalowski\" and check which column (if any) corresponds to men's singles or if there's a mention of the event name.\n\nWait, looking at the table structure, the columns don't seem to have headers like \"Men's Singles.\" Instead, they might just list names under different categories. Maybe each cell represents a participant in a specific category for that year. So, I need to look for a cell containing \"Edgar Michalowski\" and see if it appears three times in the men's singles column.\n\nBut since the table is extensive and I don't have access to all the data, maybe I can focus on rows where \"Edgar Michalowski\" is present. If he appears three times in the same category (probably the same column each time), that would support the claim.\n\nLooking through the years:\n\n- 1986: No mention of Edgar Michalowski.\n- 1987: He's listed, but I don't see \"Men's Singles\" as a column, so maybe he participated in another category.\n- 1988: Not seeing him here.\n- 1989: No.\n- 1990: Maybe? No, not sure.\n- Wait, perhaps the columns after \"Year\" are different categories. For example, in each row, the participants might be listed under various events like singles, doubles, mixed doubles, etc.\n\nSo, for each year, if Edgar Michalowski is present, I need to see which category he was in. If he's listed three times in the same category (like Men's Singles) across different years, that would support the claim.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact column names corresponding to each event, it's tricky. Maybe \"Men's Single\" or similar is a column name. Alternatively, the last column might indicate the event type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row lists participants in different events for that year, and if Edgar Michalowski appears three times in a specific event column across three years, that would be relevant.\n\nBut since I can't see all the data, maybe the approach is to look for any occurrence of his name and check the context. If he's listed three times as a participant in men's singles at the Czechoslovakian International, then it's true.\n\nWait, but the table might only list winners or top performers, not all participants. So perhaps \"Czechoslovakian International\" is an event where he participated multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents a different year, and within each row, there are columns for different categories. So in 1986, if Edgar Michalowski is present in the Men's Singles column, that's one time. Then again in 1987, another time, and so on until three times.\n\nBut without seeing all the rows, it's hard to confirm. However, I can look for any occurrence of his name. Let me scan through each row:\n\nLooking at 1986: Participants include Andrey Antropov, Catharina Andersson, Michal Mal\u00fd, etc. No Edgar Michalowski.\n\n1987: Michal Mal\u00fd and others, no Edgar.\n\n1988: Klaus Fischer and Elena Rybkina, no Edgar.\n\n1989: Tomasz Mendrek and others, no.\n\n1990: Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen and Camilla Martin, no.\n\n1991: Robert Liljequist and Irina Serova, no.\n\n1992: Tomasz Mendrek and Irina Serova, no.\n\nSo, if he's not appearing in these years, the claim might be false. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the table has more rows beyond 1992. Alternatively, maybe \"Czechoslovakian International\" is a different event where he participated multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns represent different aspects like singles, doubles, mixed, etc., and within each row, participants are listed per category. So, for example, in 1986, under Men's Singles, there might be Edgar Michalowski, but without seeing it, I can't confirm.\n\nGiven that I don't see his name appearing in any of the rows provided, it's possible that he didn't participate in these events as listed. Therefore, the claim might be false based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim based on the provided table. Edgar Michalowski does not appear in the listed rows, making it unlikely that he participated three times at the Czechoslovakian International according to the given data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim appears to be false based on the information provided.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"edgar michalowski play in 2 category , men 's single and mixed double.\" First, I should look through each row of the table provided to find where Edgar Michalowski is listed.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with years on the left. Each row has several columns like Player1, Player2, etc., but the headers aren't clearly defined beyond that. So I need to scan each year to see if Edgar Michalowski appears in any of the player cells.\n\nStarting from 1980 onwards, I check each year until I find his name. In the 1992 row, I spot \"Edgar Michalowski\" under Player1. Now, I need to verify which categories he played in that specific year.\n\nIn 1992, Edgar is listed in the Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles. The claim says he played in two categories: men's single and mixed double. That matches exactly what's stated in the table for 1992.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the row for 1992, specifically the columns where his name appears under Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"edgar michalowski play in 2 category , men 's single and mixed double,\" we need to check if he played both Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles in any given year.\n\n1. **Find Edgar Michalowski in the table**: Scanning each row, Edgar is listed in the 1992 row as Player1.\n   \n2. **Check the categories for 1992**: In that year, he plays Men's Singles and Mixed Doubles.\n\nSince both categories are confirmed for 1992, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1992, \"column_name\": \"Men's Singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1992, \"column_name\": \"Mixed Doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"Monika Cassens has a total of 3 different partners in the women's double category.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. Monika Cassens is a name that appears in the table multiple times as part of pairs in various years. So, I guess each time she's paired with someone else, that counts as a partner. The claim is saying that across all these pairings, there are exactly three distinct partners.\n\nI should look through the table and list out all the different partners Monika Cassens has been paired with in the women's doubles category. Then, I can count them to see if it's three or more.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nStarting from 1984:\n- 1984: Partner is Viktoria Pron.\n- 1985: Partner is Grethe Mogensen.\n- 1986: No entry for Monika Cassens, maybe she wasn't playing that year?\nWait, I need to make sure. Looking at each row:\n\nI think it's better to list all the partners where Monika Cassens is part of a pair in the women's doubles.\n\nSo let me go through each row and note her partners:\n\n1984: Viktoria Pron (1)\n1985: Grethe Mogensen (2)\n1986: No partner listed, maybe she didn't play that year.\n1987: Petra Michalowsky (3)\n1988: No partner? Wait, the table shows \"monika cassens\" in 1988. Hmm, looking again, the columns are probably for different categories, but since it's women's doubles, each row should have two players. So in 1988, is there a partner?\n\nLooking at the 1988 row: monika cassens and elena rybkina? Or maybe she played with someone else.\n\nWait, I think I might be misinterpreting the table. The columns are probably for different events or pairings each year, so each cell represents a pairing in a specific category.\n\nWait no, perhaps each row is a year, and each column is a different event or category within that year, like mixed doubles, women's doubles, men's doubles, etc.\n\nBut the claim is specifically about the women's double category. So I need to identify which columns correspond to women's doubles in each row.\n\nLooking at the table headers, there are multiple columns per row, probably indicating different events or pairings. So for each row (year), there are several pairings in different categories.\n\nSo I think in each row, the relevant column would be the one labeled \"Women's Double\" or something similar, but looking at the provided table, it seems that the columns aren't specified, so maybe all cells in a row are different events or partners.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the table is structured such that for each year, there are multiple pairings across different categories. So the 'monika cassens' appears as part of a pair in various years and categories.\n\nBut since the claim is about women's doubles, I need to look at which rows have monika cassens in the women's double category.\n\nSo perhaps I should go through each row and see if monika cassens is listed with another player under women's doubles for that year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell is a pairing in a specific category. So for example, in 1984, she's paired with Viktoria Pron in women's doubles.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't specify which column is which event. So perhaps all columns in a row are different pairings across events or different partners in different categories.\n\nBut without knowing which column corresponds to women's doubles, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe each year has multiple cells representing different partnerships across various categories, and we need to count how many times monika cassens is paired with others in the women's double category.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"women's double\" refers to a specific event within each year, so for example, in 1984, the women's doubles might be one of the pairings that year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that monika cassens has been paired with three different partners in the women's double category across her career.\n\nSo to find out, I need to list all her partners in the women's double and count if it's exactly three.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n1984: Partner is Viktoria Pron\n1985: Partner is Grethe Mogensen\n1987: Partner is Petra Michalowsky\n1990: No partner listed that year? Or maybe she didn't play.\nWait, 1990 row has her as \"monika cassens\", but the other cell is \"trine johansson\". So perhaps in 1990, she's playing with Trine Johansson.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's women's doubles or something else. Maybe I need to check each year where she's paired and whether it's women's doubles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are for different events, like mixed, men's, women's. So in each row (year), there are multiple pairings across these categories.\n\nSo for example, in 1984, \"monika cassens\" is in a pairing with someone else, possibly in women's doubles that year. Then in other years, she has different partners.\n\nBut without knowing which column is which event, it's hard to be precise. Maybe the columns are labeled, but in the provided data, they're not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps each cell in the row represents a pairing in a specific category, and across rows, we can track her partners in women's doubles.\n\nSo for example:\n\n1984: Partner is Viktoria Pron (assuming women's doubles)\n1985: Partner is Grethe Mogensen (assuming women's doubles)\n1987: Partner is Petra Michalowsky (assuming women's doubles)\n1990: Partner is Trine Johansson (assuming women's doubles)\n\nBut that would give her four partners, which contradicts the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some years she didn't play women's doubles or didn't have a partner listed.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n1984: Viktoria Pron\n1985: Grethe Mogensen\n1986: No partner mentioned for Cassens\n1987: Petra Michalowsky\n1988: No partner? Or maybe paired with someone else.\n1989: Not present\n1990: Trine Johansson\n1991: Maybe not listed.\n\nSo if we count the partners she had in women's doubles, that would be:\n\nViktoria Pron (1984)\nGrethe Mogensen (1985)\nPetra Michalowsky (1987)\nTrine Johansson (1990)\n\nThat's four partners. So the claim says three, which would make it false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing some years or miscounting.\n\nWait, in 1988: \"monika cassens\" is paired with elena rybkina? Or someone else?\n\nLooking at the row for 1988:\n\n- monika cassens\n- elena rybkina\n\nSo perhaps she played with Elena Rybkinska that year. So that's another partner.\n\nSimilarly, in 1990: Trine Johansson.\n\nWait, but I'm assuming all these are women's doubles. Maybe not all of them are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns represent different events each year, so for example, in 1984, there might be mixed doubles and women's doubles. So monika cassens could have played in both categories that year with different partners.\n\nBut without knowing which column is which event, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row (year) has multiple pairings across different events, so for 1984, she has two pairings: one in mixed doubles and one in women's doubles. So her partner in women's doubles that year would be Viktoria Pron.\n\nSimilarly, in 1985, she might have played with Grethe Mogensen in women's doubles.\n\nIn 1987, Petra Michalowsky.\n\nIn 1990, Trine Johansson.\n\nSo four partners: Viktoria, Grethe, Petra, Trine. So that's four, not three. Therefore, the claim is false because she has more than three partners.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some years she didn't have a women's doubles partner listed, so perhaps only three.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n1984: V\n1985: G\n1987: P\n1990: T\n\nThat's four. So unless I'm miscounting or missing something, it seems like she has more than three.\n\nWait, maybe in 1988 and 1989, she didn't have a partner listed in women's doubles, so those don't count. But in 1990, she does have a partner. So that makes four.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because she has four partners.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Monika Cassens has three different partners in the women's double category. After analyzing the table, it's clear that she has been paired with at least four distinct partners: Viktoria Pron (1984), Grethe Mogensen (1985), Petra Michalowsky (1987), and Trine Johansson (1990). This surpasses the claim of three partners.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false. Monika Cassens has had more than three different partners in the women's double category.",

It mentions a partnership between Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens in the mixed doubles category across four years: 1975, 1980, 1981, and an additional three-year period (which I assume should be consecutive, but it's not specified, so maybe that part isn't critical).\n\nI'll start by looking for their names in the table. Let me scan each row's Partner 1 and Partner 2 columns.\n\nLooking at row by row:\n\n- 1975: Partner 1 is \"Monika Cassens\" and Partner 2 is \"Edgar Michalowski.\" So they teamed up here, which matches the years mentioned (1975 being one of them). The column for this row is \"Partner 1\" and \"Partner 2.\"\n\n- 1980: Again, Partner 1 is Monika Cassens and Partner 2 is Edgar Michalowski. So they team up again in 1980.\n\n- 1981: Same pairing\u2014Monika Cassens and Edgar Michalowski. They team up once more in 1981.\n\nI notice that the claim mentions 1975, 1980, 1981, and an unspecified three-year period. However, based on the table data provided, their partnerships are only recorded in these specific years: 1975, 1980, and 1981. There's no indication of a three-year consecutive period beyond that. It could be that the \"3 year\" part is a mistake or perhaps refers to something else not shown in the table.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if there are any other instances where they team up beyond these years. Scanning the rest of the rows up to 1992, I don't see them appearing together again except for those three specific years.\n\nSince all the specified years (1975, 1980, 1981) do show a partnership between Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens, the claim is supported in these instances. However, the mention of a \"3 year\" period is unclear because there's no data indicating they teamed up for three consecutive years beyond those already listed.\n\nGiven that all the required team-up years are present and verified by checking the relevant cells in the table, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1975,\n      \"column_name\": \"Partner 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1980,\n      \"column_name\": \"Partner 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1981,\n      \"column_name\": \"Partner 1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"edgar michalowski never play any match at the czechoslovakian international , single or double\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It asserts that Edgar Michalowski did not participate in any matches at the Czechoslovakian International, whether as a singles player or part of a doubles team. So my task is to check the table and see if there's any evidence of him competing in such events.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1985 onwards, with columns for Men Singles, Women Singles, Men Doubles, and Women Doubbles. My focus should be on these four columns because they relate directly to matches or competitions.\n\nI'll go through each year one by one:\n\nStarting in 1986, I see that the men's singles column has \"andrey antropov\" and women's doubles have \"elena rybkina.\" So, not Edgar here. Next, 1987: Michal Mal\u00fd is listed under Men Singles, Bozena Siemieniec for Women Singles, and others, but no Edgar. In 1988, Klaus Fischer in Men Singles and Elena Rybkina in Women Singles\u2014nope.\n\nMoving to 1989: Tomasz Mendrek in Men Singles, Viktoria Pron in Women Singles, and others. No Edgar. Then 1990: Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen, Camilla Martin, etc.\u2014still nothing.\n\nIn 1991, Robert Liljequist in Men Singles, Irina Serova in Women Singles\u2014again, no Edgar. 1992: Tomasz Mendrek again, Irina Serova, and others, but no Michalowski.\n\nNow, looking at the years before that, from 1985 to 1990, I should check if there's any occurrence of \"edgar michalowski.\" Let me scan each year:\n\nWait a second\u2014looking back at the table structure, it seems each row has four columns: Men Singles, Women Singles, Men Doubles, Women Doubbles. Each cell contains a name or a combination like \"poul - erik h\u00f8yer larsen\" etc.\n\nI need to check if any of these names in the relevant columns from 1985 onwards is \"edgar michalowski.\" So I'll go row by row:\n\n1985: Men Singles has \"Poul - Erik H\u00f8yer Lassen,\" Women Singles \"Grethe Mogensen,\" Men Doubles same as singles, Women Doubles \"Hanne Adsb\u00f6l\"\u2014no Edgar.\n\n1986: Men Singles \"Andrey Antropov,\" Women Singles \"Catharina Andersson,\" Men Doubles \"Michal Mal\u00fd Karel Lakom\u00fd,\" Women Doubles \"Lila Galjamova Elena Rybkina\"\u2014still no.\n\n1987: Men Singles \"Michal Mal\u00fd,\" Women Singles \"Bozena Siemieniec,\" Men Doubles \"Heinz Fisher Klaus Fisher,\" Women Doubles \"Monika Cassens\"\u2014no.\n\n1988: Men Singles \"Klaus Fischer,\" Women Singles \"Elena Rybkina,\" Men Doubles \"Stephan Kuhl Robert Neumann,\" Women Doubles \"Petra Michalowsky\"\u2014hmm, wait, in 1988, the Women Doubles column has \"Monika Cassens Petra Michalowsky.\" That's two names. Could one of them be Edgar? No, because the names are Monika and Petra, not Edgar.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread it. Let me check again: In 1988, the Women Doubles cell is written as \"monika cassens petra michalowsky\"\u2014so that's two people. But none of them is Edgar Michalowski.

Let me check from 1985 to 1992. I think I covered all the years provided in the table. So, in none of these columns do I see the name \"Edgar Michalowski.\"\n\nTherefore, since there's no entry for him in the singles or doubles events listed in the table, the claim that he never played any match at the Czechoslovakian International holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis concludes that Edgar Michalowski did not participate in any matches at the Czechoslovakian International based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Monika Cassens plays women's singles at the Czechoslovakian International more times than she plays women's doubles.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is checking. It\u2019s comparing the number of times Monika Cassens played in women's singles against the number of times she played in women's doubles at the Czechoslovakian International tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different year, and there are several columns that might be relevant. The columns include \"Women's Single\" and \"Women's Double.\" I'll need to count how many times Monika Cassens appears in each of these categories across all rows.\n\nI should start by going through each row one by one. For each row, I'll check if the player name is Monika Cassens under both \"Women's Single\" and \"Women's Double.\"\n\nStarting with 1980:\n\n- Year 1980: No Monika Cassens in either singles or doubles.\n  \nNext, 1981: No entries.\n\n1982: No entries.\n\n1983: Same as above.\n\n1984: Looking at the 1984 row, I see \"Monika Cassens\" under \"Women's Single\" but not under \"Women's Double.\" So that's one for singles and zero for doubles in this year.\n\nMoving to 1985: Again, Monika is listed under \"Women's Single,\" but no entry in \"Women's Double.\"\n\n1986: No entries for her.\n\n1987: She appears in \"Women's Single\" again. Checking the doubles column, there's a \"Monika Cassens\" listed here as well. Wait, that might be another player because sometimes names can be similar. Let me double-check. Oh, no, actually, in 1987, under \"Women's Double,\" it's \"Monika Cassens.\" So that would mean she played both singles and doubles in this year.\n\nWait, I need to make sure. The column headers for each row are: Women's Single, Men's Single, Women's Double, Men's Double, etc. So yes, 1987 has her in both singles and doubles.\n\nContinuing:\n\n1988: She is listed under \"Women's Single\" but not in \"Women's Double.\"\n\n1989: No entries for her.\n\n1990: She appears in the \"Women's Single\" column but no doubles entry.\n\n1991: No entries.\n\n1992: She is in singles again, and I don't see her in doubles this time. Wait, looking at 1992's row, under \"Women's Double,\" it says \"irina serova.\" So no Monika here.\n\nNow, adding up the counts:\n\n- In 1984: Singles = 1, Doubles = 0\n- 1985: Singles = 1, Doubles = 0\n- 1987: Singles = 1, Doubles = 1 (Wait, is that correct? Did she play doubles in 1987?)\n\nLooking back at the 1987 row:\n\nYes, \"Monika Cassens\" appears under \"Women's Single\" and also under \"Women's Double.\" So that year, she played both.\n\nSo total singles: 1984 + 1985 + 1987 (if 1987 includes doubles) = Wait, actually, in 1987, if she played doubles, does that mean she appeared twice in the row? Let me check. Each row lists all players per category. So in 1987, she's listed under both singles and doubles.\n\nSo, for singles: years 1984, 1985, 1987 (three times)\nFor doubles: only 1987 (once)\n\nWait no, because each time she plays a tournament, it's either singles or doubles or both. So if in 1987 she played both singles and doubles, that counts as one appearance for singles and one for doubles.\n\nSo total singles appearances: 3\nTotal doubles appearances: 1\n\nThe claim says she plays women's singles more times than women's doubles. Yes, because 3 > 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant:\n\nLooking at each row where Monika Cassens appears in singles or doubles.\n\nRow indices (starting from 0):\n\n1984: row 7? Wait, let me count the rows properly.\n\nWait, the table starts with 1980 as row 0, then 1981 (row 1), up to 1992 as row 12. But I need to check each row to see if Monika is in singles or doubles.\n\nI think it's better to list all the relevant cells:\n\nEach time she plays singles or doubles, the corresponding cell is relevant.\n\nFrom the table analysis:\n\n- 1984: Women's Single\n- 1985: Women's Single\n- 1987: Women's Single and Women's Double\n\nSo in rows 1984 (row index 4?), 1985 (index 5), 1987 (index 9). Wait, I need to clarify the row indices.\n\nWait, the first data row is 1980, which would be row 0. Let me list them out:\n\nRow 0: 1980\nRow 1: 1981\nRow 2: 1982\nRow 3: 1983\nRow 4: 1984\nRow 5: 1985\nRow 6: 1986\nRow 7: 1987\nRow 8: 1988\nRow 9: 1989\nRow 10: 1990\nRow 11: 1991\nRow 12: 1992\n\nSo in row 4 (1984), she's in Women's Single.\n\nRow 5 (1985): same.\n\nRow 7 (1987): both categories.\n\nTherefore, the cells that are relevant are:\n\n- Row 4, column \"Women's Single\"\n- Row 5, column \"Women's Single\"\n- Row 7, columns \"Women's Single\" and \"Women's Double\"\n\nI think that's all. So those four cells (two in row 7) would be the ones to look at.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the analysis of the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim compares Monika Cassens' participation in women's singles versus doubles at the Czechoslovakian International.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - From 1984 to 1992, check each year for her appearances in both categories.\n   \n3. **Count Appearances:**\n   - **Singles:** 1984, 1985, and 1987 (total of 3 times).\n   - **Doubles:** Only 1987 (once).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since singles appearances (3) exceed doubles (1), the claim holds TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells in the Table:**\n\n- Row 4 (1984): Women's Single\n- Row 5 (1985): Women's Single\n- Row 7 (1987): Women's Single and Women's Double\n\nThese cells are key to verifying the claim.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"edgar michalowski play all of his match in mixed double\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for \"edgar michalowski\" in the table. Let me scan each row's first cell, which seems to be a name column. Hmm, I see that row 3 has \"Ernst Michalowski\", not \"Edgar\". Wait, maybe it's a typo or different spelling? But the claim is specifically about Edgar, so if he's not in the table, that might mean something.\n\nAssuming he exists in the table under another name or perhaps I missed him. Let me check again. Looking through each row carefully: rows 0 to 13 have names like Thomas, Kim, Claus, etc., but not Edgar Michalowski. This is confusing because if he's not present, then maybe he didn't play any matches.\n\nWait, the claim says \"play all of his match in mixed double.\" If he never played a match, then he can't have played any in mixed doubles or otherwise. So perhaps I should check if there are any entries where he is involved in matches.\n\nBut since his name doesn't appear in the table, that suggests he might not be listed at all, which could mean either he wasn't part of any matches or the data isn't fully captured. However, without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Edgar Michalowski\" is indeed present but under a different row or column name. Let me check other columns beyond the first one because perhaps his name is in another position. Wait, looking at the table structure, each row has multiple cells after the first, which seem to be players' names or partners.\n\nBut since I don't see \"Edgar Michalowski\" anywhere, it's possible that he wasn't involved in any matches listed here. Therefore, there might not be any relevant cells because his name isn't present.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim would be false because he didn't play any matches in mixed doubles or at all if he's not in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens never partner up in mixed doubles. To check this, I need to look through the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should understand what columns are relevant here. Since we're dealing with partnerships between two people in mixed doubles, I'm looking for a column where partnerships or teams are listed. In the table, there's a \"Partner 1\" and \"Partner 2\" column in each row. These seem to represent who each player is paired with.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to see if Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens are ever listed as partners. Let me start by scanning each row for both names.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In the first few rows, I don't see either of their names.\n- As I go further down, in 1983, row 12, under \"Partner 1\" it says \"erfried michalowsky\", not Edgar. Under \"Partner 2\", it's Monika Cassens. So that's one mention.\n- Then, in row 13, 1984, again \"erfried michalowsky\" is Partner 1 and \"petra michalowsky\" as Partner 2.\n- In row 14, 1985, \"poul - erik h\u00f8yer larsen\" is Partner 1 and \"grethe mogensen\" is Partner 2. Not our people.\n- Moving to 1986, row 15: Michal Mal\u00fd and others; no.\n- 1987, row 16: \"monika cassens\" as Partner 2 with someone else, but not Edgar.\n- 1988, row 17: \"kai abraham\" is Partner 1, not Edgar.\n- 1989, row 18: \"thomas mundt\" and others; no.\n- 1990, row 19: \"christian jacobsen\" and others.\n- 1991, row 20: \"vladislav druzchenko\" etc., not our pair.\n- 1992, row 21: \"hans fischer\" and others.\n\nSo, the only time both Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens appear together is in row 12 (1983). Let's check that again. In row 12, under \"Partner 1\", it says \"erfried michalowsky\", not Edgar. So they aren't partners there. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recheck each occurrence of their names. Maybe I missed where they partner up.\n\nLooking for \"edgar michalowski\" and \"monika cassens\" in the same row as Partners.\n\nIn row 12 (1983), \"Partner 1\" is erfried, not Edgar, and Partner 2 is Monika. So that's one mention of Monika without Edgar.\n\nIs there any row where both are listed as Partners? Let me check each time their names appear.\n\nAnother approach: List all instances where either name appears in the table, then see if they're ever together.\n\nEdgar Michalowski appears in rows 12 and 13:\n\n- Row 12: Partner 1 is erfried, not Edgar. So no.\n- Row 13: Not Edgar.\n\nMonika Cassens appears in multiple rows, often as Partner 2, but I need to see if she's ever Partnered with Edgar.\n\nLooking for \"edgar michalowski\" and \"monika cassens\" in the same row:\n\nI don't see any instance where both are listed together. So they never partner up in mixed doubles according to the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they never partner up is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"Partner 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"Partner 2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"monika cassens have the same partner every time she plays double at the czechoslovakian international.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being claimed here. It seems that whenever Monika Cassens participates in a doubles event at the Czechoslovakian International, her partner remains the same each time. So, I need to check if there are multiple entries where she plays with the same partner.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows as years from 1981 to 1992 and columns for different partners or participants. The first column is 'Partner,' which lists the names of her partners in each year. \n\nI should go through each row where Monika Cassens is involved and check if she has the same partner across those instances. If she consistently plays with the same partner every time, then the claim holds; otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nStarting from 1981: In row 0, her partner is listed as \"Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen.\" Then in 1982 (row 1), again the same name appears. Moving to 1983, it's \"Peter Buch,\" so that's a change. Wait, but wait, looking at row indices: 0 is 1981, 1 is 1982, etc.\n\nWait, no, in the table, each row corresponds to a specific year. So for example, row 0 (1981) shows Monika Cassens playing with Peter Buch. But then in row 1 (1982), she plays with Grethe Mogensen and another name, which I think might be Hanne Adsb\u00f6l? Wait, no, the columns are the partners. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, each row has multiple cells. The first cell is 'Partner,' so for row 0 (1981), the partner is Peter Buch. Then in row 1 (1982), her partner is Grethe Mogensen and Hanne Adsbol? Or perhaps that's two different partners? Wait, no, looking at the table:\n\nIn row 0: Partners are Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen and Grethe Mogensen.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. The columns aren't clearly labeled beyond 'Partner.' Maybe each cell in the Partner column represents her partner for that year or event.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row lists the participants, with the first being her partner. So, in row 0 (1981), she partners with Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen. In row 1 (1982), she partners with Grethe Mogensen and Hanne Adsbol? That seems odd because that would be multiple partners.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table structure. Let me look again: The table has a header row, then each subsequent row is a year from 1981 to 1992. Each row has several columns, but the first column after the headers is 'Partner.' So in row 0 (1981), her partner is Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen. In row 1 (1982), her partner is Grethe Mogensen and Hanne Adsbol? Or maybe it's two separate partners for that year, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each row lists the participants in order, with Monika Cassens being one of them. So, for example, in 1981 (row 0), she is paired with Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen as her partner, and others are also playing. Then in 1982 (row 1), she partners with Grethe Mogensen, and so on.\n\nSo, to check if her partner changes or not, I need to see each row where she is listed and note who her partner is that year.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row where Monika Cassens appears:\n\n- Row 0 (1981): Partner is Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen.\n- Row 1 (1982): Partner is Grethe Mogensen. Wait, but then in 1983 (row 2), her partner is Peter Buch. That's a change from the previous year.\n- In row 4 (1985), she partners with Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen again.\n- Then in row 5 (1986), her partner is Andrey Antropov.\n- Row 7 (1988): Partner is Klaus Fischer.\n- Row 9 (1990): Partner is Christian Jacobsen.\n- Row 10 (1991): Partner is Vladislav Druzchenko.\n- Wait, but looking back at row indices: The years go up to 1992 as row 11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all the rows where Monika Cassens appears:\n\nLooking through each row's 'Partner' column:\n\n- Row 0 (1981): Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen\n- Row 1 (1982): Grethe Mogensen and Hanne Adsbol? Or maybe only Grethe.\n- Wait, perhaps in row 1, the partners are listed as two people: Grethe Mogensen and Hanne Adsbal. But that would mean Monika Cassens is playing doubles with both? That doesn't make sense because you can only have one partner at a time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'Partner' column lists her single partner for each year. So in 1981, she partners with Poul-Erik; in 1982, she partners with Grethe; in 1983, Peter Buch; and so on.\n\nWait, but in row 0 (1981), the partners are Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen and Grethe Mogensen. So maybe that's a doubles team where she is playing with Grethe, or perhaps it's two separate partners for different events? I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row lists all participants, including her partner in the first column. For example:\n\nIn row 0 (1981), she is partnered with Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen.\n\nIn row 1 (1982), she is partnered with Grethe Mogensen and Hanne Adsbal? That seems unlikely because you can't have two partners in doubles unless it's a mixed team, but that might not apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the 'Partner' column as her primary partner each time. So:\n\n- 1981: Poul-Erik\n- 1982: Grethe Mogensen\n- 1983: Peter Buch\n- 1984: Hanne Adsbal\n- 1985: Poul-Erik again\n- 1986: Andrey Antropov\n- 1987: Klaus Fischer\n- 1988: Hanne Adsbal again?\nWait, that doesn't make sense. It seems like her partner changes multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'Partner' column lists her partner for each year. So she plays with different partners each time except when it's the same name. For example:\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n1981: Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen\n\n1982: Grethe Mogensen\n\n1983: Peter Buch\n\n1984: Hanne Adsbal\n\n1985: Poul-Erik again\n\n1986: Andrey Antropov\n\n1987: Klaus Fischer\n\n1988: Hanne Adsbal again?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure because the 'Partner' column seems to sometimes list two names, which might indicate that she played with multiple partners in a single year, but that's unlikely for doubles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row lists her partner for that particular event or tournament. So in 1981, she plays with Poul-Erik; in 1982, Grethe; and so on. \n\nGiven this, her partners vary: Poul-Erik (1981), Grethe (1982), Peter Buch (1983), Hanne Adsbal (1984), Poul-Erik again (1985), Andrey Antropov (1986), Klaus Fischer (1988), Christian Jacobsen (1990), Vladislav Druzchenko (1991).\n\nSo, she has multiple different partners over the years. The only time she repeats a partner is in 1981 and 1985, where Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen is listed again as her partner.\n\nWait, does that mean that in both 1981 and 1985, she played with the same partner? So perhaps in those two years, she was teamed up with Poul-Erik again. That would suggest that in at least one case, she has the same partner twice, but not every time.\n\nSo the claim is that \"she have(s) the same partner every time,\" which implies every single time she plays doubles at this event, her partner doesn't change. But from the table, it's clear that she changes partners multiple times\u2014sometimes with the same person again, like Poul-Erik in 1981 and 1985.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because she does not always have the same partner each time she participates.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made is that Monika Cassens has the same partner every time she plays doubles at the Czechoslovakian International. However, upon reviewing the provided table, it's evident that her partners vary over the years. She teams up with different individuals in consecutive years, such as Poul-Erik H\u00f8yer Larsen in 1981 and again in 1985, but also with others like Grethe Mogensen, Peter Buch, Andrey Antropov, Klaus Fischer, Christian Jacobsen, and Vladislav Druzchenko. This shows that her partner is not consistent across all her appearances.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because Monika Cassens does not consistently have the same partner each time she participates in doubles at the event.",
