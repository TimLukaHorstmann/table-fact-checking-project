    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the HTML table provided. The claim states three specific values: annual ridership in 2012 should be 123219300, rider per mile should be 4056, and there should be 44 stations.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each part of the claim one by one and find the corresponding cells in the table that match these numbers.\n\nStarting with the annual ridership: looking at the 'annual ridership (2012)' column. I need to scan down each row to see if any cell matches 123219300. Scanning through, I notice that the fifth row has this exact number (123,219,300). So, for the first part of the claim, it's verified in the fifth row under 'annual ridership (2012)'.\n\nNext, checking the rider per mile: the second column is 'rider per mile'. Scanning each row again, I find that the fifth row has 4056 as the value here. So, this part matches in the same fifth row but the second column.\n\nLastly, the claim mentions there being 44 stations. The fourth column is labeled 'stations', so I need to look for 44 in that column. Scanning each row's 'stations' cell, none of them say 44. Instead, numbers like 468, 86, 145, and others appear, but not 44.\n\nSince all three conditions must be met for the claim to be TRUE, but only two out of the three are matched in the table, the claim is not fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"annual ridership (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    // No matching station count found\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"5 lines have more than 10,000 riders per mile\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is specifically about the \"lines\" in the table and whether they have ridership numbers exceeding 10,000 per mile. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: annual ridership (2012), rider per mile, opened, stations, and lines. Each row represents data for a particular line. The claim is focusing on the \"lines\" column, so my main focus should be on the \"rider per mile\" figures for each line.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of the 5 lines have a rider per mile value greater than 10,000. So, I'll go through each row where the number of lines is 5 and check their rider per mile numbers. Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"5 lines,\" which probably refers to the count of lines as per the table, not any specific line number. Hmm, actually, looking at the table, each row seems to represent a single line's data. So, for example, rows might correspond to different subway lines or similar transit lines.\n\nWait, but in the HTML table provided, each <tr> is a row representing a line's data. The \"lines\" column gives the number of lines (or perhaps it refers to individual lines). For instance, one row has 24 lines, another has 5, etc. So, the claim might be referring to whether any of the lines (rows) have a rider per mile count exceeding 10,000.\n\nWait, no\u2014the \"lines\" column is one of the columns in the table. The claim says \"5 line[s]\" which probably refers to any row where the number of lines is 5, but that doesn't make much sense because the numbers in the \"lines\" column vary from 1 to 24. Alternatively, maybe it's a translation issue and they meant \"5th\" or some specific line, but more likely, it refers to whether any of the lines (rows) have rider per mile exceeding 10,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that for each line with a certain number of stations or something else. Wait, no\u2014the claim specifically mentions rider per mile and doesn't tie it directly to other columns like annual ridership. So, I think it's about whether any line has rider per mile >10,000.\n\nLooking at the \"rider per mile\" column: let me scan through each row's rider per mile value.\n\nRow 0: 37613 \u2013 no\nRow 1: 9227 \u2013 no\nRow 2: 7095 \u2013 no\nRow 3: 13982 \u2013 no\nRow 4: 4056 \u2013 no\nRow 5: 9172 \u2013 no\nRow 6: 18123 \u2013 yes, that's over 10,000\nWait, row 6 has rider per mile of 18123. So that line meets the criteria.\n\nSimilarly, let me check other rows:\n\nRow 7: 4594 \u2013 no\nRow 8: 9115 \u2013 no\nRow 9: 2904 \u2013 no\nRow 10: 3871 \u2013 no\nRow 11: 3794 \u2013 no\nRow 12: 2606 \u2013 no\nRow 13: 881 \u2013 no\nRow 14: 1071 \u2013 no\n\nSo, only row 6 has rider per mile over 10,000. But the claim says \"5 lines have more than 10000 riders per mile.\" Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Does it mean that there are five lines where each has more than 10k riders/mile? Or does it mean that for each of the five lines, they have more than 10k?\n\nLooking back at the table, I need to see which rows represent lines (maybe by the \"lines\" column) and whether their rider per mile is over 10k.\n\nBut actually, in this context, perhaps the \"lines\" column refers to something else. Wait, no\u2014the columns are annual ridership, rider per mile, opened, stations, lines. So each row represents a single line's data. Therefore, the claim might be that any of the lines (rows) have rider per mile over 10k.\n\nWait, but looking at the \"rider per mile\" column:\n\n- The highest is 18123 in row 6.\n- Next is 9172 in row 5.\n- Then 13982 in row 3.\n\nSo only row 6 has a value over 10k. So if the claim says that 5 lines have more than 10k riders per mile, but only one line meets this, then it's false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The \"lines\" column might be indicating how many lines in total, so perhaps the 5th row is being referred to. But no, the claim doesn't mention anything about rows or indexing. It just says \"5 lines.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's a translation issue and they meant that any of the five main lines have more than 10k riders/mile. If only one line meets this, then the claim is partially true but not entirely for five lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim states that \"5 lines\" have rider per mile exceeding 10k. From the data, only row 6 (rider per mile 18123) does. Therefore, the claim is false because only one line meets this criterion, not five.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nLooking at all rows for rider per mile:\n\nRow 0: 37,613\nRow 1: 9,227\nRow 2: 7,095\nRow 3: 13,982\nRow 4: 4,056\nRow 5: 9,172\nRow 6: 18,123\nRow 7: 4,594\nRow 8: 9,115\nRow 9: 2,904\nRow 10: 3,871\nRow 11: 3,794\nRow 12: 2,606\nRow 13: 881\nRow 14: 1,071\n\nOnly row 6 has over 10k. So, only one line meets the condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"5 lines have more than 10,000 riders per mile\" is false because only one line does so.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five lines have rider per mile exceeding 10,000. However, upon examining each row, only one line (row 6) meets this criterion with a rider per mile of 18,123. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"false\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Only one line has rider per mile exceeding 10,000.\"\n}\n```",
