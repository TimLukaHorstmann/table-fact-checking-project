    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the type code of sl 500 , sl 550 be cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m273 )\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the relevant parts of the table. The table has columns: model, years, type/code, power rpm, and torque rpm.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"type code\" of two models: sl 500 and sl 550. So I need to find those two models in the table and check their type/code column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row after the header is for 'sl 350' with a V6 engine.\n- The second row is about 'sl 500 , sl 550', which falls under 'cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 ( m273 )'.\n- The third row is 'sl 55 amg' with a supercharged V8.\n- The fourth row is 'sl 600' with a V12 biturbo.\n- The fifth row is 'sl 65 amg' with another engine.\n\nSo for sl 500 and sl 550, their type/code is indeed 'cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 ( m273 )', which matches the claim. There's no discrepancy here because in the table, those models are listed under that exact code.\n\nI should also consider if there are any variations or additional info, but from what I see, it's consistent. So the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type / code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"2006 - 2008 have a type / code of cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m272 )\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several rows, each representing different models with their corresponding years, type/code, power rpm, and torque rpm. My goal is to find if any row in the 2006-2008 range matches the type/code specified in the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, there are a few rows that fall within the years 2006 - 2008. The first row is for \"sl 350\" with the code \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v6 ( m272 )\". That doesn't match because it's a v6, not v8.\n\nThe second row is for \"sl 500 , sl 550\" with the code \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 ( m273 )\". Wait, that's a v8, but the code has m273. The claim mentions m272, so this doesn't match either because of the different engine code.\n\nThe third row is for \"sl 55 amg\" with the code \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 supercharged ( m113 )\". This is a v8 but again, it's m113, not m272. So still no match.\n\nThe fourth row is \"sl 600\" with a v12 engine, so that's out of the question since we're looking for a v8.\n\nNow, checking the fifth row, \"sl 65 amg\", which is from 2004 onwards and uses a v12 biturbo. So it doesn't fall within 2006-2008 unless 2004 is considered part of that range depending on interpretation. But even if I consider that, the type/code here is v12, not v8.\n\nWait, the claim says \"2006 - 2008\", so I should focus only on models from 2006 to 2008. That excludes the sl 65 amg because it starts in 2004. So the relevant rows are the first four: sl 350, sl 500/sl550, sl55 amg, and sl600.\n\nNone of these have a type/code that matches \"cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m272 )\". The closest is the second row, which has v8 but with m273. So there's no exact match for m272 in 2006-2008 models.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because none of the models listed under 2006-2008 have the specified type/code of cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 with engine code m272.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type / code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"model\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
