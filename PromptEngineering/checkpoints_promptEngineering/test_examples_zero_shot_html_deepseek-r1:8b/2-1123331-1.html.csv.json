    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"hydraulics , drive by damon hill , have a grid number bigger than 1\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into its components. It mentions three things: hydraulics, drive by Damon Hill, and a grid number bigger than 1. My goal is to check if all these parts are supported by the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists drivers along with their constructors, laps, time or reason for retirement, and their starting grid positions. The claim specifically mentions \"hydraulics\" and \"drive by Damon Hill\". So I should look for entries where either of those terms appears in the 'time / retired' column.\n\nStarting with \"hydraulics\", I'll scan each row's 'time / retired' cell for that exact term. Scanning through, I find that Damon Hill has \"hydraulics\" listed under his time or retirement status. His grid number is 7, which is bigger than 1, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim also mentions \"drive by Damon Hill\". So I need to confirm if there's a driver named Damon Hill in the table who has the grid number mentioned. Looking through the 'driver' column, I see that Damon Hill is indeed listed with a grid position of 7.\n\nNow, putting it all together: The term \"hydraulics\" appears for Damon Hill, and his grid number is 7, which is bigger than 1. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to check if:\n\n1. There's a driver with \"hydraulics\" as their time / retired status.\n2. This driver has a grid number greater than 1.\n\nChecking the table:\n\n- Damon Hill has \"hydraulics\" in the 'time / retired' column and his grid number is 7, which is greater than 1.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, supported by these cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
