    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"The location that was founded in 1891 and left in 1975 is Hickory, North Carolina.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part says a location was founded in 1891, and the second part says it stopped operating or left in 1975. The specific location mentioned is Hickory, NC.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different institution with details like name, location, year founded, and the year they left. My task is to find if any institution matches both the founding year (1891) and departure year (1975) while being located in Hickory, NC.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for the location \"Hickory, North Carolina.\" I see that there's a row at row index 12 with the name \"Wingate University\" located in Wingate, NC. That doesn't match Hickory, so it's not relevant here.\n\nNext, checking for \"Hickory, NC,\" I find it in row index 8: \"Western Carolina University.\" Wait, no, that's in Cullowhee, NC. Hmm, perhaps I missed a row. Let me check again. Oh, row index 8 is Western Carolina, and row 9 is Wingate. Then I see row index 12 as Wingate. Maybe I need to look further.\n\nWait, let me go through each row one by one. Starting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Mars Hill College, founded 1856.\n- Row 1: Western Carolina University, Cullowhee.\n- Row 2: Presbyterian College, Clinton, SC.\n- ...\n- Looking for Hickory, I think it's in row index 8? Wait, maybe I'm confusing rows. Let me count correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the institution that was founded in 1891 and left in 1975 is not present in the table. Let me see each row:\n\nRow 0: Mars Hill College, 1856.\nRow 1: Western Carolina University, 1889.\nRow 2: Presbyterian College, 1880.\n...\nWait, I don't see any institution founded in 1891 that left in 1975 located in Hickory, NC. The only one close is Wingate University, which was founded in 1896 and closed in 1989, but the location is Wingate, not Hickory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again for Hickory, NC. If no institution matches both founding in 1891 and closing in 1975 in Hickory, then the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim that says: \"the former private member that be found in 1839 and leave in 1975 be hickory, north carolina.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the claim is referring to. It mentions a \"former private member\" which was established in 1839 and ceased operations in 1975, located in Hickory, North Carolina. Looking at the table provided, each row represents a different institution with details like name, location, year founded, etc.\n\nI should go through each row to find a school that fits these criteria: private status, founded in 1839, closed or left by 1975, and located in Hickory, NC.\n\nLet me start by looking at the location first. Hickory is mentioned, so I need to check which institutions are based there. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 15: Mars Hill College is in Mars Hill, NC, not Hickory.\n- Row 23: Western Carolina University is in Cullowhee, NC, not Hickory.\n- Row 24: Wingate University is in Wingate, NC, not Hickory.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed one. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at row indices, perhaps I didn't go far enough. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: UNC Pembroke - Pembroke, NC\n...\nI think I need to find a school in Hickory. Wait, maybe it's not listed here or perhaps I'm confusing the names.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Hickory, North Carolina.\" Looking at the table, I don't see any rows with location exactly as Hickory. Let me double-check each row's location:\n\n- Row 0: Pembroke\n- Row1: Mars Hill\n- ...\n- Wait, maybe Presbyterian College? No, it's in Clinton, SC.\n- Queens University is in Charlotte, NC.\n- St Andrews is in Laurinburg, NC.\n- Western Carolina is in Cullowhee, NC.\n- Wingate is in Wingate, NC.\n\nHmm, I don't see a row with Hickory as the location. So perhaps there's no institution in Hickory listed here. That would mean the claim is false because such a school doesn't exist in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Is there any row where the location is Hickory? The table seems to list institutions from various NC cities like Charlotte, Laurinburg, Clinton, etc., but no Hickory. So that's a red flag.\n\nNow, considering the claim mentions a private member founded in 1839 and left by 1975. If such an institution isn't present in the table, then it's false. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which column to check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a school that was private, established in 1839, and closed by 1975. Let me see:\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 15: Mars Hill College, founded 1856, closed 1975.\n- Row 23: Western Carolina University, founded 1889, closed 1975.\n\nWait, but the claim says it was found in 1839, so that's earlier than Mars Hill. Let me check for a school founded in 1839.\n\nLooking at the table, I don't see any row with a founding year of 1839. The closest is Presbyterian College in 1880 and Queens University in 1857, but not 1839.\n\nSo, if there's no institution matching these criteria, the claim isn't supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Year Founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Year Left\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
