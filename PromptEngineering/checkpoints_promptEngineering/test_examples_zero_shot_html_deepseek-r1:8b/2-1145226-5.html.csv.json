    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Paul Emerick is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"paul emerick do not have the greatest number of tries out of the 9 total players.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by locating where Paul Emerick is in the table. Scanning through each row, I see his name in the second row (row index 1). \n\nNow, looking at the columns, the one that's relevant here is \"tries,\" which shows how many times each player has tried something, probably goals or shots. So, the specific data for Paul Emerick is in the \"tries\" column under his row. According to the table, he has 17 tries.\n\nNext, I need to check if this number, 17, is indeed not the greatest among all players listed. To do that, I'll go through each player's \"tries\" count:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 26\n2. Paul Emerick: 17\n3. Todd Clever: 11\n4. Philip Eloff: 10\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10\n6. Chris Wyles: 10\n7. David Fee: 9\n8. Mike Hercus: 9\n9. Riaan van Zyl: 9\n\nFrom this list, the highest number of tries is 26 by Vaea Anitoni. Paul Emerick has 17, which is significantly less than that. \n\nSo, the claim states that Paul Emerick does not have the greatest number of tries. Since his 17 is lower than others, especially Vaea Anitoni's 26, this claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because Paul Emerick indeed doesn't have the highest number of tries among all players listed.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"Paul Emerick do not have the greatest number of tries out of the 9 total players,\" I need to check his number of tries compared to others. From the table, Paul Emerick has 17 tries, which is less than Vaea Anitoni's 26. Thus, the statement is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of 8 years.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'drop' column in the table because it's directly related to the claim about drops. Each row represents a different player and their corresponding data.\n\nThe goal is to find if any single player has the highest number of drops within an 8-year period. So I need to check each player's span and see if their drop count meets this criterion.\n\nLet me go through each player:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: Span is 1992-2000, which is 8 years. Drops are 0.\n2. Paul Emrick: 2003-2012 is 9 years. Drops are 0.\n3. Todd Clever: 2003- is ongoing; he's been playing since then. He has 11 drops over his span. Wait, but the claim is about an 8-year span. I'm not sure if his entire span counts or if any specific 8-year period includes a high drop count.\n4. Philip Eloff: 2000-2007 is 7 years. Drops are 0.\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007- ongoing, so at least 12 years. He has 10 drops, but I don't know if an 8-year period within his span has more drops.\n6. Chris Wyles: 2007- ongoing, 14 drops. His entire span is more than 8 years, and he's had 14 drops in total. If any 8-year period includes all these drops, it's possible. But I need to see if the drop count within an 8-year window is higher elsewhere.\n7. David Fee: 2002-2005, 3 years span. Drops are 0.\n8. Mike Herkus: 2002-2009, 7 years. He has 4 drops in total over his entire span of 7 years.\n9. Riaan van Zyl: 2003-2004, 1 year. Drops are 0.\n\nLooking at the 'drop' column, Chris Wyles has the highest number with 14 drops, but his active period is from 2007 onwards. However, the claim specifies \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of 8 years.\" \n\nSo, I need to check if any player's drop count within an 8-year window is higher than others. For example, Chris Wyles has been active since 2007. From 2007 to 2015 (assuming he stopped in 2015), that's 8 years. In those 8 years, he had 14 drops. However, looking at the table, it shows his total drops as 14 regardless of the span.\n\nBut wait, the 'drop' column lists all drops up until now. So for Chris Wyles, if he started in 2007 and is still active, but we don't know when he stopped. The data only goes up to 2012 for Paul Emrick, so perhaps the table doesn't include his later years. Therefore, it's unclear whether any 8-year period has more than 14 drops.\n\nLooking at other players: Mike Herkus had 4 drops over 7 years (2002-2009). Chris Wyles has 14 drops from 2007 onwards, but if we take an 8-year window starting in 2007, he might have all 14 drops within that period. However, the table doesn't specify when his drops occurred; it just shows total drops.\n\nSo, without knowing the exact years when each drop happened, we can't confirm whether any single player has a drop count exceeding others within an 8-year span. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"3 of the 9 players have not yet finished their span of play on the United States national rugby union team.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of this means. The table lists players with their spans, which are the years they played for the US team. Some spans end with a year, like \"1992 - 2000,\" while others have an ongoing span, like \"2003 -\" or \"2007 -.\"\n\nThe claim is about whether three out of nine players haven't finished their playing span yet. So I need to check each player's status regarding their span.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 1992-2000 \u2013 this ended, so they've finished.\n2. Paul Emerrick: 2003-2012 \u2013 ended, finished.\n3. Todd Clever: 2003- \u2013 ongoing, hasn't finished.\n4. Philip Eloff: 2000-2007 \u2013 ended, finished.\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007- \u2013 ongoing, hasn't finished.\n6. Chris Wyles: 2007- \u2013 ongoing, hasn't finished.\n7. David Fee: 2002-2005 \u2013 ended, finished.\n8. Mike Herkus: 2002-2009 \u2013 ended, finished.\n9. Riaan van Zyl: 2003-2004 \u2013 ended, finished.\n\nSo the players still active (haven't finished their span) are Todd Clever, Takudzwa Ngwenya, and Chris Wyles. That's three players. \n\nNow, there are nine players in total as per the table, so three out of nine haven't finished their span. The claim states this, so it seems true.\n\nI need to map which cells are relevant. Each active player's row is relevant because they haven't finished. So rows 2 (Todd Clever), 4 (Takudzwa Ngwenya), and 5 (Chris Wyles) have the 'span' that ends with a dash, indicating ongoing. So the relevant columns are 'player', but specifically looking for the span status, so maybe 'span' column is key.\n\nBut the instructions say to list cells by row_index and column_name. So for each active player, their row's 'span' is relevant. Alternatively, perhaps only the 'span' cell indicates ongoing or not.\n\nWait, the claim is about whether they have NOT yet finished their span, so the relevant info is in the 'start' and 'end' of their playing period. But since the table just shows the span as years, we can determine from that if it's ongoing.\n\nSo each active player (with spans ending with a dash) hasn't finished. So I should note which rows have such spans. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 2: 2003 -\n- Row 4: 2007 -\n- Row 5: 2007 -\n\nThese are three players. Their row indexes are 2, 4, and 5.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be their 'span' column, as that's where the ongoing status is indicated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Chris Wyles be 1 of the 2 player with drop during their time on the rugby team.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and find where Chris Wyles is located. Scanning through the table, I see that Chris Wyles is in the sixth row (row_index 6). His data includes various stats, including \"drop\". \n\nLooking at his specific row, under the \"drop\" column, it shows a value of 1. That means during his time on the rugby team, he had one drop. The claim says that Chris Wyles is one of two players with a drop. So I need to check if there's exactly one other player with a drop.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see how many players have a \"drop\" value greater than zero. Starting from the first row:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 0 drops.\n- Paul Emnerick: 0 drops.\n- Todd Clever: 0 drops.\n- Philip Elhoff: 0 drops.\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 0 drops.\n- Chris Wyles: 1 drop.\n- David Fee: 0 drops.\n- Mike Herkus: 4 drops.\n- Riaan van Zyl: 0 drops.\n\nSo, the only players with non-zero drops are Chris Wyles (1) and Mike Herkus (4). That means there are two players who had drops during their time on the rugby team. \n\nSince the claim says Chris Wyles is one of these two, it's supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Chris Wyles being one of two players with a drop, I checked each player's \"drop\" count in the table.\n\nChris Wyles has 1 drop. The only other player with a non-zero drop is Mike Herkus, who has 4 drops. This means there are exactly two players with drops.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Locate Chris Wyles' row (row_index 6).\n2. Note his \"drop\" value is 1.\n3. Check all rows for other non-zero \"drop\" values.\n4.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Riaan van Zyl is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Riaan van Zyl has the shortest time span on the United States National Rugby Union Team and ties with three others for the smallest number of tries.\"\n\nFirst, I need to locate Riaan van Zyl in the table. Looking at the 'player' column, I see there's a row with his name: \"riann van zyl\". Wait, is it spelled correctly? The claim says \"Riaan van Zyl,\" but the table has \"riaan van zyl.\" Hmm, maybe that's just a typo in the table. I'll proceed assuming it's the same person.\n\nNext, the claim mentions two main points: time span and number of tries.\n\nStarting with the time span. Each player has a 'span' column that indicates their years active. Looking at Riaan van Zyl's row, under the 'span' column, it says \"2003 - 2004.\" I need to check if this is indeed the shortest time span compared to others.\n\nI'll list out all players and their spans:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n2. Paul Emerrick: 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n3. Todd Clever: 2003 - (still active, so more than 17 years as of now)\n4. Philip Eloff: 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007 - (active, over 11 years)\n6. Chris Wyles: 2007 - (active, over 13 years)\n7. David Fee: 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n8. Mike Herkus: 2002 - 2009 (7 years)\n9. Riaan van Zyl: 2003 - 2004 (1 year)\n10. Ryan van Zyl: Not in the table, but perhaps a different person? Wait, no, the claim is about Riaan van Zyl.\n\nWait, looking at the 'span' column for Riaan van Zyl, it's only one year from 2003 to 2004. That seems very short compared to others. The next shortest would be David Fee with 3 years and then Philip Eloff with 7 years. So yes, Riaan has the shortest time span.\n\nNow, the claim also says he ties with three others for the smallest number of tries. Looking at the 'tries' column for Riaan van Zyl: it's 0. So I need to check if any other players have 0 tries as well.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 0\n- Paul Emerick: 0\n- Todd Clever: 0\n- Philip Eloff: 0\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 0\n- Chris Wyles: 14\n- David Fee: 0\n- Mike Herkus:90\n- Riaan van Zyl: 0\n\nWait, so Riaan has 0 tries. But how many others have 0? Let's count:\n\nVaea Anitoni - 0\nPaul Emerick - 0\nTodd Clever - 0\nPhilip Eloff - 0\nTakudzwa Ngwenya - 0\nDavid Fee - 0\n\nThat's six players with 0 tries. The claim says he ties with three others. So that's incorrect; there are more than three.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is referring to something else? Or perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRow by row:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: 0\n2. Paul Emerick: 0\n3. Todd Clever: 0\n4. Philip Eloff: 0\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: 0\n6. Chris Wyles:14\n7. David Fee:0\n8. Mike Herkus:90\n9. Riaan van Zyl:0\n\nYes, that's seven players with 0 tries. So Riaan is not tied with three others; he has six or seven others who also have 0 tries.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect on both points: his time span is indeed the shortest, but he doesn't tie with only three others for 0 tries\u2014he ties with more than three. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of it against the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Locate Riaan van Zyl in the table:** The player's name in the table is \"riaan van zyl\" (all lowercase). Assuming this is a typo and refers to \"Riaan van Zyl,\" we proceed.\n\n2. **Check Time Span:**\n   - Riaan van Zyl's time span is listed as \"2003 - 2004\", which is 1 year.\n   - This is the shortest compared to others (e.g., David Fee with 3 years, Philip Eloff with 7 years).\n   - Therefore, Riaan has the shortest time span.\n\n3. **Check Number of Tries:**\n   - Riaan van Zyl's tries column shows \"0.\"\n   - We count how many players have \"0\" tries:\n     - Vaea Anitoni\n     - Paul Emerick\n     - Todd Clever\n     - Philip Eloff\n     - Takudzwa Ngwenya\n     - David Fee\n     - Riaan van Zyl\n   - Total of 7 players with 0 tries.\n   - The claim states he ties with three others, which is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim that Riaan van Zyl has the shortest time span and ties with three others for the smallest number of tries is FALSE because he does not tie with only three others\u2014he ties with more than three.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"Evaluate a statement about player statistics in a table.\",\n  \"statement\": \"Riaan van Zyl has the shortest time span and ties with three others for the least tries.\",\n  \"correct_answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"explanation\": \"While Riaan van Zyl indeed has the shortest time span, he does not tie with only three others for the least tries; there are more than three players with zero tries.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of only 1 year.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at how \"drop\" is defined in the context of the table. In the table, there's a column named \"drop,\" so that seems relevant. Each row represents a different player and their respective statistics.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"greatest number of drop from 1 player.\" So I need to find which player has the highest number of drops in a single year. Let me look at each row:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 0 drops.\n- Paul Emerrick: 0 drops.\n- Todd Clever: 0 drops.\n- Philip Eloff: 0 drops.\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 0 drops.\n- Chris Wyles: 1 drop.\n- David Fee: 0 drops.\n- Mike Herkus: 4 drops.\n- Riaan van Zyl: 0 drops.\n\nSo Mike Herkus has the highest number of drops, which is 4. Now, I need to check the \"span\" column for Mike Hercus to see how many years that drop occurred over. Looking at his row, the span is \"2002 - 2009.\" \n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"over the span of only 1 year.\" If the drop happened over multiple years (from 2002 to 2009), then the span isn't just one year. But I should check if the data for the drop corresponds to a single year or not.\n\nLooking at the table structure: There's a 'start' column, which indicates when their playing career started, but it doesn't specify when their drop occurred. The 'tries' column has numbers, but that might relate to attempts rather than drops.\n\nAssuming that each player's stats are for the entire span listed, then Mike Herkus had 4 drops over his career from 2002 to 2009. That's more than one year. However, if within that time only one year had significant drops, we need to see if that's the case. But since the data doesn't specify the exact years when the drops happened, I have to go by the given information.\n\nTherefore, Mike Hercus has a drop count of 4 over his span of 2002-2009, which is more than one year. So the claim that the greatest number of drops from one player happens over just one year isn't supported because it spans multiple years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Paul Emmerick in the table. Looking at the 'player' column, I see his row towards the top. His details are:\n\n- Player: Paul Emmerick\n- Span: 2003 - 2012\n- Start: 49\n- Tries: 17\n- Conv: 0\n- Pens: 0\n- Drop: 0\n\nThe claim is about his 'tries' compared to other players. So, I need to check all the other rows and see if any of them have fewer tries than Paul's 17.\n\nLet me go through each player one by one:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: Tries = 26\n2. Paul Emmerick: Tries = 17\n3. Todd Clever: Tries = 11\n4. Philip Eloff: Tries = 10\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: Tries = 10\n6. Chris Wyles: Tries = 14 (Wait, no, looking back at the table, I might have made a mistake here. Wait, in the table, under 'tries' for Chris Wyles, it's actually 10. Let me double-check.)\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: tries=26\n- Paul Emmerick: 17\n- Todd Clever: 11\n- Philip Eloff: 10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10\n- Chris Wyles: tries=10 (No, in the table it's actually 10?

Riaan van Zyl: tries=9\n\nSo, the 'tries' column data is:\n\n26,17,11,10,10,10,9,90,9.\n\nNow, Paul Emmerick has 17 tries. The claim says he does not have fewer tries than any other player. So we need to check if all other players have >=17 tries.\n\nLooking at each player's 'tries':\n\n- Vaea Anitoni:26 >17\n- Todd Clever:11 <17 \u2192 this is less\n- Philip Eloff:10 <17\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya:10 <17\n- Chris Wyles:10 <17\n- David Fee:9 <17\n- Riaan van Zyl:9 <17\n- Mike Hercus:90 >17\n\nSo, Paul Emmerick's 'tries' is 17. There are several players (Todd Clever, Philip Eloff, Takudzwa Ngwenya, Chris Wyles, David Fee, Riaan van Zyl) who have fewer tries than him.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because Paul Emmerick does have fewer tries than some other players.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"paul emerick do not have fewer tries than any other player,\" we compare Paul's 'tries' (17) to all other players.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"All of the players have already finished their span of play on the United States National Rugby Union Team.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. A \"span of play\" likely refers to the period during which a player was active or participated with the team. So, the claim is stating that every listed player has completed their playing period.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details like their name, span (which seems to be years they played), start year, number of tries, conversions, penalties, and drops. \n\nI need to check for each player if their \"span\" is fully closed. The \"span\" column has entries like \"1992 - 2000\", \"2003 - 2012\", etc. For some players, the span ends with a specific year, while others have an ongoing span, marked as \"2007 -\" or similar.\n\nFor example, looking at Chris Wyles' row: his span is \"2007 -\". That means he's still playing, hasn't finished yet. So if the claim says all have finished, that would be false because Chris Wyles is still active.\n\nSimilarly, others like Todd Clever and Takudzwa Ngwenya also have spans ending with \"-\" indicating they're still playing. \n\nTherefore, since not all players have completed their span, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Chris Wyles be the only player with drop during his time on the rugby team\" is true or false by checking the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that Chris Wyles is the only player who had a drop during his time on the rugby team. So, my task is to check if any other players in the table also have a non-zero value under the \"drop\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different player and their corresponding data. The columns relevant here are \"player,\" \"span,\" \"start,\" \"tries,\" \"conv,\" \"pens,\" and \"drop.\" Since the claim specifically mentions the \"drop\" statistic, I should focus on that column.\n\nStarting with Chris Wyles' row: his \"drop\" value is 1. So, he definitely has a drop. Now, I need to check all other players in the table to see if any of them also have a non-zero drop.\n\nLet me go through each player one by one:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: Drop = 0\n2. Paul Emrick: Drop = 0\n3. Todd Clever: Drop = 0\n4. Philip Eloff: Drop = 0\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: Drop = 0\n6. Chris Wyles: Drop = 1 (as established)\n7. David Fee: Drop = 0\n8. Mike Herkus: Drop = 4\n9. Riaan van Zyl: Drop = 0\n\nWait, Mike Herkus has a drop of 4, which is non-zero. That means Chris Wyles isn't the only player with a drop during his time on the team. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to identify all the cells that are relevant. These would be Chris Wyles' row and Mike Herkus' row because both have non-zero drops. That means their \"row_index\" and \"column_name\" (which is \"drop\") should be included in the relevant_cells list.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells are those two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Riann van Zyl is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Riann van Zyl has the longest time span on the United State National Rugby Union Team and ties with only 1 other player for the greatest number of tries.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check two main points from the claim. \n\n1. **Longest Time Span**: The table has a column called 'span' which indicates the years the player was active. I should look up Riann van Zyl's time span.\n\n2. **Ties for Most Tries**: There's another column, 'tries', which shows how many tries each player scored. The claim says he ties with only one other player for the most tries.\n\nLet me start by finding Riann van Zyl in the table. Scanning through the list of players, I see that Riaan van zyl is present in row index 8 (since it's zero-based indexing). His 'span' is \"2003 - 2004\" which means he played for two years. \n\nNow, comparing his span to others. Looking at other players:\n\n- vaea anitoni: 1992-2000 \u2192 9 years\n- paul emerick: 2003-2012 \u2192 10 years\n- todd clever: 2003- (current) \u2192 still ongoing\n- philip eloff: 2000-2007 \u2192 8 years\n- takudzwa ngwenya: 2007- (ongoing)\n- chris wyles: 2007- (ongoing)\n- david fee: 2002-2005 \u2192 4 years\n- mike hercus: 2002-2009 \u2192 8 years\n- riaan van zyl: 2003-2004 \u2192 2 years\n\nSo, the longest time span is actually held by Paul emerick with 10 years. Riann van Zyl's span of 2 years is definitely not the longest. That already contradicts the first part of the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any players with a longer span than Paul emerick. Todd clever and others are still playing, so their 'span' might be ongoing. But in the table, their 'start' year is given, and 'span' is until now or a specific end year. So for Todd clever, it's \"2003 -\", which probably means he's still active. Similarly, Takudzwa ngwenya and Chris wyles have spans that are ongoing.\n\nBut in terms of the data provided in the table, the longest completed span is Paul emerick with 10 years (from 2003 to 2012). Riann van Zyl only has 2 years. So the first part of the claim is false.\n\nNow for the second part: tying with another player for the most tries. Let's look at the 'tries' column for Riann van Zyl, which is 0. That's the lowest; he didn't score any tries. So claiming he ties with anyone in the number of tries doesn't make sense because his count is zero.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"tie with only 1 other player for the greatest number of tries.\" If Riann van Zyl has 0 tries, that's not the greatest; he actually has none. So there can't be a tie here either.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the 'tries' column is misread. Let me check again. For Riaan van zyl, it's row index 8: his 'tries' are 0. The other players with high tries are Mike hercus, who scored 90. So Riann has the least tries.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. He doesn't have the longest time span and he didn't tie for the most tries; in fact, he tied for the least.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread his name. Let me check again: Riaan van zyl vs Riann van Zyl? Oh, wait, the claim says \"riann van zyl\" with two 'n's and one 'z'. In the table, it's spelled as \"riaan van zyl\" with two 'a's. So perhaps it's a typo in the claim.\n\nBut assuming that they meant Riaan van zyl (with two 'a's), then he still doesn't have the longest time span or the most tries. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made about Riann van Zyl is incorrect based on the provided table. He does not have the longest time span, nor does he tie with any other player for the greatest number of tries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"span\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"tries\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
