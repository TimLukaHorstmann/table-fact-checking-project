    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that the Virginia Tech Hokies bowl game had attendance over 70,000 seven times. I need to check each relevant row in the provided table to see if there's data supporting this.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows correspond to the Virginia Tech Hokies bowl games. Looking at the \"Team\" column, the entries include Virginia Tech Hokies on several rows. I'll list those out:\n\n1. 2019: Virginia Tech Hokies\n2. 2020: Virginia Tech Hokies\n3. 2021: Virginia Tech Hokies\n\nNow, for each of these games, I need to check the \"Attendance\" figure to see if it exceeds 70,000.\n\nStarting with 2019: The attendance is listed as 75,509. That's over 70,000, so that counts as one time.\n\nNext, 2020: Attendance is noted as 67,461. Hmm, that's just under 70,000. So this doesn't count towards the seven times.\n\nThen, 2021: The attendance is 68,911, which is also below 70,000. That doesn't help either.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check if there are more years with Virginia Tech Hokies games in the table beyond 2021. Scanning through, the next one after 2021 isn't present. So only three games where Virginia Tech was playing: 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\nOut of these, only the 2019 game had attendance over 70,000. The other two were below that threshold. Therefore, there's only one instance where attendance exceeded 70,000 for Virginia Tech bowl games.\n\nSince the claim states seven times, this doesn't hold true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only the 2019 game had attendance over 70,000, not seven instances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2019, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2020, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2021, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be 10 win out of 26 game in virginia tech hokies bowl game",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 10 win out of 26 game in virginia tech hokies bowl game\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the Virginia Tech Hokies have 10 wins out of 26 games they played in bowl games. So, I need to check if there are any cells in the table that relate to the Virginia Tech Hokies' bowl game performance, specifically their number of wins and total games played.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a season, from 1990 to 2012. Each row has several columns like Team, Opponent, Bowl Game, etc. The key columns here are \"Bowl Game\" (which might indicate whether it's a bowl game or not) and perhaps any other columns related to wins and losses.\n\nWait, in the table, I don't immediately see columns that directly state the number of wins. There is a \"Record\" column which shows the overall record for each season, but I'm not sure if that includes bowl games specifically. For example, one row has a Record of 8-3, another 7-6, and so on. But without knowing how these records are compiled (whether they include only bowl games or all games), this might be tricky.\n\nBut the claim is about \"bowl game\" performance, so I should focus on rows where the Bowl Game is listed as something like \"Bowl Game\" or similar. Looking through the table, each row seems to have a column named \"Bowl Game,\" which probably indicates whether they participated in a bowl game for that season.\n\nWait, no, looking closer, the columns are: Season, Team, Opponent, Bowl Game, etc. So the \"Bowl Game\" column likely lists the name of the bowl game they played, like Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, etc. The Record column would then represent their overall performance in all games for that season.\n\nBut to get specifically the number of wins in bowl games, I need a separate column that indicates bowl game wins. However, from the table provided, it seems there's no such column. The columns are: Season, Team, Opponent, Bowl Game, and maybe others like Revenue or Employees, but those don't seem relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps the Record column includes bowl game wins. For instance, if a team has 10 bowl game wins out of 26 games, that would mean in their bowl games, they have 10 wins and 16 losses (assuming each game is either a win or loss). But how do we differentiate between total games and bowl games?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Bowl Game\" column indicates whether it's a bowl game or not. For example, if a team has played multiple bowl games in their season, but the table doesn't specify how many bowl games they played each season.\n\nWait, looking at some rows:\n\nFor 1990: Bowl Game is listed as \"Bowl Game,\" Opponent is West Virginia, and Record is 9-2. So maybe in that year, they played a bowl game where they had a record of 9-2 overall. But that doesn't necessarily mean their bowl games were all part of that.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim is about having 10 wins out of 26 bowl games. So we need to find in the table cells related to Virginia Tech Hokies' bowl game performance, specifically 10 wins and 26 total bowl games played.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The first few rows are for seasons like 1990, 1991, etc.\n- Each row has a \"Team\" column. I need to look for entries where Team is \"Virginia Tech Hokies.\"\n\nBut scanning the table, in the first 20 rows provided, I don't see any entry with \"Virginia Tech Hokies.\" So perhaps there's no relevant data in this table about Virginia Tech Hokies bowl games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the team names are abbreviated or spelled differently. For example, sometimes teams might be listed as \"Hokies\" instead of \"Virginia Tech Hokies,\" but looking at the table, I see entries like \"Penn State Nittany Lions,\" \"Auburn Tigers,\" etc., so it seems the full name is included.\n\nTherefore, if there's no row with Team as \"Virginia Tech Hokies,\" then we don't have any data relevant to their bowl games in this table. Thus, the claim can't be verified because there's no information about their bowl game performance.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1990: Team is \"Virginia Tech Hokies\" \u2013 Yes! Here we go.\n\nWait, actually, in row 0 (the first row), Season is 1990, Team is \"Virginia Tech Hokies,\" Opponent is \"West Virginia,\" Bowl Game is \"Bowl Game,\" and Record is 9-2.\n\nSo, in the 1990 season, the Virginia Tech Hokies played a bowl game against West Virginia. Their overall record was 9-2, which includes all games, not just bowl games. So their bowl game performance isn't specified here\u2014whether they won or lost that specific bowl game.\n\nOther rows with \"Virginia Tech Hokies\" would be sparse because the team is likely only listed once per season. For example, in 1990, they played a bowl game; perhaps in other years they didn't, but I don't see data beyond that single row for them.\n\nTherefore, since there's only one entry for Virginia Tech Hokies in this table (Season 1990), and even then, it doesn't specify the number of bowl games or their outcomes beyond the overall record, which is 9-2, we can't extract from this table whether they have 10 wins out of 26 bowl games.\n\nMoreover, there's no column that specifies the number of bowl games played each season. So, for example, in 1990, if they had multiple bowl games, but the Record column doesn't break down wins and losses specifically for bowl games.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the table provided, there is insufficient data to confirm or deny the claim that Virginia Tech Hokies have 10 wins out of 26 bowl games. There's only one row with their team name, and even then, it doesn't provide detailed bowl game statistics.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified using the provided information. The table does not contain specific data about the Virginia Tech Hokies' bowl game performance, such as the number of wins or total bowl games played.",

The claim says: \"2 out of 20 6 game be held at memphis memorial stadium in memphis , tn.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into key parts. It mentions that there are 2 games (out of 20) played at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, TN.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different bowl game with various details like the name, date, teams, stadium, etc. I need to find any rows that mention \"Memphis Memorial Stadium\" in the stadium column and check if there are exactly two games listed there.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- 1. 1968 Orange Bowl: Stadium is Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, FL.\n- 2. 1969 Blue-Gray Classic: Stadium is Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, FL.\n- 3. 1970 Cotton Bowl: Stadium is Dallas Cowboys Stadium in Irving, TX.\n- 4. 1971 Liberty Bowl: Stadium is Autotron Stadiim in Louisville, KY.\n- 5. 1972 Orange Bowl: Stadium is Pro Player Stadium again, same as row 1.\n- 6. 1973 Sugar Bowl: Stadium is Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, LA.\n- 7. 1974 Gator Bowl: Same as row 2.\n- 8. 1975 Cotton Bowl: Same as row 3.\n- 9. 1976 Orange Bowl: Same as rows 1 and 5.\n- 10. 1977 Sugar Bowl: Same as row 6.\n- 11. 1978 Gator Bowl: Same as row 2.\n- 12. 1979 Cotton Bowl: Same as row 3.\n- 13. 1980 Orange Bowl: Same as rows 1,5,9.\n- 14. 1981 Sugar Bowl: Same as row 6 and 10.\n- 15. 1982 Gator Bowl: Same as row 2.\n- 16. 1983 Cotton Bowl: Same as row 3.\n- 17. 1984 Orange Bowl: Same as rows 1,5,9,13.\n- 18. 1985 Sugar Bowl: Same as rows 6,10,14.\n- 19. 1986 Gator Bowl: Same as row 2.\n- 20. 1987 Cotton Bowl: Same as row 3.\n\nNow, looking through all these, I need to see if any of them have \"Memphis Memorial Stadium\" in the stadium column. From my initial scan, none of the rows list \"Memphis Memorial Stadium.\" The stadiums listed are Pro Player Stadium, Gator Bowl, Dallas Cowboys Stadium, Autotron Stadium, Louisiana Superdome, and others, but not Memphis Memorial.\n\nTherefore, since there are no games at Memphis Memorial Stadium in the provided data, the claim that 2 out of 20 games were held there is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any of the 20 games listed in the table were held at Memphis Memorial Stadium. Upon reviewing each row's stadium information, none of them mention \"Memphis Memorial Stadium.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"5 out of 20 6 game be the gator bowl , the first in 1994.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part means. It mentions \"5 out of 20 6 game\" which likely refers to selecting 5 games from a list of 20 that are related to the Gator Bowl, specifically the first one in 1994. So, I need to look for all instances of the Gator Bowl in the table and see if there's at least five entries starting from 1994 onwards.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a game. The \"Bowl\" column seems to indicate which bowl it is, like Gator Bowl or others. I need to scan through each row to find all Gator Bowl games.\n\nStarting from the top, I see rows for different bowls like Insight Bowl, Sugar Bowl, etc. Let me focus on the Gator Bowl entries:\n\n- 1994: Gator Bowl\n- 2005: Gator Bowl\n- 2006: Gator Bowl\n- 2011: Gator Bowl\n- 2012: Gator Bowl\n\nSo that's five games (1994, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012). Now, the claim says \"the first in 1994,\" which matches because the earliest listed is 1994. \n\nNow, does this support the claim? The claim states that there are at least five Gator Bowl games starting with the first one in 1994. Since I found exactly five such entries, it seems to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those rows where the bowl is the Gator Bowl, specifically from row 0 (1994) up to row 4 (2012).\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as there are exactly five Gator Bowl games starting with the first in 1994.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Bowl\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of data about different bowl games, including the Sugar Bowl. The claim is that the four Sugar Bowl games have a combined attendance of 291,424. My task is to verify if this claim is true by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which row and column contains the attendance numbers for each of the four Sugar Bowl games listed. Looking at the table, it seems that each game has an \"Attendance\" column. So my main focus should be on this column specifically for the Sugar Bowl entries.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **2004: 2005 Sugar Bowl**: The attendance here is 77,349.\n2. **2005: 2006 Gator Bowl**: Wait, no, that's actually the Gator Bowl, not a Sugar Bowl. So this isn't relevant for the Sugar Bowl games.\n3. **2006: 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl**: That's another bowl game, not a Sugar Bowl. Not relevant.\n4. **2008: 2009 Orange Bowl**: Again, that's the Orange Bowl, so it doesn't count towards the four Sugar Bowls.\n5. **2011: 2012 Sugar Bowl**: This is the third Sugar Bowl entry with an attendance of 64,512.\n\nWait a minute, I thought there were four Sugar Bowl games in the table, but when I look at the \"Game\" column, I see:\n\n- 2004: 2005 Sugar Bowl\n- 2005: 2006 Gator Bowl (not Sugar)\n- 2006: 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl (not Sugar)\n- 2008: 2009 Orange Bowl (not Sugar)\n- 2011: 2012 Sugar Bowl\n\nSo actually, only two of the games are Sugar Bowls. The claim says \"four sugar bowl game,\" but based on this table, there's only two entries under \"Sugar Bowl.\" That already seems contradictory.\n\nBut maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the \"Game\" column:\n\n- 2004: 2005 Sugar Bowl\n- 2005: 2006 Gator Bowl\n- 2006: 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl\n- 2008: 2009 Orange Bowl\n- 2011: 2012 Sugar Bowl\n\nYes, only two are Sugar Bowls. So the claim mentions four Sugar Bowl games, which doesn't align with the table data provided. This discrepancy suggests that either the table is incomplete or the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, even if I assume there might be more Sugar Bowl entries beyond what's shown here, based on the given table, only two games have their attendances listed. Therefore, to calculate the combined attendance for these four Sugar Bowls, we need all four attendances. Since the table only shows two, it's impossible to verify the claim accurately.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"Attendance\" column:\n\n- 2004: 77,349\n- 2011: 64,512\n\nThese are the only attendances provided for Sugar Bowl games in the table. Without the other two required attendances, we can't sum them up to reach 291,424.\n\nFurthermore, even if I try adding these two, they sum to 141,861, which is far below 291,424. So without the missing attendance figures, the claim cannot be validated as true based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's insufficient data in the provided table to support the claim of a combined attendance of 291,424 for four Sugar Bowl games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific number of losses and games: 10 losses out of 26 games for Virginia Tech Hokies in their bowl games. So, I need to look into the table to see if there's any data that supports this.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows correspond to Virginia Tech. Looking at the table, the team names are listed along the left side. Scanning through, I see \"Virginia Tech Hokies\" appearing in a couple of rows: one in 2009 and another in 2011. So those are the relevant years.\n\nNow, for each of these years, I need to check the bowl game performance. The key columns here are \"W/L\" (which stands for Win/Loss) and possibly others like \"Opponent,\" but since we're looking for losses, \"W/L\" is the main focus. So in each of those rows, I should note down whether it's a win or loss.\n\nStarting with 2009: The row shows that Virginia Tech played in the Orange Bowl against Florida State. The result was a loss (L). So that's one loss.\n\nNext, looking at 2011: They were in the Sugar Bowl against Michigan. The result here is also a loss (L). That adds another loss to their count.\n\nSo, from the table provided, Virginia Tech Hokies have lost two bowl games: one in 2009 and another in 2011. Now, considering that the claim says \"10 losses out of 26 games,\" but based on the data, there are only two losses. That's a big difference\u20142 vs. 10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check if there are more rows for Virginia Tech beyond 2011 in the table. Scanning through, after 2012, the next entries are \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\" and so on, but no further mention of Virginia Tech Hokies. So it seems they only have two bowl games listed in this table.\n\nIf that's the case, then the claim is definitely not supported by the data given\u2014only two losses, not 10 out of 26. But wait, could there be more games not listed here? The table might only include a portion of their bowl game history. However, without additional information or rows for Virginia Tech Hokies beyond what's shown, we can't confirm 10 losses.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, the claim doesn't hold true because they have only two losses in the listed games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided table as it shows only two losses for Virginia Tech Hokies.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2009, \"column_name\": \"W/L\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2011, \"column_name\": \"W/L\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's about Virginia Tech Hokies bowl games where attendance was over 70,000, and this happened 8 times.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists bowl games from 1980 to 2012. Each row has details like the game name, date, teams involved, location, and attendance figures. \n\nI need to identify rows related to Virginia Tech Hokies bowl games where attendance was over 70,000.

Let me check the table:\n\nLooking at row 3: game is 2002 Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech vs Notre Dame, attendance 79,540 \u2192 over.\n\nRow 6: 2005 Sugar Bowl, Virginia Tech vs Michigan, attendance 72,786 \u2192 over.\n\nRow 8: 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl, Virginia Tech vs Georgia, attendance 54,706 \u2192 under.\n\nRow 10: 2007 Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech vs Kansas, attendance 74,311 \u2192 over.\n\nRow 12: 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl, Virginia Tech vs Rutgers, attendance 48,127 \u2192 under.\n\nSo the relevant games where attendance was over 70k are:\n\n1. 2002\n2. 2005\n3. 2007\n4. 2010 (but row 11: 2010 Orange Bowl, attendance 65k \u2013 no)\nWait, in the table, row 10 is 2007, row 11 is 2010, and row 12 is 2012.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted. Let me list each relevant game:\n\n- 2002: over\n- 2004: row 4, which is 2004 Sugar Bowl with attendance 73k \u2192 over (row 4)\n- 2005: row 6, 72k \u2192 over\n- 2007: row 10, 74k \u2192 over\n- 2010: row 11, 65k \u2013 no\n- 2012: row 12, 48k \u2013 no\n\nWait, I might be confusing rows. Let me go through each row where Virginia Tech is involved and check the attendance.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: 1980, not over.\nRow 1: 1983, not over.\nRow 2: 1995, 50k.\nRow 3: 2002, 79.5k \u2192 count as 1.\nRow 4: 2004, 73,349 \u2192 2.\nRow 6: 2005, 72,786 \u2192 3.\nRow 8: 2006, 54k \u2013 no.\nRow 10: 2007, 74,311 \u2192 4.\nRow 12: 2012, 48k \u2013 no.\n\nSo that's four games: 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007. That's only four times, not eight. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the table, row numbers go from 0 to 12. Let me check all rows where Virginia Tech is involved:\n\n- Row 0: 1980\n- Row 1: 1983\n- Row 2: 1995 (50k)\n- Row 3: 2002 (79.5k) \u2192 count.\n- Row 4: 2004 (73,349) \u2192 count.\n- Row 6: 2005 (72,786) \u2192 count.\n- Row 8: 2006 (54k) \u2013 no.\n- Row 10: 2007 (74,311) \u2192 count.\n- Row 12: 2012 (48k) \u2013 no.\n\nThat's only four times. So the claim says attendance was over 70k eight times for Virginia Tech bowl games. But from what I see, it's only four times.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the table provided, the relevant rows where Virginia Tech is a participant and attendance is above 70,000 are:\n\n1. 2002 Orange Bowl: 79,540 \u2192 over\n2. 2004 Sugar Bowl: 73,349 \u2192 over\n3. 2005 Sugar Bowl: 72,786 \u2192 over\n4. 2007 Orange Bowl: 74,311 \u2192 over\n\nThat's four games. Unless there are more that I'm missing.\n\nWait, row 4 is 2004, but the date might be different. Let me check each game:\n\nRow 3: 2002 Orange Bowl \u2013 yes.\nRow 4: 2004 Sugar Bowl \u2013 yes.\nRow 6: 2005 Sugar Bowl \u2013 yes.\nRow 10: 2007 Orange Bowl \u2013 yes.\n\nThat's four times. So the claim says eight times, but only four games meet the criteria based on the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect as it states eight times when there are only four instances in the data given.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Virginia Tech Hokies had bowl game attendance over 70,000 eight times is incorrect. Based on the provided data, only four bowl games meet this criterion: the 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007 seasons.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; there are only four instances of Virginia Tech Hokies bowl games with attendance over 70,000 as listed in the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim is true based on the provided table and then identify which cells from the table are relevant to verifying the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"3 out of 20 6 game be hold at memphis memorial stadium in memphis , tn\". It seems a bit unclear, but I think it's trying to say that there are three games (out of 20) played at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, TN. So, I need to find evidence supporting this claim in the table.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. The table has columns like Year, Game Name, Opponent, Venue, and others. Each row represents a different game with specific details.\n\nI need to look for any rows where:\n1. The number of games is 3 (as per \"3 out of 20\").\n2. These games are played at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis, TN.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"3 out of 20\", which suggests there are three games being discussed, and these are part of a series of 20 games. But looking through the table, each row seems to represent individual games rather than a group of 20. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's stating that in total, across all the games listed, there are 3 games held at Memphis Memorial Stadium.\n\nTo verify this, I'll go through each row and check if the Venue column mentions \"Memphis Memorial Stadium\" in Memphis, TN.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Venue is \"Liberty Bowl\", location isn't specified but probably not Memphis.\n- Row 1: Opponent is Auburn, venue is Jordan-Hare Stadium, so no.\n- ... and so on. I'll need to scan each row's Venue column.\n\nAfter skimming through the table, I notice that most venues are stadiums like \"Louisiana Superdome\" or \"Georgia Dome\", but there's one row where the Venue is \"Liberty Bowl at Memphis\". That might be it.\n\nLooking for specific entries:\n- In Row 18 (Year 2009), the Game Name is \"Chick - fil - a bowl\", and the Venue is \"Georgia Dome\".\n- In Row 19 (Year 2010), the Venue is \"Sun Life Stadium\" in Miami Gardens, FL.\n- In Row 20 (Year 2011), the Venue is \"Mercedes - benz Superdome\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The only mention of Memphis is in the header, which lists the Revenue for each year, not related to games.\n\nOh, perhaps there's a game in Row 19 (Year 2010) where the Venue is \"Sun Life Stadium\" but that's in Florida, not Tennessee.\n\nWait another moment. Let me check Row 17: Year 2008, Game Name \"Chick - fil - a bowl\", Venue \"Georgia Dome\". Not Memphis.\n\nRow 16: Year 2007, Game Name \"Orange Bowl\", Venue \"Pro Player Stadium\" in Miami Gardens.\n\nHmm, I'm not finding any games listed in the table that are at Memphis Memorial Stadium. The closest is Row 18's Chick-fil-A Bowl, but that's at Georgia Dome.\n\nSo, based on this, there doesn't seem to be a game in the table that's held at Memphis Memorial Stadium. Therefore, the claim that \"3 out of 20 6 game be hold at memphis memorial stadium\" is likely false because no such games are present in the provided data.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The user wants us to identify which cells from the table support the claim, if any. Since I couldn't find any supporting cells, there might not be any relevant ones. However, maybe the columns like \"Game Name\" or \"Venue\" could be relevant because they directly relate to the claim about specific games and venues.\n\nBut since no such games exist in the data, the answer would be FALSE. And for the relevant_cells, perhaps we need to indicate which columns were checked but didn't provide support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Game Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "6 out of 20 6 game be the gator bowl , the first in 1994",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim says, \"6 out of 20 6 game be the gator bowl , the first in 1994.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I think there might be a typo in the claim. It probably means \"6 out of 20 games be the Gator Bowl, the first in 1994.\" Maybe it's trying to say that the Gator Bowl had 6 games over 20 years starting with one in 1994. So the idea is to check if the Gator Bowl has been played every year from 1994 onwards for at least six times within those 20 years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different bowl game with details like the name, date, location, and other columns. I need to focus on the 'Gator Bowl' specifically. Let me scan through the rows:\n\nStarting from 1987 up to 2012, I'll note down the Gator Bowl games.\n\n- In 1994, there's a game against Alabama at the Florida Field in Gainesville.\n- In 2005, it was between LSU and Notre Dame at the Superdome.\n- In 2006, Georgia plays Florida State at the Georgia Dome.\n- In 2012, Michigan faces Mississippi State at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\n\nWait, so from 1994 to 2012, there are five Gator Bowl games. That's less than six. So if the claim is that there were six games in 20 years starting in 1994, that might not be accurate because there are only five within that time frame.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me check each row for 'Gator Bowl':\n\nRow 0: Gator Bowl - 1994\nRow 5: Gator Bowl - 2005\nRow 6: Gator Bowl - 2006\nRow 11: Gator Bowl - 2012\n\nWait, that's only four. Did I miss any? Let me go through each row:\n\n- 1987: Orange Bowl\n- 1994: Gator Bowl (1)\n- 2005: Sugar Bowl\n- 2006: Chick-Fil-A Bowl\n- 2010: Orange Bowl\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should look at the 'Name' column for \"Gator Bowl\":\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: Gator Bowl - 1994 (1)\nRow 5: Gator Bowl - 2005 (2)\nRow 6: Chick-Fil-A Bowl\nRow 11: Sugar Bowl\n\nNo, it seems only four times: 1994, 2005, 2006, and 2012. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the claim was about six games in 20 years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes more Gator Bowls beyond 2012, but the data stops at 2012. So up to 2012, there are four Gator Bowl games starting from 1994. That's way less than six over 20 years (1994-2013).\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"6 out of 20 games be the Gator Bowl, the first in 1994\" isn't accurate because there are only four Gator Bowls listed up to 2012.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list all the Gator Bowls:\n\n- 1994: Yes\n- 2005: Yes\n- 2006: Yes\n- 2012: Yes\n\nThat's four games in total from 1994 onwards until 2012, which is an 18-year span, not 20. So even within that, it's only four games.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because there are fewer than six Gator Bowl games within 20 years starting in 1994.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that there were six Gator Bowl games within a 20-year period starting in 1994. However, upon examining the table, only four Gator Bowl games occur from 1994 to 2012. This count is less than six, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Gator Bowl\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Gator Bowl\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Gator Bowl\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Gator Bowl\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The sugar bowl is a specific game, so I need to look for rows where the Game Name includes \"Sugar Bowl\".\n\nLooking again:\n\n- 2004: 2005 Sugar Bowl\n- 2008: 2009 Orange Bowl (No)\n- 2012: 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl (No)\nWait, maybe that's not accurate. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: Year 2004, Game Name: 2005 Sugar Bowl\nRow 1: Year 2005, Game Name: 2006 Gator Bowl\nRow 2: Year 2006, Game Name: 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl\nRow 3: Year 2007, Game Name: 2008 Orange Bowl\nRow 4: Year 2008, Game Name: 2009 Orange Bowl\nRow 5: Year 2009, Game Name: 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl\nRow 6: Year 2010, Game Name: 2011 Orange Bowl\nRow 7: Year 2011, Game Name: 2012 Sugar Bowl\nRow 8: Year 2012, Game Name: 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl\n\nWait, so the sugar bowl games are in rows where the game name includes \"Sugar Bowl\". From the table:\n\n- Row 0: 2005 Sugar Bowl (Attendees 77,349)\n- Row 7: 2012 Sugar Bowl (Attendees 64,512)\n\nSo that's two sugar bowl games. But the claim says four. Maybe I'm missing some. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps in 2004, it's the 2005 Sugar Bowl, then in 2008, it's the 2009 Sugar Bowl, and so on. Wait, no, looking at row 4: Year 2008, Game Name: 2009 Orange Bowl. So not a sugar bowl.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check each game name for \"Sugar Bowl\". Let me list them:\n\n- 2005 Sugar Bowl\n- 2012 Sugar Bowl\n\nThat's two games. But the claim refers to four sugar bowl games. Maybe I'm missing some rows or misreading.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sugar bowl is a specific bowl game that occurs annually, so maybe each year has one, but in the table, only two are listed. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to multiple years, and the total attendance of those four games adds up to 491,424.\n\nWait, let me count the rows with \"Sugar Bowl\" as Game Name:\n\nRow 0: 2005 Sugar Bowl - Attendees 77,349\nRow 7: 2012 Sugar Bowl - Attendees 64,512\n\nThat's two games. So their combined attendance would be 77,349 + 64,512 = 141,861, which is way less than 491,424. So that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"sugar bowl game\". Maybe it refers to any bowl game held in Louisiana or something else. But looking at the table, only two are explicitly named as Sugar Bowl games.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if there's another sugar bowl game in the table that I didn't notice. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 2004 - 2005 Sugar Bowl\nRow1: 2005 - 2006 Gator Bowl\nRow2: 2006 - 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl\nRow3: 2007 - 2008 Orange Bowl\nRow4: 2008 - 2009 Orange Bowl\nRow5: 2009 - 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl\nRow6: 2010 - 2011 Orange Bowl\nRow7: 2011 - 2012 Sugar Bowl\nRow8: 2012 - 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl\n\nSo only two sugar bowl games in the table. Therefore, their combined attendance is 77,349 + 64,512 = 141,861, which doesn't reach 491k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim includes more years beyond what's listed in the table. But since the data stops at 2012, perhaps that's all we have.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if any other rows might be sugar bowl games. For example:\n\nIn row4: Year 2008, Game Name: 2009 Orange Bowl - Not a sugar bowl.\nRow7: 2012 Sugar Bowl\nIs there another one? Maybe in 2016 or earlier?\n\nWait, the table only goes up to 2012. So perhaps it's only two games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"sugar bowl\" isn't just about the game name but something else. But given the data, I think it's based on the Game Name column.\n\nTherefore, if there are only two sugar bowl games in the table, their total attendance is around 142k, which is way below 491k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant to refer to four different bowl games, not necessarily all sugar bowls. But since the claim specifically says \"sugar bowl game\", I have to go with that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see:\n\nLooking again at the Game Name column:\n\n2004: 2005 Sugar Bowl\n2005: 2006 Gator Bowl\n2006: 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl\n2007: 2008 Orange Bowl\n2008: 2009 Orange Bowl\n2009: 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl\n2010: 2011 Orange Bowl\n2011: 2012 Sugar Bowl\n2012: 2012 Russell Athletic Bowl\n\nSo only two sugar bowl games in the table. Therefore, their total is 77k + 64k = 141k, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something else. Wait, perhaps the four games are from 2004 to 2017 or something beyond what's listed here. But without that data, I can't confirm.\n\nBut given only two sugar bowl games in the table, their total is much lower than the claim. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the four sugar bowl games have a combined attendance of 491,424 is based on an error. Upon analyzing the provided table, only two sugar bowl games are listed: \n\n1. **2005 Sugar Bowl** with attendees 77,349\n2. **2012 Sugar Bowl** with attendees 64,512\n\nTheir combined attendance totals approximately 141,861, far below the stated figure of 491,424. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; only two sugar bowl games are listed in the table with a combined attendance of about 141,861.",
