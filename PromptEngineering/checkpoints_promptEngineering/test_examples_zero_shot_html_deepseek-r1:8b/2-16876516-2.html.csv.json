    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"9 adr have a bore of mm (in) just like every other bore in the table.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's stating that the 'bore' measurement for the engine model 9 adr uses the same unit, which is mm (in), as all other entries in the table.\n\nSo, my approach should be to check all the 'bore' cells in the table and see if they consistently use mm (in). If any of them use a different unit or provide inconsistent information, the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: name, cyl, bore, capacity, power, weight. The 'bore' column seems to have values like \"mm (in)\", which suggests that all entries might follow this format. However, I should verify each row's bore value.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- 9 ad has a bore of \"9 - cyl radial\" under the 'cyl' column, and the 'bore' cell is \"mm (in)\". So, it uses mm (in).\n\nNext, checking other rows:\n- 9 adb: same as above, bore is \"mm (in)\".\n- 9 adr: again, \"mm (in)\".\n- 7 ac: mentions \"mm (in)\" as well.\n- 9 ac: same here.\n- 9 nc: consistent with mm (in).\n- 9 nct: same.\n- 9 ab: same unit.\n- 9 na: consistent.\n- 9 nas: same.\n- 18 ab and 18 abs: both have \"mm (in)\".\n\nFrom this, it seems that every 'bore' cell in the table uses mm (in). There's no row where the bore is measured in a different unit like inches or centimeters. All entries follow the same format.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because all relevant cells confirm that the bore is in mm (in), without any exceptions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"9 adr\" have a bore of mm (in) consistent with every other entry in the table. By examining each 'bore' cell, we find they all use mm (in). Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"bore\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bore\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
