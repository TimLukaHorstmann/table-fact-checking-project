Let me focus on California and Pennsylvania.\n\nFor California (row index 4), the successor is William M. Gwin (D). For Pennsylvania (row index 2), the successor is William Bigler (D).

So, strictly speaking, their full names as per the table don't match just \"William\" without any additional details.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported because it doesn't account for the differences in their names beyond just \"William.\" The relevant cells would be those of California and Pennsylvania, so I'll note their row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"successor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has columns for 'state (class)', 'vacator', 'reason for change', 'successor', and 'date of successors formal installation'. Since the claim mentions \"class 2 state name,\" I'm particularly interested in the 'state (class)' column.\n\nLooking at each row, the 'state (class)' column lists several states with their respective classes.

The claim is: \"there be 2 successor who start in 1855, which be benjamin fitzpatrick and john parker hale.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there are two successors who took office in 1855, specifically named Benjamin Fitzpatrick and John Parker Hale.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a state, the reason for the change in leadership (which in this case, the legislature failed to elect on time), the successor, and the date of their formal installation. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if any successors started in 1855.\n\n1. New Hampshire: John Parker Hale took office on July 30, 1855.\n2. Alabama: Benjamin Fitzpatrick took office on November 26, 1855.\n3. Pennsylvania: William Bigler was installed in January 14, 1856.\n4. California: William M. Gwin started on January 13, 1857.\n5. Indiana: Graham N. Fitch began on February 4, 1857.\n\nSo, from the table, two successors\u2014John Parker Hale and Benjamin Fitzpatrick\u2014did start in 1855. Both are listed in different states: New Hampshire and Alabama respectively.\n\nNow, I need to check if these names exactly match those in the claim. The claim lists \"Benjamin fitzpatrick\" (without a period after his last name) and \"John parker hale.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- John Parker Hale's full name is listed as \"john parker hale (r)\". The claim uses \"John parker hale\"\u2014the capitalization of the names seems to match, except for the addition of \"(r)\" in the table. I'm not sure if that's a typo or intentional. But the key part is the first names and last names.\n\n- Benjamin Fitzpatrick is listed as \"benjamin fitzpatrick (d)\". The claim has \"Benjamin fitzpatrick\"\u2014again, similar except for the party affiliation noted in parentheses. \n\nSince the table's successors' names match those in the claim, the claim seems to be accurate based on the provided data.\n\nI also need to make sure that there are exactly two successors who started in 1855. From the table, only July and November 1855 entries fall into that year. The other years are 1856, 1857, so they don't count.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that two people, William M. Gwin and Graham N. Fitch, joined Congress in 1857. My task is to check if there's any information in the provided HTML table that supports or contradicts this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various states, their state classes, vacators, reasons for change, successors, and the date of the successor's formal installation. Each row represents a different state with its corresponding data.\n\nI'll start by identifying if William M. Gwin and Graham N. Fitch are mentioned in the table. Scanning through the 'successor' column:\n\n- The first row mentions John Parker Hale.\n- Second, Benjamin Fitzpatrick.\n- Third, William Bigler.\n- Fourth, William M. Gwin (D).\n- Fifth, Graham N. Fitch (D).\n\nSo, both William M. Gwin and Graham N. Fitch appear as successors in their respective rows, specifically in the fourth and fifth rows of the table.\n\nNow, I need to check when they joined Congress. The claim specifies 1857. Looking at the 'date of successors formal installation' column:\n\n- For William M. Gwin, it's January 13, 1857.\n- For Graham N. Fitch, it's February 4, 1857.\n\nBoth dates fall in 1857, which aligns with the claim that they joined Congress in 1857.\n\nAdditionally, both were Democrats (indicated by the '(d)' next to their names), which is consistent and doesn't affect their joining Congress.\n\nI don't see any information in the table that would contradict this.

The claim says, \"there be 5 successors in congress between 1855 and 1857.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about successors in Congress who took office during the years 1855 to 1857. So I need to look at how many successors are listed in the table within that time frame.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several states and their respective successors with installation dates. Each row represents a different state where there was a vacancy in Congress, leading to a successor being appointed. The column we care about here is \"successor,\" but more importantly, the date of their formal installation. \n\nI should check each row's date to see if it falls between 1855 and 1857. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. New Hampshire: July 30, 1855 \u2013 that's within the range.\n2. Alabama: November 26, 1855 \u2013 also within the range.\n3. Pennsylvania: January 14, 1856 \u2013 yes.\n4. California: January 13, 1857 \u2013 still within 1855-1857.\n5. Indiana: February 4, 1857 \u2013 also within the timeframe.\n\nSo there are five successors who were installed during this period.

It has columns: state (class), vacator, reason for change, successor, and date of successors formal installation. My focus is on the 'successor' column because that's what the claim is referring to.\n\nI need to find the successors for Indiana and Alabama.

The claim says both successors are named William, but according to the table, that's not the case for either Indiana or Alabama.\n\nSo the claim is making a statement about two specific states (Indiana and Alabama) having successors named William.

The claim says, \"the only class 2 state name be california.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, I see that each row has information about a state, its vacator, reason for change, successor, and the date of installation. The states listed are New Hampshire, Alabama, Pennsylvania, California, and Indiana. Each of these is in class 2 as per the \"state (class)\" column.\n\nThe claim mentions \"class 2,\" so I should check if all other states in class 2 besides California are excluded or not. Wait, no, it's saying that the only class 2 state name is California. That would mean that all other entries with class 2 should be incorrect or non-existent, but according to the table, there are multiple class 2 states: New Hampshire (2), Alabama (3), Pennsylvania (3), California (3), and Indiana (3). Wait, no, hold on. The \"state (class)\" column shows that each state has a class number. For example, New Hampshire is in class 2, while Alabama, Pennsylvania, California, and Indiana are in class 3.\n\nWait, so the claim says \"the only class 2 state name be california.\" So it's asserting that only California is in class 2, and no other states are in class 2. But looking at the table, New Hampshire is also listed as class 2. That would mean the claim is incorrect because there's another state (New Hampshire) also classified as class 2.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to check all rows where \"state (class)\" is 2. In the table, only New Hampshire has a class of 2. California and others are in class 3. So the claim is false because there's at least one other state (New Hampshire) in class 2 besides California.\n\nNow, for relevant cells, I need to find which cells support this verification. The \"state (class)\" column is crucial here because it shows which states are in class 2. Also, the row where New Hampshire is listed would be relevant because that's the other state in class 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"state (class)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"there be 1 successor that start in 1855 which be william bigler.\" So, the claim is stating that there is exactly one successor who started their role in 1855, and that person is William Bigler.\n\nNow, I need to look at the table provided. The table has several columns: state (class), vacator, reason for change, successor, and date of successors formal installation.\n\nI should go through each row to see if any successor matches both criteria: starting in 1855 and being named William Bigler.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- State: New Hampshire (2)\n- Vacant: vacant\n- Reason: Legislature failed to elect on time\n- Successor: John Parker Hale (r)\n- Date: July 30, 1855\n\nHere, the successor is John Parker Hale, not William Bigler, and his installation date is in July 1855.\n\nSecond row:\n- State: Alabama (3)\n- Vacant: vacant\n- Reason: Legislature failed to elect on time\n- Successor: Benjamin Fitzpatrick (d)\n- Date: November 26, 1855\n\nAgain, the successor is Benjamin Fitzpatrick, not William Bigler. His installation date is in November 1855.\n\nThird row:\n- State: Pennsylvania (3)\n- Vacant: vacant\n- Reason: Legislature failed to elect on time\n- Successor: William Bigler (d)\n- Date: January 14, 1856\n\nWait a minute, here we have William Bigler as the successor. His date of installation is January 14, 1856. So, his formal installation was in 1856, not 1855.\n\nFourth row:\n- State: California (3)\n- Vacant: vacant\n- Reason: Legislature failed to elect on time\n- Successor: William M Gwin (d)\n- Date: January 13, 1857\n\nThis successor is different from Bigler. His installation was in 1857.\n\nFifth row:\n- State: Indiana (3)\n- Vacant: vacant\n- Reason: Legislature failed to elect on time\n- Successor: Graham N Fitch (d)\n- Date: February 4, 1857\n\nAnother successor with a different name and date.\n\nSo, in the entire table, there is only one instance where William Bigler was the successor, but his installation was in January 1856, not 1855. Therefore, he didn't start in 1855; he started the following year.\n\nThis means that the claim's assertion that \"there be 1 successor that starts in 1855 which be william bigler\" is false because William Bigler's succession happened in 1856, not 1855.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify the relevant cells. Since only Pennsylvania has William Bigler as the successor, but his date is in January 1856, the relevant row is the third one (row index 2) and the column 'successor'.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's no successor starting in 1855 named William Bigler.
