    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and instructions. The claim is about the 1991 season where West Indies were the holders at the end of the series, and England was the host with a series result of drawn.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each relevant cell in the table related to 1991. Let me go row by row starting from row 16, which mentions 1995, but that's after 1991, so probably not relevant yet.\n\nWait, let me check row numbers properly. The table starts with row 0 as total and then goes up. Wait, no, the rows are numbered from 0 to 22, with row 0 being the header, I think. Wait, actually, looking at the table, each row has data for a specific year. For example, row 0 is the total, row 1 might be 1980 or so.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The table provided starts with row 0 as \"total\" and goes up to row 22. So row 16 corresponds to 1995, which is after 1991, so maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows.\n\nWait no, perhaps each row is a season. For example, row 16 is 1995, but what about row numbers before that? Let me check again:\n\nRow indices go from 0 (total) up to 22. So for 1991, which would be somewhere in the earlier rows. Let's see: Row 18 is 2000, row 19 is 2003-04, so 1991 should be around row 16 or before.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each row for the year 1991. Looking through the table:\n\nRow 16 is 1995\nRow 17 is 1997-98\nRow 18 is 2000\n\nSo perhaps there's no specific row for 1991 in the table. That might be a problem because if the table doesn't have data for 1991, how can I verify?\n\nWait, maybe the total section at the bottom has some totals, but let me check the claim again. The claim is about the 1991 season where West Indies were the holders and England was the host with a series result of drawn.\n\nSo I need to find cells related to 1991 in the table. If the table doesn't have a row for 1991, then there's no data to check against, which would mean the claim can't be fully supported. Alternatively, maybe the totals at the end include series outcomes or holders.\n\nLooking at the total section: It shows that West Indies won 105 matches, England 28, etc., but it doesn't specify series results. So perhaps the series outcome isn't directly stated in the table, making it difficult to verify.\n\nAlternatively, if there's no row for 1991, then maybe the claim is not supported because there's no data for that specific season in the provided table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table. Each row represents a specific season, so if row 16 is 1995 and row 17 is 1997-98, then 1991 would be between rows 15 and 16? But looking at the data:\n\nRow 15: 2004\nRow 16: 2007\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted. Let me list out the rows with their years to clarify.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: total\nRow 1: (1980)\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count each row as per the data given. Each row has a \"Year\" column, so let's check which rows have the year 1991.\n\nBut from the table provided, I can see that rows are numbered up to 22, but the years go from around 1980 up to 2009. So 1991 would be somewhere in the middle, say row 15 or so. But looking through the data:\n\n- Row 16: 1995\n- Row 17: 1997-98\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some rows. Alternatively, perhaps the table skips some years, and 1991 isn't explicitly listed.\n\nIf that's the case, then there's no data in the table for 1991, meaning we can't verify whether West Indies were the holders or if the series was drawn.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim refers to a specific aspect like England being the host with a drawn series, perhaps looking at row 18, which is 2000, and see if it's relevant. But that's after 1991.\n\nSo without data for 1991 in the table, I can't confirm the claim. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE because there's no supporting information for 1991 in the provided table.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not include specific data for the 1991 season, making it impossible to verify the claim based on the provided information.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**FALSE**",
