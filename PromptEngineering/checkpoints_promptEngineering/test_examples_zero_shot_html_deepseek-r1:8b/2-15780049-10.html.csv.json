    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim again: \"there 5 game list with the date of each be april 21 , april 24 , april 27 , april 29 , and may 2\". So, the claim is stating that there are five games listed, each corresponding to specific dates in April and May.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice it has a 'game' column with indices from 1 to 5. Each row represents a game with details like date, team, score, etc.\n\nNow, let's check the dates in each game:\n\n- Game 1: April 21\n- Game 2: April 24\n- Game 3: April 27\n- Game 4: April 29\n- Game 5: May 2\n\nThe claim lists the same dates except for the last one, which is May 2 instead of April 30. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nNext, I'll check if all five games are indeed listed in the table. Yes, each game from 1 to 5 has an entry with corresponding details.\n\nNow, considering the claim mentions specific dates, including May 2, which is correct as per the table. However, the initial part of the claim says \"there 5 game list with the date of each be april 21 , april 24 , april 27 , april 29 , and may 2\". The use of \"and\" after the comma might suggest a different structure, but in the table, all five games are indeed present with those exact dates.\n\nBut wait, there's something else. In the 'date' column, each row has the date, so that aligns with the claim checking each game's date against those listed.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that all five games have their respective dates correctly specified in the table. From the table:\n\n- Game 1: April 21 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 2: April 24 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 3: April 27 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 4: April 29 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 5: May 2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll five games have the specified dates as per the claim. Therefore, the statement seems to be true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are exactly five games listed in the table and whether all the claimed dates correspond correctly. The table has five rows (games), each with unique dates as stated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the claim is fully supported by the data in the relevant cells of the 'date' column for each game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists five specific dates for the games. Checking each game's date against these:\n\n- Game 1: April 21 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 2: April 24 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 3: April 27 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 4: April 29 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Game 5: May 2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll dates match, confirming the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"In the May 2 game, the high point for the Toronto Raptor be Dell Curry (17) and high rebound be Antonio Davis (12).\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the game on May 2. Scanning through the 'game' column, I see that the games are numbered from 1 to 5. Game 5 is listed as May 2, so that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, I need to check each part of the claim against this specific row (row index 4 since it's zero-indexed). \n\nLooking at the 'team' column for game 5: It says \"detroit,\" not \"toronto raptor.\" This is a discrepancy because the team in question is Toronto Raptors, but the table lists Detroit. So already, there might be an issue.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if Dell Curry and Antonio Davis are indeed listed as high points and rebounds for that game, regardless of the team name? Or perhaps the claim is misstating the team. Let me see.\n\nIn the 'high points' column for game 5, it's \"dell curry (17)\". That matches the claim's mention of Dell Curry scoring 17. \n\nLooking at the 'high rebounds' column: It says \"keon clark (16).\" Hmm, that's not Antonio Davis. So according to the table, the high rebounder in game 5 is Keon Clark with 16 rebounds, not Antonio Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the location where this game took place is listed as \"the palace of auburn hills\" with attendance 22076, which aligns with the details in the table but doesn't affect the player stats directly.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- The high point for May 2 is indeed Dell Curry (17), which supports part of the claim.\n- However, the high rebounder is Keon Clark (16), not Antonio Davis. \n\nSince the claim specifically states that Antonio Davis has the high rebound, this part is incorrect.\n\nMoreover, the team in the table is Detroit, not Toronto Raptors. So there's an inconsistency here as well. But perhaps the main issue is the rebound part.\n\nWait, but does the table list the team correctly? Yes, game 5 lists the team as Detroit. Therefore, the claim might also be incorrect in stating it's a Toronto Raptor game because the table shows it's Detroit.\n\nHowever, the primary assertion in the claim is about the players' stats regardless of the team, or perhaps it's a mistake in the team name. So even if the game was against Toronto Raptors, the stats should match.\n\nBut the key issue is that the high rebounds are not by Antonio Davis but Keon Clark. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on this point.\n\nSo, putting all together: The claim has two parts. One part (high points) is correct, and the other (high rebounds) is incorrect. Additionally, the team might be wrong, but that's a separate issue. However, since the main statistics are partially incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nI should also note which cells in the table support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be the 'game' (row 4), 'high points', and 'high rebounds' columns because those are where the claim's specifics can be checked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Antonio Davis did not have the high rebound in game 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then specify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"Chris Child have the high in assist 2 time with 14 and 10 and share the high in assist 1 time with alvin williams with 6.\" \n\nFirst, I should break this down. It mentions Chris Child having the highest assists two times with values 14 and 10, and then sharing the top assist once with Alvin Williams at 6.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. The relevant column for assists is \"high assists.\"\n\nI need to check the \"high assists\" column for both Chris Child and Alvin Williams across all games.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Game 1: High assist by Antonio Davis (14)\n- Game 2: High assist by Antonio Davis (14) again\n- Game 3: High assist by Antonio Davis (8)\n- Game 4: Keon Clark (16)\n- Game 5: Antonio Davis (12)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, in the table provided, I need to parse each row correctly.\n\nRow 1:\n- game: 1\n- date: april 21\n- team: detroit\n- score: l 63 - 85 (ot)\n- high points: antonio davis (15)\n- high rebounds: antonio davis (14)\n- high assists: alvin williams (6)\n\nRow 2:\n- game: 2\n- date: april 24\n- team: detroit\n- score: l 91 - 96 (ot)\n- high points: chris childs (22)\n- high rebounds: antonio davis (14)\n- high assists: chris childs (14)\n\nRow 3:\n- game: 3\n- date: april 27\n- team: detroit\n- score: w 94 - 84 (ot)\n- high points: antonio davis (30)\n- high rebounds: antonio davis (8)\n- high assists: chris childs (10)\n\nRow 4:\n- game: 4\n- date: april 29\n- team: detroit\n- score: w 89 - 83 (ot)\n- high points: morris peterson (20)\n- high rebounds: keon clark (16)\n- high assists: alvin williams (9)\n\nRow 5:\n- game:5\n- date: may2\n- team:detroit\n- score: l82-85(ot)\n- high points: dell curry (17)\n- high rebounds: antonio davis (12)\n- high assists: chris childs, alvin williams (6)\n\nWait a second. So in the first game, high assist is by Alvin Williams with 6.\n\nIn Game 2, Chris Childs has 14.\n\nGame3: Chris Childs 10.\n\nGame4: Alvin Williams 9.\n\nGame5: Both Chris Childs and Alvin Williams with 6.\n\nSo let's list out the high assists:\n\n- Game1: Alvin Williams (6)\n- Game2: Chris Childs (14)\n- Game3: Chris Childs (10)\n- Game4: Alvin Williams (9)\n- Game5: Both (6)\n\nNow, the claim says Chris Childs has the high assist two times with 14 and 10. That's correct because in Game2 he had 14 and in Game3 he had 10.\n\nThen, it says they share the high in assists one time with 6. Looking at Game5, both have 6 as the highest. So that's one instance where Chris Childs ties with Alvin Williams for the top assist.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the team be detroit for every game play and the location be the palace of auburns hill or air canada centre.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The first part talks about the team being Detroit in every game. Looking at the table, each row represents a different game. The 'team' column has values like \"detroit\" repeated multiple times, so that seems consistent.\n\nNext, the location part says it's either the palace of Auburns hill or air canada centre. Checking the 'location attendance' column, I see entries like \"the palace of auburn hills\" and \"air canada centre.\" So, the locations do alternate between these two places. \n\nNow, to verify this, I need to check each game's location against the claim. In rows 0 through 4, the locations are either \"the palace of auburn hills\" or \"air canada centre.\" But wait, in row 5, the location is again \"the palace of auburn hills.\" So does that mean it alternates correctly? Let me count: \n\nRow 0: palace\nRow 1: palace\nRow 2: air canada\nRow 3: palace\nRow 4: air canada\nRow 5: palace\n\nHmm, actually, rows 0 and 1 are both palace, then row 2 is air canada, row 3 is palace, row 4 is air canada, and row 5 is palace. That doesn't strictly alternate every game but seems to have some pattern where sometimes two in a row are the same palace. However, the claim says \"or,\" so it's acceptable if it's either one or the other, not necessarily alternating.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again:\n\nRow 0: palace\nRow 1: palace\nRow 2: air canada\nRow 3: palace\nRow 4: air canada\nRow 5: palace\n\nSo, it's more like every other game is at air canada and the rest are at palace. But the claim says \"the location be the palace of auburns hill or air canada centre.\" So as long as each game is either one or the other, regardless of how often each occurs.\n\nBut wait, looking at row 0: it's Detroit, palace\nRow1: Detroit, palace\nRow2: Detroit, air canada\nRow3: Detroit, palace\nRow4: Detroit, air canada\nRow5: Detroit, palace\n\nSo yes, each game is either palace or air canada. So the location part holds.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied across all games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the team is Detroit for every game and the location is either the palace of Auburns Hill or Air Canada Centre. Checking each game:\n\n- Team: All games are Detroit.\n- Locations: Alternate between palace and air canada, both valid as per the claim.\n\nThus, both conditions hold true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"in the april 29 game against detroit with score w 89 - 83 the location and attendance be air canada centre 20112\".\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific game on April 29th against Detroit. Looking at the table, there are several games listed with dates. April 29 appears in row 4 (since rows start from 0, but wait, looking back, the first row is index 0 for game 1 on April 21. So game 4 would be row index 3. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 1: Game 1, April 21\nRow 2: Game 2, April 24\nRow 3: Game 3, April 27\nRow 4: Game 4, April 29\n\nYes, so the game in question is row index 3.\n\nThe claim mentions the score as \"w 89 - 83\". Looking at row 3's 'score' column, it says \"w 89 - 83 (ot)\". So that matches. Therefore, this part checks out.\n\nNext, the location and attendance are stated as \"air canada centre 20112\".\n\nLooking at the 'location attendance' column in row 3: It says \"air canada centre 20112\". That's exactly what's claimed. So that also matches.\n\nI should make sure there's no discrepancy. The claim specifies both the location and attendance, so I need to check if those two specific data points are correct.\n\nSince both the score and the location/attendance in row index 3 match the claim, this makes the claim TRUE.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the 'location attendance' column for row index 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the claim and then analyze the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions five games listed in April. The month is 'april', but looking at the table, I see dates like 'april 21', 'april 24', 'april 27', 'april 29', and 'may 2'. Wait, the last date is May 2nd, which is outside of April. So does that mean there are only four games in April? Let me count: game numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are in April (April 21, 24, 27, 29), while game 5 is on May 2. So that's four games in April.\n\nThe claim says \"there be 5 game list during the month of apr.\" If the user meant within April, then it would be false because there are only four games. However, sometimes people might consider the end of April and into May as part of the same month, but strictly speaking, April ends on the 30th or 31st. So May 2nd is definitely in May.\n\nWait, let me double-check the dates:\n\n- Game 1: April 21\n- Game 2: April 24\n- Game 3: April 27\n- Game 4: April 29\n- Game 5: May 2\n\nYes, that's four games in April and one in May.

Therefore, the claim that there are five games during April is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant.

That's three games now.\n\nRow 5:\n- Team: Detroit\n- Location: Palace of Auburn Hills\n\nAnother game that fits both conditions, bringing the total to four.\n\nSo out of five games, four meet both criteria. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns we looked at were \"team\" and \"location attendance.\" Each row where team is Detroit and location is Palace of Auburn Hills is relevant.\n\nLet's list each relevant row by their index:\n\nRow 0: Game against Detroit at the Palace.\nRow 1: Same as above.\nRow 3: Same.\nRow 4: Same.\n\nSo, rows 0,1,3,4 are relevant for \"team\" and \"location attendance.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "chris child collect double digit assist in 3 of the 5 game",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Chris Child collect double digit assist in 3 of the 5 game.\" So, we're looking for instances where Chris Child had at least 10 assists in three out of the five games listed.\n\nI'll start by examining each row of the table to see if Chris Child is mentioned as having double-digit assists. The relevant column here is \"high assists.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: No mention of Chris Child, so irrelevant.\n2. Row 1: Chris Child isn't listed either; Antonio Davis has 14 rebounds but that's another column.\n3. Row 2: High assists are attributed to Chris Child with 6. Since this is a single-digit number (6 < 10), it doesn't count.\n4. Row 3: High assists are by someone else, so irrelevant for Chris Child.\n5. Row 4: High assists aren't Chris Child's; Keon Clark has 16, which isn't relevant here.\n6. Row 5: Wait, row 2 is April 24, row 3 is April 27, row 4 April 29, and row 5 May 2.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, each row corresponds to a game number from 1 to 5. So:\n\n- Game 1 (row 0): Antonio Davis has 6 assists.\n- Game 2 (row 1): Antonio Davis again with 14 rebounds but that's another column; high assists are by Chris Child with 6? Wait, no: the table shows in row 1, under \"high assists\" it says \"chris childs (14)\", which is different from \"high rebounds\". So in game 2, high assists by Chris Child is 14.\n\nWait, let me double-check the table:\n\nLooking at each row's \"high assists\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Antonio Davis (6)\n- Row 1: Chris Child (6) or is it something else? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait no, in row 1 (game 2), \"high rebounds\" are Antonio Davis (14), and \"high assists\" are Chris Child (14). So in game 2, Chris Child has 14 assists.\n\nSimilarly, in row 5 (game 5), the high assists are shared by Chris Child and Alvin Williams with 6 each. So that's 6 assists.\n\nWait, but let me check each row correctly:\n\n- Row 0: Antonio Davis (15) points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists.\n- Row 1: Chris Child (22) points, Antonio Davis (14 rebounds), Chris Child (14 assists).\n- Row 2: Antonio Davis (30) points, 8 rebounds, Chris Child (10 assists).\nWait no, row 2 is April 27, and under \"high assists\" it's Chris Child (10). So that's 10, which is double-digit.\n\nWait, let me clarify each game:\n\nGame 1:\n- Antonio Davis: 15 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists.\nSo Chris Child isn't mentioned here; only Antonio Davis has 6 assists. So no assist by Chris Child in this game.\n\nGame 2:\n- Chris Child: 22 points, Antonio Davis: 14 rebounds, Chris Child: 14 assists.\nHere, Chris Child has 14 assists, which is double-digit.\n\nGame 3:\n- High assists are Chris Child (10). That's two digits, so counts.\n\nGame 4:\n- Morris Peterson scores 20, but high assists are Alvin Williams with 9. So 9 is single-digit; not double-digit.\n\nWait no, in row 4: \"high assists\" is alvin williams (9), which is less than 10.\n\nWait the table shows for game 4:\n\n<td>morris peterson (20)</td>\n<td>keon clark (16)</td>\n<td>alvin williams (9)</td>\n\nSo yes, 9 is single-digit. So no double-digit assists by Chris Child here.\n\nGame 5:\n- High assists are shared: chris childs , alvin williams (6). So each has 6; both are single-digit.\n\nWait, that's 6, which is still under 10. So in game 5, neither have double-digit assists.\n\nSo now, let me list for Chris Child:\n\nWhich games have him with assist counts:\n\n- Game 2: 14\n- Game 3: 10\n\nIn game 2 and game 3, he has double-digit assists.\n\nWait, but the claim is that Chris Child collected double-digit assists in 3 out of 5 games. So let's count how many times this happened.\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n1. Game 1: No\n2. Game 2: Yes (14)\n3. Game 3: Yes (10)\n4. Game 4: No (9)\n5. Game 5: No (6)\n\nSo that's two games where Chris Child had double-digit assists. Therefore, the claim is stating he did it in three out of five, but actually, it was only two.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: Antonio Davis has 6 assists; no mention of Chris Child.\nRow 1: Chris Child has 14 assists (double-digit).\nRow 2: Chris Child has 10 assists (double-digit).\nRow 3: Alvin Williams has 9, which is single-digit.\nRow 4: Alvin Williams again with 6.\nWait wait, in row 5 (game 5), high assists are both at 6. So each of them has 6.\n\nTherefore, across five games:\n\n- Game 2: Yes\n- Game 3: Yes\nSo two instances.\n\nThus, the claim is that he had double-digit assists in three games, but actually only two.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the table. Let me read it again.\n\nEach row has \"high rebounds\" and \"high assists\".\n\nLooking at each game:\n\nGame 1 (row0):\n- High rebounds: Antonio Davis (14)\n- High assists: Antonio Davis (6)\n\nNo mention of Chris Child here.\n\nGame2 (row1):\n- High rebounds: Antonio Davis (14)\n- High assists: Chris Child (14)\n\nSo yes, he has double-digit here.\n\nGame3 (row2):\n- High rebounds: Antonio Davis (8)\n- High assists: Chris Child (10)\n\nYes, another instance.\n\nGame4 (row3):\n- High rebounds: Keon Clark (something? Wait, let's check the table again.)\n\nWait the original table as provided:\n\nIt seems that in row3 (game4), under \"high rebounds\" it says \"keon clark (16)\" and \"high assists\" is \"alvin williams (9)\". So yes.\n\nGame5 (row4):\n- High rebounds: Keon Clark (something) [I think]\n- High assists: Both Chris Child and Alvin Williams with 6 each.\n\nSo only two games where Chris Child has double-digit assists.\n\nThus, the claim that he did it in three out of five is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be no, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the table rows. Let me re-examine:\n\nOriginal table:\n\n| Game 1: |\n|---|\n| Antonio Davis (15) |\n| Antonio Davis (14) |\n| Chris Child (6) |\n\nWait, that might not match the user's exact table, but based on their initial description:\n\nLooking back, the user provided a table with headers and data for each game.\n\nSo Game 1: Antonio Davis has 15 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists. So no Chris Child here.\n\nGame2: Chris Child has 22 points, Antonio Davis 14 rebounds, Chris Child 14 assists.\n\nGame3: Antonio Davis 30 points, 8 rebounds, Chris Child 10 assists.\n\nGame4: Morris Peterson (20), Keon Clark (16), Alvin Williams (9) \u2013 so high assists are 9.\n\nGame5: Chris Child and Alvin each with 6.\n\nSo yes, only two games where Chris Child has double-digit assists: Game2 and Game3. So in five games, he does it twice, not three times. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Chris Child collected double-digit assists in three out of five games is false. Based on the provided data, Chris Child achieved this in only two games.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; Chris Child had double-digit assists in two games, not three.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - For each game, note the player with the highest assists (marked as \"high assists\").\n\n2. **Analyze Each Game:**\n   - **Game 1:** Antonio Davis had 6 assists.\n   - **Game 2:** Chris Child had 14 assists.\n   - **Game 3:** Chris Child had 10 assists.\n   - **Game 4:** Alvin Williams had 9 assists.\n   - **Game 5:** Both Chris Child and Alvin Williams had 6 assists.\n\n3. **Count Instances of Double-Digit Assists:**\n   - Only Games 2 and 3 meet the criteria, totaling two instances.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim that Chris Child achieved double-digit assists in three games is incorrect; he did so only twice.",

    "claim": "the april 29 game be the highest attend at the air canada centre",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about an HTML table is true or false based on the data in the table. The specific claim here is: \"the april 29 game be the highest attend at the air canada centre.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It mentions that on April 29th, there was a game where the attendance at Air Canada Centre was the highest compared to other games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc., including the location and attendance numbers. The goal is to find if April 29's game had the highest attendance among all the games listed.\n\nSo, I'll start by identifying which rows are relevant. Since the claim refers to April 29, I should focus on the row where the date is April 29. Scanning through the table, I see that it's the fourth row (row index 3) with a date of \"april 29\". \n\nNext, I need to find the attendance for that specific game. In column 'location attendance', the entry for April 29th is \"air canada centre 20112\". The number here is 20112. Now, I have to compare this number against all other games' attendances to see if it's the highest.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n- Row 0: 22076\n- Row 1: 22076\n- Row 2: 20138\n- Row 3: 20112\n- Row 4: 22076\n\nComparing all these numbers, the highest attendance is 22076. But in April 29's game, the attendance was 20112, which is less than 22076. Therefore, April 29 did not have the highest attendance; instead, games with dates April 21 and April 24 had higher attendances of 22076.\n\nSo, the claim is false because the April 29 game does not have the highest attendance at Air Canada Centre in the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the April 29 game has the highest attendance at Air Canada Centre. Checking the table, the April 29 game had 20,112 attendees. Comparing this to other games:\n\n- Other games (e.g., April 21 and April 24) at the same venue had higher attendances of 22,076.\n\nThus, the claim is false as April 29's attendance was not the highest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
