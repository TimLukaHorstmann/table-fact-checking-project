    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first: \"there be only 2 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\"\n\nSo, the claim is saying that there are exactly two instances where a team drew a game (i.e., the 'drawn' column has a value of 1) and their goal differences were specifically 34-25 and 36-29. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns for this analysis are 'drawn', 'goal difference', and perhaps 'points'. However, since the claim is about two specific goal differences when a team drew, the main focus should be on the 'drawn' and 'goal difference' columns.\n\nLet me go through each row to check where 'drawn' is 1 and the corresponding goal difference matches either 34-25 or 36-29.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 1: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 2: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 3: drawn=1. Goal difference is 34 - 25. That's one occurrence matching part of the claim.\nRow 4: drawn=1. Goal difference is 36 - 29. That's another occurrence matching the second part.\nRow 5: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 6: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\nRow 7: drawn=0 \u2192 Not relevant.\n\nSo, from the table, there are two rows where 'drawn' is 1 and the goal differences are exactly 34-25 and 36-29. Wait, no\u2014looking again:\n\nWait, row 3's goal difference is 34 - 25, which is one instance. Row 4 has a drawn of 1 but the goal difference is 36 - 29, that's another. So two instances where 'drawn' is 1 and the specific goal differences are present.\n\nBut hold on\u2014looking at row 3: games=7, drawn=1, lost=3, goal difference=34-25, points=7.\nRow 4: same games=7, drawn=1, lost=3, but goal difference=36-29, points=7.\n\nSo that's two rows where the team drew (drawn=1) and each has one of the specific goal differences. So the claim says there are only two occasions when a team drew and had those exact goal differences. That seems to be correct because in other drawn games, the goal difference is different, like 41-19 or 40-13.\n\nWait, but let me check if any other row has 'drawn'=1 with either of these goal differences. For example:\n\nIs there a third row where 'drawn'=1 and goal diff=34-25? No, each of those two rows seems unique in their respective goal differences when drawn.\n\nSo the claim is true because there are exactly two such occasions. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are only two instances where a team drew a game with specific goal differences. Upon examining the table, we find exactly two rows where 'drawn' equals 1 and the corresponding goal difference matches either 34-25 or 36-29.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"when the goal difference is 11 - 71, the points are 0.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The goal difference column in the table shows the difference between goals scored and goals conceded. For example, one row has \"51 - 10\" which probably means the team scored 51 goals and conceded 10, resulting in a goal difference of +41.\n\nLooking at the claim, it specifically mentions \"11 - 71.\" I need to check if this exact phrase appears in any row's goal difference column. Scanning each row:\n\n1. The first row has \"51 - 10.\"\n2. Second: \"40 - 13.\"\n3. Third: \"41 - 19.\"\n4. Fourth: \"34 - 25.\"\n5. Fifth: \"36 - 29.\"\n6. Sixth: \"32 - 27.\"\n7. Seventh: \"17 - 68.\"\n8. Eighth: \"11 - 71.\"\n\nYes, the eighth row has \"11 - 71\" as the goal difference.\n\nNext, I need to check what the points column says for this row.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"there be never a time when point be greater than 12 and only 1 occasion when the point be less than 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim means. The first part is \"never a time when points are greater than 12.\" So I need to check all the 'points' column values in the table to see if any exceed 12. The second part mentions \"only 1 occasion when points are less than 2,\" so I'll look for rows where points are below 2.\n\nLet me start by examining each row's points column:\n\nRow 0: 12 - this is equal to 12, not greater, so it doesn't violate the first condition.\nRow 1: Also 12 - same as above.\nRow 2: 10 - this is less than 12 but more than 2.\nRow 3: 7 - again between 2 and 12.\nRow 4: 7 - same as above.\nRow 5: 6 - still above 2.\nRow 6: 2 - wait, the claim says \"less than 2,\" so points equal to 2 wouldn't count. So no row has points less than 2.\nRow 7: 0 - that's definitely less than 2.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies only one occasion where points are less than 2. However, in the table, both rows 6 and 7 have points equal to 2 and 0 respectively. Row 6 has 2 points, which is not less than 2. Only row 7 has 0, which is less than 2. So there's only one occurrence where points are below 2.\n\nNow, checking for any points greater than 12. All the points in the table are either 0, 2, 6, 7, 10, or 12. None exceed 12. So the first part of the claim holds.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are satisfied: no points over 12 and only one point below 2. The claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"when the point be 12 the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It's saying that whenever points (points column) are 12, there should be two corresponding goal differences: one is 51-10 and another is 40-13.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various stats like games played, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. My task is to find rows where the points column has 12 and check their goal difference.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Points = 12, Goal Difference = 51 -10\n2. Row 1: Points =12, Goal Difference=40-13\n3. Row2: Points=10\n4. Row3:Points=7\n5.Row4:Points=7\n6.Row5:Points=6\n7.Row6:Points=2\n8.Row7:Points=0\n\nSo only rows 0 and 1 have points equal to 12. Now, check their goal difference:\n\n- Row0:51 -10 \u2192 which is 41.\n- Row1:40-13 \u2192 which is 27.\n\nThe claim states that when points are 12, the goal differences should be 51-10 and 40-13, which are specific numbers. But in the table, those rows have different goal differences. Wait, actually, no\u2014the claim mentions two specific goal difference values: 51-10 and 40-13.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow0 has a goal difference of 51-10 (which is 41). So that matches one part of the claim.\n\nRow1 has a goal difference of 40-13, which is 27. That also matches the second part of the claim.\n\nWait, but in the table, both these rows are present and have those specific goal differences. So when points are 12, both 51-10 and 40-13 are present as goal differences.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table:\n\nRow0: points=12, GD=51-10 (so GD is 41)\nRow1: points=12, GD=40-13 (GD=27)\n\nSo yes, in the table, when points are 12, both those two specific goal differences appear. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the claim again: \"when the point be 12 the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 -13.\" So it's saying that for points=12, there are two corresponding GDs: 51-10 and 40-13.\n\nIn the table, both these GDs exist in different rows where points=12. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if those are the only rows with points=12 or if there are more. In this case, only two rows have points=12: row0 and row1, each with one of those GDs. So the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the claim and then checking each condition against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be only 2 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" Hmm, breaking that down, it's saying there are exactly two instances where points equal 7 and losses are also 3. \n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several rows, each representing a game with different values for 'games', 'drawn', 'lost', 'goal difference', and 'points'. My task is to find all rows where both 'points' are 7 and 'lost' is 3.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nFirst row: points=12, lost=1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nSecond row: same as first in some aspects, but points=12, lost=1 \u2192 No.\nThird row: points=10, lost=2 \u2192 No.\nFourth row: points=7, lost=3 \u2192 This matches one instance.\nFifth row: points=7, lost=3 \u2192 Another match.\nSixth row: points=6, lost=4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nSeventh row: points=2, lost=6 \u2192 No.\nEighth row: points=0, lost=7 \u2192 No.\n\nSo there are exactly two rows where points are 7 and losses are 3. That seems to satisfy the claim. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns involved are 'points' and 'lost'. So for each of those two matching rows, their respective row indices are needed.\n\nThe fourth row is index 3 (since we start counting from 0), and the fifth row is index 4. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 3, column 'points'\n- Row 4, column 'lost'\n\nWait, no. Actually, for each matching row, both columns need to be checked. So in the fourth row, points=7 and lost=3, so we should include both their columns as relevant. Similarly for the fifth row.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nFor row 3: points=7 and lost=3 \u2192 columns 'points' and 'lost'.\nFor row 4: same thing.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say to list each relevant cell as an object with row_index and column_name.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions three occasions where a team drew (drawn), and each of those times, they had specific goal differences: 34 - 25 and 36 - 29. Wait, that's two different goal differences. So does the claim mean that there are three instances where they drew, and in all of those, their goal difference was either 34-25 or 36-29? Or does it mean that for each drawn occasion, they had both a 34-25 and 36-29 goal difference, which doesn't make much sense because each game has one goal difference.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a game. The \"drawn\" column indicates if the team drew, which is marked as 0 or 1 (I assume 1 means they drew). The \"goal difference\" column shows the difference for each game.\n\nSo first, how many times did the team draw? Let's check each row:\n\n- Row 0: drawn=0\n- Row 1: drawn=0\n- Row 2: drawn=0\n- Row 3: drawn=1\n- Row 4: drawn=1\n- Row 5: drawn=0\n- Row 6: drawn=0\n- Row 7: drawn=0\n\nWait, the rows are from 0 to 7. So in row 3 and row 4, the team drew (drawn=1). That's two occasions where they drew. The claim says there should be three occasions, so that's a problem right there because it only happened twice. But wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me list each row with their drawn status:\n\nRow 0: 0 \u2192 no\nRow 1: 0 \u2192 no\nRow 2: 0 \u2192 no\nRow 3: 1 \u2192 yes (first draw)\nRow 4: 1 \u2192 yes (second draw)\nRow 5: 0 \u2192 no\nRow 6: 0 \u2192 no\nRow 7: 0 \u2192 no\n\nSo only two draws. So the claim says three occasions, so that's already a discrepancy. But maybe I made a mistake in looking at the table.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 0: games=7, drawn=0\n- Row1: same\n- Row2: drawn=0\n- Row3: drawn=1\n- Row4: drawn=1\n- Row5: drawn=0\n- Row6: drawn=0\n- Row7: drawn=0\n\nSo yes, only two draws. So the claim says three occasions, which is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is false because there are only two instances where the team drew.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table. Let me check each row's \"drawn\" column again:\n\nRow 3: drawn=1\nRow4: drawn=1\n\nThat's it. So the claim says three occasions, but the data shows only two. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me also check about the goal difference part of the claim. It mentions specific numbers: 34-25 and 36-29. Let's see if these are in the table.\n\nLooking at the \"goal difference\" column:\n\nRow3: 34 - 25\nRow4: 36 - 29\n\nYes, those two rows have those goal differences when the team drew (drawn=1). So for each draw, they had one of those two goal differences. But the claim is about three occasions where they drew and had either of those goal differences.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. The claim says \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\" So does that mean that in each of three drawn games, the goal difference was both 34-25 and 36-29? That doesn't make sense because each game only has one goal difference. So perhaps the claim is that there were three drawn games where the team had a goal difference of either 34-25 or 36-29.\n\nBut in reality, looking at the data, the team drew twice: once with 34-25 and once with 36-29. So only two instances, not three. Therefore, the claim is false because there aren't three occasions, but rather two. Also, the specific goal differences are correct for those two draws.\n\nSo to sum up:\n\n- Number of drawn games: 2 (rows 3 and 4)\n- The claim says 3, so that's incorrect.\n- The specific goal differences are present in those two draws, but since there aren't three draws, the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three occasions where a team drew with a goal difference of either 34 - 25 or 36 - 29. However, upon examining the table, only two games resulted in draws for the team (rows 3 and 4). Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly asserts three instances instead of two.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}",

But looking at the table, all points values are either 12,10,7,6,2, or 0. None of them exceed 12. So there are zero instances where points are greater than 12, not two.\n\nNext part: no time when points < 2. Looking again, row 5 has points as 2 and row 6 has 0. Points less than 2 would mean points < 2, so only row 6 fits that because it's 0. But the claim says \"no time\" which implies zero instances. However, there is one instance where points are less than 2 (row 6). So the second part of the claim is also false.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is false because it incorrectly states there are two times when points exceed 12 and no times when they drop below 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because:\n\n1. There are zero instances where points are greater than 12.\n2. There is one instance where points are less than 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"when the point be 13 , the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13\". I think this means that when the points column equals 13, there should be two specific goal differences in the table. \n\nNow, I'll examine the table to find where the points are 13. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: points=12\n2. Row 1: points=12\n3. Row 2: points=10\n4. Row 3: points=7\n5. Row 4: points=7\n6. Row 5: points=6\n7. Row 6: points=2\n8. Row 7: points=0\n\nWait, none of the rows have a points value of 13. That's odd. So, if the claim is saying that when points are 13, certain goal differences exist, but in reality, there are no games with 13 points. \n\nBut maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't miss any point totals. No, all points values are 12,10,7, etc., none at 13.\n\nSo the first part of the claim is incorrect because there are no rows where points equal 13. Therefore, even if the goal differences were present, the initial condition isn't met. Hence, the claim should be considered FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the validity of the claim, I need to check each relevant cell in the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Points = 13:** \n   - Upon reviewing the 'points' column, no row has a value of 13.\n\n2. **Analyze the Claim's Conditions:**\n   - The claim states that when points are 13, there should be goal differences of 51-10 and 40-13.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no rows have points equal to 13, the condition cannot be met, making the claim FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells Explanation:**\n- None of the rows contain points=13, so no cells are relevant for this check.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then list the relevant cells that support this claim. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be 3 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" So, the claim is saying that there are three instances where the points column equals 7 and the lost column also equals 3. My task is to check if this is true by looking at the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several rows, each representing different data points with columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. The claim is specifically about when points are 7 and losses are 3. So I need to focus on the 'points' column and the 'lost' column.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: Points = 12, Lost = 1 \u2192 Doesn't meet both conditions.\n2. Second row: Points = 12, Lost = 1 \u2192 Same as above.\n3. Third row: Points = 10, Lost = 2 \u2192 No match.\n4. Fourth row: Points = 7, Lost = 3 \u2192 This matches the condition.\n5. Fifth row: Points = 7, Lost = 3 \u2192 Another match.\n6. Sixth row: Points = 6, Lost = 4 \u2192 Doesn't meet.\n7. Seventh row: Points = 2, Lost = 6 \u2192 No.\n8. Eighth row: Points = 0, Lost = 7 \u2192 Doesn't apply.\n\nSo from the table, there are two instances where points equal 7 and lost equals 3. The claim says \"there be 3 times,\" which would require three such instances. Since we only have two, the claim seems to be false at first glance.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I miscounted or overlooked something. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 4: Points=7, Lost=3 \u2192 Yes.\n- Row 5: Points=7, Lost=3 \u2192 Yes.\nAre there any more? No, the others don't meet both criteria.\n\nSo that's only two instances, not three. Therefore, the claim is false because it requires three instances, but only two are present.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"number of loss be 3 each time.\" Does it mean for each occurrence where points are 7, the losses must be exactly 3? Or does it mean that in those specific instances, both conditions are met?\n\nYes, so each instance needs to have both points=7 and lost=3. There's only two such rows (rows 4 and 5). So the claim is incorrect because it states there should be three times.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this check. The relevant columns are 'points' and 'lost,' so each time these values meet the condition, their row indices and column names should be listed.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be rows 4 and 5, specifically the 'points' and 'lost' columns in those rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
