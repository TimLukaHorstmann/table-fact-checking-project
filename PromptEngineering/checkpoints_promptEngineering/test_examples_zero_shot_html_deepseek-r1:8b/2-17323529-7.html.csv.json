    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Game 40 having a high assist by Eric Gordon is true based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify where the relevant information is stored. The table has multiple columns like \"Game Number,\" \"Opponent,\" \"Score,\" \"Assists,\" and others. The claim specifically mentions Eric Gordon's assists in Game 40.\n\nStarting with Game 40, I'll locate the row for Game Number 40. From the table, Game 40 is against the Los Angeles Lakers. The \"Assists\" column for this game shows a value of 6. \n\nThe claim states that Game 40 has a high assist by Eric Gordon with 6. Since the data in the table directly shows that Eric Gordon recorded 6 assists in that game, this aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nI'll also check other columns related to assists just to be thorough, but the \"Assists\" column is clear and directly relevant. No conflicting information is present that would suggest a different number of assists.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table for Game 40, specifically the \"Assists\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"Assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
