Scanning each row's date column:\n\n- Row 1: April 8\n- Row 2: April 10\n- Row 3: April 12\n- Row 4: April 14\n\nSo, April 14 is in row index 4.\n\nNow, I check the opponent for that specific row. The table shows the opponent as \"new jersey devils\" for row 4.\n\nThe claim states that on April 14, the opponent was the New Jersey Devils. Since the table confirms this, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
