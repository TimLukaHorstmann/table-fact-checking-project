    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the furthest vladimira ever get in a grand slam be the semi final of the us open\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's referring to someone named Vladimira, possibly a tennis player, and stating that their furthest achievement in a Grand Slam tournament was reaching the semi-finals of the US Open. So, I need to check if there's any data in the table supporting this.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The first row under 'tournament' lists various tournaments like Grand Slam Tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. Each subsequent row represents a different aspect, possibly the progress each tournament made over the years from 2006 to 2012.\n\nNow, the relevant part is probably the row for the US Open because the claim mentions it specifically. Let me find that row in the table. The fourth data row after 'grand slam tournaments' seems to be the US Open's performance across different years.\n\nEach column in this row corresponds to a year from 2006 onwards, and the cell gives some abbreviation or notation of their progress each year. For example, '1r' might mean they reached the first round, '2r' second round, '3r' third round, 'qf' quarterfinals, 'sf' semi-finals, and so on.\n\nIn the US Open row, for 2006, it's '1r', which means they lost in the first round. Then in 2007, it's 'sf', meaning they reached the semi-finals. Wait, that's the furthest they got in the US Open according to this data. So, if Vladimira is the person we're talking about, and their furthest was the semi-finals at the US Open, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that the row for the US Open is indeed showing their progress. Let me check: The fifth row is 'win - loss', which seems to be a separate summary, so the fourth data row after 'grand slam tournaments' must be the US Open's performance each year from 2006 to 2012.\n\nSo in 2007, it was 'sf' (semi-finals), and then in other years like 2008, it went back to '1r', etc. So yes, the furthest they reached was the semi-finals at the US Open in 2007.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those that show Vladimira's progress in the US Open, specifically reaching the semi-finals in 2007.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"2007\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"2007 be the year with the best win - loss ratio for overall match play\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has columns for each year from 2006 to 2012 and rows for different tournaments like Grand Slam Tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and a separate row for Win-Loss records.\n\nThe claim is about the best win-loss ratio in 2007. So I need to focus on the \"win - loss\" column across all the years to find which year had the highest ratio.\n\nLooking at the \"win - loss\" data:\n- 2006: 1 - 3\n- 2007: 8 - 4\n- 2008: 4 - 4\n- 2009: 1 - 4\n- 2010: 2 - 4\n- 2011: 6 - 4\n- 2012: 5 - 4\n\nTo find the best ratio, I need to calculate each year's win-loss as a percentage or ratio. Let's compute each:\n\n2006: (1/3) \u2248 33%\n2007: (8/4) = 2 \u2192 100%\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, in the table, for 2007, it's \"sf\" which I think stands for semi-finals, but in the win-loss row, it says \"win - loss\" as 8-4. So each cell is a string like \"a\", \"2r\", etc., but the last column is specifically labeled \"win - loss\" and has values like \"1 - 3\", \"8 - 4\", etc.\n\nSo for 2007, it's 8 wins and 4 losses, making 12 total matches. So 8/12 \u2248 66.67%.\n\nSimilarly:\n- 2008: 4/8 = 50%\n- 2009: 1/5 = 20%\n- 2010: 2/6 \u2248 33.33%\n- 2011: 6/10 = 60%\n- 2012: 5/9 \u2248 55.56%\n\nComparing these, the highest win-loss ratio is in 2007 with approximately 66.67%, followed by 2011 at ~60% and 2012 at ~55.56%. So yes, 2007 has the best ratio among all years from 2006 to 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim that 2007 has the best win-loss ratio is TRUE. The relevant cells are in the row where \"win - loss\" is given, specifically for 2007.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the \"win - loss\" column for each year, focusing on 2007.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "she most commonly go out on the second round in grand slam",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"she most commonly go out on the second round in grand slam\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It mentions that she \"most commonly goes out on the second round in grand slams.\" So, I'm looking for information about when she exits the tournaments\u2014specifically, if it's often at the second round.\n\nLooking at the table, there are four main tournaments listed: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. Each of these has columns representing different years from 2006 to 2012, showing various stages like 1r (first round), 2r (second round), etc.\n\nThe claim is about her performance in grand slams, so I need to focus on rows that represent individual tournaments under the \"grand slam tournaments\" category. Wait, no\u2014the table has separate rows for each tournament, not just a general category. So each row after the first represents a specific tournament (like Australian Open), except for the last row which seems to be a summary (\"win - loss\").\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the second row is \"australian open,\" then \"french open,\" etc., so each of those rows is a specific tournament. The first data row is labeled \"grand slam tournaments,\" but in the body, it's a single cell\u2014maybe that's a header or something else. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait no, looking again: The table has a header row with columns like \"tournament\" and years from 2006 onwards. Then the first data row under <tbody> is \"grand slam tournaments,\" but then each subsequent row is another tournament, like \"australian open,\" etc. So maybe that initial row isn't a specific tournament but a category.\n\nWait, no\u2014the table seems to have two main sections: the header (which includes years) and then each row after that represents a different aspect or perhaps more data points. Wait, actually, looking at it again, the first <tr> in tbody is for \"grand slam tournaments,\" but then the next rows are specific tournaments like Australian Open, French Open, etc., each with their own performance data across years.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the structure is that the header row under <thead> includes \"tournament\" and the years. Then, in the body, each <tr> represents a different aspect: first, it's \"grand slam tournaments,\" then specific tournaments like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and finally a \"win - loss\" row.\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense because the user provided a table with rows for each tournament. So perhaps I need to clarify which rows are relevant.\n\nThe claim is about \"she most commonly go out on the second round in grand slam.\" So I think the key here is to look at each grand slam tournament (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) and see if she often exits at the second round.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Australian Open: The years 2006-2012 show her performance as a, 2r, 2r, 1r, 2r, qf, 2r. So in 2006, she didn't go far (just 'a', which might mean absent or did not participate). In 2007, it's 2r (second round exit), 2008 same, 2009 first round, 2010 second round, 2011 quarterfinals, and 2012 second round.\n\nSo in the years listed, she exited at least at the second round multiple times: 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012. So that's four times.\n\n2. French Open: She has 2r, 3r, 3r, 2r, 2r, 3r, 2r across 2006-2012. So in 2006, she exits at 2r; 2007 at 3r; 2008 same; 2009 at 2r; 2010 at 2r; 2011 at 3r; 2012 at 2r. So again, multiple exits at 2r.\n\n3. Wimbledon: Her results are 1r, 2r, 2r, 1r, 1r, 2r, 3r. So in 2006 first round exit; 2007 second round; 2008 same; 2009 first round; 2010 first round; 2011 second round; 2012 third round. So here, she exited at 2r in 2007 and 2011.\n\n4. US Open: Results are 1r, sf, 1r, 1r, 1r, 1r, 2r. So in 2006 first round; 2007 semifinals (sf), which is further than second round; 2008 first round; etc. So she exited at 2r only in 2012.\n\nNow, compiling this: She exits at 2r in several tournaments:\n\n- Australian Open: 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012\n- French Open: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012\n- Wimbledon: 2007, 2011\n- US Open: 2012\n\nThat's a lot of times she exits at the second round. So the claim says \"she most commonly goes out on the second round in grand slams,\" which seems to be supported by this data.\n\nHowever, I should check if any cells are relevant to verify this claim. The claim is about her performance, so looking for columns that indicate when she exited each tournament. In the table, the column for each year is \"2006,\" \"2007,\" etc., but the actual results are in another column? Wait, no\u2014the structure seems to have a single column for each row, but with multiple columns.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the HTML code:\n\n<thead>\n  <tr><th>tournament</th><td>2006</td><td>2007</td>...</td></tr>\n...\n<tbody>\n  <tr><td>grand slam tournaments</td></tr>\n  ...\n  <tr><td>australian open</td><td>2006</td><td>2007</td>...</td>\n  ...\n  <tr><td>win - loss</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n\nWait, no, the actual table seems to have a header with \"tournament\" and then the years, but each row in tbody is for a specific tournament, with columns being the years.\n\nSo each row after the first has the name of the tournament (like Australian Open) as the first data cell, followed by the performance in each year.\n\nTherefore, for example, the second row (after grand slam tournaments) would be:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>australian open</td>\n  <td>2006</td>\n  <td>2007</td>\n  <td>2008</td>\n  ...\n</tr>\n\nSo to find when she exits at second round, we look for the cell that indicates her exit. But in the table as presented, I don't see a specific column indicating exit point. The columns are just years.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe each cell under a year is her result, like 'a' (absent), 2r, etc. So perhaps the first data column after \"tournament\" lists her performance in 2006, and so on.\n\nSo for example, in the row for \"australian open,\" the cells would be:\n\n2006: a\n2007: 2r\n2008: 2r\n2009: 1r\n2010: 2r\n2011: qf\n2012: 2r\n\nSo in this case, the exit points are indicated by these abbreviations. Therefore, to verify whether she commonly exits at second round, we need to look for the \"exit\" data, which is in the cells of each row under their respective years.\n\nBut since the table is presented as having columns per year, the relevant data is within those cells. So the rows with the tournament name and then the exit codes across the years are the relevant parts.\n\nTherefore, the cells to look at are the performance cells (like 2r) in each row.\n\nIn that case, yes, she exits at 2r multiple times across different tournaments, so the claim holds.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. To answer the question: \"You are tasked with identifying which rows or columns contain data relevant to verifying this claim.\" So, focusing on the data needed\u2014each tournament's exit points. Therefore, each row (after the initial ones) corresponds to a specific tournament, and within each of those rows, the cells under the years indicate her performance.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the ones containing \"2r\" in the performance columns across all tournaments.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"she most commonly goes out on the second round in grand slams,\" we need to examine the performance data for each grand slam tournament. The relevant data is found in the specific rows corresponding to each tournament (e.g., Australian Open, French Open) and within those rows, the cells indicating her exit points across the years.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Each row in the table corresponds to a specific grand slam tournament.\n2. **Locate Exit Data:** Within each tournament's row, the cells under the year columns (e.g., 2006, 2007) indicate her performance for that year, including whether she exited at the second round ('2r').\n3. **Analyze Exit Points:** Count how often she exits at the second round in each tournament.\n4. **Compile Results:** Sum the exits across all tournaments to assess the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe relevant data is found in the rows corresponding to each grand slam tournament, specifically within the cells indicating performance for each year (e.g., '2r' for second-round exits). The data supports the claim that she commonly exits at the second round.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"She attended every major grand slam from 2006 to 2012 except the 2006 Australian Open.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It lists various tournaments and their performance across different years from 2006 to 2012. Each row seems to represent a different tournament, like the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and \"win - loss\" which might be her overall record.\n\nThe claim is about attendance at major grand slams. So I'm looking for cells that indicate whether she attended each of these tournaments from 2006 to 2012. The exception is the 2006 Australian Open.\n\nLooking at the table, the first row after the headers is \"grand slam tournaments,\" which might be a summary or category. Then there are rows for each specific tournament: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and \"win - loss.\"\n\nEach of these tournaments has entries under columns from 2006 to 2012. For example, the Australian Open row shows 'a' in 2006, which might indicate that she attended or not. The other tournaments have abbreviations like '2r', '3r', 'qf', etc., which probably stand for different stages of the tournament she reached.\n\nThe \"win - loss\" row has her record each year, which is about performance, not necessarily attendance. So I think the relevant cells are in the rows that represent specific tournaments, not the summary or her overall record.\n\nNow, to check if she attended every major grand slam from 2006 to 2012 except the 2006 Australian Open, I need to look at each of these tournaments' 2006 entries. \n\nStarting with the Australian Open: In 2006, it's marked as 'a'. If 'a' stands for attendance (like 'yes'), then she did attend that year. But wait, the claim says she didn't attend the 2006 Australian Open. So if 'a' means attended, this contradicts the claim. Alternatively, maybe 'a' is an abbreviation I'm not familiar with.\n\nWait, perhaps in the table, each tournament's cell indicates whether she reached a certain stage. For example, '2r' might mean she lost in the second round, implying she did attend that tournament. So if she didn't attend the 2006 Australian Open, then her result would be something like not attending, maybe denoted differently.\n\nLooking again: In the row for the Australian Open under 2006, it's 'a'. If 'a' means attendance, then she attended, which contradicts the claim. So this might mean that the claim is false because she did attend the 2006 Australian Open.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"except the 2006 Australian Open,\" meaning she didn't attend it. But if in the table, the cell shows 'a' which could mean attendance, then the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE because she did attend that one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'a' stands for not attending. I'm not sure about the abbreviations here. The other cells have terms like '2r', '3r', etc., which are stages of a tournament. So maybe in 2006, the Australian Open has 'a' indicating attendance, meaning she did attend that year.\n\nWait, let's look at the other years for the Australian Open. In 2007, it's '2r', which means she reached the second round, implying she attended. Similarly, in 2012, it's '2r', so she attended. So if in 2006, it's 'a' and that also indicates attendance, then the claim is wrong because she did attend.\n\nBut the claim says she didn't attend the 2006 Australian Open. Therefore, this would make the claim false. So I need to check which cells are relevant.\n\nThe relevant rows are the specific tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open. Their entries for each year from 2006 to 2012 indicate whether they attended that tournament in that year.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include all these entries because each of them relates to her attendance at a major grand slam during those years.\n\nTherefore, the cells are:\n\n- Australian Open: row 1 (since the first data row is index 0?), wait no. Let's count rows properly.\n\nLooking at the table, after thead comes tbody with 5 rows:\n\nRow 0: grand slam tournaments\n\nRow 1: Australian Open\n\nRow 2: French Open\n\nRow 3: Wimbledon\n\nRow 4: US Open\n\nRow 5: win - loss\n\nWait no, in the HTML, the first <tr> inside tbody is row 0. So:\n\n- Row 0: grand slam tournaments (probably not relevant)\n- Row 1: Australian Open\n- Row 2: French Open\n- Row 3: Wimbledon\n- Row 4: US Open\n- Row 5: win - loss\n\nSo the claim is about her attendance at each tournament from 2006 to 2012, except 2006 Australian Open.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the entries in rows 1 to 4 (the specific tournaments) for each year from 2006 to 2012.\n\nEach of these cells corresponds to a year and a tournament. So the columns are '2006', '2007', ..., '2012'.\n\nSo for each of the four tournaments, their results across all eight years need to be checked against the claim.\n\nIn the claim, she didn't attend the 2006 Australian Open. So we check row 1, column '2006' which is 'a'. If 'a' indicates attendance, then she did attend, making the claim false. Therefore, the answer would be that the claim is false, and thus the task requires identifying this.\n\nSo in summary, I think the relevant cells are all the entries for each major tournament from 2006 to 2012.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those indicating her attendance or participation at each major tournament during the specified years. These include:\n\n- Australian Open: Cells for '2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', and '2012'.\n- French Open: Same years.\n- Wimbledon: Same years.\n- US Open: Same years.\n\nEach of these cells reflects her involvement in the respective tournament during those years, which contradicts or supports the claim of not attending the 2006 Australian Open.\n\nThe final answer is that the claim is false because she did attend the 2006 Australian Open.\n\n\\boxed{FALSE}",

From the table, I see there are players like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open, but no mention of Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1. Wait, maybe she's not a player but someone else?

First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's about Vladimir progress in tournaments over time, specifically whether he only made it past the group stage twice.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various tennis tournaments and their results from 2006 to 2012. The relevant columns here are each year from 2006 to 2012. Each row represents a different tournament: Grand Slam Tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and then Win-Loss record.\n\nWait, the last row is about \"win - loss,\" so that's a summary of wins against losses for each year. So, I need to check if Vladimir, represented by the entries in the table, progressed past the group stage only twice.\n\nI should look at the tournaments to see how they performed each year. The claim is about his progress past the group stage, which typically means getting beyond the first round (1r). So, any entry that shows he went beyond 1r would count as progressing past the group stage.\n\nLet me go through each tournament's performance per year:\n\n1. **Grand Slam Tournaments**: From 2006 to 2012, it seems this row is consistent with \"grand slam tournaments,\" but I think this might be a category rather than a specific player. So maybe I should focus on the other rows which are specific tournaments.\n\n2. **Australian Open**:\n   - 2006: 'a' \u2013 Not sure what 'a' stands for, possibly 'absent' or 'altitude'? Maybe it's abbreviating something else.\n   - 2007: '2r' \u2013 So he reached the second round, which is past the group stage if group stage is considered as the first round. So that's one time.\n\n3. **French Open**:\n   - 2006: '2r' \u2013 Again, same as above, so that's another time.\n   \n4. **Wimbledon**:\n   - 2006: '1r' \u2013 So he didn't progress past the group stage here.\n   - 2012: '3r' \u2013 He reached the third round, which is beyond the first round, so that's a third time.\n\n5. **US Open**:\n   - Most entries are '1r', except in 2007 he has 'sf' (semifinal), which would be beyond group stage. Wait, no: in 2007 US Open, it's 'sf'. So if the group stage is the first round, then reaching SF would definitely be past group stage. So that's another time.\n\nWait, let me list out each tournament's progress:\n\n- Australian Open: 2006 (a), 2007 (2r) \u2192 so in 2007 he made it past group stage.\n- French Open: 2006 (2r), 2007 (3r), etc. So multiple times here.\n- Wimbledon: 2012 (3r)\n- US Open: 2007 (sf)\n\nWait, but the claim is \"only 2 times have vladimira progress past the group stage.\" But according to this, he has done it more than twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe each row represents a player, and 'vladimira' is one of them. Let me check the rows again:\n\nLooking at the table, after Grand Slam Tournaments, the next rows are specific tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, then Win-Loss.\n\nWait, so perhaps \"vladimira\" isn't in the table. Maybe the claim refers to a player named Vladimir, and the table is about his performance over time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row represents different aspects, like Grand Slam tournaments as a category, and then individual tournaments. So, for example, the first data row after Grand Slams might be for the Australian Open, showing their progress each year.\n\nSo in that case, perhaps the claim refers to Vladimir's progress across these tournaments. Let me go through each tournament:\n\n- **Australian Open**: 2006 ('a'), 2007 (2r), etc.\n   - In 2007, he reached 2r, so past group stage.\n   \n- **French Open**: 2006 (2r), 2007 (3r), etc. So in both those years, he made it past group stage.\n\n- **Wimbledon**: 2006 (1r), 2012 (3r). So 2012 is another time.\n\n- **US Open**: 2007 (sf), which is beyond group stage.\n\nAdditionally, the 'win - loss' row shows progression over years. For example, in 2006, he had 1-3, which might indicate losses but not necessarily progress. But his performance improving each year suggests he's doing better, so perhaps more times.\n\nSo if I tally up:\n\n- Australian Open: at least one time (2007)\n- French Open: multiple times\n- Wimbledon: once in 2012\n- US Open: at least once in 2007\n\nThat's four or more times where he progressed past the group stage. Therefore, the claim that it only happened twice is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Vladimir has only progressed past the group stage two times, but based on the table, he has done so multiple times across different tournaments.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n**Relevant cells**:\n- Each cell in the years 2006\u20132012 columns for each tournament where progress is beyond the first round (1r).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_index\": 1}, // Australian Open 2007: 2r\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_index\": 1}, // French Open 2006: 2r\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_index\": 1}, // Wimbledon 2012: 3r\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_index\": 1}  // US Open 2007: sf\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"uhlirova most commonly go out in the semifinal in grand slam\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me carefully analyze this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has a header with columns for each year from 2006 to 2012 and another column called \"win - loss\". The rows represent different tournaments: Grand Slam Tournaments, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and Win-Loss.\n\nThe claim is about Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1's performance in the semifinals of Grand Slam tournaments. So I need to find cells related to her results in such tournaments, particularly looking at when she exits\u2014like whether it's commonly the semifinal.\n\nLooking at the table, there are four rows for each tournament: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. The last row is for \"win - loss\" which I think refers to her overall wins and losses across these tournaments.\n\nSo for Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1, the relevant data would be in the rows corresponding to Grand Slam Tournaments (but that seems repetitive since it's a header), but more importantly, each individual tournament. Since the claim is about going out in the semifinal, I should check if any of her exits are at the semifinal stage.\n\nIn the table, under \"grand slam tournaments\", all cells say \"grand slam tournaments\", which doesn't help much. But looking at each specific Grand Slam:\n\n- Australian Open: In 2006 she was 'a' (probably an abbreviation), in 2007 '2r' (second round), same for others. I don't see any 'sf' or 'semifinal' here.\n- French Open: Similarly, results are like '2r', '3r', etc., no semifinal mentioned.\n- Wimbledon: Results include '1r' and '2r'.\n- US Open: Similar pattern, with '1r'.\n\nThe \"win - loss\" row shows her performance but it's about wins against losses, not the stage she exited.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The term 'go out in the semifinal' would mean reaching the semifinals and losing there. So I need to see if any of her results are 'semifinal' or a corresponding abbreviation like 'sf'.\n\nLooking again, the columns for each year don't show anything like 'sf'. They have terms like '2r', '3r', etc., but not 'sf'. That makes me think that perhaps the table doesn't explicitly state when she exited in the semifinal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term 'semifinal' isn't directly used here. Maybe it's implied by her losing a certain number of matches early on. But without explicit data showing she went to the semifinal stage, I can't confirm the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there is no direct evidence that Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1 commonly goes out in the semifinal of Grand Slam tournaments.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"uhlirova most commonly go out in the semifinal in grand slam\" is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Look for cells related to Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1's performance in each Grand Slam tournament.\n2. **Check for Semifinal Results**: The term 'semifinal' (or 'sf') should indicate she reached that stage and lost.\n\nThe table shows results like 'a', '2r', '3r', etc., but no 'sf'. Therefore, there's no evidence she commonly exits in the semifinal.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Australian Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"French Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Wimbledon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"US Open\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"uhlirova attend all but 4 grand slam between 2006 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It says that Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1 attended almost all Grand Slam tournaments from 2006 to 2012 except for four. So, she missed four out of those tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various Grand Slam tournaments like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and a row labeled \"win - loss.\" Each of these has entries from 2006 to 2012. \n\nI think the relevant columns are each year from 2006 to 2012. So, I need to check how many times Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1 did not participate in each Grand Slam during those years.\n\nIn the table:\n- For \"grand slam tournaments,\" all entries are just \"grand slam tournaments,\" which might be a header or description.\n- The rows for each tournament (Australian Open, French Open, etc.) have abbreviations like 'a', '2r', 'sf', etc. These probably represent stages she reached: 'a' could mean absence, '2r' is second round, and so on.\n\nWait, but the claim is about attending, not performance. So maybe 'a' stands for absent? Or does it indicate that she didn't attend because she lost in the first round?\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Let me re-examine the table. The last row is \"win - loss\" with entries like 1-3, which seems to be wins and losses statistics, not attendance.\n\nSo perhaps each cell indicates her performance, not whether she attended. Then, how do I determine when she didn't attend?\n\nLooking at the rows, for example:\n- Australian Open: In 2006 it's 'a', 2007 '2r', etc.\n- If 'a' means absence, then in 2006 she didn't attend.\n\nBut wait, let me check other tournaments. For Wimbledon in 2011, it says '3r', so she reached the third round. But that doesn't directly indicate attendance; perhaps it does because if she's not present, she can't reach any rounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'a' indicates she was absent, so for each tournament, we need to count how many times her performance cell is 'a'. Each 'a' would mean she didn't attend that year's Grand Slam.\n\nSo the task is to find in the rows (other than \"win - loss\") how many times the column has 'a', and see if that number is 4 over the years 2006-2012.\n\nLet me go through each tournament:\n\n1. Australian Open: From 2006 to 2012:\n   - 2006: a\n   - 2007: 2r\n   - 2008: 2r\n   - 2009: 1r\n   - 2010: 2r\n   - 2011: qf\n   - 2012: 2r\nSo, only in 2006 is it 'a'\u2014that's one absence.\n\n2. French Open:\n   - 2006: 2r\n   - 2007: 3r\n   - 2008: 3r\n   - 2009: 2r\n   - 2010: 2r\n   - 2011: 3r\n   - 2012: 2r\nNo 'a's here. So zero absences.\n\n3. Wimbledon:\n   - 2006: 1r\n   - 2007: 2r\n   - 2008: 2r\n   - 2009: 1r\n   - 2010: 1r\n   - 2011: 2r\n   - 2012: 3r\nNo 'a's. Zero absences.\n\n4. US Open:\n   - 2006: 1r\n   - 2007: sf (she didn't lose, so maybe she attended)\n   - 2008: 1r\n   - 2009: 1r\n   - 2010: 1r\n   - 2011: 1r\n   - 2012: 2r\nNo 'a's. Zero absences.\n\nSo, across all four tournaments from 2006 to 2012, Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1 was absent only once\u2014in the Australian Open of 2006. That's one absence.\n\nBut the claim says she attended all but 4 Grand Slams between those years, implying four absences. However, according to this analysis, she missed only one tournament. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. The \"win - loss\" row might be a separate entity. Maybe each 'a' in the performance columns indicates absence, but also the \"grand slam tournaments\" row shows her participation. Let me check that row.\n\nThe first data row is \"grand slam tournaments,\" and all cells are filled with \"grand slam tournaments.\" This seems to describe the event type rather than her attendance or performance. So perhaps this isn't relevant for counting absences.\n\nTherefore, focusing on each tournament's individual rows:\n- Australian Open: 1 absence (2006)\n- Others: No absences\n\nTotal absences = 1, which is less than four. So the claim that she missed four is false.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows Uhl\u00edrov\u00e1 attended all Grand Slams except one, not four. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"tournament\": \"Australian Open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"tournament\": \"French Open\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"tournament\": \"Wimbledon\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"tournament\": \"US Open\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"only 1 time have vladimira uhlirova progress past the group stage.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's referring to Vladimira Uhlirova and her progress in tournaments beyond the group stage. The table lists various tournaments: grand slams, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and a win-loss row.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different tournament or category, and the columns represent years from 2006 to 2012. For each tournament, there are notes about their performance in each year.\n\nI need to find out how many times Vladimira Uhlirova (probably a person) progressed past the group stage in her career based on this table. The claim says she did so only once.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see:\n\n1. grand slam tournaments: This seems like a general category, not specific to any player.\n2. Australian Open: There's a row for it with various abbreviations (a, 2r, etc.), but without knowing which is Uhlirova, this might not be relevant.\n3. French Open: Similar situation as above.\n4. Wimbledon: Again, same structure.\n5. US Open: Same here.\n6. win - loss: This seems like it's showing her wins and losses across years.\n\nWait, the 'win - loss' row might actually refer to another aspect, possibly her performance in doubles or mixed doubles. But I'm not sure if that's directly about progressing past the group stage in singles.\n\nI think each of these tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, etc.) has its own progress through rounds, so perhaps looking at each tournament's progression could help. For example, if Uhlirova only once advanced beyond the group stage in any of these tournaments, then the claim holds.\n\nBut without knowing which row corresponds to her specifically, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe each row represents different aspects or she played multiple times in different categories. Alternatively, perhaps the 'win - loss' row is key.\n\nWait, maybe I should focus on how many times she progressed past the group stage across all tournaments listed. If the claim says only once, then I need to check if that's accurate.\n\nLooking at each tournament:\n\n- Australian Open: In 2006, it was 'a', which might mean she advanced beyond the group stage as a wildcard or alternate.\n- French Open: In 2007, she reached 3r, which is past group stage (group stage is usually 1st round, then 2nd, 3rd, etc. So 3r is quarterfinals).\n- Wimbledon: She has been to semifinals (sf) in 2007 and 3r in 2011.\n- US Open: In 2006, she was a wildcard and reached the 1r, but perhaps as an alternate, so maybe she didn't have to qualify through group stages. But it's unclear.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. The claim is about progressing past the group stage, which in tennis terms would be beyond the first round (group stage sometimes refers to initial rounds). So any tournament where she advanced beyond 1r would count as passing the group stage.\n\nLooking at each of her tournaments:\n\n- Australian Open: In 2006, 'a' might indicate alternate or wildcard entry, so she might have been given a bye. So she might not have had to play the first round, but if she did, she advanced past it.\n- French Open: In 2007, she reached 3r (quarterfinals), which is beyond group stage.\n- Wimbledon: She has sf in 2007 and 2r in other years. So she progressed past group stage multiple times.\n- US Open: In 2006, '1r' might mean she lost in the first round, but as an alternate, maybe she didn't have to play group stages.\n\nWait, I'm not sure about this. Maybe each time she played a tournament, if she went beyond the first round, that's passing the group stage.\n\nLooking at her performance:\n\n- 2006: In US Open, '1r' might mean she lost in the first round as an alternate.\n- 2007: French Open reached 3r, which is past group stage; Wimbledon reached sf, so definitely beyond group stage.\n- 2008: Did she play? Her row shows 2r in French and US, but in Wimbledon it's 1r. So perhaps she didn't progress past group stage in those years.\n- 2010: In US Open, '1r' again.\n- 2011: In Wimbledon, 3r.\n\nSo adding up the times she went beyond group stage:\n\n2007 French Open: 3r\n2007 Wimbledon: sf (sf is after group stages)\n2011 Wimbledon: 3r\n\nThat's three times. But the claim says only once. So that would make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the abbreviations. Maybe 'a' in Australian Open 2006 means she advanced as an alternate without playing the group stage. So that counts as past group stage, giving her more than one time.\n\nWait, but if being an alternate or wildcard doesn't require passing through group stages because she didn't have to play them, maybe it's not counted. Or maybe in some tournaments, being an alternate still involves progressing beyond group stages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'win - loss' row is for doubles, which might be a different context.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to count each time she played and advanced past 1r as passing group stage.\n\nSo:\n\n2006: US Open (1r) - maybe she didn't have to play group stages.\nAustralian Open: 'a' perhaps means she was given a bye, so no group stage match. So no advancement beyond group stage in that sense.\nFrench Open: Did she play? 2007:3r, which is past group stage.\n\n2007: French Open (3r), Wimbledon (sf) - both past group stage.\n2008: French Open (2r), US Open (2r)\n2010: US Open (1r)\n2011: Wimbledon (3r)\n\nSo that's:\n\n- 2007: 2 times\n- 2011: 1 time\n\nTotal of 3 times. So the claim says only once, which would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some tournaments she didn't have to play group stages because of her seeding or being an alternate. So for example, in the Australian Open, if she was an alternate, she might not have had to play the first round, so technically didn't pass through group stage.\n\nSo perhaps only once: 2007 French Open and Wimbledon? But that's still two times.\n\nI'm getting stuck on whether each of these counts or not. Maybe the key is that in singles, passing group stages would mean reaching at least the second round (in some tournaments) or beyond.\n\nBut without more precise data, it's hard to say for sure. However, based on the abbreviations, 'sf' and '3r' indicate she passed group stages multiple times, which contradicts the claim of only once.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the individual progressed past the group stage only once is incorrect. Based on the analysis, they advanced beyond the group stage in at least two tournaments: the 2007 French Open (reaching the third round) and the 2007 Wimbledon Championships (reaching the semifinals). Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; the individual progressed past the group stage more than once.",
