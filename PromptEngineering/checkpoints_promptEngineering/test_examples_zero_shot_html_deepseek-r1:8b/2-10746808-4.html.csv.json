    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"the crowd surpassed 19000 for 3 match on 22 may 1926.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The rows represent different matches on May 22, 1926. Since the claim mentions \"3 match,\" I assume there are three matches that day.\n\nNow, focusing on the 'crowd' column, each row lists the number of people who attended that particular game. My task is to check if any of these crowds surpassed 19,000. The target number in the claim is more than 19,000, so I need to see which games had a crowd exceeding this.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Collingwood vs Melbourne: Crowd was 15,000. That's below 19,000.\n2. Carlton vs South Melbourne: 25,000. This exceeds 19,000.\n3. Richmond vs Hawthorn: 14,000. Below.\n4. North Melbourne vs Geelong: 14,000. Below.\n5. St Kilda vs Fitzroy: 22,000. Exceeds.\n6. Footscray vs Essendon: 20,000. Exceeds.\n\nSo, three matches had crowds over 19,000. The claim says \"the crowd surpassed 19000 for 3 match on 22 may 1926.\" That seems accurate because there are indeed three matches where the crowd exceeded 19,000.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check the numbers. Let me recount:\n\n- Carlton: 25k \u2192 yes.\n- St Kilda: 22k \u2192 yes.\n- Footscray: 20k \u2192 yes.\n\nThree matches meet the criteria. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, each of these three rows has a 'crowd' value. So, I need to note their row indices and column name. The column name for crowd is \"crowd.\"\n\nThe row indices are 1 (Carlton), 5 (St Kilda), and 6 (Footscray). Wait, no: looking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Collingwood\nRow 1: Carlton\nRow 2: Richmond\nRow 3: North Melbourne\nRow 4: St Kilda\nRow 5: Footscray\n\nWait, no. The first row after <thead> is row 0, then row 1, etc., up to row 6? Wait, the table has six rows in tbody: each tr represents a match.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: Collingwood vs Melbourne\nRow 1: Carlton vs South Melbourne\nRow 2: Richmond vs Hawthorn\nRow 3: North Melbourne vs Geelong\nRow 4: St Kilda vs Fitzroy\nRow 5: Footscray vs Essendon\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the HTML:\n\nThere are six <tr> elements inside tbody. So row indices from 0 to 5.\n\nRow 0: Collingwood (crowd 15k)\nRow 1: Carlton (25k)\nRow 2: Richmond (14k)\nRow 3: North Melbourne (14k)\nRow 4: St Kilda (22k)\nRow 5: Footscray (20k)\n\nSo the three matches with crowd >19k are rows 1, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, column \"crowd\"\n- Row 4, column \"crowd\"\n- Row 5, column \"crowd\"\n\nI need to list these as objects in an array, each with row_index and column_name.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, I checked the 'crowd' column for matches on May 22, 1926. Three games had crowds exceeding 19,000, confirming the claim. The relevant cells are from those three rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"for the 6 match the venue be never the same.\" Hmm, I think it's saying that for the sixth game, the venue was never the same as previous ones. But looking at the table, each row seems to represent a different match, not necessarily the sixth one. \n\nWait, the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim is about the 6th match's venue being unique. So I need to see if all six matches had unique venues or if any were the same.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different game. Let me list out the venues:\n\n1. Victoria Park\n2. Princes Park\n3. Punt Road Oval\n4. Arden Street Oval\n5. Junction Oval\n6. Western Oval\n\nNow, I'll check if any of these venues repeat. Scanning through them: Victoria Park is first, then Princes Park, Punt Road Oval, Arden Street Oval, Junction Oval, and Western Oval. None of these names seem to be the same as each other. So all six venues are unique.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"for the 6 match the venue be never the same\" would mean that in the sixth game, the venue was different from all previous ones. Since all six have distinct venues, this is true.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the instruction. The table has seven columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date. Each row represents a match, so there are six matches in total (six rows). For each of these six matches, their venues are all unique.\n\nSo the claim says that for the sixth match, the venue was never the same as previous ones. Since none of the six are duplicates, this holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for the sixth match, the venue is different from all prior ones. By examining each row's venue, we confirm they're all unique.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"richmond defeat hawthorn by 12 point at punt road oval.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check each condition against the table.\n\n1. **Home Team vs Away Team**: Richmond is listed as the home team in the table because their name is under the 'home team' column. Hawthorn is the away team since it's under 'away team'. So that part matches.\n\n2. **Defeat by 12 Points**: I need to check the scores for both teams. Looking at the 'home team score' and 'away team score' columns. For Richmond, it's 16.16 (112), and Hawthorn is 14.16 (100). To find the difference: 112 - 100 = 12 points. So yes, Richmond defeats Hawthorn by 12 points.\n\n3. **Venue Check**: The venue for Richmond's game is punt road oval according to the table. The claim also mentions this venue, so that matches.\n\nNow, I'll check each relevant cell in the table to confirm these points.\n\n- **Row Index 2**: This row corresponds to Richmond vs Hawthorn.\n  - 'home team' is Richmond (row_index=2).\n  - 'away team' is Hawthorn (row_index=2).\n  - The scores are under 'home team score' and 'away team score' for their respective columns, which both show a 12-point difference.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

The claim is: \"collingwood defeat melbourne by 5 point in front of 15000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two teams: collingwood and melbourne. Collingwood is the home team because it's listed first in the claim, which matches the table structure where the home team is usually the first entry.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match. I need to find the row where collingwood plays against melbourne. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Collingwood vs Melbourne\n- Yes, that's the first row (row index 0).\n\nNext, I'll check the scores. Collingwood's score is 12.12 (84), and Melbourne's is 12.7 (79). To find the margin of victory, subtract the away team's score from the home team's score: 84 - 79 = 5 points. So, collingwood won by 5 points.\n\nThe crowd number in that match is 15000, which matches the claim's \"in front of 15000.\" \n\nI need to verify if all parts are correct.

The claim says: \"the crowd be unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match on 22 may 1926\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that on May 22, 1926, there were three matches where the crowd size didn't exceed 19,000. So, I need to look into the table provided and check each match's crowd number to see if at least three of them have a crowd less than or equal to 19,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like home team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The date for all these matches is May 22, 1926, so that part checks out.\n\nNow, I need to go through each row's crowd number:\n\n1. First row: Crowd is 15,000.\n2. Second row: 25,000.\n3. Third row: 14,000.\n4. Fourth row: 14,000.\n5. Fifth row: 22,000.\n6. Sixth row: 20,000.\n\nSo, the crowd numbers are: 15000, 25000, 14000, 14000, 22000, 20000.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these are below or equal to 19,000. Let's see:\n\n- 15,000 is less than 19,000.\n- 25,000 is more than 19,000.\n- 14,000 is less.\n- 14,000 again is less.\n- 22,000 is more.\n- 20,000 is more.\n\nSo that gives me three matches where the crowd was under 19,000: first, fourth, and fifth? Wait, no. Let's recount:\n\nWait, row indices start from 0 to 5.\n\nRow 0: 15000 \u2192 yes\nRow 1: 25000 \u2192 no\nRow 2:14000 \u2192 yes\nRow3:14000 \u2192 yes\nRow4:22000\u2192no\nRow5:20000\u2192no\n\nWait, so that's three matches where the crowd was under 19k? Wait, row 0 is 15k, row2 is14k, row3 is14k. That's three rows with crowd <=19000.\n\nBut wait, row4 is22k and row5 is20k, which are above.\n\nSo yes, there are three matches where the crowd didn't surpass 19,000. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map the relevant cells. Each of these rows (0,2,3) have their crowd numbers in column 'crowd'. So the relevant cells are:\n\nrow_index: 0 \u2192 column_name: crowd\nrow_index:2\u2192 same\nrow_index:3\u2192same\n\nSo, the JSON should include those three with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 6 match , only 1 venue be use more than 1 time.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is stating. It mentions that in 6 matches, only one venue was used more than once. So I need to check each of these six matches and see how many times each venue appears.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a match between different home and away teams. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\" But for this claim, the date might not matter unless it's part of verifying that all matches happened on the same day, which I don't think is necessary here.\n\nI'm focusing on the venues. So I'll list out each venue from the six rows:\n\n1. Victoria Park\n2. Princes Park\n3. Punt Road Oval\n4. Arden Street Oval\n5. Junction Oval\n6. Western Oval\n\nNow, let's see how many times each venue appears:\n\n- Victoria Park: Once (row 0)\n- Princes Park: Once (row 1)\n- Punt Road Oval: Once (row 2)\n- Arden Street Oval: Once (row 3)\n- Junction Oval: Once (row 4)\n- Western Oval: Once (row 5)\n\nSo each venue is used only once in these six matches. That means none of the venues are reused more than once.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"only 1 venue be use more than 1 time.\" So it's suggesting that across all six matches, only one venue was used multiple times. However, from my analysis, each venue is used exactly once. Therefore, no venue was used more than once. \n\nThis means the claim is false because it implies that one venue was used more than once when actually none were. So the correct answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for this verification. The column in question is \"venue,\" so I need to consider each row's venue. Each of these six rows has a unique venue, but since none are repeated, perhaps all six venues are relevant because they confirm that no venue was used more than once.\n\nWait, maybe not all six. Since the claim is about only one venue being used more than once, but in reality, no venue is used more than once, so each venue is used exactly once or zero times beyond their single occurrence. But since each match is at a different venue, maybe each of these six venues are the ones that could potentially be the one reused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the columns where the venue appears more than once would be relevant. Since in this case, no venue does, perhaps all six rows have the \"venue\" cell as relevant because they all contribute to showing that none were used multiple times.\n\nBut I think it's more precise to say that each of these six venues are checked to ensure they don't repeat. So for each match (row), their venue is checked against other matches' venues.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be each row's \"venue\" column because we're checking whether any of them appear more than once across the six rows.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if only one venue is used more than once in the six matches. By examining each match's venue, we find that each venue appears exactly once. Therefore, no venue is used more than once, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that Richmond couldn't beat Hawthorn in a game played at Punt Road Oval. So, I need to check if this situation occurred based on the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match.\n\nTo verify the claim, I'll focus on matches where Richmond is the home team and Hawthorn is the away team, specifically at Punt Road Oval. \n\nI'll go through each row to find relevant data:\n\n1. First row: Home team is Collingwood, not Richmond.\n2. Second row: Home team is Carlton, not Richmond.\n3. Third row: Home team is Richmond with a score of 16.16 (112). The away team is Hawthorn with a score of 14.16 (100). The venue is Punt Road Oval. \n4. Fourth row: Home team is North Melbourne, irrelevant here.\n5. Fifth row: St Kilda vs Fitzroy, not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: Footscray vs Essendon, not relevant.\n\nSo, the third row is the one that matters because it's Richmond playing Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval.

Since 112 is more than 100, Richmond did defeat Hawthorn on that day.\n\nThe claim says \"Richmond be unable to defeat Hawthorn,\" which would mean Hawthorn won or it was a draw.

The home team is in column 0 (row index 2), home team score in column 1 (row index 2), away team is column 2 (row index 2), and venue is column 3 (row index 2). So, all these cells are relevant.\n\nI'll structure the JSON response accordingly. The answer is \"FALSE\" because Richmond did defeat Hawthorn that day, and the relevant_cells list includes each of those specific data points from the row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Collingwood lose to Melbourne by 5 points in front of 15000 spectators.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two teams: Collingwood and Melbourne. So I need to look at their respective rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the home team column, Collingwood is listed as the first row with a score of 12.12 (84). For the away team, Melbourne has a score of 12.7 (79). \n\nNow, the claim says Collingwood loses to Melbourne. Wait, but in the table, Collingwood's score is higher than Melbourne's. So that would mean Collingwood won, not lost. That already seems contradictory.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"lose.\" In footy terms, points are calculated as behinds and goals. The scores are in the format goals.behinds (total points). Collingwood has 12 goals and 12 behinds, totaling 84 points. Melbourne has 12 goals and 7 behinds, totaling 79 points. So Collingwood indeed scored more, which means they won.\n\nThe claim says Collingwood lost by 5 points. To check that, I need to see the difference between their scores. 84 minus 79 is 5 points. But wait, if Collingwood has more points, they should be the winner, not the loser. So Melbourne losing by 5 points doesn't make sense here.\n\nAlso, looking at the crowd number, it's 15000 spectators. In the table, that matches with the first row where Collingwood is home and Melbourne is away.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states that Collingwood lost to Melbourne by 5 points in front of 15000 people. However, according to the table, Collingwood won against Melbourne by 5 points. Therefore, the claim is false because Collingwood did not lose but actually won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Collingwood lost to Melbourne by 5 points with 15,000 spectators. The table shows Collingwood scored higher than Melbourne, meaning Collingwood won, contradicting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "fitzroy lose to st kilda by 11 point at junction oval on 22 march 1926",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant to support this decision. The claim is: \"fitzroy lose to st kilda by 11 point at junction oval on 22 march 1926.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Teams Involved**: The claim mentions fitzroy and st kilda as the teams involved. Looking at the table, I need to check if these are indeed home and away teams in any row.\n\n2. **Game Outcome**: It says fitzroy lost to st kilda. So, in the match, st kilda should be the winning team, and fitzroy should be the losing one.\n\n3. **Score Difference**: The claim specifies a margin of 11 points. This means that the difference between st kilda's score and fitzroy's score should be 11 points.\n\n4. **Venue**: The game is said to have been played at junction oval. I need to check if any row in the table has this venue for either team.\n\n5. **Date**: The claim states it happened on 22 march 1926. However, looking at the table, all dates are under \"date\" column and they read \"22 may 1926.\" So there's a discrepancy here\u2014march vs. may.\n\nNow, I'll go through each relevant aspect step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Relevant Rows**\n\nFirst, I need to find if fitzroy is either the home or away team in any row. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Home Team - collingwood; Away Team - melbourne\n- Row 1: Home Team - carlton; Away Team - south melbourne\n- Row 2: Home Team - richmond; Away Team - hawthorn\n- Row 3: Home Team - north melbourne; Away Team - geelong\n- Row 4: Home Team - st kilda; Away Team - fitzroy\n- Row 5: Home Team - footscray; Away Team - essendon\n\nSo, in Row 4, the home team is st kilda and away is fitzroy. This row seems relevant because it involves both teams mentioned in the claim.\n\n**Step 2: Check Game Outcome**\n\nIn Row 4, st kilda scored 9.8 (62) and fitzroy scored 7.9 (51). The difference between these scores is 62 - 51 = 11 points. So the margin is indeed 11 points, which matches the claim.\n\n**Step 3: Venue Check**\n\nThe venue for this row is \"junction oval,\" which matches the venue mentioned in the claim.\n\n**Step 4: Date Check**\n\nThe date in Row 4 is listed as \"22 may 1926.\" The claim states the date was \"22 march 1926.\" This is a mismatch\u2014march vs. may. Therefore, the date doesn't align with the claim.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the game involving fitzroy and st kilda at junction oval with an 11-point margin in favor of st kilda, the date discrepancy means the claim isn't fully accurate. The date in the table is May 22nd, not March 22nd as stated. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the date of the game as \"22 march 1926\" while the actual date in the table is \"22 may 1926.\" All other aspects match. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
