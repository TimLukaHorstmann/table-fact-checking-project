The claim states: \"week 7 top the chart with a total attendance of 74827.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It mentions week 7 and an attendance number, 74827. So I need to find out if in week 7, the attendance was indeed 74,827.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week, with various details including the week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. My task is to locate week 7 in this table and check its attendance figure.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row until I find the one labeled \"week 7\". The rows are numbered from 1 onwards, so week 7 should be at row index 6 (since it starts counting at 0). Once I'm at that row, I look at the \"attendance\" column. \n\nIn the table, the \"attendance\" for week 7 is listed as 74827. That matches exactly with what the claim is stating. So, the claim is asserting that in week 7, the attendance was 74,827, which is correct based on the data.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim are supported by the table, the answer should be \"TRUE\". \n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant for verification.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a game where the team played against the San Diego Chargers and that the final score was 27-0 in their favor.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a week of games, with details like the opponent and the result. My goal is to find the row where the opponent is the San Diego Chargers and check what the result was for that game.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's opponent column:\n\n- Week 1: Pittsburgh Steelers\n- Week 2: Indianapolis Colts\n- Week 3: Kansas City Chiefs\n- Week 4: San Diego Chargers\n\nAh, here we go. Week 4 was against the San Diego Chargers. Now I need to check what the result was for that week. The result column shows \"w 27 - 0\". So the team won by a score of 27-0.\n\nThe claim says the final score was 27-0, so it matches exactly with this row. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other rows that might have San Diego Chargers as opponents. Let me check all weeks again quickly. Weeks 4 and... actually, looking through the list, only Week 4 has the San Diego Chargers listed as the opponent. So yes, only one game against them with the score 27-0.\n\nSo the claim is fully supported by the table data.

The claim is: \"On September 13, 1992, the lowest attendance of the first 4 weeks was recorded at 44851.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It specifies a date (September 13, 1992) and mentions that this was the lowest attendance for the first 4 weeks. So, I need to check if September 13 falls within the first 4 weeks of the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with its corresponding date. The first four weeks would be weeks 1 through 4. Let's list out their dates:\n\n- Week 1: September 6, 1992\n- Week 2: September 13, 1992\n- Week 3: September 20, 1992\n- Week 4: September 27, 1992\n\nSo, week 2 is on September 13. That's the date mentioned in the claim. Now, I need to find out the attendance numbers for weeks 1 through 4 and see if week 2 (September 13) has the lowest attendance among these four.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' column:\n\n- Week 1: 63,713\n- Week 2: 44,851\n- Week 3: 60,955\n- Week 4: 57,491\n\nThe lowest attendance here is week 2 with 44,851. That matches the claim's number. So, it seems that the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other weeks in the first four that might have lower attendances.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"the result for week 13 be a win with a score of 24 - 21.\" So, I'm looking for week 13 in the table where the result is a win (w) against someone with a score of 24-21.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'week' column to find row 13. Scanning through the rows, I see that week 13 is indeed present. The row index for week 13 would be 12 because it's zero-indexed? Wait, no, in the table provided, the first week is row 0 or 1? Looking at the HTML, each <tr> corresponds to a week starting from week 1 as the first row. So, week 1 is row index 0, week 2 is row index 1, and so on up to week 17 being row index 16.\n\nWait, no, in the table, week is listed as 1,2,...,17, each as <td> elements. So, for example, the first row has week 1. Therefore, to find week 13, I need to look at the row where week=13. Looking through the table:\n\nWeek 1, 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,... So week 13 is in row index 12 (since it's the 13th item starting from 0). Wait no, let me count:\n\nRow 0: week 1\n\nRow 1: week 2\n\nRow 2: week3\n\n...\n\nRow 12 would be week 13 because 1+12=13? Or is each row index incremented by one. So yes, week 13 is in row 12 (0-based). Wait no, actually, the first <tr> is for week1 as row 0, so week13 would be at position 12.\n\nWait, no, let me count:\n\nRow 0: week1\n\nRow1: week2\n\nRow2: week3\n\nRow3: week4\n\nRow5: week6 (since weeks are 1,2,3,4, then week5 is missing? Wait, the table has week numbers as 1,2,3,4,6,7,... So between week4 and week6, it jumps to week6. That's a bit confusing. But regardless of that, I need to find where week13 is. Let me look through each row:\n\nLooking at the <tr> elements in the tbody:\n\n- The first few are for weeks 1,2,3,4, then 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,...\n\nSo yes, week13 is present as a separate row, probably around position 12. So I'll need to find that.\n\nOnce I locate the correct row, I need to check two columns: 'result' and maybe another column for attendance, but actually, only result matters here.\n\nIn the claim, the result should be a win (w) with score 24-21. So in the 'result' column of week13's row, it should say \"w 24 - 21\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 12: week13, opponent is detroit lions, result is w 24 -21.\n\nYes, that matches exactly. The result for week13 is a win with 24-21.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because all conditions are met in the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table where week 13 has a winning result of 24-21.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"week 8 have more attendance than week 9 with 58701 attendee.\" \n\nFirst, I'll locate weeks 8 and 9 in the table to compare their attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Week 8 has an attendance of 58,701.\n- Week 9 also has an attendance figure listed as 58,074.\n\nComparing these two, week 8's attendance (58,701) is indeed higher than week 9's (58,074). \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant.

Scanning the 'opponent' column, I see entries like Pittsburgh Steelers, Indianapolis Colts, Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers, and so on. So there's at least one game against the San Diego Chargers.\n\nNow, for each of these games, I need to check the 'result' column to see if any had a score of 27-0. Looking through the table, let's go row by row:\n\n- Week 4: Opponent is San Diego Chargers, result is w 27 - 0. That seems to match exactly.\n- Other games against them are week 6 and week 8, but their results are different: 38-24 and 26-10 respectively.\n\nSo the only game where they played the San Diego Chargers with a score of 27-0 is week 4. Therefore, the claim refers to that specific game.\n\nI need to check which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant columns are 'opponent' and 'result'. For week 4, the row index is 3 (since it starts at 1). So I'll include row_index: 3 and column_name: \"opponent\", as well as column_name: \"result\".\n\nWait, in the table, week is listed from 1 onwards.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"with a total attendance of over than 58701 , week 8 top the chart.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things: the attendance for week 8 being over 58,701 and that week 8 is at the top of the chart. So I need to check both conditions against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week, with columns for week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. My main focus will be on the \"week\" column and the \"attendance\" column.\n\nStarting with the first part: Is week 8's attendance over 58,701? I need to find week 8 in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Week 1: 63713\n- Week 2: 44851\n- Week 3: 60955\n- Week 4: 57491\n- Week 6: 54254\n- Week 7: 74827\n- Week 8: 58701\n- Week 9: 58074\n- Week 10: 57348\n- Week 11: 56726\n- Week 12: 63597\n- Week 13: 73711\n- Week 14: 62193\n- Week 15: 57285\n- Week 16: 59898\n- Week 17: 61742\n\nWeek 8 has an attendance of 58,701. The claim says \"over than 58701,\" which would mean strictly greater than 58,701. However, week 8's attendance is exactly 58,701. So this part might be a point of contention.\n\nNow, the second part: Does week 8 top the chart? This likely refers to having the highest attendance in the season. To check this, I need to compare week 8's attendance with all other weeks. \n\nLooking through all the attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 63,713\n- Week 2: 44,851\n- Week 3: 60,955\n- Week 4: 57,491\n- Week 6: 54,254\n- Week 7: 74,827 (highest so far)\n- Week 8: 58,701\n- Week 9: 58,074\n- Week 10: 57,348\n- Week 11: 56,726\n- Week 12: 63,597\n- Week 13: 73,711 (highest now)\n- Week 14: 62,193\n- Week 15: 57,285\n- Week 16: 59,898\n- Week 17: 61,742\n\nSo week 7 has the highest attendance at 74,827 and week 13 also had a high of 73,711. Therefore, week 8 doesn't have the highest attendance; it's lower than weeks 7 and 13.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n1. Week 8 attendance is exactly 58,701, not over.\n2. Even if it were over, it wouldn't be the highest attendance as weeks 7 and 13 are higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because week 8 does not have attendance over 58,701 and doesn't top the chart in terms of highest attendance.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: The claim mentions two main points. First, checking week 8's attendance against the \"attendance\" column. Second, determining if it's the highest, which would involve comparing across all weeks, so each row's \"attendance\" is relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because week 8's attendance is exactly 58,701 and does not exceed this number.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"on december 27 1992 an attendance of less than 44851 be count , lowest of the first 4 week\". So, breaking it down, the claim mentions a specific date (December 27, 1992) and claims that the attendance on that day was less than 44,851. Additionally, it refers to this being \"the lowest of the first 4 weeks\".\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each week's data starting from week 1 up to week 17. The claim specifically mentions December 27, which is Week 17 because the last row in the tbody shows Week 17.\n\nNow, focusing on Week 17: According to the table, on December 27, 1992 (Week 17), the attendance was 61742. I need to compare this with the threshold of less than 44,851. Since 61,742 is much higher than 44,851, it doesn't meet the condition of being less than 44,851.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lowest of the first 4 weeks\". So perhaps I should check the attendance figures for Weeks 1 through 4 to see if Week 17's attendance is indeed the lowest among these. Let me list out the attendances:\n\nWeek 1: 63,713\nWeek 2: 44,851\nWeek 3: 60,955\nWeek 4: 57,491\n\nSo, the lowest attendance in the first four weeks is Week 2 with 44,851.\n\nBut Week 17's attendance is 61,742, which is higher than this. Therefore, it can't be the lowest of the first four weeks because it's after that period. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim meant \"lowest among the first four games\" or something else. But as per the wording, it says \"the lowest of the first 4 week.\" So, if we take the first four weeks (weeks 1-4), their attendances are:\n\nWeek 1: ~63k\nWeek 2: ~44k\nWeek 3: ~60k\nWeek 4: ~57k\n\nThe lowest among these is Week 2 at ~44k. Now, looking at Week 17, it's higher than that, so the claim stating that Week 17 attendance is less than 44,851 and the lowest of the first four weeks is incorrect.\n\nSo, the attendance on December 27, 1992 (Week 17) was 61,742, which is greater than 44,851. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not less than 44851 on that date, and also because that week isn't among the first four weeks.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the attendance on December 27, 1992 (Week 17) was higher than the stated threshold and doesn't qualify as the lowest of the first four weeks. Relevant cells are Week 1-4 to check their attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"during the week after 13 the result be a win with a score of 24 - 21.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It mentions a specific week after week 13 and specifies that the result was a win against an opponent with a score of 24-21.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week (from 1 to 17). The columns relevant here are 'week', 'opponent', 'result', and maybe 'date' because it's about the timing relative to week 13.\n\nSince the claim refers to \"the week after 13,\" I need to find the week that comes right after week 13 in the table. Checking the row indices, week 13 is at index 12 (since lists are zero-indexed, but the table uses sequential numbering). So the next week would be week 14.\n\nNow, I'll look for week 14 in the table. In row 12, week 14 occurred on December 7, 1992 against the Chicago Bears. The result was a win with a score of 24-7. Wait, that doesn't match the claim's score of 24-21.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the table. Week 13 is indeed week 13, and week 14 is next. But the score for week 14 is 24-7, not 24-21. So that doesn't match the claim's expected score.\n\nWait another thought: could there be a week after 13 that I'm not seeing? Let me count the weeks again. The table goes up to week 17, so weeks 14, 15, 16, 17 are all after week 13. But none of these have a result of 24-21.\n\nWait another angle: perhaps the claim refers to a specific opponent who scored 24-21 against. Let me check all the weeks after 13 for any win with that score.\n\nLooking at week 14: Chicago Bears, won 24-7.\nWeek 15: Green Bay Packers, lost 16-14.\nWeek 16: Cleveland Browns, won 17-14.\nWeek 17: Buffalo Bills, won 27-3.\n\nNone of these weeks have a win with a score of 24-21. So the claim seems to be incorrect based on this.\n\nWait another possibility: maybe week 13 is part of the \"after 13\" context? No, because it's the week after, so week 14 onwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent was not correctly identified in the table. Let me check each week after 13 again:\n\n- Week 14: Opponent is Chicago Bears, result 24-7.\n- Week 15: Opponent is Green Bay Packers, result lost 16-14.\n- Week 16: Opponent is Cleveland Browns, won 17-14.\n- Week 17: Opponent is Buffalo Bills, won 27-3.\n\nNone match the score of 24-21. Therefore, the claim is not supported by any week after 13 in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with the row indices? Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: week1\n...\nRow 12: week14\nYes, that's correct. So week14 is index 12, and the result is 24-7, not 24-21.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there is no week after 13 with a result of 24-21 win.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"september 13 , 1992 have attendance more than 44851\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to September 13, 1992 in the table. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n1. September 6, 1992\n2. September 13, 1992\n3. September 20, 1992\n4. September 27, 1992\n5. October 11, 1992\n...\n\nSo, row 2 (since it's the second one) corresponds to September 13, 1992.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'attendance' for that particular game. The 'attendance' column in row 2 shows 44851.\n\nThe claim states that this attendance is \"more than 44851.\" So, comparing 44851 (from the table) with the number in the claim, which is also 44851. Wait, but the claim says more than 44851, so it's checking if it's higher than that same number.\n\nBut actually, 44851 is equal to 44851, not more. Therefore, the attendance isn't greater; it's exactly the same. So the claim should be FALSE because it's not more than 44851, just equal.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me look again at row 2: date is September 13, 1992, opponent is Indianapolis Colts, result is win 20-10, attendance is 44851. So yes, the attendance is exactly 44851, not more than that number.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"september 13 , 1992 have attendance more than 44851\" is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Locate the relevant row**: The date September 13, 1992 corresponds to row index 2 in the table.\n2. **Check the 'attendance' value**: In row 2, the 'attendance' cell has a value of 44,851.\n\nThe claim states that attendance is more than 44,851. However, since the actual attendance is exactly 44,851, it does not meet the criteria of being \"more than\" 44,851. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by breaking down what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a specific score: 19 - 16. I need to check if any row in the table has this exact score. Looking at the 'result' column because that's where scores are recorded.\n\nNext, the week number mentioned is week 13. So, I'll look for the row where 'week' is 13 and see what the result was.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Pittsburgh Steelers, loss with a score of 29 - 24\n- Week 2: Indianapolis Colts, win 20 - 10\n- Week 3: Kansas City Chiefs, win 23 - 20\n- Week 4: San Diego Chargers, win 27 - 0\n- Week 6: Cincinnati Bengals, win 38 - 24\n- Week 7: Denver Broncos, loss 27 - 21\n- Week 8: Cincinnati Bengals, win 26 - 10\n- Week 9: Pittsburgh Steelers, loss 21 - 20\n- Week 10: Cleveland Browns, loss 24 - 14\n- Week 11: Minnesota Vikings, win 17 - 13\n- Week 12: Miami Dolphins, loss 19 - 16\n- Week 13: Detroit Lions, win 24 - 21\n- Week 14: Chicago Bears, win 24 - 7\n- Week 15: Green Bay Packers, loss 16 - 14\n- Week 16: Cleveland Browns, win 17 - 14\n- Week 17: Buffalo Bills, win 27 - 3\n\nWait a minute, I'm looking for the score 19 - 16. Let me check each 'result' column:\n\n- Week 12 has a result of \"l 19 - 16\". So that's a loss with that exact score.\n- Week 13 is \"w 24 - 21\", which doesn't match.\n\nSo, the claim says it was week 13 and the score 19 - 16. But in week 13, they won against Detroit Lions with a different score. The only time 19 - 16 happened was in week 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the specified week (13) doesn't have that score. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in week 13, the score was 19-16. By examining the table, I find that week 13 resulted in a win with a score of 24-21.
