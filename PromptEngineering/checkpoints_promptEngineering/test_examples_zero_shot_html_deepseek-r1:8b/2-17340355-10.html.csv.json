    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest attendance be at the american airline center\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the highest attendance figure recorded in the table occurs at the American Airlines Center. So, to verify this, I need to look for the highest attendance number and check where it's located.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a game number, date, team, location with attendance, and the game record. The relevant column here is \"attendance,\" which seems to be a numerical value representing the number of people who attended each game.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the highest attendance number:\n\n- Game 75: Attendance is 18,422\n- Game 76: Attendance is 18,422\n- Game 77: Attendance is 20,301\n- Game 78: Attendance is 17,781\n- Game 79: Attendance is 15,908\n- Game 80: Attendance is 18,478\n- Game 81: Attendance is 18,422\n- Game 82: Attendance is not specified because the cell is empty.\n\nWait, game 82's attendance is missing. That might be a problem because if that were the highest, we can't confirm it. But looking at the numbers, game 77 has the highest attendance of 20,301, which is higher than the others listed except maybe if game 82 was higher but since it's missing, I can't use it.\n\nSo, the highest attendance in the table is at game 77, held at the American Airlines Center with 20,301 attendees. That matches the claim stating that the highest attendance is at the American Airline Center. \n\nI should also check if any other location has a higher number, but from what's provided, none do. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the highest attendance and its corresponding location. The highest attendance in the table is 20,301 at the American Airlines Center.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then specify which cells are relevant for verification. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim says: \"3 of the game at the us airways center have the same attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part means. The key points are:\n\n1. Looking at games (so rows in the table).\n2. These games must be held at the US Airways Center.\n3. For these specific games, there must be three instances where the attendance is the same.\n\nSo, my first step is to go through the table and identify which rows have the game location as \"us airways center.\"\n\nLooking at the 'location' column:\n\n- Row 0: us airways center\n- Row 1: us airways center\n- Row 2: american airlines center\n- Row 3: new orleans arena\n- Row 4: fedexforum\n- Row 5: target center\n- Row 6: us airways center\n- Row 7: us airways center\n\nSo, rows 0,1,6,7 are at US Airways Center.\n\nNow, the claim is about three games having the same attendance. So within these four rows (0,1,6,7), I need to check if any three have the same attendance number.\n\nLet me list out each row's attendance:\n\n- Row 0: 18422\n- Row 1: 18422\n- Row 6: 18422\n- Row 7: ?\n\nWait, in row 7, it says \"us airways center\" but there's no attendance listed. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 7 is game 82 on April 15 against Golden State. The location is us airways center, but I don't see an attendance number. Hmm, perhaps that row was incomplete or maybe I missed it. Wait, in the HTML provided, each <td> under 'location attendance' seems to have two parts separated by a space. So for row 7:\n\n<td>us airways center</td>\n\nWait, no, looking again, row 7's location is \"us airways center\" without any attendance number. Let me count the columns properly.\n\nThe table has these columns: game, date, team, location attendance, record.\n\nSo each 'location attendance' cell contains both location and attendance. For example:\n\nRow 0: us airways center 18422\n\nSimilarly, row 1: same, row 6: us airways center 18422.\n\nWait, so for row 7, it's \"us airways center\" but no attendance number? Or is the attendance missing?\n\nLooking back:\n\n<tr>\n<td>82</td>\n<td>april 15</td>\n<td>golden state</td>\n<td>us airways center</td>\n<td>46 - 36</td>\n</tr>\n\nSo yes, row 7's location is \"us airways center\" but there's no attendance number. So perhaps that cell is missing data, or maybe it's just listed as \"us airways center\" without the attendance.\n\nHmm, this might be a problem because if the attendance isn't provided for all US Airways Center games, then we can't check the attendance numbers accurately. But in row 7, the location is us airways center but no attendance number, so I can't include it in the relevant cells because there's missing data.\n\nSo, considering only rows where both 'location' and 'attendance' are present, which would be rows 0,1,6.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nEach row has a 'location attendance' column. So for each row, that single cell contains both location and attendance. So in row 7, it's \"us airways center\" but without the attendance number. So maybe the cell is missing the attendance part? Or perhaps it's just listed as \"us airways center\", implying attendance data was not recorded or is missing.\n\nIf so, then for our analysis, we can only consider rows where the 'location attendance' includes both location and attendance. So rows 0,1,6 have complete data with attendance numbers:\n\n- Row 0: us airways center 18422\n- Row 1: us airways center 18422\n- Row 6: us airways center 18422\n\nWait, but row 6's attendance is listed as \"us airways center 18422\". No, wait, looking at the HTML:\n\n<tr>\n<td>81</td>\n<td>april 13</td>\n<td>memphis</td>\n<td>us airways center 18422</td>\n<td>45 - 36</td>\n</tr>\n\nSo row 6 (game 81) has attendance 18422.\n\nWait, but the user's table shows:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 7, with game numbers 75-82. Let me list them all:\n\nGame 75: attendance 18422\n\nGame 76: attendance 18422\n\nGame 77: 20301 (different)\n\nGame 78: 17781\n\nGame79:15908\n\nGame80:18478\n\nGame81:18422\n\nGame82: missing data.\n\nSo, the games at US Airways Center with complete attendance are:\n\n- Game75:18422\n\n- Game76:18422\n\n- Game81:18422\n\nThat's three games. Now, do they have the same attendance? Let me check each:\n\nGame75: 18,422\n\nGame76:18,422\n\nGame81:18,422\n\nYes, all three have the same attendance of 18,422.\n\nSo, that satisfies the claim: \"3 of the game at us airways center have the same attendance.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nThe cells would be those in the rows where the location is US Airways Center and attendance is 18422. So:\n\n- Row0 (game75): location attendance is \"us airways center 18422\"\n\n- Row1 (game76): same\n\n- Row6 (game81): same\n\nThus, the relevant cells are these three.\n\nWait, but in terms of which data points exactly?\n\nEach row has a game number, date, team, location attendance, and record. The claim refers to games at US Airways Center with the same attendance. So the key columns would be 'location attendance' column for each relevant row.\n\nThus, the cells to include are the 'location attendance' cells for these three rows.\n\nSo in terms of HTML table cells, they would correspond to:\n\n- game75's location attendance cell\n\n- game76's location attendance cell\n\n- game81's location attendance cell\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those with content \"us airways center 18422\" in the 'location attendance' column.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying three games at US Airways Center that share the same attendance number. Upon examining the provided data:\n\n- Game 75: Attendance 18,422\n- Game 76: Attendance 18,422\n- Game 81: Attendance 18,422\n\nThese three games meet the criteria of having the same attendance at US Airways Center.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe answer is \\boxed{TRUE}. The relevant cells are those corresponding to Games 75, 76, and 81 in the 'location attendance' column.",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the table carefully. Each row represents a game with details like game number, date, team, location and attendance, and the record. The claim refers to two specific games: one at Target Center and another at FedExForum.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all games played at these venues. Let's scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Houston vs Sacramento at US Airways Center.\n- Row 1: Sacramento vs Dallas at US Airways Center.\n- Row 2: Dallas vs New Orleans at New Orleans Arena.\n- Row 3: New Orleans vs Memphis at FedExForum (15908 attendance).\n- Row 4: Memphis vs Minnesota at Target Center (18478 attendance).\n- Row 5: Memphis vs Golden State at US Airways Center.\n\nWait, so the game at FedExForum is row 3. The game at Target Center is row 4. So the claim says that the Target Center game happens after the FedExForum game.\n\nLooking at their dates: FedExForum game on April 10, and Target Center game on April 11. So yes, April 11 comes after April 10. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns involved are 'date' for both games.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the game against new orleans didn't have the highest attendance\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about the game against New Orleans and its attendance compared to others in the table. The key here is to find out if this particular game had lower attendance than all others or just lower than some.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different game with details like date, team, location, attendance, etc. My focus should be on the \"attendance\" column for games involving New Orleans.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Game 75**: April 1 vs Houston at US Airways Center with 18,422 attendees.\n2. **Game 76**: April 3 vs Sacramento at same venue, same attendance.\n3. **Game 77**: April 5 vs Dallas in a different venue (American Airlines Center) with 20,301.\n4. **Game 78**: April 8 vs New Orleans at New Orleans Arena with 17,781.\n5. **Game 79**: April 10 vs Memphis at FedExForum with 15,908.\n6. **Game 80**: April 11 vs Minnesota at Target Center with 18,478.\n7. **Game 81**: April 13 vs Memphis again at US Airways Center with same 18,422 as Game 75 and 76.\n8. **Game 82**: April 15 vs Golden State at US Airways Center with 18,000+ (46-36).\n\nNow, the claim is about New Orleans' game attendance. Looking for their game in the table:\n\nGame 78: Date April 8, location New Orleans Arena, attendance 17,781.\n\nI need to check if this was the highest or not. Let's list all attendances from the table:\n\n- Game 75: 18,422\n- Game 76: 18,422\n- Game 77: 20,301\n- Game 78: 17,781\n- Game 79: 15,908\n- Game 80: 18,478\n- Game 81: 18,422\n- Game 82: 18,000+\n\nSo the highest attendance is 20,301 in Game 77 against Dallas. The next highest are Games 75,76,80,81,82 with 18,422 or higher.\n\nGame 78 had 17,781, which is less than the highest (20,301) but more than some others like 15,908 and 18,478? Wait, no: 17,781 is actually higher than 15,908 but lower than 18,422. So it's not the lowest, but also not the highest.\n\nWait, 18,478 in Game 80 is higher than 17,781. So Game 78 isn't the lowest either. The attendance numbers are:\n\n- Highest: 20,301\n- Next: 18,422 (Games 75,76,81)\n- Then: 18,478 (Game80)\n- Then: 17,781 (Game78)\n- Lowest:15,908 (Game79)\n\nSo Game 78's attendance is higher than some but lower than others. Therefore, the claim says it didn't have the highest attendance, which is true because its attendance was not the highest in the table.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions three teams: golden state, memphis, and new orleans. So, I need to look at these team names in the table to find their respective attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the 'team' column:\n\n- For \"golden state\": Scanning each row's team name, I see it appears on row 82.\n- For \"memphis\": It's listed on rows 79 and 81.\n- For \"new orleans\": Found on row 78.\n\nNow, I need to check the attendance for each of these teams. The 'location attendance' column seems to combine both location and attendance numbers. For example, \"us airways center 18422\" probably means the arena's name is us airways center with 18,422 attendees.\n\nFor golden state (row 82), the location is \"us airways center\". Since it doesn't have a number before \"us airways center,\" I assume attendance isn't provided here. Wait, actually, looking again, row 82 says \"us airways center\" without a number, which might mean the attendance wasn't recorded or isn't included in this table.\n\nBut for memphis (rows 79 and 81) and new orleans (row 78), their attendances are listed as:\n\n- Memphis: 15908 (row 79) and 18,422 (row 81)\n- New Orleans: 17,781 (row 78)\n\nSince golden state's attendance isn't specified in the table, we can't compare it. Without knowing if they have the same attendance, the claim might be FALSE. However, if the table doesn't provide their numbers, maybe the answer is also based on whether the data supports the claim.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to check if the claim is fully supported by the table. If any of the three teams don't have an attendance number in the relevant rows, then the statement can't be verified as TRUE because there's missing data.\n\nSo, golden state (row 82) doesn't have a specific attendance listed.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of the claim means. The key points are that there's a highest attendance and that it occurs specifically at Target Center. So my task is to check if any game played at Target Center has higher attendance compared to other venues in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different game with details like game number, date, team, location, attendance, and record. The \"location\" column includes places like US Airways Center, American Airlines Center, New Orleans Arena, FedExForum, Target Center, etc., along with their respective attendances.\n\nI need to find all the rows where the location is \"Target Center\" because that's the venue in question. From the table:\n\n- Row 80: game 80, date April 11, team Minnesota, location Target Center, attendance 18,478.\n  \nThat's the only row for Target Center in the provided data. Now, I have to check if this attendance is higher than any other venue's highest attendance.\n\nLooking at other venues:\n\n- US Airways Center: Games 75, 76, 81, and 82 had attendances 18,422; the highest there is 18,422.\n- American Airlines Center: Game 77 with 20,301 is the highest for that venue.\n- New Orleans Arena: Game 78 with 17,781.\n- FedExForum: Game 79 with 15,908.\n\nSo, Target Center's attendance of 18,478 needs to be compared against these. The next highest is at US Airways Center with 18,422 and American Airlines with 20,301.\n\nWait a minute, 20,301 is higher than 18,478. So the highest attendance overall in the table isn't at Target Center but at American Airlines Center. Therefore, the claim that \"the highest attendance be at the target center\" would be FALSE because another venue has a higher attendance.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any other Target Center games beyond what's shown. The data only goes up to game 82. If there were more games not listed here, perhaps with higher attendances, that could affect the claim. However, based on the given table, I can only use the data provided.\n\nSo within the data, the highest attendance is at American Airlines Center (20,301), which is higher than Target Center's 18,478.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the game at the fedexforum take place after the game at the target center\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then analyzing the table step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific games: one at FedExForum and another at Target Center. The claim states that the game at FedExForum happened after the one at Target Center. So I need to check if there are any games in the table for these locations and see their respective dates to determine if FedExForum's game was indeed later.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, team, location, attendance, and record. The relevant columns here are 'game', 'date', 'location', and 'attendance'. But more importantly for this claim, I need to focus on 'location' and 'date'.\n\nFirst, I'll identify all the games that took place at FedExForum and Target Center.\n\nScrolling through the table:\n\n- Row 8: game 79, date April 10, location FedExforum.\n- Any other FedExForum games? No, only row 8.\n\nFor Target Center:\n- Row 9: game 80, date April 11, location Target center. Wait, let me count correctly. The rows are numbered starting from 0 or 1? Let me check the HTML code. The first <tr> is for game 75 as row index 0. So game 80 would be at index 8.\n\nWait, no: looking again, each <tr> represents a row. The first tr (index 0) is game 75, then index 1 is 76, up to index 8 which is game 80. So Target Center is at index 8, game 80, date April 11.\n\nFedExForum is at index 7 (game 79), date April 10.\n\nSo the Target Center game was on April 11, and FedExForum was on April 10. Wait, that's a problem because April 10 comes before April 11. So the claim says that the FedExForum game took place after the Target Center game, but according to the dates, Target Center is later.\n\nWait, no: game at FedExForum is on April 10 (game 79), and game at Target Center is on April 11 (game 80). So the Target Center game is after FedExForum's. Therefore, the claim says that FedExForum's game is after Target's, which is incorrect because it happened earlier.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify: The claim is \"the game at the fedexforum take place after the game at the target center.\" So they're comparing two games: one at FedEx and one at Target. The claim says FedEx's game was after Target's.\n\nBut according to the dates:\n\n- FedExForum: April 10 (game 79)\n- Target Center: April 11 (game 80)\n\nSo Target's game is on April 11, which is after April 10. Therefore, the claim is saying that FedEx's game happened after Target's, but in reality, Target's was later. So the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure there are only those two games involved. Let me check if there are any other games at those locations. In the table:\n\n- FedExForum: game 79 on April 10.\n- Target Center: game 80 on April 11.\n\nNo others, so yes, only those two games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the game at FedExForum was before the one at Target Center.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, regarding relevant cells, which ones are needed to verify this?\n\nWe need to check the location and date for both games. So for each of these locations, we have to find their respective rows.\n\nLooking for FedExForum: it's in row 7 (index 7) because game 79 is index 7? Wait, no: the first row (game 75) is index 0, so game 79 would be at index 7. Because 75 is 0, 76 is 1, ..., 79 is 7 (since 75 +7=82, wait no, 75+7=82? Wait, actually, each row increments the game number by 1, so game 75 is row 0, game 76 row 1,..., game 80 would be row 8.\n\nWait, let me count again. Game numbers start at 75 and go up to 82. So the rows are:\n\nRow 0: game 75\nRow 1: game 76\n...\nRow 7: game 79 (since 75 +7=82? Wait no, 75 is row 0, so each row adds one. So game 75 is 0, 76 is 1,..., 79 is 4? No, wait:\n\nWait 75 is row 0,\n\nRow index = game number -75.\n\nSo for game 79: 79-75=4, but that's incorrect because in the HTML, the first <tr> is for game 75 as index 0. So each tr corresponds to a game number incremented by 1 starting from 75.\n\nThus:\n\nGame 75: row 0\n76:1\n77:2\n78:3\n79:4\n80:5? Wait no, the HTML shows up to game 82, which is row 8 (since 82-75=7, so row index 7). Wait, wait the last row is for game 82 as per the table:\n\nLooking at the tbody, it has tr elements. Let me count them.\n\nYes, in the tbody, there are 9 <tr> tags: from line 4 to line 12. So rows 0-8 (since first is 0).\n\nSo:\n\nGame 75: row 0\n76:1\n77:2\n78:3\n79:4\n80:5\n81:6\n82:7? Wait, no, because the last tr in the tbody has game 82, which would be row index 8 (since 82-75=7, but indexes start at 0). So maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The games go from 75 to 82, so that's 8 games after 75? Wait no: 75 is the first game, then 76 up to 82: 82-75+1=8 games. But in the HTML, the tbody has 9 tr elements (from line 4 to 12), meaning 9 rows, which would correspond to game numbers 75 through 83? Wait no, because in the table:\n\nLooking at the last row:\n\n<tr>...</tr>\n\nThe content is:\n\n78:3\n79:4\n80:5\n81:6\n82:7?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. To find the relevant cells, we need to identify which rows correspond to FedExForum and Target Center.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- FedExForum: location is in game 79 (row 4)\n- Target Center: location is in game 80 (row 5)\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows are row 4 and row 5.\n\nThus, the cells we need are:\n\nFor row 4 (game 79): <tr> with game 79, location FedExForum, date April 10.\n\nFor row 5 (game 80): <tr> with game 80, location Target Center, date April 11.\n\nTherefore, these two rows are needed to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game at FedExForum took place after the one at Target Center. However, based on the provided data, the game at Target Center (April 11) occurred after the game at FedExForum (April 10). Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is false because the game at FedExForum happened before the game at Target Center.\n\n**Relevant cells:**  \n- Game 79 at FedExForum: row index 4\n- Game 80 at Target Center: row index 5",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the game against new orleans have the highest attendance\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that the game against New Orleans has the highest attendance among all games listed in the table. So, my task is to check if any of the games listed are against New Orleans and if their attendance is higher than all others.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, team, location, and attendance. I need to identify which rows involve New Orleans as either home or away teams.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 75**: Houston vs. New Orleans in Houston. The location is US Airways Center with 18,422 attendees.\n2. **Row 76**: Sacramento vs. New Orleans in Sacramento. Attendance is also 18,422.\n3. **Row 77**: Dallas vs. New Orleans in Dallas. Attendance is 20,301, which is higher than the previous two.\n4. **Row 78**: New Orleans vs. New Orleans. Wait, that seems odd because it's playing against themselves? The location is New Orleans Arena with 17,781 attendees.\n5. **Row 79**: Memphis vs. New Orleans in Memphis. Attendance is 15,908.\n6. **Row 80**: Minnesota vs. New Orleans in Minneapolis. Attendance is 18,478.\n7. **Row 81**: Memphis vs. New Orleans again in Houston (US Airways Center) with 18,422 attendees.\n8. **Row 82**: Golden State vs. New Orleans in Fresno (US Airways Center). Attendance is 46.\n\nWait a minute, that last one doesn't seem right. Golden State is playing against New Orleans at the US Airways Center, but Fresno is mentioned as the location? That might be a typo because the US Airways Center is typically in Arizona, not Fresno. Maybe it's a mistake, and the location should be something else, but for now, I'll proceed with what's given.\n\nNow, focusing on the games involving New Orleans:\n\n- **Row 75**: Attendance 18,422\n- **Row 76**: Attendance 18,422\n- **Row 77**: Attendance 20,301 (Dallas game)\n- **Row 78**: Attendance 17,781 (self-game)\n- **Row 79**: 15,908\n- **Row 80**: 18,478\n- **Row 81**: 18,422\n- **Row 82**: 46\n\nFrom this list, the highest attendance is in Row 77 with 20,301. So, the game against Dallas has the highest attendance among all New Orleans games.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the game against new orleans have the highest attendance.\" It might be a bit ambiguous whether it refers to any single game involving New Orleans or each game they play. However, since one of their games (against Dallas) does have the highest attendance, that would make the claim true.\n\nI should also check if there are multiple games against New Orleans, which there are, but only one has the highest attendance. The claim doesn't specify a particular game, just that in general, their games have high attendance. So, it's TRUE because at least one of their games has the highest attendance.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: I need to find which rows and columns support this claim. Since we're looking for the highest attendance, the column is \"attendance\" in each row where New Orleans is involved.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- **Row 75**: Attendance data\n- **Row 76**: Attendance data\n- **Row 77**: Attendance data (highest)\n- **Row 78**: Attendance data\n- **Row 79**: Attendance data\n- **Row 80**: Attendance data\n- **Row 81**: Attendance data\n- **Row 82**: Attendance data\n\nBut actually, the claim is about \"the game against new orleans,\" so maybe it's referring to all games involving New Orleans. However, each row where New Orleans is a team would be relevant.\n\nSo, I'll list all rows where \"new orleans\" appears in either the 'team' or 'location' columns because that's where they play.\n\nLooking at the 'team' column:\n\n- Row 75: opponent is New Orleans\n- Row 76: opponent is New Orleans\n- Row 77: opponent is New Orleans\n- Row 78: team is New Orleans\n- Row 80: opponent is New Orleans\n\nRow 81 and 82 are against New Orleans as well, but the 'team' column lists \"memphis\" and \"golden state,\" so their opponents are New Orleans.\n\nTherefore, all rows where either the team or location is New Orleans would be relevant. So, rows 75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82.\n\nBut more specifically, since the claim is about attendance, I need to extract the 'attendance' values for these games and see if any are higher than others.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the 'attendance' entries in these rows. Each of those cells provides data that could support or negate the claim, so they're all relevant.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify if any game against New Orleans has the highest attendance. By examining each row where New Orleans is involved, we find that the game against Dallas (Row 77) has the highest attendance of 20,301. Since this is higher than all other attendances for games involving New Orleans, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 75,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 76,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 77,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 78,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 79,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 80,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 81,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 82,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
