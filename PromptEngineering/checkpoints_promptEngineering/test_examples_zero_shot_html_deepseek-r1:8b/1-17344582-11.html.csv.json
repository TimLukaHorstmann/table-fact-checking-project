    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"With a final score of 75 - 86, B Shaw have 5 assist.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the game with a score of 75-86 in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Score is 75-86. That's the first match.\n- Rows 1,2,3,4,5 don't have that score.\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 0.\n\nNow, I need to check if B Shaw has exactly 5 assists in this game. Looking at the 'high assists' column for row 0: It says \"b shaw (5)\". That's exactly 5 assists. \n\nWait, but sometimes in basketball stats, assists can be shared or have multiple contributors. In this case, the high assists column lists B Shaw with 5, which is a clear indication that he had 5 assists.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are true: there's a game with that score (row 0), and B Shaw indeed has 5 assists there.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"the location attendance for the 1 - 1 be boston garden.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"location attendance,\" which probably refers to where a game was played and how many people attended. Then it specifies \"for the 1 - 1\" series and says it's at Boston Garden.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, etc., and one of them is \"location attendance.\" The rows represent different games, identified by numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc. Each row has details about a specific game.\n\nThe claim is specifically referring to the series where the Pistons played against someone with a record of 1 - 1. From the table, I see that in game 2, the score is \"w 109 - 103\" and the series is listed as \"1 - 1.\" That must be the one.\n\nSo for game 2, which has series 1 - 1, I need to check where it was played. The column for location attendance is listed as \"Boston garden.\" Wait, in the table, the location attendance cell for game 2 says \"boston garden\" without a number or anything else. It just states the location.\n\nSo the claim is stating that for the series 1 - 1, the location attendance is at Boston Garden. From the table, in game 2, which corresponds to series 1 - 1, the location is indeed Boston Garden.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the relevant cell in the \"location attendance\" column for the corresponding series matches the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the location of the game where the Pistons played with a 1-1 series record. In row 2, column \"location attendance\" is \"boston garden.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's talking about a game played at Boston Garden and its series record being 5-2. So, I need to check if there's such a game in the table that meets these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc. The relevant columns for this claim would likely be 'series' and perhaps 'location attendance', but the main focus is on the series record, so the 'series' column is key here.\n\nI need to find all games that were played at Boston Garden because the claim specifies \"at boston garden.\" So I'll filter the rows where the 'location attendance' column mentions Boston Garden. From the table, I can see that games 1, 2, and 5 are at Boston Garden. Let me check each of these.\n\nNow, looking at their series records:\n- Game 1: series is 0 - 1\n- Game 2: series is 1 - 1\n- Game 5: series is 2 - 3\n\nNone of these games have a series record of 5-2. The highest series in the Boston Garden games is 2-3 for game 5.\n\nTherefore, there's no game at Boston Garden with a series record of 5-2. So the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
