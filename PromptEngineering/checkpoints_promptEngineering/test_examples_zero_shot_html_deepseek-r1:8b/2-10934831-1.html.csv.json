    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about the warning sign is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"the warning sign have a yellow background colour and a triangular shape.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each part of the claim against the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol. Each row represents a different type of sign with specific attributes.\n\nThe claim mentions two things:\n1. The warning sign has a yellow background colour.\n2. It has a triangular shape.\n\nI need to verify both parts by checking the corresponding cells in the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: yellow background colour. In the table, under each row's \"background colour\" column, I should look for the color associated with the 'warning' sign. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: warning - background is yellow.\n- Rows 1 and 2: prohibition and mandatory instructions have white or blue backgrounds.\n- Row 3: supplementary has blue yellow.\n- Row 4: directions sometimes has yellow.\n- Row 5: information has blue.\n\nSo, the first part of the claim is correct for 'warning' signs. Now checking the second part: triangular shape. The 'shape' column in the table lists each sign's shape. For 'warning', it's triangular as per row 0.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells beyond these two that might affect the claim, but it seems only the background colour and shape columns for the warning sign are relevant here.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the warning sign has a yellow background color and a triangular shape as per the table. The relevant cells confirm these attributes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"background colour\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"shape\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It has columns: type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol. Each row corresponds to different types of signs and their attributes.\n\nThe claim is about the warning sign specifically. So I should focus on the row where \"type of sign\" is \"warning\". Looking through the rows, the first row has \"warning\" as the type.\n\nNow, checking the border column for this row: it says \"red\". That matches the part of the claim regarding the red border.\n\nNext, checking the text/symbol column: it states \"black\".

Let me find their rows in the table.\n\nStarting with the first row after the header:\n- Type: warning\n- Shape: triangular\n- Border: red\n\nSo, the warning sign has a red border. That's consistent with the claim so far.\n\nNext, looking for the prohibition sign. The second row is prohibition:\n- Type: prohibition\n- Shape: circular\n- Border: red\n\nAgain, the border is red. So both signs have a red border as per the table.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other details that might affect this. For example, sometimes signs can vary, but in the given data, both warning and prohibition have red borders. \n\nI think that's all.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the mandatory instruction sign have a blue background\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by understanding the task step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has five columns: type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol. There are six rows, each representing a different type of sign with their respective attributes.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"mandatory instruction signs\" having a blue background. So, my first step is to locate the row that corresponds to \"mandatory instructions.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that the third row has this as its first cell. That's row 2 if we're zero-indexing or row 3 if one-indexed, but since the example uses zero-indexing (like in their sample JSON), I'll stick with that.\n\nNext, I need to find the column related to background colour. Looking at the headers, the relevant column is \"background colour.\" So for the \"mandatory instructions\" row, which is row index 2, the background colour cell is what's important here.\n\nNow, checking the data in that cell: according to the table, under \"background colour,\" it says \"blue.\" That matches exactly with the claim. The claim states that the background is blue, and the table confirms this for mandatory instruction signs.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. I don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would negate this fact. Each row seems to represent a different type of sign with its own attributes, so focusing solely on the relevant row and column gives me the necessary confirmation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the relevant cells are at row index 2 and column \"background colour,\" which clearly states blue. This means the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"background colour\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"blue be the background color of the white border for the mandatory instruction sign\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table has several columns: type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol. Each row corresponds to a different type of sign with various attributes.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"mandatory instruction sign,\" so I need to find the row where the type is \"mandatory instructions.\" Looking through the rows, the third row has this exact header:\n\n- type: mandatory instructions\n- shape: circular\n- border: white\n- background colour: blue\n- text/symbol: white\n\nSo, for the mandatory instruction sign, the border is white and the background color is blue. Now, let's parse the claim to see if it matches these values.\n\nThe claim states that \"blue be the background color of the white border.\" Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. It seems to be saying that blue is the background color corresponding to the white border. From the table, we can see that the border (the 'border' column) for mandatory instructions is indeed white, and the background colour (a separate column) is blue. So, blue is the background colour, which corresponds correctly to the white border.\n\nTherefore, the claim is asserting a relationship between the background colour and the border. The table supports this because it shows that the background colour is blue when the border is white for the mandatory instruction sign.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies in the data. The relevant cells are row index 2 (since it's zero-indexed) and the column \"background colour.\" So, these two cells confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the 'background colour' and 'border' columns for the mandatory instruction sign.\n\n- **Row Index**: 2\n- **Columns Checked**:\n  - background colour: blue\n  - border: white\n\nThe claim states that \"blue be the background color of the white border,\" which is accurate based on these values.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"background colour\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"border\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim says: \"the warning sign be circular with a red border and black text.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each part of the claim against the corresponding cells in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim has three main parts:\n1. Circular shape\n2. Red border\n3. Black text\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows for different types of signs. The warning sign is the first row with \"warning\" as the type of sign.\n\nUnder the 'shape' column for this row, it's \"triangular.\" So, shape-wise, the claim says circular, but according to the table, it's triangular. That already seems contradictory.\n\nNext, checking the border color. The border cell under 'border' is red. That matches the second part of the claim. So that's one point in favor of the claim being true.\n\nThen, the text/symbol column shows black for the warning sign. That aligns with the third part of the claim. So both border and text match.\n\nHowever, the shape doesn't match at all. The claim says circular, but it's triangular in the table. Since one of the attributes is incorrect, does that make the entire claim false?\n\nI remember the instructions say if any condition isn't fully supported, the answer should be FALSE. So even though two parts are correct, because the shape is wrong, the overall claim isn't entirely true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through each row again just in case there's another warning sign or something. No, only the first row is for the warning sign, and it's triangular. So that's definitely incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since the shape doesn't match, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"shape\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"border\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"text / symbol\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It has columns like type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol.

The claim says: \"the warning and prohibition sign be both circular with a red border.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two specific signs mentioned: warnings and prohibitions. It states that both are circular and have a red border.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine the relevant columns for each sign. The table has several columns: type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol. \n\nStarting with the warning sign (first row):\n- Type of sign: warning\n- Shape: triangular\n- Border: red\n- Background colour: yellow\n- Text/symbol: black\n\nProhibition sign (second row):\n- Type of sign: prohibition\n- Shape: circular\n- Border: red\n- Background colour: yellow\n- Text/symbol: black\n\nNow, let's check the claim against these entries.\n\nThe claim says both signs are \"circular.\" The warning sign has a triangular shape, as per the table. So that part of the claim is incorrect for the warning sign. However, the prohibition sign is indeed circular, which aligns with the claim.\n\nNext, regarding the border color: the claim states it's red. Both signs have a red border according to the table, so this part holds true for both.\n\nSo, breaking down each condition:\n1. Are both warning and prohibition signs circular? The warning is triangular, so this is false for the warning sign, but true for prohibition.\n2. Do both have a red border? Yes, both have red borders.\n\nSince the claim makes two statements about both signs, I need to verify if all parts are true. However, since one of the signs (warning) doesn't meet the shape criterion, the overall claim is partially false.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should look at each sign individually. The claim says \"the warning and prohibition sign be both circular with a red border.\" It's making two statements about each sign: they are both circular in shape and have a red border.\n\nSince the warning sign isn't circular (it's triangular), the statement about it being circular is false. Therefore, even though the prohibition sign meets both conditions, the overall claim fails because one of the signs doesn't match the description.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because not all parts of the claim hold true for both signs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both the warning and prohibition signs are circular with red borders.
