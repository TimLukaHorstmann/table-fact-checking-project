    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about an episode is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the episode nut in season 7 , written by amy iglow , have 7.19 million us viewer.\" \n\nI need to verify each part of this claim against the table. The key points are:\n\n1. Episode title is \"Nut.\"\n2. It's from Season 7.\n3. Written by Amy Iglow.\n4. Viewers are 7.19 million.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find where these conditions match.\n\nStarting with Season 7: The rows go up to 79 for season 12, but looking at row numbers, I see that row 74 is Season 7. So row_index 74 is Season 7.\n\nNext, checking if the episode title is \"Nut.\" Scanning through the 'title' column, yes, in row 74, the title is \"nuts\". Wait, it's written as \"nuts\" but the claim says \"nut.\" Hmm, that might be a discrepancy. But maybe it's a typo or variation in spelling, so I should consider if \"nuts\" matches \"nut.\" Maybe not exactly, but sometimes titles can have slight variations.\n\nThen, checking who wrote it. The 'Writer' column for row 74 is Amy Iglow. So that part matches.\n\nLastly, the viewers. In row 74, the 'US Viewers' column has a value of 8.10. Wait, that's not 7.19. That's a problem because the claim says 7.19 million, but according to the table, it's 8.10 for that episode.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in checking the rows. Let me double-check row 74: \n\nRow 74 has:\n- Episode number: 80? Wait no, row numbers go from 0 upwards, so row 74 would be the 75th entry. Looking at the 'Season' column for row 74, it's Season 7.\n\nTitle is \"nuts\" (all lowercase in the table). Writer is Amy Iglow. Viewers are 8.10.\n\nSo the viewers don't match. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, could there be another episode named \"nut\" in Season 7? Let me check other rows in Season 7, which are row 74 (Season 7). So no, only one episode per season unless otherwise stated.\n\nTherefore, the claim's viewers number doesn't match. Also, the title is slightly different\u2014maybe it's a typo for \"nut\" vs. \"nuts.\"\n\nSo the main points: viewers don't match, and there might be a discrepancy in the episode title spelling.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect, so the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the viewership number doesn't match, and there's a slight variation in the episode title. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"Writer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the episode that be written by jeff astrof and matt goldman be name scream.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It seems to say two main things:\n1. An episode was written by both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman.\n2. The title of that episode is \"Scream.\"\n\nI need to verify if such an episode exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: series, season, title, written by, original air date, us viewers (millions).\n\nMy first step is to find any episodes where the writer(s) include both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman. Then, check if the corresponding title is \"Scream.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 68: Season 1, title \"Bahamian Rhapsody (Part 2)\", written by Kari Lizer & Jeff Astrof. Only Jeff Astrof here, no Matt Goldman. So not relevant for this claim.\n\nContinuing until I find a match.\n\nLooking at Row 87: Series 87, Season 20, Title \"Scream\". The writers are Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman. This seems to fit both parts of the claim: written by both and titled \"Scream.\"\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because there's an episode that meets these criteria. Now, I need to find which cells in the table support this. \n\nI'll check the relevant columns for Row 87:\n- series (row_index 87)\n- season (20)\n- title (\"Scream\")\n- written by: Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are for row 87 and column \"written by\" and \"title.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 87, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 87, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Frank Pine writing a show called \"sweet charity\" with 5.56 million US viewers is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the claim. It mentions two things: that Frank Pine wrote \"sweet charity\" and that this show had 5.56 million US viewers. So, I need to check if both parts are accurate based on the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different series with various details like season number, title, writer, original air date, and US viewers in millions. My goal is to find the specific cells that relate to the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: Frank Pine wrote \"sweet charity.\" I need to look for rows where the 'title' column matches \"sweet charity\" and see who the writer is. Scanning through the table, I find row 82 (since the series numbers go up from 68 onwards). In row 82, the title is \"sweet charity,\" and the writer listed is Frank Pines. Wait, it's written as \"Frank pines\"\u2014could be a typo, but it seems correct.\n\nNext, checking the viewers. The claim states that this show had 5.56 million US viewers. Looking at row 82, the 'US viewers' column has 5.56, which matches exactly.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the data: Frank Pine wrote \"sweet charity,\" and it had 5.56 million viewers in the US.\n\nNow, I need to map this to the relevant cells in the table. The title is in the 'title' column at row_index 82, and the viewers are in the 'US viewers' column at the same row. Therefore, the relevant cells are these two columns from that specific row.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is fully supported by the data, so the answer should be TRUE with those specific cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 82, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 82, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The episode title should be \"scream,\" and it should be written by both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman. So I need to look for these two names in the 'written by' column and see if any episode has the title \"scream.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like series number, season, title, etc. The relevant column here is 'written by.' I'll go through each row's 'written by' cell to check for Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman.\n\nStarting from row 0 up:\n- Row 68: Written by Kari Lizer & Jeff Astrof\n- Row 69: Sherry Bilsing - Graham & Ellen Kreamer\n- Row 70: Jack Burditt\n- Row 71: Allan Rice\n- Row 72: Frank Pines\n- Row 73: Amy Iglow & Allan Rice\n- Row 74: Sherry Bilsing - Graham & Ellen Kreamer\n- Row 75: Tricia O'Kelley & Alex Kapp Horner\n- Row 76: Jack Burditt\n- Row 77: None, but it's for \"I Love What You Do For Me\"\n- Row 78: Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman\n\nWait, row 78 has both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman in the 'written by' column. Now I should check what the episode title is for this row.\n\nLooking at the 'title' column for row 78:\nRow 87 (since series number goes up to 87) with season 20: The title is \"Scream.\" So yes, the episode titled \"scream\" was written by Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are in row 87, column 'written by' because that's where their names appear, and also in row 87, column 'title' to confirm the episode name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 78, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 87, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"amy iglow write the episode nut and it gain 6 million viewer.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. Amy Iglow wrote an episode called \"nut.\"\n2. This episode gained 6 million viewers.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's an episode written by Amy Iglow titled \"nuts\" (since in the table it's spelled as 'nuts'). Then check if that specific episode had 6 million viewers.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Amy Iglow is the writer. Scanning the 'written by' column:\n\n- Row 74: Amy Iglow wrote \"nuts.\"\n- Row 81: Jeff Astrof wrote \"a family unfair.\"\n- Row 83: Amy Iglow and Allan Rice wrote \"subway, somehow.\"\nWait, no, row 83's written by is Amy Iglow & Allan Rice, but the title is \"subway, somehow,\" not nuts.\n\nSo only row 74 matches both Amy Iglow as the writer and the episode title \"nuts.\" Now, I need to check the viewers for that episode. Looking at row 74, the 'viewers' column has 8.10, which is 8.1 million. The claim says it gained 6 million viewers, but in reality, it was 8.1 million. So this doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, actually, 8.10 could be rounded, but 6 million is less than 8.1. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because the number of viewers doesn't match. \n\nAdditionally, the claim says \"nut\" while the correct title is \"nuts.\" So there's a discrepancy in spelling.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two issues: incorrect episode name and incorrect viewer count. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the incredible writer who gain 5.56 million viewer be none other than jack burditt\". Hmm, that seems a bit off in structure, but I think the main point is that there's a writer associated with 5.56 million viewers and that this writer is Jack Burditt.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different episode or series with various details like season number, title, written by, original air date, and US viewers in millions.\n\nThe claim mentions \"gain 5.56 million viewer\", which probably refers to the column \"us viewers (millions)\". The value 5.56 is present in one of the rows. Let me find where that is.\n\nScanning through the table, I see row 82 has 5.56 as the viewers. So the relevant row index is 82, and the column is \"us viewers (millions)\".\n\nNext, the claim says this writer is Jack Burditt. Looking at row 82, under the \"written by\" column, it's Frank Pines. Wait, that doesn't match. So if I'm checking if the writer for the 5.56 million viewers is Jack Burditt, but in reality, it's Frank Pines, then the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Row 82: written by Frank Pines, views 5.56. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not Jack Burditt but Frank Pines who wrote that episode with 5.56 million viewers.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\". The relevant cells are row 82 and column \"written by\" because we need to check who the writer is there. Also, the views column is relevant because we're checking the specific viewer number mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 82, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 82, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the episode by jeff astrof and allan rice be name scream and gain 6.29 million view.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need to be checked against the table. The claim mentions an episode written by Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice, named \"scream,\" with 6.29 million viewers. So, I need to find cells in the table that correspond to these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table columns: series, season, title, written by, original air date, us viewers (millions). The relevant columns here are 'title', 'written by', and 'us viewers (millions)'.\n\nNext, I'll scan each row to find where \"scream\" is the episode title. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 87 has series 87, season 20, title \"scream\". So that's a match for the title part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the 'written by' column: Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice are listed as the writers in row 87. Wait, no, looking back at row 87, it says \"jeff astrof & matt goldman\". Hmm, so while Jeff Astrof is mentioned, Allan Rice isn't here. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, the viewers for this episode are 6.29 million, which matches the claim. However, since the 'written by' cell doesn't include Allan Rice but instead mentions Matt Goldman along with Jeff Astrof, there's an inconsistency there.\n\nTherefore, even though the title and viewers match, the writers don't fully align with the claim, as it names both Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice as the episode's writers. Since one of the conditions isn't met, the overall claim is not fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 87, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 87, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
