    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"selkirk - interlake be the rid for the candidate patricia cordner who gain 9506 vote.\" So, I need to check if these three parts are correct according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for the riding \"selkirk-interlake\" and the candidate \"patricia cordner.\"\n\nI scan through each row. The first row is Brandon-Souris with Jean Luc Bouch\u00e9. Next, Charleswood-St James-Assiniboia with Fiona Shiells. Then Churchill with Niki Ashton. Dauphin-Swan River-Marquette with Ron Strynadka. Elmwood-Transcona with Jim Maloway. Kildonan-St Paul with Ross Eadie. Portage-Lisgar with Mohamed Alli. Provencher with Ross C Martin. Saint Boniface with Matt Schaubroeck. Selkirk-Interlake is next.\n\nThere, I find the row where Riding is \"selkirk-interlake\" and Candidate is Patricia Cordner. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the votes: her vote count is 9506. The claim states she \"gained 9506 votes.\" In the table, under 'votes', it shows 9506 for Selkirk-Interlake, Patricia Cordner. So that's correct too.\n\nWait, but sometimes in political terms, \"gain\" might mean more than just receiving those votes. Does she have more than previous candidates? But since the claim only specifies her having 9506, and the table shows exactly that number, I think it's valid.\n\nPutting it all together: The riding is Selkirk-Interlake, candidate is Patricia Cordner with 9506 votes. All parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the riding \"selkirk - interlake\" has a candidate named \"patricia cordner\" who received exactly 9506 votes.\n\n1. **Riding Check**: The row for \"selkirk-interlake\" exists in the table.\n2. **Candidate Check**: The candidate is listed as \"patricia cordner.\"\n3. **Votes Check**: The vote count is indeed 9506.\n\nAll conditions are met, so the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"riding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"candidate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"votes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
