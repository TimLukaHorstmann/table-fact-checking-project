    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the home team of essendon have a crowd of 47656.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The home team of Essendon would be the team that's playing at home in their matches. So I should look for the row where the home team is Essendon.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows. Each row represents a different match with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find the home team that's Essendon. \n\nThe first row has \"essendon\" as the away team, so that's not it. The second row also lists Essendon as the away team, same thing. The third row has Essendon as the home team. So this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, in that row, I need to check two things: the crowd number and whether it's Essendon's home game. The column for crowd is \"crowd\", which has the value 47656 here. Since the claim mentions a crowd of 47656, this matches.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other rows where Essendon is the home team. Looking further down, in row 5 and 6, Essendon is listed as the away team again. So only row 3 has Essendon as the home team with a crowd of 47656.\n\nSo the claim states that the home team of Essendon had a crowd of 47656 on a specific date, which aligns with what's in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim to check: \"there be a crowd of 74656 for essendon home team on 26 june 1952.\" I need to verify if this is true based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. It's got columns like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game.\n\nThe claim mentions \"essendon\" as the home team. Looking at the table, I see an Essendon entry in the sixth row. The row index is 5 because it starts from 0. So, that's one relevant cell: row_index 5, column_name \"home team\".\n\nNext, the crowd size mentioned is 74656. In the table, the crowd column for Essendon's game has a value of 47656 on June 26, 1982. Wait, but the claim says \"26 june 1952.\" That's a different date\u201430 years earlier.\n\nSo, first discrepancy: the date in the table is June 26, 1982, not 1952. That already seems off. The crowd number also doesn't match; 47656 is less than 74656. \n\nI should check if there was an Essendon game on June 26, 1952 with a crowd of over 74k. But looking through the table, all games are from 1982. There's no data for 1952. Maybe I need to consider that the table might not cover every possible date, but in this case, it's only showing 1982 games.\n\nSo, even though Essendon is a home team in the table, the crowd and date don't align with the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
