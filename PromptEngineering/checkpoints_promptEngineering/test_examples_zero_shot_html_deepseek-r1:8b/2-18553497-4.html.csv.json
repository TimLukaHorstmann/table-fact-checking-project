    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"hani said scored 3 goal total and sabry raheel score 1 goal total.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: name, egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league, and total. Each row represents a player or a category like 'totals'.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that check the claim. Let's break down the claim.\n\n1. Hani said scored 3 goals in total.\n2. Sabry Raheel scored 1 goal in total.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Hani Said: I'll search for his name in the 'name' column. In row 5, we see \"hani said\" with 3 in the egyptian premier league and 0 in others, totaling 3 goals. So the relevant cell is row_index 5, column_name 'total'.\n\n- For Sabry Raheel: Similarly, find his name. It's in row 9. He has 1 goal in the egyptian premier league, so total is also 1. Relevant cell is row_index 9, column_name 'total'.\n\nNow, checking if both are correct:\n\nHani Said has a total of 3 goals, which matches the claim.\nSabry Raheel has a total of 1 goal, which also matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are as identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in more than 1 event.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns for different competitions: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, CAF Champions League, and Total. Each row represents a player with their performance across these competitions.\n\nI need to check if Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the only players who have scored in more than one event. So I should look at each of their rows and see how many times they scored.\n\nStarting with Gamal Hamza: Looking through the table, his row is near the bottom. In Egyptian Premier League (EPL), he has 1 goal. Egyptian Cup (EC) shows 0 goals. CAF Champions League (CC) shows 2 goals. So total goals are 3 across all competitions. But wait, the claim is about scoring in more than one event. He scored in EPL and CC, so that's two events where he scored at least once each. \n\nNext, Junior Agogo: His row is earlier in the table. In EPL, he has 3 goals. EC shows 0, and CAF CL shows 1 goal. So total of 4 goals across all competitions. He scored in EPL and CC, so that's two events as well.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players also scored in more than one event. Let me go through each player:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: Only EPL (6 goals), so only one competition.\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: Only EPL (5), same.\n- Junior Agogo: As above, two competitions.\n- Abdel Halim Ali: Only EPL (3).\n- Hani Said: Only EPL.\n- Shikabala: Only EPL.\n- Gamal Hamza: Two competitions.\n- Mahmoud Samir: Only EPL.\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes: Only EPL.\n- Sabry Raheel: Only EPL.\n- Wisam El Abdy: Only EPL.\n- Amr El-Safty: He has 0 in EPL and EC, but 1 in CC. So he scored only in CC, which is one competition.\n- Own Goals: Only in EPL.\n- Totals row: Doesn't represent a player.\n\nWait, what about players like Junior Agogo and Gamal Hamza\u2014are there any others? Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking at the 'egyptian premier league' column, most have 1 or more goals. For example, Amr El-Safty has 0 in EPL but scored in CC. Own Goals also scored once in EPL.\n\nWait, no. The key is to see which players scored in more than one competition. So if a player scored in two or more of the three competitions (EPL, EC, CAF CL), then they are relevant here.\n\nSo let's check each player:\n\n1. Sherif Ashraf: Only EPL.\n2. Mahmoud Fathallah: Only EPL.\n3. Junior Agogo: EPL and CAF CL \u2192 two competitions.\n4. Abdel Halim Ali: Only EPL.\n5. Hani Said: Only EPL.\n6. Shikabala: Only EPL.\n7. Gamal Hamza: EPL and CAF CL \u2192 two.\n8. Mahmoud Samir: Only EPL.\n9. Ricardo Alves Fernandes: Only EPL.\n10. Sabry Raheel: Only EPL.\n11. Wisam El Abdy: Only EPL.\n12. Amr El-Safty: CC only.\n13. Own Goals: EPL only.\n14. Totals: Not a player.\n\nSo, besides Junior Agogo and Gamal Hamza, are there any other players who scored in two or more competitions? Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the 'total' column, it's 38, but that's total goals, not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed someone. Let me go row by row:\n\nRow 0: Sherif Ashraf \u2192 EPL only.\nRow1: Mahmoud Fathalla \u2192 EPL only.\nRow2: Junior Agogo \u2192 EPL and CC.\nRow3: Abdel Halim Ali \u2192 EPL only.\nRow4: Hani Said \u2192 EPL only.\nRow5: Shikabala \u2192 EPL only.\nRow6: Gamal Hamza \u2192 EPL and CC.\nRow7: Mahmoud Samir \u2192 EPL only.\nRow8: Ricardo Alves Fernandes \u2192 EPL only.\nRow9: Sabry Raheel \u2192 EPL only.\nRow10: Wisam El Abdy \u2192 EPL only.\nRow11: Amr El-Safty \u2192 CC only (since 0 in EPL, 1 in CC).\nRow12: Own Goals \u2192 EPL only.\n\nSo the only players who scored in more than one competition are Junior Agogo and Gamal Hamza. Therefore, they are indeed the only ones. So the claim is true because it's exactly them who have scored in two events each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"amr el - safty be the only player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant information. The table has a column named \"egyptian premier league,\" which directly relates to the claim.\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n1. **sherif ashraf**: Scores 6 goals in Egyptian Premier League.\n2. **mahmoud fathallah**: 5 goals, so he scores.\n3. **junior agogo**: 3 goals, scores.\n4. **abdel halim ali**: 3 goals, scores.\n5. **hani said**: 3 goals, scores.\n6. **shikabala**: 3 goals, scores.\n7. **gamal hamza**: 1 goal, scores.\n8. **ahmed magdy**: 2 goals, scores.\n9. **mostafa gaafar**: 2 goals, scores.\n10. **alaa kamal**: 1 goal, scores.\n11. **mahmoud samir**: 1 goal, scores.\n12. **ricardo alves fernandes**: 1 goal, scores.\n13. **sabry raheel**: 1 goal, scores.\n14. **wisam el abdy**: 1 goal, scores.\n15. **amr el - safty**: 0 goals in Egyptian Premier League.\n16. **own goals**: 1 goal, but this is probably a statistical category and not a player.\n\nLooking at the \"egyptian premier league\" column, amr el - safty has 0 goals, while all other players listed have at least 1 goal except for 'totals' which might be a different row. The last row labeled 'totals' shows 34 goals in Egyptian Premier League, but that's not relevant to individual players.\n\nSo, amr el - safty is the only player with 0 goals in the egyptian premier league. No other players have 0; all have at least 1 except for him. Therefore, the claim seems true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, I should identify who shikabala and sabry raheel are in the table. Looking at the 'name' column:\n\n- Shikabala is listed as one of the players.\n- Sabry Raheel is also listed there.\n\nNext, I'll look for their respective goal counts across different competitions: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, and CAF Champions League. The total goals are also provided in the 'total' column.\n\nStarting with shikabala:\n\nFrom the table:\n- In the Egyptian Premier League (egyptian premier league), he has 3 goals.\n- He didn't score any goals in the Egyptian Cup (egypt cup).\n- In the CAF Champions League (caf champions league), he also scored 0 goals.\n- His total is 3.\n\nNow, checking sabry raheel:\n\nFrom the table:\n- He has 1 goal in the Egyptian Premier League.\n- No goals in the Egyptian Cup.\n- No goals in the CAF Champions League.\n- His total is 1.\n\nThe claim says shikabala scored 2 more goals than sabry. Shikabala's total is 3, and sabry's total is 1. The difference is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure I'm not making any mistakes. Shikabala has 3, sabry 1\u2014so yes, a two-goal difference. That seems correct.\n\nSo based on the table data, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"shikabala scored 2 more goals total than sabry raheel,\" we compare their total goals from the table:\n\n- **Shikabala**: Total goals = 3\n- **Sabry Raheel**: Total goals = 1\n\nThe difference is indeed 2 goals, supporting the claim.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. Identify players in question: Shikabala and Sabry Raheel.\n2. Locate their total goals from the 'total' column.\n3. Calculate the difference: 3 (Shikabala) - 1 (Sabry) = 2.\n4. Confirm that this matches the claim.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n\n- **Shikabala's Total**: Found in row 6, column \"total\".\n- **Sabry Raheel's Total**: Found in row 19, column \"total\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions \"gamal hamza\" and \"caf champions league,\" so I need to find these entries.\n\nLooking at the 'name' column, there's a row for \"gamal hamza.\" Now, I check the 'caf champions league' column for this player. According to the table, gamal hamza has 2 goals in this category.\n\nNext, I should verify if any other players scored more than 2 goals in the caf champions league. Scanning through the list: junior agogo has 1 goal, amr el-safety has 1, and own goals have 0. Mostafa gaafar and others also have 0 or 1. So it seems no one else has more than 2.\n\nNow, checking if gamal hamza scored the most in this league, I see he's tied with perhaps others? Wait, looking back, only gamal hamza and maybe another have higher numbers. Wait, no\u2014looking at the 'caf champions league' column: \n\n- junior agogo has 1\n- amr el-safety has 1\n- own goals have 0\n- others have 0 or 2.\n\nWait, actually, gamal hamza is tied with some? No, looking again: the row for gamal hamza shows 2 in 'caf champions league.' Are there any other players with higher than 2? Checking each:\n\nmahmoud fathallah: 0\nsherif ashraf: 0\njunior agogo:1\nabdel halim ali:0\nhani said:0\nshikabala:0\ngamal hamza:2\nhamza gamal (maybe same as gamal hamza):2\nahmed magdy:0\nmostafa gaafar:0\nalaa kamal:0\nmahmoud samir:0\nricardo alves fernandes:0\nsabry raheel:0\nwisam el abdy:0\namr el-safety:1\nown goals:0\ntotals for caf champions league is 4.\n\nSo the total in 'caf champions league' column is 4, meaning across all players, only 4 goals. So gamal hamza has 2, which is more than any other player except maybe someone else? Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at each row's 'caf champions league' data:\n\nRow 0: sherif ashraf:0\nRow1:5:0\nRow2:junior agogo:1\nRow3:abdel halim ali:0\nRow4:hani said:0\nRow5:shikabala:0\nRow6:gamal hamza:2\nRow7:ahmed magdy:0\nRow8:mostafa gaafar:0\nRow9:alaa kamal:0\nRow10:mahmoud samir:0\nRow11:ricardo alves fernandes:0\nRow12:sabry raheel:0\nRow13:wisam el abdy:0\nRow14:amr el-safety:1\nRow15:own goals:0\nRow16:totals:4\n\nSo the highest is 2, achieved by gamal hamza. No one else has more than 1 except him. Therefore, he scored the most in caf champions league.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the most goal.\" So if it's singular, then yes, he scored the most.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in at least 1 event.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant players mentioned in the claim. Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the two players we need to focus on.\n\nLooking at the 'egyptian premier league' column for Gamal Hamza (row index 6), I see he scored 1 goal. In the 'caf champions league' column, he scored 2 goals. So Gamal Hamza has scored in both leagues.\n\nFor Junior Agogo (row index 2), under the 'egyptian premier league', he scored 3 goals. He also scored 1 goal in the 'caf champions league'. So he has scored in both as well.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other players who have scored at least once. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Sheriff Ashraf: Scores only in Egyptian Premier League (6 goals).\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: Only in Egyptian Premier League (5 goals).\n- Junior Agogo: As discussed, has 4 total.\n- Abdel Halim Ali: 3 in Egyptian Premier League.\n- Hani Said: Same as above with 3 goals.\n- Shikabala: Also 3 in Egyptian Premier League.\n- Gamal Hamza: 1 + 2 = 3 goals.\n- Other players like Ahmed Magdy, Mostafa Gaafar, etc., have 2 or less in the Egyptian Premier League and nothing elsewhere.\n- Own Goals: Only 1 goal in Egyptian Premier League.\n- Totals: Total goals across all leagues are 38.\n\nFrom this, it's clear that only Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo scored in both the Egyptian Premier League and the Caf Champions League. Additionally, some other players like Shikabala, Hani Said, etc., scored only in the Egyptian Premier League, but not elsewhere.\n\nThe claim says \"the only player\" who scored in at least 1 event. But looking at the table, there are multiple players who scored in at least one event. For example, Sheriff Ashraf, Mahmoud Fathallah, Abdel Halim Ali, Hani Said, Shikabala, and others all have goals in Egyptian Premier League or Caf Champions League.\n\nWait, but actually, in the claim, it says \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in at least 1 event.\" The wording is a bit unclear\u2014does it mean they are the only two players who scored in both events (Premier League and Cup), or that they are the only ones who scored in at least one?\n\nLooking back, the claim says \"score in at least 1 event,\" which likely means scoring in any of the listed competitions. So any player with a score of 0 across all is not considered.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- All players except for those with 0 across all columns have scored at least once.\n- The total goals are 38, and only 'totals' row has non-zero numbers elsewhere, but that's the totals.\n\nWait, no. Each player's data is per competition. So if a player scored in any of Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, or Caf Champions League, they have scored at least once.\n\nLooking through each player:\n\n- sherif ashraf: 6 in Egyptian Premier League.\n- mahmoud fathallah: 5 in Egyptian Premier League.\n- junior agogo: 3 +1=4.\n- abdel halim ali: 3.\n- hani said: 3.\n- shikabala:3.\n- gamal hamza:1+2=3.\n- ahmed magdy:2.\n- mostafa gaafar:2.\n- alaa kamal:1.\n- mahmoud samir:1.\n- ricardo alves fernandes:1.\n- sabry raheel:1.\n- wisam el abdy:1.\n- amr el - safty:0 in both but 1 in Egypt Cup? Wait, his row shows \"egyptian premier league\" as 0 and \"caf champions league\" as 0. So he has scored only 1 goal total.\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nEach player's data is per competition. For example, amr el - safty: under Egyptian Premier League, it's 0, under Egypt Cup, 0, under Caf Champions League, 0. But his total goals are 1, which must be elsewhere? Or perhaps a mistake.\n\nWait, no. The 'totals' row is at the bottom. So each player has their own columns. So for amr el - safty: egyptian premier league (0), egypt cup (0), caf champions league (0). But he's still listed as scoring 1 goal somewhere? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table structure again:\n\n- The first column is row index.\n- Then columns are egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league, and totals.\n\nSo for each player, their scores per competition are in those columns.\n\nFor example, Sheriff Ashraf: 6 in Egyptian Premier League, 0 elsewhere. Total goals 6.\n\nJunior Agogo: 3 in Egyptian Premier League, 1 in Caf Champions League. Total 4.\n\nGamal Hamza: 1 in Egyptian Premier League, 2 in Caf Champions League. Total 3.\n\nAmr el - safty: 0 in all, but his total is 1? That can't be right. Maybe a typo or I'm misunderstanding the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'totals' row at the bottom is the sum of all goals across players, not per player totals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the last row, it says \"Totals\" with numbers like 6,0,2 and total goals as 38.\n\nSo each column's total: Egyptian Premier League total 6, Egypt Cup total 0, Caf Champions League total 2, and overall total goals across all players is 38.\n\nThat makes sense. So each player has their own three scores, and the totals per competition are in the last row.\n\nThus, Amr el - safty has 0 in Egyptian Premier League, 0 in Egypt Cup, 0 in Caf Champions League. But his total goals would be 0? But he's listed as scoring 1 goal somewhere else?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the table structure. Maybe each player's row includes their scores per competition and a total.\n\nLooking again: The first column is row index, then Egyptian Premier League (column1), Egypt Cup (column2), Caf Champions League (column3), and Total Goals (column4).\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 0: Sheriff Ashraf\n- EPL:6\n- Egypt Cup:0\n- Caf CL:0\n- Total:6\n\nSimilarly, row 1: Mahmoud Fathallah: 5,0,0,5.\n\nContinuing down, each player has their own data.\n\nSo for Amr el - safty (row index 7), the columns are:\n\nEPL:0, Egypt Cup:0, Caf CL:0, Total:1. So he scored 1 goal in total somewhere else not listed? Or is there a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the 'Egypt Cup' column has goals from that specific competition, and if a player didn't participate, it's 0. But how did Amr el - safty score 1 then?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all players:\n\nRow Index: Player\n0: Sheriff Ashraf\n1: Mahmoud Fathallah\n2: Junior Agogo\n3: Abdel Halim Ali\n4: Hani Said\n5: Shikabala\n6: Gamal Hamza\n7: Ahmed Magdy\n8: Mostafa Gaafar\n9: Alaa Kamal\n10: Mahmoud Samir\n11: Ricardo Alves Fernandes\n12: Sabry Raheel\n13: Wisam El Abd\n14: Amr El Safty\n15: Own Goals\n16: Totals\n\nWait, row 15 is 'Totals' with EPL=6, Egypt Cup=0, Caf CL=2, Total=38.\n\nSo for player at row index 7: Ahmed Magdy: EPL=1, Egypt Cup=1 (if that's correct), but in the given table, his EPL is 1, Egypt Cup=0, Caf CL=0, Total=1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if he scored 1 goal in EPL and 0 elsewhere, total should be 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look again:\n\nPlayer row index 7: Ahmed Magdy\n\nEPL:1, Egypt Cup:0, Caf CL:0, Total:1\n\nSimilarly, player at index8: Mostafa Gaafar: EPL=0, Egypt Cup=0, Caf CL=2, Total=2.\n\nWait, that would make sense because if he scored 2 goals in Caf CL.\n\nSimilarly, row14: Amr El Safty: EPL=0, Egypt Cup=0, Caf CL=0, Total=1. So how did he score 1 goal? Maybe I misread the columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'Egypt Cup' column is where his goals are. Let me assume that each player's participation varies. So if a player didn't play in the Egypt Cup, their score is 0.\n\nBut then, for Amr El Safty: EPL=0, Egypt Cup=some number, Caf CL=0, Total=1.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at another approach. The key point is that each player has three scores per competition plus a total.\n\nSo the question is whether Amr El Safty scored 1 goal in any of the competitions.\n\nIf EPL=0, Egypt Cup=0, Caf CL=0, but Total=1, that would mean he scored a goal elsewhere. But since the competitions listed are only EPL, Egypt Cup, and Caf CL, perhaps it's an error or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'Totals' at the end sum up each column: EPL total 6 (from all players), Egypt Cup total 0, Caf CL total 2, and overall total goals 38.\n\nTherefore, for Amr El Safty, if his three competitions are 0, then he must have scored a goal in another competition not listed. But since only EPL, Egypt Cup, and Caf CL are considered, that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the 'Total' column is per player, meaning Amr El Safty scored 1 goal in total across all competitions, but his scores per competition are zero, which would be a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps it's an error or I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'Totals' row at the end correctly sums up to 38, so individual players must have totals adding up accordingly. But regardless of that, the key point is that Amr El Safty scored 1 goal in total, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps his Egypt Cup score is non-zero. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the table may not be fully transcribed correctly, but assuming that each player's EPL, Egypt Cup, Caf CL, and Total goals are as per their row.\n\nSo for Amr El Safty: EPL=0, Egypt Cup=1 (if he scored 1 in Egypt Cup), then his total would be 1. But if the table says Egypt Cup=0, that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me focus on the main point: whether Amr El Safty scored a goal in any competition.\n\nIf his EPL, Egypt Cup, and Caf CL are all 0 but he has Total Goals=1, then perhaps the answer is yes, he scored at least one goal in total.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify that, maybe it's not necessary for this question.\n\nBack to the original task: determine whether any player scored a goal in the Egypt Cup. Looking at each player's Egypt Cup score:\n\nFrom the table, players are listed with their EPL, Egypt Cup, Caf CL, and Total goals.\n\nPlayer 1: Mahmoud Fathallah: EPL=5, Egypt Cup=0, etc.\n\nSimilarly, other players have Egypt Cup scores of 0 except perhaps one.\n\nWait, checking player index2: Junior Agogo. His Egypt Cup score is unknown as per the table (assuming it's 0). Similarly for others.\n\nBut let me check if any player scored in the Egypt Cup:\n\nLooking at all players, their Egypt Cup goals are listed as 0 except perhaps some.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a row where someone scored a goal in the Egypt Cup. Alternatively, perhaps none of them scored in the Egypt Cup, hence the total is 0.\n\nSo if that's the case, then the answer is no, no player scored a goal in the Egypt Cup.\n\nTherefore, the final answer would be: No, none of the players scored a goal in the Egypt Cup.\n</think>\n\nNo, none of the players scored a goal in the Egypt Cup. The \"Egypt Cup\" column for all players has a value of 0, indicating that no goals were scored in that competition by any team.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{No}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"hani said scored 3 goal total and sabry raheel score 1 less goal than hani.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about Hani Said scoring a total of 3 goals. The second part mentions Sabry Raheel scoring 1 less goal than Hani, so that would mean Sabry scored 2 goals if Hani scored 3.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns. The 'name' column will tell me who each player is. The 'egyptian premier league', 'egypt cup', and 'caf champions league' columns show their performance in each competition, and the 'total' column gives the sum.\n\nStarting with Hani Said: I'll search the 'name' column for \"hani said\". Found at row index 5. Now, check how many goals he scored. Looking at his entries: in Egyptian Premier League he has 3, Egypt Cup 0, CAF Champions League 0. The total is also 3. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, Sabry Raheel: I'll look for \"sabry raheel\" in the 'name' column. Found at row index 9. Checking his goals: Egyptian Premier League has 1, Egypt Cup 0, CAF Champions League 0. Total is 1. According to the claim, Sabry should have scored 2 if Hani had 3, but here he only has 1. So that part doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the second part of the claim. It says Sabry scored \"1 less goal than Hani.\" If Hani scored 3, then Sabry should have 2. But in the table, Sabry only has 1. That means the claim is false because Sabry didn't score one less than Hani.\n\nSo, the total goals for Hani are correct (3), but Sabry's score doesn't match the claim. Therefore, the entire statement isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says, \"amr el - safty be only 1 of 2 player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two players who didn't score in the Egyptian Premier League. The first name is amr el - safty, and there should be only one other player with a zero in that column.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"egyptian premier league\" column seems to track how many goals each player scored there. I'll go through each row's egyptian premier league value to find who didn't score, i.e., those with a '0' in that column.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. sherif ashraf: 6 goals\n2. mahmoud fathallah:5\n3. junior agogo:3\n4. abdel halim ali:3\n5. hani said:3\n6. shikabala:3\n7. gamal hamza:1\n8. ahmed magdy:2\n9. mostafa gaafar:2\n10. alaa kamal:1\n11. mahmoud samir:1\n12. ricardo alves fernandes:1\n13. sabry raheel:1\n14. wisam el abdy:1\n15. amr el - safty:0\n16. own goals:1\n17. totals:34\n\nFrom this list, only two players have a '0' in the egyptian premier league column. The first is amr el - safty (row index 15), and the second is 'own goals' (row index 16). Wait, but 'own goals' might not be a player's name; it's probably an additional category. So, maybe only one player, amr el - safty, didn't score in the league.\n\nThe claim says there are two players, so if 'own goals' isn't considered a player, then amr is alone, making the statement false. However, if 'own goals' is considered another player, then there are two with zeros, but amr would only be one of them. The claim says he's \"only 1 of 2 players,\" so that would make it true.\n\nWait, I need to check each row carefully. Let me list the egyptian premier league column values again:\n\nRow 0:6\nRow1:5\n...\nRow15:0 (amr el - safty)\nRow16:1\n\nSo, only amr has a '0' besides own goals. But in the table, 'own goals' is a separate row with 1, not 0. Wait, that's confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at row index 15: amr el - safty has 0 in egyptian premier league.\nRow16: own goals have 1 in that column.\n\nSo, only amr didn't score, making the claim incorrect because it says there are two players who didn't score. Therefore, the answer is FALSE because there's only one player (amr) who didn't score, not two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"gamal hamza scored the second highest goal in the caf champion league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns for goals are \"egyptian premier league,\" \"egypt cup,\" and \"caf champions league.\" The claim specifically mentions the \"caf champions league,\" so I should focus on that column.\n\nNext, I need to find Gamal Hamza's entry in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that Gamal Hamza is in row 6 (since it starts from 0, but maybe the user counts rows starting at 1). Looking at his data: in the \"caf champions league\" column, he has a score of 2.\n\nNow, to check if he scored the second highest goal. I should look for other players who have scored more than him in that same competition. Let's see:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: 0\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: 0\n- Junior Agogo: 1\n- Abdel Halim Ali: 0\n- Hani Said: 0\n- Shikabala: 0\n- Gamal Hamza: 2\n- Gamal Hamza is next, then others like Ahmed Magdy and Mostafa Gaafar also have 0 in that column. Wait, no, looking again, after Gamal Hamza, the next non-zero is maybe someone else? Let me check each row properly.\n\nWait, looking at the table, in the \"caf champions league\" column:\n\n- Row 0: 6 (Sherif Ashraf)\n- Row1:5\n- Row2:3\n- Row3:3\n- Row4:3\n- Row5:3\n- Row6:1 (Gamal Hamza)\n- Then others have 0, except row 12 has 1 and row13 also 1.\n\nWait no, the table shows:\n\nLooking at each row in \"caf champions league\" column:\n\n- sherif ashraf: 6\n- mahmoud fathallah:5\n- junior agogo:3\n- abdel halim ali:0\n- hani said:0\n- shikabala:0\n- gamal hamza:1 (Wait, no. Wait in the table provided by the user, the row for Gamal Hamza has 2 in caf champions league.)\n\nWait let me recheck:\n\nThe table is long, but looking at it, Gamal Hamza's row shows:\n\n<td>gamal hamza</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n\nSo in \"caf champions league\" column, he has 2.\n\nThen, other players: Sherif Ashraf has 6, Mahmoud Fathallah 5, Junior Agogo 3, etc. So the highest is Sherif Ashraf with 6, then Mahmoud Fathallah with 5, then others like Junior Agogo with 3, and Gamal Hamza with 2.\n\nSo in the \"caf champions league,\" the top scorers are:\n\n1. Sherif Ashraf:6\n2. Mahmoud Fathallah:5\n3. Junior Agogo:3\n4. Others like Shikabala, Hani, etc.:0 or 1.\n\nWait no, looking again, the row for Gamal Hamza is at position where in \"caf champions league\" he has 2. So his score is 2.\n\nSo the highest scorers are Sherif Ashraf (6), Mahmoud Fathallah (5), Junior Agogo (3), and then others like Alaa Kamal, etc., have 1 or 0.\n\nWait no, wait, in the \"caf champions league\" column, let's list all the numbers:\n\n- Row 0: sherif ashraf -6\n- row1:5\n- row2:3\n- row3:0\n- row4:0\n- row5:0\n- row6: gamal hamza -2\n- row7: Ahmed Magdy -0\n- row8: Mostafa Gaafar -0\n- row9: I assume others have 0 unless specified.\n\nWait, looking at the table provided by the user:\n\nThe rows after Gamal Hamza are:\n\nRow6: gamal hamza -1? Wait no, in the table as given, the relevant columns for each row:\n\nLooking back, the user's table has:\n\nFor example, row 0 is Sherif Ashraf with 6 in caf champions league.\n\nRow1: Mahmoud Fathallah with5.\n\nRow2: Junior Agogo with3.\n\nRow3: Abdel Halim Ali with0.\n\nRow4: Hani Said with0.\n\nRow5: Shikabala with0.\n\nRow6: gamal hamza - his row is \"gamal hamza\" and in the columns, \"caf champions league\" has 2.\n\nThen others have lower numbers.\n\nSo the top scorers are Sherif Ashraf (6), Mahmoud Fathallah (5), Junior Agogo (3). Then comes Gamal Hamza with2.\n\nTherefore, the highest is Sherif, then Mahmoud, then Junior, then Gamal. So Gamal is fourth in the league, not second.\n\nThus, the claim that Gamal scored the second highest is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"gamal hamza scored the second highest goal in the caf champion league,\" we examine the relevant column in the table:\n\n- **Column Name**: \"caf champions league\"\n- **Row Index**: 6 (Gamal Hamza's row)\n\nFrom the data, Gamal Hamza has a score of 2.
