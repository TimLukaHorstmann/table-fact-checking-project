    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the claim and check each condition against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"viswanathan anand have a rating greater than 2753 , with a prev less than 4 , and + 4 as the chng.\"\n\nFirst, I need to locate Viswanathan Anand in the table. Looking at the 'player' column, I see that the first row lists \"viswanathan anand ( ind )\". So he's ranked 1.\n\nNow, checking his rating: In the same row, under the 'rating' column, it's 2803. The claim says the rating should be greater than 2753. Since 2803 is definitely higher, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, the 'prev' (previous rank) for Viswanathan Anand in the table is listed as 2 in the first row. Wait, no, looking again: the 'prev' column for the first row is 2. But the claim says \"prev less than 4\". Since 2 is indeed less than 4, this condition holds.\n\nLastly, the change ('chng') is given as +4 in the same row. The claim specifies \"+ 4 as the chng,\" which matches exactly. \n\nAll three conditions are met: rating >2753, prev <4, and change of +4. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"rating\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"prev\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"change\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
