    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the structure of the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's stating. It mentions two companies: \"beach break live\" and \"cone timentrate design.\" The claim also specifies that both were invested in by Peter Jones and that each of them requested more than 35,000.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns. The table has several columns: episode, first aired, entrepreneurs, company or product name, money requested, investing dragons.\n\nThe key columns here are \"company or product name,\" \"money requested,\" and \"investing dragons.\" So, for each part of the claim, I should check these columns.\n\nStarting with \"beach break live,\" I'll look through each row's \"company or product name\" column. Scanning down, I see that in the first row, it's \"beach break live,\" so that matches. The money requested there is 50,000, which is more than 35,000, and the investing dragon is Peter Jones. So this part checks out.\n\nNext, checking for \"cone timentrate design.\" Scanning through the table again, I don't immediately see this name in the \"company or product name\" column. The closest I see is \"concentrate design,\" which is in episode 3. But since it's different, maybe I missed it elsewhere. Let me go row by row:\n\n- Episode 1: beach break live and goldgenie\n- Episode 2: youdoodoll and gaming alerts\n- Episode 3: concentrate design\n- Episode 4: reestore and cush'n 'shade\n- Episode 5: hungryhousecouk\n- Episode 6: steri spray and caribbean ready meals\n- Episode 7: fit fur life and jpm eco logistics\n- Episode 8: electroexpo, chocbox\n- Episode 9: red button design\n\nI don't see \"cone timentrate design\" anywhere. It's possible that it's a typo or perhaps a different entry elsewhere, but based on the table provided, it doesn't exist.\n\nSo, out of the two companies mentioned in the claim, only \"beach break live\" is present in the table. Since \"cone timentrate design\" isn't present, the second part of the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, since both parts need to be true for the overall claim to hold, and one part is missing, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"money requested\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"investing dragons\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"reestore request 50000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: episode, first aired, entrepreneur(s), company or product name, money requested, and investing dragon(s). The rows represent different episodes with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"reestore request 50000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis.\" So I need to check if there's a row where the company name is \"reestore,\" the money requested is 50,000, and the investors are Deborah Maden and Theo Paphitis.\n\nLet me go through each row to find matching information. Starting from episode 1:\n\n- Episode 1: Company is \"beach break live,\" money is 50k but by Peter Jones.\n- Episode 2: Money is 35k, so not relevant.\n- Episode 3: 100k, not 50k.\n- Episode 4: Two entries. The first has company \"reestore\" with money 50k and investors Deborah Maden & Theo Paphitis. This matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should check all rows to ensure there are no other instances or possible mismatches. Let's see:\n\nLooking at episode 4 again:\n- First entry: reestore, 50000, Deborah Maden & Theo Paphitis.\n- Second entry for episode 4 is about Cush'n 'shade, different company.\n\nEpisodes 5 to 9 also don't have reestore or match the specific details. So only one row matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a matching row with all the required details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"game alert ask for 200000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions \"game alert\" and a specific amount, \"200000.\" Looking at the table columns, \"company or product name\" might be relevant here because it could refer to names like \"gaming alerts.\" Alternatively, \"money requested\" could be another column to check since the number 200000 is involved.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n- **Episode 1**: Money requested is 50,000. Not matching.\n- **Episode 2**: 35,000 and 200,000. Wait, one row has 35000 and another 200000? Let me check:\n  - First episode 2: 35,000.\n  - Second episode 2: 200,000. That's exactly the number in the claim.\n\nSo, \"gaming alerts\" is the company or product name for that row, which matches part of the claim. The money requested is 200,000, which directly relates to the amount mentioned.\n\nNext, looking at other rows:\n- Episode 5 and 6 have 100,000, but not 200,000.\n- Episode 4 has two entries: 50,000 and 100,000, so no match there either.\n  \nNo other rows match both \"gaming alerts\" and 200,000. So, the claim is supported by one specific row in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells pointing to that particular row where both conditions are met.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"money requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the claim first: \"in episode 7, 145000 be the highest amount of money request by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for Episode 7 in the table. Scanning through the 'episode' column, I see that there are two entries for Episode 7:\n\n1. The first row has details where the entrepreneurs are Sammy French, and the company is Fit Fur Life with a money request of \u00a3100,000.\n2. The second row mentions Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker as the entrepreneurs, with the company name JPM Eco Logistics, also requesting \u00a3100,000.\n\nWait, but the claim says that in Episode 7, \"145000\" is the highest amount requested by Jerry and Paul. Looking at the table, I don't see an entry for \u00a3145,000 in Episode 7. The money request there is only \u00a3100,000 for both rows. \n\nSo, the claim mentions a specific amount, 145000, which doesn't match any of the entries in Episode 7. Additionally, it attributes this amount to Jerry and Paul specifically, but they didn't request that amount either. Therefore, the claim seems incorrect.\n\nNext, I'll verify if there's any cell in Episode 7 related to the claim. The relevant columns for each row would be 'money requested' since that's where the numbers are. So, both rows under Episode 7 have money requested as 100000, not 145000.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly states the amount and attributes it to the wrong entrepreneurs in Episode 7.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the 'money requested' column for Episode 7 and ensure Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker are the ones associated with that amount.\n\nThe JSON object is structured to indicate which cells are relevant. In this case, the money requested cell in Episode 7 is checked against the claim's specified value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"money requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"reestore request 70000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see if there's any information that matches this claim. Let me go through each row of the table one by one.\n\nLooking at the table headers, we have columns like episode, first aired, entrepreneurs, company or product name, money requested, and investing dragons. So, the relevant columns for the claim would likely be \"money requested\" and \"investing dragons\".\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find any that match the claim. The claim mentions a company named \"reestore\" and the investors Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis requesting 70,000.\n\nLet me check each episode:\n\n- Episode 1: Money requested is 50,000 or 60,000, but no \"reestore\" here.\n- Episode 2: Company is \"youdoodoll\" and money is 35k. Not matching.\n- Episode 3: \"Concentrate design\", 100k. No match.\n- Episode 4: Here's where I see \"reestore\". Let me check the details. The first row for episode 4 has:\n  - Company: reestore\n  - Money requested: 50,000\n  - Investors: Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis\nWait, that doesn't match the claim which says 70k. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong cell.\n\nWait, in the table, for episode 4, there are two rows because sometimes multiple entrepreneurs or companies apply. The first row of episode 4 has reestore with 50k and investors Deborah & Theo. Then the second row is a different company, Cush'n 'shade, with 100k and investors Deborah & Peter.\n\nSo the claim mentions \"reestore request 70000\", but in the table, the only entry for reestore is 50,000. There's no row where reestore asks for 70,000. Maybe I missed another episode?\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim might be about a specific episode, so perhaps I should see if any other episodes have \"reestore\" with the right details.\n\nLooking through all the rows, only episode 4 has reestore, and it's 50k. So the claim says 70k, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no entry in the table where reestore requests 70k from those investors.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could there be another row? Let me double-check. Hmm, no, only one instance of \"reestore\" with 50k and that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"reestore request 70000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis\". By checking the table, we find that in episode 4, reestore requests 50,000. There is no entry for 70,000 or another company named reestore with those figures. Thus, the claim doesn't hold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"investing dragons\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to parse what the claim is saying. It mentions \"game alert\" and asks about the least amount of money requested in the table. So, I should look for any rows where the company or product name is \"game alert\" and check their money requested amounts.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various details. The relevant columns seem to be 'company or product name' and 'money requested'. So, I'll focus on these two columns.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if any have \"game alert\" as the company or product name. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Episode 1: No mention of game alert.\n- Episode 2: Youdoodoll, Gaming Alerts. Wait, Gaming Alerts is close but not exactly \"game alert\". So maybe not relevant here unless it's a typo, but I'll check others.\n- Episode 3: Concentrate Design.\n- Episode 4: Restore and Cush'n 'shade.\n- Episode 5: Hungryhousecouk.\n- Episode 6: Steri Spray and Caribbean Ready Meals.\n- Episode 7: Fit Fur Life and JPM Eco Logistics.\n- Episode 8: Electroexpo, Chocbox.\n- Episode 9: Red Button Design.\n\nI don't see any company or product name that exactly matches \"game alert\". The closest is \"Gaming Alerts\" in episode 2. But the claim specifically mentions \"game alert,\" not \"gaming alerts.\" So maybe it's a different entity.\n\nNext, I need to check if any of these companies ask for the least amount of money. Looking at the 'money requested' column:\n\nThe amounts vary, but the smallest ones are 35,000 and 50,000. For example, episode 2 has 35,000, episode 1 has 50,000, episode 3 also 100,000, etc.\n\nHowever, none of these seem to be from \"game alert.\" Since there's no row with the exact name \"game alert,\" the claim isn't fully supported.
