    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"13 class 253 be build between 1978 - 1979\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The claim says that there's a \"13 class 253\" built between 1978 and 1979. Looking at the table, each row represents different classes with their operators, numbers, year built, cars per set, and unit numbers.\n\nI need to look for rows where the class is 253 and the operator might be relevant. Wait, in the table, under \"operator,\" I see entries like \"br western region\" and \"br cross country.\" The claim doesn't specify an operator, so maybe it's not necessary? Or perhaps the operator isn't part of the condition.\n\nNext, looking for the number 13. In the table, each row has a \"number\" column. Scanning through:\n\n- First row: 27\n- Second row: 13\n- Third row: 18\n- Fourth row: 32\n- Fifth row: 4\n\nSo the second row has 13 as the number. That's a match for the claim's \"13 class 253.\"\n\nNow, checking the year built for that row. The second row says the year built is from 1978 to 1979. That matches the time frame in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, cars per set is 9 and unit numbers are 253028 - 253040, but since the claim doesn't mention these specifics, they aren't necessary for verification.\n\nSo putting it together: The second row has class 253, number 13, and year built between 1978-1979. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by this specific cell in the table.\n\nI should identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns are \"number\" and \"year built.\" In terms of rows, it's specifically the second row (index 1) because that's where the number 13 and the correct year range are found.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, with the relevant_cells pointing to row 1's number and year built columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"there be 10 cars per set on 32 class 254's\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that for class 254s with a capacity of 32 units, each set has 10 cars. So I need to check if there are any rows in the table that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: class, operator, number, year built, cars per set, and unit numbers. \n\nNow, I'll scan through each row to find entries where the class is 254 and cars per set is 10.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Class: 253\nSo this doesn't match because it's class 253, not 254.\n\nSecond row:\n- Class: 253 again, so no match.\n\nThird row:\n- Class: 253 once more. Not what we need.\n\nFourth row:\n- Class: 254. This is relevant.\n- Cars per set: 10. Exactly matches the claim.\n- Units: 254001 - 254032, but that's not needed for this check.\n\nFifth row:\n- Class: 254\n- Cars per set: 4. Doesn't match the claim of 10.\n\nSo only the fourth row meets both conditions: class 254 and cars per set being 10. Therefore, the claim is supported by at least one relevant data point in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported as there exists a row for class 254 with 10 cars per set.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cars per set\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim: \"in 1982 the operator for the british rail class be br eastern region br scottish region.\" So, the claim is making a specific statement about the operator associated with British Rail's class 254 in the year 1982.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different classes and their details. I need to check if any of the rows match the conditions given in the claim for the year 1982 and the correct operator.\n\nLet me examine the table rows one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: This is class 253 with \"br western region\" as the operator, built from 1975-1977. Not relevant because it's about class 253, not 254, and the year doesn't match 1982.\n   \n2. **Second Row**: Also class 253, same operator as above, but built in 1978-1979. Again, not applicable for our claim.\n\n3. **Third Row**: This is class 253 with \"br cross country\" as the operator, built from 1981-1982. While it's close in years, it's still about class 253 and a different operator than what's claimed, so no match.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: Class 254 with operators listed as \"br eastern region br scottish region,\" built from 1977-1979. The year here is 1977-1979, which doesn't include 1982. So not matching the claim's year.\n\n5. **Fifth Row**: This row is for class 254 again but with a single operator listed as \"br eastern region br scottish region\" and built in 1982. This matches both the year (1982) and the operator mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, the only relevant row that supports the claim is the fifth one because it's about class 254, the correct operators, and the exact year of 1982.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the fifth row, which matches the year 1982 and lists the correct operators for class 254.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"operator\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 9 cars per set on all class 253's\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It\u2019s stating that every Class 253 vehicle set has exactly 9 cars per set.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are two entries for Class 253. The first row (row index 0) shows \"cars per set\" as 9. The second entry (row index 1) also lists 9 under the same column. So both instances of Class 253 have 9 cars per set.\n\nI should check if all relevant rows support this claim. Since there are only two entries for Class 253 and both show 9, that fully supports the claim. I don't need to look at other classes because the claim is specifically about Class 253.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones in row indices 0 and 1 under \"cars per set\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we examine the table entries for Class 253.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"br cross country be the last operator for class 253 british rail\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and the data it contains. The table has several columns: class, operator, number, year built, cars per set, and unit numbers. Each row represents a different set of data for specific classes and operators.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"br cross country\" being the last operator for class 253 in British Rail. So I need to check if there's any record where class 253 is operated by \"br cross country\" and that it's the last such entry.\n\nLooking at the table, let's focus on rows where the class is 253:\n\n1. The first two rows (row indices 0 and 1) both have class 253 with operator \"br western region\". The numbers here are 27 cars in 1975-1977 and 13 cars in 1978-1979.\n2. The third row (index 2) has class 253 with operator \"br cross country\" operating 18 cars built in 1981-1982.\n3. Then, we have rows for class 254, which is a different class, so I can ignore those.\n\nNow, the key point is whether \"br cross country\" is indeed the last operator listed for class 253. From the table, after the third row (row index 2), there are no more entries for class 253. The next rows are about class 254, which doesn't affect this claim.\n\nSo, in the context of the table provided, \"br cross country\" is the last operator listed for class 253. There's no other operator after that for the same class within the data shown.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the information in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table where \"br cross country\" is the last listed operator for class 253.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"operator\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"30 class 253 be build between 1978 - 1979\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"30 class 253 be built between 1978 - 1979.\" I think there might be a typo here\u2014probably meaning \"built,\" not \"be build.\" So it's about 30 cars of class 253 being constructed during that year range.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check if there are any rows related to class 253 built in 1978-1979 with a number that would add up to 30. Let me go through each row related to class 253.\n\nLooking at the table, I see three rows for class 253:\n\n1. The first two rows both have \"br western region\" as the operator. In the first of these, the number is 27, and it's built between 1975-1977. So that's before 1978, so not relevant to the claim.\n\n2. The second row for class 253 also has the same operator but different numbers. It shows a total of 13 cars built in 1978-1979. That's part of the range mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. The third row is about \"br cross country\" operator with 18 cars built in 1981-1982, which doesn't overlap with the claim's year range.\n\nSo, from class 253, only the second row (row index 1) has numbers relevant to 1978-1979. But that row shows 13 cars. Wait, but the claim says \"30\" class 253s were built between those years. Since there are only 13 in that specific row and another row before with 27, maybe I need to add them up? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, each row represents a different batch or group of cars. The first two rows for class 253 are under \"br western region,\" but the second one is part of 1978-1979, while the first is in 1975-1977. So they are separate batches.\n\nThe second row (row index 1) has 13 cars built between 1978-1979. That's within the claim's year range. The first row (index 0) for class 253 isn't part of 1978-1979, so it doesn't count towards the 30.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider all rows for class 253 in that year range. So, only one row (row index 1) has 13 cars built in 1978-1979. That's only 13, not 30. There's also another row for class 254, which is a different class, so we can ignore that unless the claim refers to both classes.\n\nWait, no, the claim specifically mentions \"class 253,\" so I should only focus on rows where class is 253. So in row index 1, it's 13 cars. The first row for class 253 (row index 0) is from 1975-1977, which isn't within 1978-1979.\n\nSo, the total number of class 253s built in 1978-1979 is 13, not 30. Therefore, the claim is saying that 30 were built between those years, which isn't supported by the table data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding how the numbers are presented. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow index 0: class 253, operator br western region, number 27, built 1975-1977.\n\nRow index 1: same class and operator, number 13, built 1978-1979.\n\nSo the total for that operator is 27+13=40? Or are they separate batches? The table seems to show different batches. Each row might represent a specific order or batch of cars.\n\nWait, looking at the 'number' column: first row has 27, second row 13, third row 18 (cross country). Then for class 254, it's 32 and 4.\n\nSo each number is per set or group. For example, in class 253 under br western region, there are two batches: 27 cars built from 1975-1977, and another 13 from 1978-1979. So total for that operator is 40. But the claim is about 30 cars built between 1978-1979.\n\nBut in the table, only 13 were built then. Unless there's another row I'm missing, but looking at the tbody, there are five rows: three for class 253 and two for class 254.\n\nSo, since the claim says \"30\" class 253s built between those years, but the table shows only 13 in that specific row (and 27 before), so it doesn't add up to 30. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, unless I'm miscounting or misunderstanding how the numbers are presented. Let me double-check:\n\n- Row index 0: class 253, number 27, built 1975-1977 \u2192 not relevant for 1978-1979.\n- Row index 1: class 253, number 13, built 1978-1979 \u2192 13 cars.\n- So only 13, not 30.\n\nHence, the claim is false because there were only 13 class 253s built between 1978-1979, not 30. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 30 class 253 cars were built between 1978 and 1979. However, upon examining the table, only 13 class 253 cars fall within this specific time frame. Thus, the claim is not supported by the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"number\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

It says there are no recorded cars per set for class 254 with a number of 32. So I'm looking to see if any row in the table matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to focus on rows where \"class\" is \"class 254\". There are two such rows:\n\n1. Row 3: class 254, operator br eastern region br scottish region, number 32, year built 1977 - 1979, cars per set 10, unit numbers 254001 - 254032.\n2. Row 4: class 254, operator br eastern region br scottish region, number 4, year built 1982, cars per set 10, unit numbers 254033 - 254037.\n\nThe claim mentions \"32 class 254's\". So the number in question is 32. In row 3, the number is 32 and cars per set is 10. That means for that particular set (number 32), there are 10 cars recorded. Therefore, the claim that there are no recorded cars per set on 32 class 254's is FALSE because at least one set with number 32 has a recorded car count of 10.\n\nI should check if any other rows might be relevant. The second row for class 254 is for the number 4 and year 1982, which doesn't relate to 32, so it's not relevant here.

The claim is: \"in 1982 the operator for the british rail class be br cross country.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. **Year**: 1982\n2. **Class**: British Rail class (specifically looking at class numbers)\n3. **Operator**: BR Cross Country\n\nNow, I'll examine the table row by row to find any relevant data that might support or contradict the claim.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Class: 253\n  - Operator: br western region\n  - Year built: 1975-1977\n  - This doesn't match because the operator is different, and it's for class 253, not cross country.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Class: 253\n  - Operator: br western region\n  - Year built: 1978-1979\n  - Again, same as above; not matching.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Class: 253\n  - Operator: br cross country\n  - Year built: 1981-1982\n  - This matches the operator and class in the claim.

So the existence of this class in 1982 with BR Cross Country as the operator supports part of the claim. However, the exact year 1982 might not fully match because it spans from 1981 to 1982.\n\nAlso, looking for any other rows that might have the same class and operator but a different year.

The claim says: \"there be 11 cars per set on 2 class 253's.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns for this claim are \"cars per set\" and the \"class\" column because the claim mentions both the number of cars and the specific class numbers (class 253). Also, since the claim talks about two sets of class 253, I need to check each row for class 253.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n- Row 0: class 253, cars per set is 9.\n- Row 1: same as above.\n- Row 2: class 253, cars per set is 18. Wait, that's different, but I need to see if it matches the claim. The claim says 11 cars per set on two of them, so this row's 18 doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The claim is about two class 253 sets with 11 cars each. So I should check each row for class 253 and see if any have 11 in the \"cars per set\" column.\n\nLooking again:\n- Row 0: class 253, cars 9.\n- Row 1: same as above.\n- Row 2: class 253, cars 18.\nSo none of the rows for class 253 have 11 as the number of cars per set. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows with class 253 and 11. Let me check all four rows:\n\n1. Row 0: 9\n2.

Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe the table has more rows that aren't shown? No, it's only four rows as given in the problem. So definitely, none have 11 cars per set for class 253.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" with the relevant cells being all the class 253 rows to show they don't have 11.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"br eastern region br scottish region be the last operator for class 253 british rail.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that the \"br eastern region\" and \"br scottish region\" are the final operators responsible for Class 253 in British Rail.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different set of data about specific classes and their operators. The table has columns: class, operator, number, year built, cars per set, and unit numbers.\n\nI need to focus on the rows where the class is \"class 253.\" Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **First Row (Row 0):**  \n   - Class: 253  \n   - Operator: br western region  \n   - Year built: 1975-1977  \n   - Cars per set: 9  \n   - Unit numbers: 253001-253027  \n\n2. **Second Row (Row 1):**  \n   - Class: 253  \n   - Operator: br western region  \n   - Year built: 1978-1979  \n   - Cars per set: 9  \n   - Unit numbers: 253028-253040  \n\n3. **Third Row (Row 2):**  \n   - Class: 253  \n   - Operator: br cross country  \n   - Year built: 1981-1982  \n   - Cars per set: 9  \n   - Unit numbers: 253041-253058  \n\n4. **Fourth Row (Row 3):**  \n   - Class: 254  \n   - Operator: br eastern region br scottish region  \n   - Year built: 1977-1979  \n   - Cars per set: 10  \n   - Unit numbers: 254001-254032  \n\n5. **Fifth Row (Row 4):**  \n   - Class: 254  \n   - Operator: br eastern region br scottish region  \n   - Year built: 1982  \n   - Cars per set: 10  \n   - Unit numbers: 254033-254037  \n\nNow, the claim is about Class 253. So I should focus on Rows 0, 1, and 2.\n\nLooking at these rows, the operators are:\n- Row 0: br western region\n- Row 1: br western region\n- Row 2: br cross country\n\nThe last operator for Class 253 in the table is \"br cross country\" (Row 2). The claim says it's \"br eastern region br scottish region,\" which isn't the case. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure if there are any other operators after \"br cross country.\" Looking at Rows 3 and 4, they're for Class 254, not Class 253. So no, Class 253's last operator is indeed \"br cross country.\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells that confirm this would be Row 2, specifically the 'operator' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the last operator for Class 253 is \"br cross country,\" not the eastern or scottish regions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"operator\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
