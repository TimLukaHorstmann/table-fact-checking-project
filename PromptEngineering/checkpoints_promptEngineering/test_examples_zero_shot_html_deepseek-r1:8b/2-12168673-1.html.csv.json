Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"blueeyesintherein win on 2012 , with the owner self , king morgenson , travis , and so on.\" \n\nI need to check each part of the claim against the table. The key elements are the horse's name, the year, and the owner.\n\nStarting with the horse's name: \"blueeyesintherein\". I'll scan through each row of the table looking for this exact name in the 'winner' column. \n\nLooking at the first row (row 0), the winner is indeed \"blueeyesintherein\". That matches the claim, so that cell is relevant.\n\nNext, the year: 2012. The same row has a 'year' value of 2012, which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nNow, the owner part: the claim mentions \"self, king, morgenson, travis, and so on.\" In the table, the 'owner' cell for that row is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". This seems to match exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo all three parts of the claim (horse name, year, and owner) are present in the corresponding row. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , and et al be the owner when blueeyesintherein be the winner in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the year 2012 row because the claim mentions that event happened in 2012. So, the relevant row is row index 0.\n\nNext, I should check the 'winner' column for that row. The winner listed is 'blueeyesintherein,' which matches the claim's mention of the winner being blueeyesintherein. That's a good sign.\n\nNow, looking at the 'owner' column for 2012. The owner is given as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" The claim also states that this group should be the owner when blueeyesintherein won in 2012. So, both the winner and the owner from the table match what's stated.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. All the relevant cells for 2012 are checked, and they support the claim fully.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"overbrook farm and et al own winner blueeyesintherein after 2009\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the components of the claim. It mentions two main things: the owner's name (\"overbrook farm and et al\") and the horse's name (\"blueeyesintherein\"). The claim also specifies that this ownership occurs \"after 2009\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1996 to 2012, with columns for winner, jockey, trainer, owner, and time. My task is to find if there's any row where the owner is \"overbrook farm and et al\" and the year is after 2009.\n\nI'll start by checking each relevant row starting from 2010 and onwards since it needs to be after 2009. \n\nStarting with 2010: The winner is \"just louise\", owner is \"eldon farm equine\". Not matching.\n2011: Winner \"flashy lassie\", owner \"barry l king\". No match.\n2012: Winner \"blueeyesintherein\", owner listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". This seems to fit the description of \"overbrook farm and et al\"? Wait, no. The owner here is a combination of self, king, Morgenson, Travis, etc., not specifically overbrook farm. So maybe not.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again. The claim says \"overbrook farm and et al own winner blueeyesintherein after 2009\". So the owner's name should be exactly \"overbrook farm and et al\" and the year should be after 2009.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- 2009: Owner is westrock stables.\n- 2010: eldon farm equine\n- 2011: barry l king\n- 2012: self / king / Morgenson etc. No match.\n\nWait, but in 1995, there's \"golden attraction\" owned by overbrook farm. But that's before 2009, so it doesn't apply here.\n\nSo the claim is saying after 2009, overbrook farm and et al own a winner named blueeyesintherein. Looking at all rows after 2009 (2010-2012), none of them have \"overbrook farm and et al\" as the owner. The closest is in 1995, but that's before 2009.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where overbrook farm and et al own blueeyesintherein after 2009. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on two criteria: ownership by \"overbrook farm and et al\" and a winner named \"blueeyesintherein\" occurring after the year 2009. Checking all relevant rows from 2010 onwards, none match both conditions. Therefore, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2012, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et all own winner flashy lassie after 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions that a group of owners (self, king, Morgenson, Travis, etc.) own the winner \"flashy lassie\" after 2009. So, the key points are: the owner's name is this collective group, the horse's name is Flashy Lassie, and the race occurred after 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the winner is \"flashy lassie.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- 2012: blueeyesintherein\n- 2011: flashy lassie\n\nAh, there's a row in 2011 with Flashy Lassie as the winner. So that's the relevant row for the winner part.\n\nNext, I need to check who owns Flashy Lassie. In the 2011 row, the \"owner\" column has \"barry l king.\" The claim says the owners are self, king, Morgenson, Travis, etc., which seems to be a group including Barry L King. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, checking when this happened: the race was in 2011. The claim mentions after 2009. Since 2011 is after 2009, it fits.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2011,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2011,\n      \"column_name\": \"owner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
