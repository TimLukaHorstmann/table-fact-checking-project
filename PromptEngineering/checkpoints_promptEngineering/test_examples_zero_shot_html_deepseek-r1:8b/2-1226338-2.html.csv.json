Each row has columns: year, entrant (team), chassis, engine, and points.\n\nI need to find any rows where \"entrant\" is \"Marc Surer.\" However, scanning through the table, I notice that the entrants listed are mostly team names like \"team ensign,\" \"team ats,\" \"ensign racing,\" \"theodore racing team,\" etc. There's no mention of a driver named Marc Surer in this table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim refers to Marc Surer as an entrant or a participant. Perhaps the table includes both teams and drivers? But looking closely, all the entrants are team names. For example, \"ensign racing,\" \"theodore racing team,\" etc., which likely represent the team rather than individual drivers.\n\nSo, there's no row where the entrant is Marc Surer or any variation that would indicate his participation in 1984 and 1985. Without Marc Surer's points being recorded in those years, I can't compare 1984 to 1985 for him because he's not present in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. The answer should be \"FALSE,\" and there are no relevant cells since Marc Surer isn't listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The closest match might be \"motor racing developments ltd,\" but that's not the same.\n\nSince there's no data for Marc Surer in the table, the claim can't be verified.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"marc surer score a total of 5 point in both 1985 and 1986\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"marc surer\" scoring 5 points in both 1985 and 1986. So, I need to look for entries in the table where \"marc surer\" is listed as an entrant, and their points are 5 for those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different entry with columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, points.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check for \"marc surer.\"\n\nStarting from the top:\n- 1979: Entrant is \"team ensign\" \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n- 1980: Entrant is \"team ats\" \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n- 1981: Entrant is \"ensign racing\" and another entry for \"theodore racing team\" \u2013 neither is Marc Surer.\n- 1982: Entrant is \"arrows racing team\" twice \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n- 1983: Same entrant as above \u2013 no Marc Surer.\n- 1984: Entrant is \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n- 1985: Entrant is \"motor racing developments ltd\" which is the Brabham team. Hmm, I think Marc Surer was involved with Brabham in 1985, but let me check if he's listed here. The entrant column says \"motor racing developments ltd,\" which might be the team name, not necessarily Marc Surer.\n- 1986: Entrant is \"barclay arrows bmw\" \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n\nWait a second, I'm a bit unsure about 1985 and 1986 because Marc Surer did race for Brabham in those years. But looking at the table, the entrant columns don't list \"Marc Surer.\" Instead, they list team names like \"motor racing developments ltd\" in 1985 and \"barclay arrows bmw\" in 1986.\n\nSo, perhaps Marc Surer wasn't the entrant himself but part of the team. That means the points for the teams are recorded under their own names, not Marc Surer's. Therefore, in 1985 and 1986, it was the Brabham team that scored points, not Marc Surer personally.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where \"marc surer\" is listed as the entrant with 5 points in 1985 or 1986. The claim might be confusing team achievements with individual scores, which might not align based on this table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again for any mention of Marc Surer in the entrants. Scanning through all the rows, I don't see \"Marc Surer\" listed anywhere in the 'entrant' column. That suggests that either Marc Surer wasn't part of these teams or isn't included in this table.\n\nSo, based on the table provided, there's no entry where Marc Surer scored 5 points in both 1985 and 1986. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"marc surer score the same amount of point in both race in 1981.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. It mentions Marc Surer and points from two races in 1981. My goal is to check if he scored the same number of points in both races that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to focus on the year 1981. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- The fourth row (row_index:3) has the year 1981, entrant \"ensign racing\", chassis \"ensign n180b\", engine \"cosworth v8\", and points 4.\n- The fifth row (row_index:4) also has the year 1981, entrant \"theodore racing team\", chassis \"theodore ty01\", engine \"cosworth v8\", and points 4.\n\nWait, but Marc Surer isn't listed in these rows. So maybe I'm misunderstanding which races he participated in. Perhaps there are more entries for 1981 that I missed? Let me double-check the table.\n\nNo, looking again, after row_index:3 and 4, the next is 1982. So it seems Marc Surer isn't present in the 1981 data provided. That's confusing because if he didn't race that year, how could he score points?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering who Marc Surer is. Maybe he wasn't active in Formula One during 1981. If that's the case, then the claim would be about someone who didn't participate in those races, making the point comparison irrelevant or impossible.\n\nBut assuming Marc Surer was involved, and given that the table doesn't show him racing in 1981, there's no data to verify whether he scored the same points. So the answer would likely be FALSE because there's no evidence of him racing that year to compare points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"marc surer score a total of 8 points in the 2 races of 1981.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's about Marc Surer and his points in two specific races from 1981. Looking at the table, it seems to list information about different racing teams, their chassis, engines, and points over various years.\n\nI should start by identifying if there are any entries for Marc Surer in the 'entrant' column for the year 1981. Scanning through the 'entrant' column:\n\n- 1979: team ensign\n- 1980: team ats (twice)\n- 1981: ensign racing, theo...\nWait, I don't see any entry that says \"Marc Surer\" or anything similar. Maybe the name is spelled differently? Let me check again. The 'entrant' column has names like \"team ats,\" \"ensign racing,\" \"theodore racing team,\" etc. There's no mention of Marc Surer here.\n\nIf there's no record of Marc Surer in 1981, then he didn't participate in those races, which would mean the claim is false because he didn't score any points. But maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps Marc Surer used a different name or was part of another team not listed here? However, based on the table provided, there's no such entry.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the claim refers to points from two races in 1981. So I should check how many times Marc Surer competed and what his total points were. But again, without him being listed in the 'entrant' column for 1981, it's unlikely he scored any points that year.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data supporting Marc Surer's participation or points in those races, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

The claim says, \"marc surer score 2 time as many point in 1986 than 1983.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's talking about Marc Surer and his points in Formula 1 racing over two different years: 1986 and 1983. The claim is stating that in 1986, he scored twice as many points as he did in 1983.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to identify if there's any data related to Marc Surer for those years. I'll go through each row one by one to see if his name appears.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- 1979: team is \"team ensign\" \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n- 1980: team is \"team ats\" \u2013 nope.\n- 1981: two entries, both for \"ensign racing\" and \"theodore racing team\" \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n- 1982: \"arrows racing team\" \u2013 not him.\n- 1983: \"arrows racing team\" again \u2013 still not Marc Surer.\n- 1984: \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" \u2013 nope.\n- 1985: \"motor racing developments ltd\" \u2013 doesn't match.\n- 1986: \"barclay arrows bmw\" \u2013 not Marc Surer.\n\nHmm, I'm going through each row and none of the team names mention Marc Surer. So, there's no entry in the table for Marc Surer in any of these years. That means we don't have data to verify whether he scored twice as many points in 1986 compared to 1983 because his name isn't present.\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the information provided in the table. It's about a driver not listed here, so the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Marc Surer's points in 1986 and 1983, but his name doesn't appear in the table, making it impossible to verify.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"marc surer score a total of 6 points in 1986, 3 more than in 1985.\" First, I should figure out what each part means and then check against the table.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the claim. It mentions two years: 1986 and 1985. The person's name is Marc Surer. So, I need to find entries for Marc Surer in both 1986 and 1985 in the table provided. \n\nLooking at the table, each row has a year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. I'll go through each row to see if any mention Marc Surer or have data related to his points.\n\nScanning the years: 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986. So, relevant rows are for 1985 and 1986.\n\nFor 1985, I need to check if Marc Surer was an entrant and what his points were. Looking through the 'entrant' column in 1985: \"motor racing developments ltd\" is the entrant. That's not Marc Surer. So, no entry for him in 1985. Hmm, that's a problem because the claim says he scored points in both years.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe Marc Surer was part of a team with the same name or similar? Let me check again. For 1986: entrant is \"barclay arrows bmw.\" Still not matching Marc Surer's name. So perhaps there are no entries for him in either year.\n\nIf that's the case, then his points in 1986 would be zero because he wasn't present, and same for 1985. The claim states he scored 6 points in 1986 and 3 more than 1985, implying he had some points in both years.\n\nBut if he didn't participate in either year, then the claim is false because there's no data supporting it. So, I need to look at the relevant cells. \n\nLooking at the table again, the 'entrant' column for 1985 is \"motor racing developments ltd,\" which isn't Marc Surer. Similarly, for 1986, it's \"barclay arrows bmw.\" No match found.\n\nTherefore, there's no data in the table supporting the claim that Marc Surer scored 6 points in 1986 or any points in 1985.

The claim says: \"marc surer score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"marc surer,\" which is a name, and it talks about scoring points over two different times\u2014once when he scored 6 points and another time when he scored 2 points in total. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because points are typically either earned or not, so you don't score them twice.\n\nLooking at the table, I see the columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, points. So each row represents a different team or entry with their details for a specific year. The 'entrant' column lists various teams like \"team ensign,\" \"team ats,\" \"ensign racing,\" etc. I don't see any mention of \"marc surer\" in the table.\n\nWait, maybe \"marc surer\" is an entrant or a team name? Let me check each row. Scanning through the 'entrant' column: there's \"team ensign,\" \"team ats,\" \"ensign racing,\" \"theodore racing team,\" \"arrows racing team,\" and others. None of these match \"marc surer.\" So, it's possible that either Marc Surer was not part of any entry listed in this table or the claim refers to a different context.\n\nThe claim compares two scenarios: scoring 6 points vs. scoring 2 points in total. In racing contexts, points are often accumulated over races or seasons, so \"scoring 6 point 2 time\" might mean over two instances. If Marc Surer scored 6 points in one instance and 2 points in another, the claim would be about a comparison between these two.\n\nBut looking at the table, each entry has a single 'points' value. There's no indication of multiple races or events contributing to different point totals for the same entrant on separate occasions. Each row seems to represent a unique year and entry with their total points for that year or event.\n\nSince there's no data about Marc Surer in the table, I can't verify any information related to him. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the data provided because Marc Surer isn't present as an entrant, so his performance isn't documented here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is about Marc Surer's points which aren't listed in the table, making the claim unverifiable from the given data.
