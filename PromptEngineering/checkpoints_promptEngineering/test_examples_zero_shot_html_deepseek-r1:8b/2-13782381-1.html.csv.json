    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the average result for week 13 be l 28 - 17\". So, we're looking at Week 13 in the table and checking if the average outcome of that week is a loss (denoted by 'l') with a score of 28-17.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all entries where the 'week' column is 13. There's only one row for week 13:\n\nWeek: 13\nDate: 1984 - 12 - 02\nOpponent: new york giants\nResult: l 20 - 10\nGame Site: the meadowlands\nAttendance: 74975\n\nFrom this, the result for Week 13 is a loss (l) with a score of 20-10. The claim states that it should be \"l 28 - 17\". However, in reality, it's \"l 20 - 10\", which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data. It's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check Week 13's result in the table. The outcome is a loss with a score of 20-10, not 28-17 as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction about week 12's result being an average of 28-17. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that in week 12, the game result was an average of 28-17. Wait, average? That doesn't quite make sense because each game has a specific result, not an average. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps it means that the outcome of week 12 was exactly 28-17, or maybe that some average leading up to week 12 was 28-17. But given the context, I think it refers to the actual result in week 12 being 28-17.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to week 12. The table has weeks from 1 to 16. Week 12 is row number 12. Let me check that row. \n\nIn row 12, the opponent is Houston Oilers, and the result is \"l 31 - 20\". So the game was a loss for the team in question (assuming it's the home team) with a score of 31-20. That doesn't match 28-17 at all.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. The claim says \"result of 28 - 17.\" In week 12, the result is listed as \"l 31 - 20\". So it's a loss with those scores. That's not 28-17. Therefore, the claim that week 12's result is an average or equal to 28-17 is false because the actual result was a different score.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones in week 12: row index 12 and column \"result\". That's the key piece of information that shows the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
