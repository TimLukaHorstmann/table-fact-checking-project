    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the Miami Dolphins game attendance is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the game against the miami dolphin have 34063 in attendance.\" My goal is to find out if there's a matching entry in the table that supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with specific details. The relevant columns here are 'week', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', and 'attendance'. Since the claim mentions \"the game against the miami dolphin,\" I need to focus on rows where the opponent is the Miami Dolphins.\n\nI'll scan through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Buffalo Bills.\n- Week 2: Opponent is Oakland Raiders.\n- Week 3: Opponent is Boston Patriots.\n- Week 4: Opponent is Buffalo Bills again.\n- Week 5: Opponent is Denver Broncos.\n- Week 6: Opponent is Oakland Raiders.\n- Week 7: Opponent is Denver Broncos.\n- Week 8: Opponent is Houston Oilers.\n- Week 9: Opponent is San Diego Chargers.\n- Week 10: Opponent is Miami Dolphins. Here's the first match.\n\nLooking at Week 10, the opponent is indeed the Miami Dolphins. The 'attendance' for this week is listed as 34063, which exactly matches the number in the claim. So, there is a row where the game was against the Miami Dolphins and had 34,063 attendees.\n\nBefore finalizing, I should check if there are multiple relevant rows. However, the claim specifies \"the game,\" implying a singular instance. Since only Week 10 fits this criterion, that's the only relevant cell.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"33057 crowd attend the week 6 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions three key pieces of information: the number 33057, a crowd attending a game, and that it's week 6. So I need to verify each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The attendance column seems relevant because it likely holds the number of people who attended each game. So, any \"crowd attend\" reference should be checked here.\n\nNext, the claim specifies a crowd size of 33057. I need to find if this exact number is present in the attendance column for week 6. \n\nNow, let's look at the table data. Week 6 corresponds to one specific row. The rows are numbered from 1 to 12, with week 14 and 15 as well, but let me focus on week 6.\n\nSearching through the weeks: week 6 is in row number 5 (since the first row is week 1). Let's check what the attendance was for that week. According to the table, under week 6, the attendance is listed as 33057. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data. The crowd did attend in numbers equal to 33057 during week 6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"6 week's game be attend by 33007 crowd.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look for information related to the 6th week game in the table. Each row represents a week, starting from week 1 up to week 12, and then week 14. Wait, there's no week 13 in the table. So, the claim is about week 6.\n\nLooking at the table, week 6 has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. The attendance for week 6 is listed as 33057. Now, the claim mentions a crowd of 33007. \n\nSo, I need to check if the attendance in week 6 was 33007. From the table, it's clear that it wasn't\u2014it's actually 33,057. There's no row for week 14 yet, but week 6 is definitely the relevant one here.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data because the actual attendance for week 6 was higher than what's stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 6th week game had an attendance of 33,007. However, according to the table, week 6 had an attendance of 33,057.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
