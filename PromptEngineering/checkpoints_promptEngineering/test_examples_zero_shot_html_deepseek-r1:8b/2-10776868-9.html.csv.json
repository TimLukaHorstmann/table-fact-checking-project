The claim is: \"in 1962, the victorian football league season took place on 23 june.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check the 'date' column in the table because that's directly related to the claim about the date in 1962. Looking at each row:\n\n- All rows have the same date: \"23 june 1962\". So the venue and other columns don't affect the date part of the claim.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the Victorian Football League (VFL) season taking place on June 23, 1962. However, looking at the table headers, the 'home team' and 'away team' might not directly relate unless I'm considering which teams played on that date.

The relevant columns here are 'home team', 'home team score', 'away team', and 'away team score'.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1962, the VFL began in July\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the VFL, which I think stands for Victorian Football League, but now it's known as the AFL (Australian Football League), started when? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that Australian football has a history that goes back several decades. The claim says it began in 1962, specifically in July.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a game from June 23, 1962. All the dates are \"23 june 1962.\" That's interesting because if the VFL started in July 1962, then games would typically be played in that month or later. However, all the matches here took place on June 23rd, which is in early June, not July.\n\nI should check if any of these rows have a date in July 1962. But according to the table, every game was on June 23, so none are in July. That suggests that the VFL games didn't start in July 1962 but rather earlier that month. Therefore, the claim that the VFL began in July 1962 might be false.\n\nWait, I should verify if the VFL actually started in 1962. From what I recall, the AFL had its predecessor leagues before 1962, and it's possible that the VFL was already established by then. So maybe the claim is incorrect because the games were being played in June, not July.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, there are no games listed for July 1962. All the matches occurred on June 23, which is in early June. Hence, the claim that the VFL began in July 1962 isn't supported by this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the VFL began in July 1962.

The claim is: \"the match between south melbourne and richmond drew the smallest crowd of the day.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the relevant information. The table has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'm interested in the match between South Melbourne and Richmond. So I need to locate that specific row in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that South Melbourne is listed as the home team against Richmond as the away team in one of the rows. Specifically, it's the sixth row from the top (since the first is melbourne vs st kilda). Let me count: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th\u2014yes, that's South Melbourne vs Richmond.\n\nNow, looking at the crowd column for this match. The crowd number is 17000.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the claim to identify the key components: the two teams involved are Collingwood and Hawthorn, and the comparison is about their scores in a specific match from 1962.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, each row represents a game with details including home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. My goal is to find the relevant rows where both teams, Collingwood and Hawthorn, are involved, specifically on June 23, 1962.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the rows:\n\n1. **First Row**: Home team is Melbourne, away is St Kilda. Not relevant since Hawthorn isn't here.\n2. **Second Row**: Essendon vs Geelong. Not relevant.\n3. **Third Row**: Collingwood is the home team, against Fitzroy.

So Collingwood isn't even playing against Hawthorn here; it's North Melbourne.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Collingwood vs Hawthorn.\" So in the table, I don't see a row where both Collingwood and Hawthorn are matched against each other on June 23, 1962. The only match involving Hawthorn is against North Melbourne.\n\nTherefore, there's no data to support that Collingwood played against Hawthorn specifically on that date.

The claim is: \"the game between footscray and fitzroy was played at windy hill.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The key elements here are the two teams (footscray and fitzroy) and the venue (windy hill). \n\nI should start by locating rows in the table where both the home team and away team are either footscray or fitzroy. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Home team is melbourne, away is st kilda. Doesn't match.\n2. **Second Row**: Essendon vs Geelong. No match.\n3. **Third Row**: Collingwood vs Fitzroy. Here, one of the teams is fitzroy, but the other isn't footscray.\n4. **Fourth Row**: Carlton vs Footscray. Now, both teams are present, but I need to check if the venue is windy hill.\n5. **Fifth Row**: South Melbourne vs Richmond. Not relevant.\n6. **Sixth Row**: North Melbourne vs Hawthorn. No match.\n\nSo only the fourth row has footscray as an away team and fitzroy isn't in that row. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking again: In the third row, Collingwood is home against Fitzroy. So maybe I should correct that. The relevant row would be when both teams are present. Let me check each row properly.\n\nWait, in the fourth row, Carlton is home and Footscray is away. Now, checking for whether the venue is windy hill. Looking at that same row, the venue is princes park. So even though footscray is there, it's not at windy hill.\n\nLooking through all rows again, I don't see a game between footscray and fitzroy. Let me confirm each team pairing:\n\n- Footscray is an away team in the fourth row against Carlton.\n- Fitzroy is the away team in the third row against Collingwood.\nSo there's no row where both teams are footscray and fitzroy as home and away.\n\nTherefore, the claim that such a game was played at windy hill isn't supported by the table. So the answer should be false.\n\nNext, identifying relevant cells: The rows to check would be where either team is involved, so for example, looking up whether any row has both teams. But since no such row exists, maybe it's about checking if the venue was windy hill when they played. Wait, but in none of their games is the venue windy hill.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are where footscray or fitzroy are listed as either home or away and the venue is checked. Specifically, for each occurrence of these teams, we need to see what venue they played at.\n\nIn row 3, Fitzroy is away at victoria park.\nIn row 4, Footscray is away at princes park.\nNo game between them was held at windy hill, so none of their games match the claim. Therefore, no relevant cells because the claim isn't supported by any data in the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps the relevant cells are all instances where either team is present to check if they were ever at windy hill. So maybe the columns to look at are 'away team', 'home team', and 'venue' for each row that includes footscray or fitzroy.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- In row 3: home team is collingwood, away is fitzroy. Venue is victoria park.\n- In row 4: home is carlton, away is footscray. Venue is princes park.\n- In no such row does the venue match windy hill.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in those rows where either team is present and the venue column because none of them have the correct venue.
