    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, they play at the Mile High Stadium 4 more times than at the Kingdome.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what information is needed to verify this claim. The key points are:\n\n1. It's about the 1982 season.\n2. Games played at Mile High Stadium versus games played at Kingdome.\n3. Mile High Stadium has exactly 4 more games than Kingdome.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists each week of the Broncos' season, including details like the opponent, result, game site, and attendance. The columns relevant here are \"game site\" and perhaps others, but specifically, we need to count how many times they played at Mile High Stadium and at Kingdome.\n\nHowever, the table provided doesn't have a column for the year or season, only from week 1 to week 16. But the claim is about the 1982 season. I should check if all these weeks fall within the 1982 season because if some games are from other years, that might affect the count.\n\nAssuming all the listed games are part of the 1982 season (since they go up to week 16 and the last game is on January 2, which is typical for a Super Bowl or playoff game in the NFL), we can proceed.\n\nNext, I'll look through each row's \"game site\" to see where the games were played. Mile High Stadium is mentioned in several rows: weeks 1, 2, 10, 12, and 14. Wait, no\u2014let me check again:\n\n- Week 1: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 2: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 10: Mile High Stadium\n- Week 11: Kingdome? No, week 11 is Jack Murphy Stadium.\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Week 1, Mile High Stadium\nRow 1: Week 2, Mile High Stadium\nRow 2: Week 10, Mile High Stadium\nRow 3: Week 11, Kingdome? No, it's Jack Murphy Stadium. So not Kingdome.\nWait, no\u2014wait the table lists \"game site\" as Mile High Stadium for week 1-2 and then again at week 10, but then week 11 is Jack Murphy, week 12 is Mile High, week 13 is Anaheim, week 14 is Mile High, week 15 is Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and week 16 is Kingdome.\n\nSo let's count:\n\nMile High Stadium: Weeks 1, 2, 10, 12, 14. That's 5 games.\n\nKingdome: Only week 16. So that's 1 game.\n\nWait, but the claim says they played at Mile High Stadium 4 more times than Kingdome. If Mile High has 5 and Kingdome has 1, that's a difference of 4. So it seems true.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check each row:\n\nWeek 1: Mile High - count as 1\nWeek 2: Mile High - 2\nWeek 10: Mile High - 3\nWeek 12: Mile High - 4\nWeek 14: Mile High - 5\n\nKingdome only appears in week 16, so that's 1.\n\nSo Mile High: 5 games\nKingdome: 1 game\nDifference: 4\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct. The Broncos played at Mile High Stadium 4 more times than Kingdome during the 1982 season.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if any of these games were not part of the regular season or if the count includes playoff games. Since week 16 is a playoff game (Super Bowl), but it's still part of the same season, so that's included.\n\nAlso, the Kingdome was the home stadium for the Seattle Seahawks, but the Broncos might have played there in some other year. But since we're only looking at their own games, and the claim specifies their own season, the count is accurate within that context.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being all the rows where they played at Mile High Stadium and Kingdome.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each game site in the table for the 1982 Denver Broncos season. The team played 5 games at Mile High Stadium and 1 game at Kingdome, resulting in a difference of 4 games more at Mile High Stadium.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The claim requires comparing the number of games at Mile High Stadium versus Kingdome during the 1982 season.\n2. **Locate Game Sites in Table:** Review each row's \"game site\" to count occurrences of Mile High Stadium and Kingdome.\n3. **Count Games:**\n   - Mile High Stadium: Weeks 1, 2, 10, 12, 14 (5 games)\n   - Kingdome: Week 16 (1 game)\n4. **Calculate Difference:** 5 (Mile High) - 1 (Kingdome) = 4.\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim is true as Mile High Stadium hosts 4 more games than Kingdome in the 1982 season.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"claim\": \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, they played at the Mile High Stadium 4 more times than at the Kingdome.\",\n  \"verification\": {\n    \"mile_high_stadium_games\": [\n      {\"week\": 1, \"site\": \"Mile High Stadium\"},\n      {\"week\": 2, \"site\": \"Mile High Stadium\"},\n      {\"week\": 10, \"site\": \"Mile High Stadium\"},\n      {\"week\": 12, \"site\": \"Mile High Stadium\"},\n      {\"week\": 14, \"site\": \"Mile High Stadium\"}\n    ],\n    \"kingdome_games\": [\n      {\"week\": 16, \"site\": \"Kingdome\"}\n    ],\n    \"difference\": 4\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim says, \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, the team lost 5 more times than they won.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is asserting. It's about the number of losses versus wins in a specific season. So, I need to look into the table and find out how many games the Broncos won and lost during that season.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists games from week 1 to week 16, spanning September through December and into January. The key columns here are \"week\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"result\", and others like attendance, but the most relevant for this claim will be \"result\" since it shows whether they won or lost each game.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the table doesn't have any games from the 1982 season. The earliest week shown is week 1 on September 12, which is in 1982, but the next weeks are up to week 16 on January 2, 1983. However, it's important to note the years because the claim refers specifically to the 1982 season. \n\nWait, actually, week 1 is in 1982, and the rest go into 1983. So does the table cover all of 1982? Probably not, since after week 16, which is January 2, 1983, the season would have ended. But in reality, the Broncos' 1982 season included more games beyond what's shown here, but for this table, we only have up to week 16.\n\nWait, no, actually, the claim is about the entire 1982 season, which had more than 16 weeks? No, wait, the NFL regular season has 16 games. So, if the table shows all 16 games, then maybe it's complete. But looking at the table provided, I see that it goes up to week 16 on January 2, so that would be the last game of the regular season in 1982.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the table isn't complete because the Broncos had a playoff game after week 16. So the claim is about the regular season, which ended at week 16.\n\nSo, I need to count the number of wins and losses for the Broncos during the 1982 season based on the table provided.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nWeek 1: Lost (L) against Chargers\nWeek 2: Won (W) against 49ers\nWeek 10: Lost (L) against Seahawks\nWeek 11: Lost (L) against Chargers\nWeek 12: Lost (L) against Falcons\nWeek 13: Won (W) against Rams\nWeek 14: Lost (L) against Chiefs\nWeek 15: Lost (L) against Raiders\nWeek 16: Lost (L) against Seahawks\n\nWait, that's only 9 games. Hmm, but the table has 16 rows, so maybe I'm missing something. Oh no, wait, looking again:\n\nThe table starts at week 1, then skips to week 10, 11, etc. It seems like it's not listing all weeks sequentially. So perhaps the table is incomplete or only showing a subset of games? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the user provided an HTML table with rows from week 1 to week 16, but they're spread across September, November, December, and January. So each row represents a game played in those weeks.\n\nSo, for the 1982 season, which had 16 games, the table shows all 16 games. Now, I need to count how many wins and losses there were.\n\nLooking at the \"result\" column:\n\nWeek 1: l (loss)\nWeek 2: w\nWeek 10: l\nWeek 11: l\nWeek 12: l\nWeek 13: w\nWeek 14: l\nWeek 15: l\nWeek 16: l\n\nWait, that's only 9 games. No, wait, each row is a week, so there are 16 rows, but the \"result\" column has either 'l' or 'w'.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. Week 1: loss\n2. Week 2: win\n3. Week 10: loss\n4. Week 11: loss\n5. Week 12: loss\n6. Week 13: win\n7. Week 14: loss\n8. Week 15: loss\n9. Week 16: loss\n\nWait, that's only 9 results. But the table has 16 rows. Oh no, I think I misread it. Wait, each row is a different week, but in the provided table, some weeks are missing? Or maybe the table isn't complete.\n\nWait, let me count the rows: looking at the HTML code, there's a table with 16 rows, each corresponding to a week from 1 to 16, but some weeks have games that are not consecutive. For example, after week 2, it goes to week 10, then 11, etc.\n\nSo, for the 1982 season, the Broncos played 16 games. The table lists all 16 games, so I can count the number of wins and losses.\n\nFrom the \"result\" column:\n\n1. L\n2. W\n3. L\n4. L\n5. L\n6. W\n7. L\n8. L\n9. L\n\nWait, that's only 9 results again. No, I think I'm misunderstanding how the table is structured.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, perhaps each row is a different game, but the opponent and date vary. So each row is one game, and there are 16 games listed, from week 1 to week 16.\n\nSo, for the 1982 season:\n\n- Wins: let's see, which results are W?\n\nWeek 2: W\nWeek 13: W\n\nThat's two wins.\n\nLosses: The rest are L. So total games = 16. Wins = 2, Losses = 14.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says they lost 5 more times than they won. If they lost 14 and won 2, that's a difference of 12, not 5.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm miscounting or misunderstanding the table.\n\nWait, let me go through each row:\n\n1. Week 1: Lost\n2. Week 2: Won\n3. Week 10: Lost\n4. Week 11: Lost\n5. Week 12: Lost\n6. Week 13: Won\n7. Week 14: Lost\n8. Week 15: Lost\n9. Week 16: Lost\n\nWait, that's only 9 games again. No, no, the table has 16 rows, each with a week number and other details.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier in counting the results. Let me list out all 16 results:\n\nLooking at the HTML table:\n\n- Week 1: L\n- Week 2: W\n- Week 10: L\n- Week 11: L\n- Week 12: L\n- Week 13: W\n- Week 14: L\n- Week 15: L\n- Week 16: L\n\nWait, that's only 9 results. But there are 16 weeks, so I'm missing something.\n\nOh no, perhaps the table is incomplete or misaligned. Wait, looking again, the HTML table has 16 rows:\n\n1. Week 1\n2. Week 2\n3. Week 10\n4. Week 11\n5. Week 12\n6. Week 13\n7. Week 14\n8. Week 15\n9. Week 16\n\nWait, that's only 9 weeks. No, no, the table has 16 rows, but with week numbers skipping around.\n\nWait, perhaps each row is a single game, and there are 16 games listed, so I need to count all of them.\n\nLooking at the \"result\" column for each of the 16 rows:\n\n1. L\n2. W\n3. L\n4. L\n5. L\n6. W\n7. L\n8. L\n9. L\n10. L\n11. L\n12. W\n13. L\n14. L\n15. L\n16. L\n\nWait, that's 16 results. So wins are at week 2 and week 12: so two wins.\n\nLosses are the rest: 14 losses.\n\nSo total games: 16 (2W +14L)\n\nThus, the Broncos lost 14 times and won twice in 1982.\n\nThe claim is that they lost 5 more times than they won. So let's see:\n\nIf W=2, L=14\n\nDifference: L - W = 12.\n\nSo the difference is 12, not 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because they lost 12 more times than they won, not 5.\n\nBut wait, I think there might be a misunderstanding here. The claim says \"lost 5 more times than they won.\" So that would mean L = W +5.\n\nIn this case, W=2, so L should be 7 to satisfy L=2+5=7.\n\nBut in reality, L=14, which is way more than 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The Broncos lost significantly more times than they won in 1982.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the wins and losses.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nFrom the \"result\" column of each game:\n\n1. L\n2. W\n3. L\n4. L\n5. L\n6. W\n7. L\n8. L\n9. L\n10. L\n11. L\n12. W\n13. L\n14. L\n15. L\n16. L\n\nSo wins at week 2 and week 12: that's two wins.\n\nLosses: 14.\n\nYes, so L=14, W=2.\n\nDifference is 12, not 5.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the team lost five more times than it won in 1982 is incorrect. Based on the provided data, the team actually lost twelve more times than it won during that season.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; the team lost twelve more games than they won in 1982.",

The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, week 1, 2 and 10 be played at the Mile High Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for rows related to the 1982 season. However, the table provided doesn't specify a season. It lists games from weeks 1 through 16, but without indicating which years these games occurred in. So, I can't confirm if week 10 was played in 1982 just by looking at the table.\n\nNext, I need to check if the claim mentions specific weeks: 1, 2, and 10. Looking at the table, there are indeed entries for these weeks (rows 0, 1, and 9). Each of these rows shows the game site as \"mile high stadium.\"\n\nSo, each of these weeks (1, 2, 10) was played at Mile High Stadium according to the table. However, since the table doesn't specify the year, I can't verify that this happened in the 1982 season. Therefore, the claim's accuracy depends on knowing that these games were indeed from 1982.\n\nBut based solely on the table, all three weeks (1, 2, 10) are at Mile High Stadium.

The claim states: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, week 16 has the least amount in attendance of all 9 games.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about the 1982 season, specifically week 16, having the lowest attendance among all nine games that season. So, my main tasks are to verify if there is a week 16 in the table and whether it indeed has the least attendance.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice that the weeks listed go from 1 to 16, which suggests that the season covered spans multiple weeks. The claim refers to week 16, so I should check if week 16 data is present in the table.\n\nI scan through each row's 'week' column:\n- Week 1\n- Week 2\n- ...\n- Week 10\n- Week 11\n- Week 12\n- Week 13\n- Week 14\n- Week 15\n- Week 16\n\nYes, week 16 is included in the table. Now, I need to compare its attendance figure against all other weeks to see if it's the lowest.\n\nThe 'attendance' column for week 16 shows 43145. To confirm this is the least, I'll list out all the attendance numbers:\n\n- Week 1: 73564\n- Week 2: 73899\n- Week 10: 73996\n- Week 11: 47629\n- Week 12: 73984\n- Week 13: 48112\n- Week 14: 74192\n- Week 15: 44160\n- Week 16: 43145\n\nNow, I'll arrange these numbers to find the smallest one. The lowest is week 16 with 43,145 attendees.

The claim states: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, the team lost 5 more times than they won in December.\" \n\nFirst, I should check what each part of the claim means and find relevant cells in the table. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Season**: It specifies the 1982 season. Looking at the table, the 'week' column goes up to week 16, but the dates only go up to December 26. Wait, there's a game on January 2, so that might be week 17 or beyond. But the claim is about December games, specifically losses and wins in December.\n\n2. **December Games**: The claim refers to losses and wins in December. I need to identify which rows correspond to December games. Looking at the 'week' and 'date' columns:\n\n- Week 10: November 21\n- Week 11: November 28\n- Week 12: December 5\n- Week 13: December 12\n- Week 14: December 19\n- Week 15: December 26\n\nWait, but the claim is about losses and wins in December. So, games in December would be weeks 12 (Dec 5), 13 (Dec 12), 14 (Dec 19), and 15 (Dec 26). However, week 16 is January 2, which is not December.\n\n3. **Counting Losses and Wins in December**: I need to count the number of losses and wins for these four games.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Week 12: December 5 vs Atlanta Falcons. Result: l 27 - 34. So that's a loss.\n- Week 13: December 12 vs Los Angeles Rams. Result: w 27 - 24. That's a win.\n- Week 14: December 19 vs Kansas City Chiefs. Result: l 16 - 37. Another loss.\n- Week 15: December 26 vs Los Angeles Raiders. Result: l 10 - 27. Third loss.\n\nSo in December games, the Broncos lost three times and won once.\n\nThe claim says they lost five more times than they won in December. Let's check:\n\nNumber of losses in December: 3\nNumber of wins in December: 1\n\nDifference: 3 - 1 = 2. The team lost two more times than they won in December, not five more.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this verification. Each cell corresponds to a row and column related to the December games and their results.\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n- Week 12: Loss\n- Week 13: Win\n- Week 14: Loss\n- Week 15: Loss\n\nSo the relevant rows are 11 (week 12), 12 (week 13), 13 (week 14), and 14 (week 15). The columns to check are 'result' for each game.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be these four rows under 'result'.\n\nBut wait, the table has row indices starting at 0. So:\n\n- Week 12 is row 11\n- Week 13 is row 12\n- Week 14 is row 13\n- Week 15 is row 14\n\nEach of these has a 'result' column that shows whether it's a loss or win.\n\nSo the relevant_cells are rows 11, 12, 13, and 14 with column 'result'.\n\nI should list each as an object in the array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check against each part.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, they play at the mile high stadium 4 more times than at the Kingdome and 2 more times than at Anaheim Stadium.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant information in the table. The table lists games from weeks 1 to 16, including details like opponent, result, game site, and attendance. The key here is the number of times they played at each venue.\n\nLooking for Mile High Stadium: I see that the Broncos played at Mile High Stadium multiple times. Specifically, in week 1, 2, 10, 12, and 14. That's a total of 5 games. \n\nNext, checking Kingdome: The table shows only one game at Kingdome, which is in week 16 against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nFor Anaheim Stadium: There's only one game there as well, week 13 against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nNow, comparing these numbers:\n\n- Mile High Stadium: 5 games\n- Kingdome: 1 game\n- Anaheim Stadium: 1 game\n\nThe claim states that Mile High Stadium had 4 more games than Kingdome. Since Kingdome has 1 and Mile High has 5, the difference is indeed 4. Similarly, Mile High has 2 more games than Anaheim Stadium (1 vs. 5), which also holds true.\n\nTherefore, all the conditions in the claim are met.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to count the number of times the Broncos played at each stadium during the 1982 season.\n\n- **Mile High Stadium**: There are 5 games listed (weeks 1, 2, 10, 12, 14).\n- **Kingdome**: Only 1 game in week 16.\n- **Anaheim Stadium**: Only 1 game in week 13.\n\nThe claim states that Mile High Stadium had 4 more games than Kingdome and 2 more than Anaheim. Comparing the counts:\n- 5 - 1 = 4 (Mile High vs. Kingdome)\n- 5 - 1 = 2 (Mile High vs. Anaheim)\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim says. The user wrote: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season , week 12 , 13 and 14 be play at the mile high stadium.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down, the claim mentions three specific weeks (12, 13, 14) during the 1982 Broncos season where games were played at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists games from week 1 through week 16 of some season. The columns include week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. \n\nI should check each week mentioned in the claim (12, 13, 14) to see if they are indeed playing at Mile High Stadium.\n\nStarting with week 12: Looking through the table, I find row 11 which is week 11, then row 12 is week 12. In row 12, the game site is \"mile high stadium.\" So week 12 was played there.\n\nNext, week 13: The next rows are 13 and 14. Row 13 corresponds to week 13, and the game site is listed as \"anaheim stadium.\" That's different from Mile High Stadium.\n\nWait, that doesn't match the claim. The claim says weeks 12,13,14 were played at Mile High, but according to the table, only week 12 was there. Weeks 13 and 14 were away games.\n\nSimilarly, for week 14: Looking at row 14, which is week 14, the game site is again \"mile high stadium.\" Wait, no, row 14's week is 14, but the game site says \"mile high stadium\" again? Let me double-check. Oh no, wait\u2014actually, row 12 is week 12 at Mile High, row 13 is week 13 at Anaheim Stadium, and row 14 is week 14 at Mile High again.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the season shouldn't have two games in the same week or overlapping weeks. Let me check the table structure again.\n\nThe table has rows corresponding to weeks from 1 to 16. Row numbering starts at 0 as week 1, up to row 15 which is week 16. So:\n\nRow 11: Week 12\nRow 12: Week 13\nRow 13: Week 14\n\nWait no, actually, the rows are numbered starting from 0 as the first row (week 1), so row index 11 would be week 12? Let me count.\n\nRow 0: week 1\nRow 1: week 2\n...\nRow 10: week 11\nRow 11: week 12\nRow 12: week 13\nRow 13: week 14\n\nSo, for week 12 (row 11), the game site is Mile High.\n\nWeek 13 (row 12) is at Anaheim Stadium.\n\nWeek 14 (row 13) is again at Mile High Stadium.\n\nWait, but in reality, a team doesn't play two home games in consecutive weeks unless they have bye weeks. Let me check the opponents as well.\n\nIn week 12, opponent is Atlanta Falcons, result is loss.\n\nWeek 14: Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs, result is loss.\n\nSo, in the table, there are indeed games for week 12 and week 14 at Mile High Stadium, but not week 13. The claim says weeks 12,13,14, so it's incorrect about week 13.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim is: during week 12,13,14, games were played at Mile High.\n\nFrom the table, in week 12 (row 11) and week 14 (row 13), yes, but not week 13 (row 12). So the claim is incorrect for week 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because only weeks 12 and 14 were at Mile High Stadium, not 13. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the table.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRow 11: week 12, site Mile High\n\nRow 12: week 13, site Anaheim\n\nRow 13: week 14, site Mile High\n\nSo yes, only weeks 12 and 14 at Mile High, but not 13. So the claim is wrong about week 13.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because not all three weeks (12,13,14) were played at Mile High\u2014only two of them.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that in the table, the games are indeed for 1982. The dates aren't specified, but the opponents and game sites might help. For example, if the Broncos usually play home games in certain months, but without exact dates, it's a bit tricky. However, since the user didn't specify the year beyond 1982, and the table doesn't provide that info, I have to go with the given data.\n\nSo, the claim is false because only weeks 12 and 14 were at Mile High Stadium, not week 13.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during weeks 12, 13, and 14 of the 1982 Denver Broncos season, games were played at Mile High Stadium. Upon examining the table, it's clear that while weeks 12 and 14 indeed had games there, week 13 was an away game at Anaheim Stadium. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_false\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Only weeks 12 and 14 were played at Mile High Stadium; week 13 was not.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true based on the provided table. The claim says that during week 1, 2, and 10 of the 1982 season, the Broncos played at Mile High Stadium with the lowest attendance.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure to understand what data is available. The table has columns for week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different week of the season.\n\nThe claim mentions three specific weeks: 1, 2, and 10. I need to check each of these weeks in the table to find their attendance numbers at Mile High Stadium because that's where the games are supposed to have occurred with the lowest attendance.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Week 1 is on September 12 against the San Diego Chargers at Mile High Stadium with 73,564 attendees.\n- Week 2 is on September 19 against the San Francisco 49ers at Mile High Stadium with 73,899 attendees.\n- Week 10 is on November 21 against the Seattle Seahawks at Mile High Stadium with 73,996 attendees.\n\nWait, but according to the table, these weeks have higher attendance each time. For example, week 1 has 73k, week 2 slightly more at ~74k, and week 10 also around 74k. The claim says that in these weeks, they had the lowest attendance. But looking at the data, all three games are at Mile High Stadium, but their attendances are quite similar and actually higher than other games listed.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Are there any other games in the table for 1982? Well, the table starts from week 1 to week 16, but it's not clear if these are all the games played by the Broncos that season or just a selection. However, since the claim is about weeks 1, 2, and 10, I should focus on those specific weeks.\n\nIn the table, for these three weeks:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n\nThese numbers are actually among the highest attendances in Mile High Stadium according to the table. For example, week 12 has an attendance of 73,984 and week 14 at 74,192, which are slightly higher than week 1 but lower than weeks 2 and 10.\n\nWait no, actually, looking again:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n\nAnd other weeks like 12 (73,984), 13 (48,112), which is much lower, and 11 at 47,629.\n\nSo, in the table provided, week 1 has about 73k, which is higher than week 13's 48k. Similarly, week 2 is higher than some but lower than others. However, the claim states that weeks 1, 2, and 10 had the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium.\n\nBut looking at the data, these weeks have attendances of around 73-74k. Other games in Mile High Stadium, like week 13 against the Rams, had much lower attendances (48k) which is less than all three mentioned weeks. So actually, weeks 1, 2, and 10 did not have the lowest attendances.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again:\n\nRows for weeks 1-16 are given. For Mile High Stadium games, the attendance numbers go from:\n\n- Week 1: 73k\n- Week 2: ~74k\n- Week 10: ~74k\n\nOther games at Mile High Stadium include:\n\n- Week 12: 73,984 (which is slightly lower than week 2)\n- Week 14: 74,192 (higher than week 1)\n- Week 16: 43k (much lower)\n\nSo, in terms of Mile High Stadium attendances, the lowest is around week 13 and 16 with 48k and 43k respectively. Therefore, weeks 1, 2, and 10 are not the lowest; instead, their attendance is relatively higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim that during these weeks they had the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium is false because there were other games with lower attendances in those same stadiums.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during weeks 1, 2, and 10 of the 1982 season, the Denver Broncos played at Mile High Stadium with the lowest attendance. However, upon examining the table, these weeks actually have higher attendances compared to other games listed. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because the attendance numbers for weeks 1, 2, and 10 are not among the lowest in Mile High Stadium during the 1982 season. Other games had lower attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"type\": \"answer\",\n    \"content\": \"The claim is false.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Denver Broncos' 1982 season is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, week 16 has the least amount in attendance of 74192 in all 9 games.\" Hmm, wait a minute. First, I should parse this correctly. It mentions the 1982 season, which is a bit confusing because the table provided doesn't have a \"Season\" column. Instead, it lists weeks and dates, starting from week 1 to week 16.\n\nWait, looking at the table's columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance. So each row represents a specific week of games in what seems like the 1982 season, as the latest week is week 16 on January 2nd. The claim refers to week 16 having the least attendance across all 9 games.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table data, week numbers go up to 16, but how many games are there? Each week has one game, right? So from week 1 to week 16, that's 16 games. But the claim mentions \"all 9 game.\" Wait, maybe it's a typo and meant to say all 16 games? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, let me look at the data again. The table has rows for weeks 1 through 16. Each week has one game, so that would be 16 games in total. But the claim says \"all 9 game.\" That doesn't add up. Maybe it's a typo and they meant all 16 games? Or perhaps the claim is talking about something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to a specific set of games, like the first nine weeks or something else. But the way the claim is phrased is confusing: \"week 16 have the least amount in attendance of 74192 in all 9 game.\" Maybe it's a translation issue or a typo.\n\nWait, looking at the table data for week 16, I see that the attendance is 43,145. Now, let me check if this is indeed the lowest across all games listed in the table. So I need to compare the 'attendance' column across all rows to find the minimum value and see if week 16's attendance matches that.\n\nSo first, extract the attendance numbers from each row:\n\nRow 0 (week 1): 73,564\n\nRow 1 (week 2): 73,899\n\nRow 9 (week 10): 73,996\n\nRow 10 (week 11): 47,629\n\nWait, hold on. The weeks are listed as 1,2,3...16. But in the table, it's a bit confusing because after week 14, the next weeks are 15 and 16. So each row is a separate week.\n\nNow, looking at all the attendance numbers:\n\n73,564; 73,899; ... Let me list them all out properly.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nWeek 1: 73564\n\nWeek 2: 73899\n\nWeek 10: 73996\n\nWeek 11: 47629\n\nWait, that's a big drop. Week 11 has only 47,629 attendees. Then week 12:73,984; week13:48,112; week14:74,192; week15:44,160; week16:43,145.\n\nSo the attendances are:\n\nWeek1:73564\n\nWeek2:73899\n\nWeek3: ?\n\nWait, actually, the table provided in the question only has rows for weeks 1,2,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Wait, that's 9 weeks, not 16. So maybe the user made a mistake in their claim.\n\nWait, this is confusing because the initial table starts with week1, then jumps to week2, then skips weeks 3-9, then goes to week10,11,12,13,14,15,16. So only certain weeks are listed, not all 16. Therefore, if the claim refers to \"all 9 games,\" maybe it's referring to these specific rows.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nThe rows provided are for weeks:1,2,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\u2014total of 9 weeks. So perhaps the claim is talking about these 9 games in week16 having the least attendance of 74192. Wait, but in the data, week16 has 43,145 attendees, which is much lower than others.\n\nWait, let me check all 9 attendances:\n\nLooking at the provided rows (weeks1-2,10-11,12-16):\n\nWeek1:73,564\n\nWeek2:73,899\n\nWeek10:73,996\n\nWeek11:47,629\n\nWeek12:73,984\n\nWeek13:48,112\n\nWeek14:74,192\n\nWeek15:44,160\n\nWeek16:43,145\n\nSo the attendance numbers are:\n\n73,564; 73,899; 73,996; 47,629; 73,984; 48,112; 74,192; 44,160; 43,145.\n\nLooking for the minimum here. Let's list them in order:\n\nMinimum is 43,145 (week16), then 44,160 (week15), followed by 47,629 (week11). Wait, no: 47k is higher than 44k and 43k. So actually, week16 has 43,145, which is the lowest among these nine weeks.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"least amount in attendance of 74192.\" But according to the data, week14 has 74,192 attendees, which is higher than others but not the minimum. The minimum is 43,145.\n\nSo the claim seems incorrect because it states that week16 had 74,192 attendees as the lowest, but in reality, it's the highest among these nine weeks. Wait no: 74k is higher, so the lowest is indeed 43k. So the claim is wrong because it claims 74192 (which is 74,192) as the least attendance for week16, but in fact, that's one of the higher attendances.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nWeek1:73,564\n\nWeek2:73,899\n\nWeek10:73,996\n\nWeek11:47,629\n\nWeek12:73,984\n\nWeek13:48,112\n\nWeek14:74,192\n\nWait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake in transcribing the numbers. Let me re-examine:\n\nRow for week14 is 74,192.\n\nRow for week15:44,160.\n\nRow for week16:43,145.\n\nSo 74k is higher than 44k and 43k.\n\nTherefore, among these nine weeks (1,2,10-16), the lowest attendance is week16 at 43,145, not 74,192.\n\nThus, the claim that week16 had the least attendance of 74,192 is incorrect because that number is higher than other attendances in the data. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that week 16 had an attendance of 74,192, which is actually one of the higher numbers. The lowest attendance in the provided data for week 16 is 43,145.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"Statement\": \"During the 1982 Denver Bronco season, Week 16 had the least attendance with 74192 attendees across all 9 games.\",\n  \"Verification\": \"The attendance number provided (74,192) does not match the actual lowest figure for week 16 in the given data.
