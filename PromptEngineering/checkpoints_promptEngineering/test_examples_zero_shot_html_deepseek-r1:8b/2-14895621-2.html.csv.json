    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The name \"hwang sun\" likely refers to Hwang Sun, a badminton player. \"Kang haeng\" is probably referring to Kang Haeng-suk, another badminton player known for partnering with Hwang Sun in the past.\n\nThe claim mentions that they partnered three times at tournaments. So, I need to check if there are three instances in the table where Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-suk were partners together.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. The rows contain different entries for these categories.\n\nI notice that most of the rows have repeated entries, like \"world championships\" or \"asian games,\" but I'm more interested in the partner column because that's where the partnerships are recorded.\n\nScanning through each row's partner column:\n\n1. The first row has \"world championships\" as the partner, which is a category, not a person.\n2. The second row lists \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner. This matches Kang Haeng-suk.\n3. The third row again lists \"asian games,\" which isn't a person.\n4. The fourth row has \"kang haeng - suk\" again, so that's another partnership with Hwang Sun.\n5. The fifth row is \"other open tournaments,\" not a person.\n6. The sixth row mentions \"kang haeng - suk\" once more.\n\nSo, in total, Kang Haeng-suk appears as the partner three times in the partner column: rows 2, 4, and 6. Each of these instances represents a different event, with the years 1985, 1982, and 1985 respectively.\n\nWait a second, there's an entry for 1985 twice\u2014once in row 2 (world championships) and once in row 6 (India Open). That means that in 1985, Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng-suk at least twice: once in the world championships and once in the India Open. So does that count as two separate partnerships for that year?\n\nThe claim is about three times at tournaments in total. From the table, there are three instances where their partnership is recorded:\n\n- 1985 World Championships\n- 1982 Asian Games\n- 1985 India Open\n\nThat's three distinct partnerships. Even though one year has two entries, it doesn't negate the fact that there are three separate events listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells confirm that Kang Haeng-suk partnered with Hwang Sun three times across different tournaments as per the partner column in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table and then specify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1985 world championship in calgary , canada.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Entity 1**: Hwang Sun\n2. **Entity 2**: Kang Haeng\n3. **Event**: Partnered together for the first time.\n4. **Location**: Calgary, Canada.\n5. **Event Name**: 1985 World Championship.\n\nNow, I'll look into the table to find relevant information.\n\nThe table has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: All cells are \"world championships.\" This seems like a header or placeholder.\n  \n- **Row 1**:\n  - Outcome: 3\n  - Event: wd (probably short for World Dance)\n  - Year: 1985\n  - Venue: Calgary, Canada\n  - Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n  \nThis row mentions the 1985 world championship in Calgary with Kang Haeng as the partner. So, Hwang Sun isn't mentioned here.\n\n- **Row 2**: All cells are \"asian games.\" Probably another event.\n  \n- **Row 3**:\n  - Outcome: 1\n  - Event: wd (again, World Dance)\n  - Year: 1982\n  - Venue: New Delhi, India\n  - Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n  \nHere, in 1982, the partner is again Kang Haeng. No Hwang Sun mentioned.\n\n- **Row 4**: All cells are \"other open tournaments.\" Another event type.\n  \n- **Row 5**:\n  - Outcome: 1\n  - Event: wd\n  - Year: 1985\n  - Venue: India Open\n  - Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n  \nAgain, in 1985, but this time at the India Open. No Hwang Sun here either.\n\nWait, so I'm looking for when Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng. The claim states that it was the first time at the 1985 World Championship in Calgary. However, in the table:\n\n- In row 1 (1985), partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, not Hwang Sun.\n- In row 5 (1985), venue is India Open, partner is Kang Haeng.\n\nThere's no mention of Hwang Sun anywhere in the table. All partnerships involve Kang Haeng and another person, but not Hwang Sun.\n\nSo, according to the table, there's no evidence that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at any point, especially not at the 1985 World Championship in Calgary. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the table shows partnerships involving Kang Haeng but not Hwang Sun in the relevant event and venue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Hwang Sun is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by carefully reading and understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in 1982 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman's double event , finish first , 1 of 2 time she win an event with kang haeng.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there's any data that supports this. The table has columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner.\n\nLet me go through each row to find relevant information. \n\nRow 0: outcome is \"world championships\", which doesn't seem related.\nRow 1: outcome is \"3\", but the event is \"wd\". Not directly related to Asian Games or Hwang Sun's participation in 1982.\nRow 2: outcome is \"asian games\", so this could be relevant. Let's check details.\n- The event is \"asian games\", which matches part of the claim.\n- Year is 1982, which is mentioned in the claim.\n- Venue is \"new delhi , india\". Not sure if that matters for the specific event but it's a match.\n- Partner is \"kang haeng - suk\", which is also in the claim. So this row seems directly related.\n\nRow 3: outcome is \"other open tournaments\", not relevant.\nRow 4: outcome is \"1\" with event \"wd\". Not directly relevant to Asian Games.\nRow 5: outcome is \"india open\", and year is 1985, which doesn't match the claim's 1982.\n\nSo focusing on row 2: it mentions the Asian Games in 1982 with Kang Haeng as partner. The claim states Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in a specific event (double women's double) and finished first. \n\nWait, in the table, under \"event\" for row 2, it just says \"asian games\". It doesn't specify the exact event or position. So does that mean we can't confirm the exact event type or the finish? The claim mentions \"double woman's double event\", which isn't specified here.\n\nAlso, the outcome column in row 2 is \"asian games\", but usually, outcomes would be more specific like first place. So maybe it's not directly supporting the finish position.\n\nHmm, so while there's a match in the year and partner, the table doesn't specify the event type or that she finished first. Therefore, the claim might not be fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1985 india open finish first 2 year after win the asian game.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n1. Hwang Sun partners with Kang Haeng.\n2. This happens at the 1985 India Open.\n3. They finished first, specifically in the top two positions (since \"finish first 2\" implies a top two).\n4. This occurred two years after they won the Asian Games.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each part of the claim against the data provided.\n\nStarting with the partners: In the table, under the 'partner' column, there are entries like \"kang haeng - suk\". It seems likely that \"kang haeng\" is Kang Haeng. So, Hwang Sun might be another name or a typo for Kang Haeng - Suk? Or maybe they're referring to different individuals. Wait, in row 2 and 4, the partner is \"kang haeng - suk\", so it's possible that both Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng are partners.\n\nNext, looking at the events: The claim mentions the 1985 India Open. In the table, I see an entry for 'India open' in row 6, which is in the venue column as \"india open\". So that part checks out.\n\nRegarding finishing first or second: In the table, there's a cell with value '1', which indicates they came in first or second. For example, row 2 has outcome '3' and row 4 also has '1'. The claim says they finished first two, so perhaps '1' represents first place, and '3' might be third. So the '1's indicate top positions.\n\nLastly, the timing: Two years after winning the Asian Games. In the table, there are entries for Asian Games in row 0, but that seems to have a status of 'asian games'. The claim says they won the Asian Game, so looking at the outcome column, row 2 has outcome '3' which might not be a win, while row 1 and 5 have outcomes '1', indicating wins. Wait, no, the first row (row 0) seems to list 'asian games' as an event with outcome 'asian games'. The other rows: row 1 is Asian Games with outcome '1'; row 2 is world championships with outcome '3'; row 3 is Asian Games again but outcome '1', so perhaps that's a win. So, the claim says they won the Asian Game, which would correspond to an outcome of '1'. \n\nNow, putting it together: They won the Asian Game in 1982 (row 4's year is 1982) and then two years later, in 1985, they participated in the India Open (venue 'india open'), finishing first (outcome '1') with their partner Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nSo, checking the relevant cells:\n- The partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, which is in row 2, column 'partner' and row 4, same column.\n- The event is India Open in row 6, venue column.\n- The outcome is '1' in row 6, outcome column.\n- The year 1985 is in row 6, year column.\n- They won the Asian Game in 1982, which would be another relevant cell. However, looking at the table, the 1982 entry for Asian Games has partner Kang Haeng - Suk as well.\n\nWait, but in row 1, the event is 'wd' (world championships), and the outcome is '3'. So that might not be the Asian Game win. The actual Asian Game win is in row 4: outcome '1', year 1982, partner Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nSo, the cells to check are:\n\n- Partner: rows 2 and 4, column 'partner' (both have Kang Haeng - Suk)\n- Outcome: row 6, column 'outcome' (value 1)\n- Venue: row 6, column 'venue' (India Open)\n- Year: row 6, column 'year' (1985)\n- Asian Game win: row 4, outcome '1'\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells include rows where they won the Asian Games and then participated in India Open two years later.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The partners Kang Haeng - Suk participated in the 1985 India Open, finishing first (outcome '1'), two years after winning the Asian Games in 1982.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"With her partner kang haeng , hwang sun finish in the top 3 at 3 different venue from 1982 to 1985.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components. \n\n1. **Partner**: The claim mentions \"kang haeng\". Looking at the table, under the 'partner' column, there are entries like \"kang haeng - suk\" and others. So, the partner in question is likely \"kang haeng - suk\".\n\n2. **Hwang Sun**: The claim refers to \"hwang sun\". I need to check if this person exists in the table. Scanning through the 'partner' column, I see \"kang haeng - suk\" but not \"hwang sun.\" This is a bit confusing because perhaps there's a typo or different naming convention. Maybe \"hwang sun\" is another name for \"kang haeng - suk,\" or maybe it's a separate individual not listed here.\n\n3. **Top 3 Finish**: The claim states they finished in the top 3. Looking at the table, under the 'outcome' column, I see values like \"world championships,\" \"3,\" \"asian games,\" \"1,\" and others. It seems that some outcomes are numerical, like \"3\" or \"1.\" So, it's possible that these numbers represent their finishing positions.\n\n4. **Different Venues**: The claim mentions three different venues from 1982 to 1985. In the table, the 'venue' column lists locations like \"calgary , canada,\" \"new delhi , india,\" \"india open,\" and others. I need to check if there are at least three distinct venues in this period.\n\nNow, let's look at each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**: outcome is \"world championships,\" which seems to be an event name, not a numerical position. Venue is also \"world championships,\" which might mean it's not a specific location but the name of the event itself.\n  \n- **Row 2**: outcome is \"3.\" Partner is \"kang haeng - suk.\" Year is 1985. Venue is \"calgary , canada.\" So, this seems like a relevant row because it has a numerical outcome and matches the partner's name.\n\n- **Row 3**: outcome is \"asian games,\" which again might be an event name. Venue is \"asian games,\" same as the event.\n  \n- **Row 4**: outcome is \"1.\" Partner is \"kang haeng - suk.\" Year is 1982. Venue is \"new delhi , india.\"\n  \n- **Row 5**: outcome is \"other open tournaments.\" Not relevant unless it's a numerical position, which it isn't here.\n  \n- **Row 6**: outcome is \"1.\" Partner is \"kang haeng - suk.\" Year is 1985. Venue is \"india open.\"\n\nSo, from the table, the rows that have numerical outcomes and match the partner name are:\n\n- Row 2: outcome 3 at Calgary in 1985.\n- Row 4: outcome 1 at New Delhi in 1982.\n- Row 6: outcome 1 at India Open in 1985.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"three different venues.\" Let's list the venues from these rows:\n\n- Calgary, Canada (Row 2)\n- New Delhi, India (Row 4)\n- India Open (Row 6)\n\nAssuming \"india open\" is a venue, that makes three distinct venues: Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open. So, there are indeed three different venues.\n\nHowever, the claim also mentions \"hwang sun.\" If \"hwang sun\" is not present in any partner column, then perhaps this part isn't fully supported. The table only mentions \"kang haeng - suk,\" so if \"hwang sun\" is a separate individual not listed, that could make the claim false because it's about their performance, but the name might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"hwang sun\" is another name for \"kang haeng - suk.\" If that's the case, then the partner part is satisfied.\n\nLooking back at the rows:\n\n- Rows 2,4,6 all have \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner. So, if \"hwang sun\" is another name for this person, it's covered. But if \"hwang sun\" is a different individual not listed in the table, then the claim would be incorrect.\n\nThe problem is that the claim specifically mentions \"hwang sun,\" but the table has \"kang haeng - suk.\" Without confirmation that they're the same person, this part could be an issue. But maybe it's a typo or variation of the name.\n\nAssuming that \"hwang sun\" refers to \"kang haeng - suk,\" then the partner condition is met. So, considering all three relevant rows and their outcomes, we have:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1985: Calgary and India Open\n\nWait, but from the table, in 1985, there are two entries for kang haeng - suk: one at Calgary (Row 2) with outcome 3, and another at India Open (Row 6) with outcome 1. So actually, in 1985, they had two different venues where they finished top 3.\n\nSo, from 1982 to 1985, kang haeng - suk (assuming hwang sun is the same) participated in:\n\n- New Delhi in 1982: outcome 1\n- Calgary in 1985: outcome 3\n- India Open in 1985: outcome 1\n\nThat's three different venues where they finished top 3 (1, 3, 1). So the claim seems to be supported.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue if \"hwang sun\" isn't the same person. But without more information, I have to assume that it is, given that the partner column doesn't list any other partners matching the name.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Partner: kang haeng - suk (assuming hwang sun is them)\n- Outcomes: 3, 1, 1 in different venues\n- Venues: Calgary, New Delhi, India Open\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and determine which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"hwang sun partner with asian game 5 time at tournament\". That seems a bit confusing. Maybe it means Hwang Sun partnered with Asian Games five times at various tournaments. I need to parse that.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. The rows have data for different events like world championships, asian games, etc., years, places, and partners.\n\nI notice there's a pattern in the table where sometimes 'asian games' is listed as an outcome, and other times it's just '1' under the outcome column. Wait, that might be a problem. For example, the first row after the headers has 'world championships' repeated in all columns, which doesn't make much sense because each column should have different data.\n\nThen, looking at the rows:\n- The second row has outcome as '3', event 'wd', year 1985, venue Calgary, partner Kang Haeng - suk.\n- Third row: outcome 'asian games', but the next columns are all 'asian games' again, which seems incorrect. Probably a mistake because each column should have unique data.\n\nWait, perhaps it's an issue with how the table is structured. Maybe the repetition indicates different aspects of the event? Not sure. But let's look for rows where 'asian games' is in any relevant column that might tie to Hwang Sun partnering multiple times.\n\nLooking for instances where 'Kang Haeng - suk' is the partner, as that seems like a name that could be Hwang Sun or similar. In row 2, the partner is Kang Haeng - suk. Row 4 has same partner at India Open in 1985. So, perhaps that's two instances where this person partnered with 'asian games'?\n\nWait, but looking at the outcomes: rows have outcomes as either events like world championships or asian games, or sometimes just numbers like 1 or 3. Maybe the numbers represent something else, like rankings or participation count? Not sure.\n\nThe claim mentions \"partnered with Asian Games five times.\" So we need to see if there are five instances where Hwang Sun partnered with Asian Games at tournaments. But in the table, I can only spot two entries (rows 2 and 4) where 'Kang Haeng - suk' is the partner. Unless 'asian games' is a recurring event across different years and venues.\n\nBut wait, looking at the 'event' column, for row 3: outcome is 'asian games', but then the event column also says 'asian games'. Similarly, in row 1, outcome is 'world championships', and so on. It seems like sometimes the same term is repeated, which might be a formatting error.\n\nSo maybe each row represents a different event or instance where someone partnered with an Asian Games tournament. If that's the case, then Hwang Sun (assuming he's Kang Haeng - suk) partnered twice: once in 1985 Calgary and once in 1985 India Open. But the claim says five times, which isn't supported by the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'asian games' is being used incorrectly. The 'event' column has entries like 'wd' (world championships), but some rows have 'asian games' as the event. Maybe that's a different context.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me clarify:\n\n- outcome: seems to be the name of the event or result.\n- event: possibly another term for the same thing?\n- year: obvious\n- venue: where it was held\n- partner: who partnered with whom?\n\nBut the repetition in rows makes it confusing. For example, row 3 has all columns as 'asian games', which seems off. Maybe that's a mistake.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 2: outcome=3, event=wd, year=1985, venue=Calgary, partner=Kang Haeng - suk\n\nRow 4: outcome=1, event=wd, year=1985, venue=India Open, partner=Kang Haeng - suk\n\nSo in these two rows, the partner is Kang Haeng - suk. The claim says \"partnered with Asian Games five times.\" If 'asian games' is considered an event that happened multiple times, perhaps each row represents a separate instance. But the table doesn't show enough instances for five.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the outcome column indicate something like count or number of times. Row 2 has outcome=3 and row 4 has outcome=1. Not sure how that ties to Asian Games.\n\nBut the key is the partner: Kang Haeng - suk. If Hwang Sun is the same as Kang Haeng - suk, then there are two instances where he partnered with events related to Asian Games (assuming 'asian games' in row 3 and 'wd' refers to world championships, but that doesn't make sense).\n\nWait, perhaps 'wd' stands for World Disability? Or maybe it's an abbreviation. Alternatively, maybe the event column has typos or inconsistencies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each occurrence of 'asian games' is a different partnership. But in row 3, all columns are 'asian games', so perhaps that's one instance where the outcome was Asian Games and partnered with someone (Kang Haeng - suk). Then in row 4, another instance where he partnered with Asian Games again.\n\nSo maybe total instances where Kang Haeng - suk partnered with Asian Games is two. But the claim says five times, which isn't supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are not five instances of Hwang Sun partnering with Asian Games at tournaments based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun partnered with Asian Games five times at tournaments, but the table only shows two relevant entries where Kang Haeng - suk (possibly Hwang Sun) was a partner. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the given claim about Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng for the first time at the 1982 World Championship in the India Open is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components:\n\n1. **Partners**: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng.\n2. **Event**: 1982 World Championship.\n3. **Venue**: India Open.\n4. **Action**: First time partnering.\n\nNext, I'll look at the HTML table to see if there's any data that matches these points.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- **Row 0**: All columns are \"world championships\", which doesn't match the event in question (1982 World Championship).\n  \n- **Row 1**:\n  - Outcome: 3\n  - Event: wd\n  - Year: 1985\n  - Venue: Calgary, Canada\n  - Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n  \n  This row seems to be about a different year and venue, so it doesn't fit.\n\n- **Row 2**: All columns are \"asian games\", which is irrelevant here.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Outcome: 1\n  - Event: wd\n  - Year: 1982\n  - Venue: New Delhi, India\n  - Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n  \n  This row mentions the year 1982 and the venue as \"New Delhi, India\". The partner is Kang Haeng - Suk. However, the event here is labeled as \"wd\", which might stand for \"world championship\" or another event.\n\n- **Row 4**: All columns are \"other open tournaments\".\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Outcome: 1\n  - Event: wd\n  - Year: 1985\n  - Venue: India Open\n  - Partner: Kang Haeng - Suk\n  \n  This row is about the year 1985 and the venue as \"India Open\". The partner is again Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nNow, analyzing each relevant cell:\n\n- **Year 1982**: Looking at Row 3, the event is labeled as \"wd\", which might not explicitly say \"world championship\". However, given that Hwang Sun's first partnership with Kang Haeng in 1982 is mentioned, it's likely that this row is referring to the World Championship. The venue here is New Delhi, India, but the claim mentions the India Open, which is a specific tournament.\n\n- **Venue**: The claim specifies \"India Open\", and Row 5 has the venue as \"India Open\". So, this matches.\n\nPutting it together: In 1982 (Row 3), Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng - Suk at the World Championship in New Delhi. However, the claim mentions the India Open in 1982. Wait, but Row 3 is about 1982, and the venue is New Delhi, not the India Open.\n\nLooking back, Row 5 is about 1985, which is a different year than the claim's 1982. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"first time at the 1982 world championship in the india open\". But the table doesn't have an entry for the India Open in 1982. Instead, Row 3 is about New Delhi, India, and Row 5 is about the India Open but in 1985.\n\nSo there's no data in the table that explicitly mentions Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng at the India Open in 1982. The only relevant rows are Row 3 (1982, New Delhi) and Row 5 (1985, India Open). Since the claim refers to 1982 and the India Open, but the table doesn't have a matching row for that specific event and year, it seems like the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1982 new delhi , india finish first 2 year after win the world championship.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its key components:\n\n1. **Partners**: Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng.\n2. **Event Location**: The event took place in New Delhi, India in 1982.\n3. **Outcome**: They finished first (2 years after winning the world championship).\n\nNow, I'll examine each part against the table.\n\nStarting with the partners: In the table, under the 'partner' column, there are multiple entries. Looking at row 1, it says \"kang haeng - suk\". Assuming that \"suk\" is a typo or additional name, but the main partner here is Kang Haeng. Hwang Sun's partnerships aren't explicitly listed in the provided rows, so I need to check if any row mentions both Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng as partners.\n\nNext, the event location: The claim specifies New Delhi, India in 1982. Looking at the table's 'venue' column, there's a row (row 1) that says \"new delhi , india.\" This matches the location.\n\nThe outcome part mentions finishing first two years after winning the world championship. In the table, under the 'outcome' column, the numbers are 3 and 1. It also mentions \"world championships,\" which is in row 0, but the outcomes are numerical, not explicitly stating first place. \n\nNow, checking for Hwang Sun: There's no mention of Hwang Sun anywhere in the table. The partners listed are Kang Haeng - Suk and others. Without Hwang Sun present, it's unclear if he was involved.\n\nPutting this together: The claim refers to both Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng as partners at a specific event in 1982 New Delhi with a certain outcome. However, the table doesn't mention Hwang Sun partnering with anyone, including Kang Haeng, at that location or year. It does have an entry for New Delhi in 1982 but without Hwang Sun listed as a partner.\n\nTherefore, since there's no evidence in the table supporting all parts of the claim, especially regarding Hwang Sun being present, I conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Hwang Sun is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"in 1985 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman's double event , finish second , 2 of 3 time she win an event with kang haeng\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key components of the claim:\n1. Year: 1985\n2. Event: Asian Games (specifically, the \"double women's double\" event)\n3. Finish: Second place\n4. Partnership: With Kang Haeng\n5. Achievement: Hwang Sun won 2 out of 3 events with Kang Haeng.\n\nNow, I'll analyze the HTML table to see if these points are supported.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an outcome with details about the event, year, venue, and partner. The columns relevant here are 'year', 'event', and 'partner'.\n\nStarting with the year 1985: Scanning through the rows, I find two rows for 1985:\n- Row 2 (index 1): Outcome is \"wd\", year is 1985.\n- Row 5 (index 4): Outcome is \"1\", year is 1985.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them again:\n\nRows are from index 0 to 5.\n\nRow 0: year not specified (all cells are \"world championships\")\nRow 1: year 1985\nRow 2: outcome \"asian games\" with year not specified\nRow 3: outcome \"other open tournaments\"\nRow 4: year 1985\nRow 5: outcome \"india open\"\n\nSo, in row 1 (index 1), the event is \"wd\", and in row 4 (index 4), the event is \"india open\". The term \"asian games\" isn't explicitly mentioned here. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, looking at row 2: outcome is \"asian games\", but the year is not specified as 1985. So perhaps in 1985, Hwang Sun participated in other events besides Asian Games.\n\nBut the claim says she participated in the Asian Games in 1985. Since the table doesn't explicitly show her participating in the Asian Games in 1985, maybe that's a point against the claim.\n\nWait, actually, row 1 is for \"wd\" (maybe short for world doubles?), and row 4 is India Open. The Asian Games would be another event, but in 1985, did she participate? There might not be an entry here, so perhaps the table doesn't mention her in the Asian Games that year.\n\nNext, looking at partners: Kang Haeng is mentioned in rows 1,3, and4. So in 1982 and 1985, she partnered with him.\n\nThe claim states that in 1985, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games (specifically women's doubles), finished second, and this was 2 out of 3 times she won an event with Kang Haeng.\n\nBut from the table, I see that in 1985 (row1 and row4), she did partner with Kang Haeng, but it doesn't specify if they participated in the Asian Games or another event. Row4's event is \"india open\", so perhaps not the Asian Games.\n\nAlso, there's no entry for the Asian Games in 1985 where she finished second. The claim refers to the specific event as \"double women's double,\" which might correspond to a particular competition like the Asian Games.\n\nAnother point: the table shows two instances in 1985 where she won (row1 outcome is \"wd\", but I'm not sure if that's a win or not). Wait, row1 has outcome \"3\" and row4 has \"1\". The claim says she won 2 out of 3 events. But it's unclear from the table how many times she actually won.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers in the 'outcome' column represent points or results. For example, \"3\" might mean she came third, while \"1\" could be a win. If that's the case, then row1: 3 (third place), and row4: 1 (win). So in 1985, she won once with Kang Haeng.\n\nBut the claim says she won twice that year. That would mean another event where she won, but according to the table, there are only two events in 1985 where she partnered with him, and one of them was a win.\n\nMoreover, the claim mentions the Asian Games, which isn't explicitly listed for 1985. The table doesn't show her participating in the Asian Games that year, only in \"wd\" and \"india open\".\n\nPutting this together: The table shows Hwang Sun participated with Kang Haeng in two events in 1985 (rows1 and4), winning one of them. But it doesn't mention her participating in the Asian Games in 1985 or finishing second there. Therefore, the claim's details about the event and finish position aren't fully supported by the table.\n\nAdditionally, the table might not include all her events, so we can't be sure if she won twice with Kang Haeng that year. She only has one win noted.\n\nThus, the claim isn't entirely supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"With her partner Kang Haeng, Hwang Sun finish first at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking for. It mentions two people: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng. Wait, actually, in the table, there's a column called \"partner\" which has values like \"kang haeng - suk\". So maybe \"Kang Haeng\" is the partner. The claim says they finish first at 3 different venues from 1982 to 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each row to see if it relates to Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng finishing first at three different venues in those years.\n\nWait, the table has a column named \"outcome\" with values like \"world championships\", \"3\", \"asian games\", etc. There's also a \"year\" column. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: outcome is \"world championships\", event is \"world championships\", year is \"world championships\". Hmm, the years are probably numbers. Wait, in row 1, year is 1985, which is a number. So maybe the first row has text \"world championships\" instead of a number, but perhaps it's representing an event type.\n\nRow 2: outcome is \"asian games\", same as others. Doesn't seem relevant unless Hwang Sun participated in Asian Games.\n\nRow 3: outcome is \"1\". Year is 1982. Venue is New Delhi, India. Partner is Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nRow 4: other open tournaments, not relevant unless it's one of the three.\n\nRow 5: outcome is \"1\", year 1985, venue India Open, partner same as above.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to Hwang Sun and her partner finishing first at 3 different venues from 1982-1985. So I need to find entries where outcome is 1 (since they finished first), partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, and year is between 1982-1985.\n\nLooking at row 1: outcome is \"world championships\", event wd, year 1985, venue Calgary, partner Kang Haeng. But wait, the outcome here is text, not a number. So maybe in this context, \"3\" refers to the outcome code or position? Or perhaps it's indicating they finished third?\n\nAlternatively, row 1 has outcome as \"world championships\", which might be an event category, but that doesn't directly indicate finishing first.\n\nRow 3: outcome is \"1\", year 1982. So this could be a first-place finish by someone with partner Kang Haeng at New Delhi venue.\n\nRow 5: outcome \"1\", year 1985, venue India Open, same partner. So two instances where they finished first in different venues in those years.\n\nBut wait, the claim says three different venues from 1982 to 1985. So we need three rows where outcome is 1, partner is Kang Haeng - Suk, and years between 1982-1985 inclusive.\n\nLooking at row 3: 1982, New Delhi\n\nRow 5: 1985, India Open\n\nIs there another one? Let's see if any other rows meet the criteria. Row 4 has outcome \"1\", but the event is \"other open tournaments\". Maybe that counts as a third venue.\n\nWait, row 4: outcome is 1, year 1985, venue other open tournaments, partner same. So in 1985, there are two venues: India Open and other open tournaments. But the time period from 1982 to 1985 includes 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985.\n\nIn row 3: 1982\n\nRow 5: 1985\n\nRow 4: 1985, but is that a different venue? Yes, India Open vs. other open tournaments.\n\nBut does the table have another first-place finish in 1983 or 1984?\n\nLooking through the rows, I don't see any others. The only rows with outcome \"1\" are row 3 (1982), row 4 (1985 as other open), and row 5 (1985 as India Open). So that's two venues: New Delhi in 1982 and two in 1985.\n\nWait, but the claim says three different venues. So unless I'm missing a third instance where they finished first with Kang Haeng.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps row 1 is a first-place finish? But outcome there is \"world championships\" which might not be numerical. However, in row 1, partner is same, year 1985, but outcome isn't a number; it's text. So maybe that doesn't count as a finish position.\n\nSo with the given data, only two venues where they finished first: New Delhi in 1982 and two different venues in 1985 (India Open and other open tournaments). That makes two venues, not three.\n\nTherefore, the claim is saying there are three different venues. Since the table shows only two, the claim would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains data about various events with outcomes, years, venues, and partners. The claim states that Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng finished first at three different venues between 1982 and 1985. \n\nUpon examining the table:\n- In 1982 (row 3), they finished first at New Delhi.\n- In 1985, there are two entries: one at India Open (row 5) and another at other open tournaments (row 4). However, row 1's outcome is \"world championships\" without a numerical value, so it doesn't count as a finish position.\n\nThis results in only two venues where they finished first within the specified timeframe. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
