    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the introductory phrase for episode 794 be none.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the table data. The key elements are \"episode 794,\" \"introductory phrase,\" and whether it's \"none.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode with various details like the introductory phrase. So, I need to find the specific row for episode number 794.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row is episode 791. Not relevant.\n2. Next is episode 794. That's our target row.\n3. Then there's episode 795, which isn't needed.\n4. Similarly, episodes 796, 798, and 801 are irrelevant to this claim.\n\nNow, focusing on episode 794 (row index 1 in the tbody). The relevant columns for the claim are \"introductory phrase.\" So I'll check the value under that column for row 794.\n\nFrom the table, the introductory phrase for episode 794 is listed as \"none.\" That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim align with the data in the relevant cells, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because the introductory phrase for episode 794 is indeed none.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"introductory phrase\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim says: \"the episode with salvatore giunta as a guest originally aired on november 18.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two key pieces of information: the guest's name (Salvatore Giunta) and the original airdate (November 18). My goal is to find cells in the table that correspond to these two pieces of information.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are episode number, the w\u00e3rd, guest, introductory phrase, original airdate, and production code. The rows represent different episodes with their respective details.\n\nI'll start by locating the row where the guest is Salvatore Giunta. Scanning each row's guest column:\n\n- Row 1: David Frum, Katrina Vanden Heuvel\n- Row 2: Reza Aslan\n- Row 3: Abbe Lowell, Cee Lo Green\n- Row 4: Beri Fox, Martha Stewart\n- Row 5: Jeffrey Goldberg, David Stern\n- Row 6: Salvatore Giunta\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 6 (index starts from 0, so it's actually row index 6).\n\nNext, I check the original airdate for this episode. In row 6, under the \"original airdate\" column, it says November 18.\n\nNow, comparing this to the claim: The claim states that the episode with Salvatore Giunta as a guest originally aired on November 18. Both pieces of information are present in the table. The guest is indeed Salvatore Giunta, and the original airdate matches November 18.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data, so it's true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"guest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about an HTML table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has several columns: episode, the w\u00e3rd, guest, introductory phrase, original airdate, and production code. There's also a specific claim to check.\n\nThe claim is: \"episode 798 air on november 15.\" I need to verify if this is true by checking the relevant cells in the table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate the row corresponding to episode 798. Looking at the table, each row starts with an episode number. Scanning through, I see that there's a row for episode 798. So, row index 5 (since it's zero-indexed) is the one we're interested in.\n\nNext, I need to find which columns are relevant. The claim mentions two things: the episode number and the airdate. So, I should look at the \"episode\" column to confirm it's 798 and the \"original airdate\" column to see if it's November 15.\n\nStarting with the \"episode\" column, in row index 5, the value is indeed 798. That checks out.\n\nNow, checking the \"original airdate\" column for that same row. The entry is \"november 15,\" which matches the claim's date of November 15. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nI don't think any other columns are relevant here because the claim only specifies episode number and airdate, not the guest or production code, for example.\n\nTherefore, since both conditions in the claim are met by the table, the answer should be TRUE.

It has columns: episode, the w\u00e3rd, guest, introductory phrase, original airdate, and production code. The rows represent different episodes.\n\nThe claim states that episode 794 is the only one without an introductory phrase. So I need to check each row corresponding to episode 794 and see if others have a value in the \"introductory phrase\" column or not.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For episode 794 (row index 1), the \"introductory phrase\" cell is \"none\".\n- Now, I should check other rows to see if any have \"none\" in that column as well. If there are more than one with \"none\", then the claim would be false.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Episode 791: Introductory phrase is \"shaka brah! this is the colbert report!\", so not none.\n2. Episode 794: None, as per the claim.\n3. Episode 795: None in introductory phrase.\n4.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about an episode is true or false based on the provided HTML table and then identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the episode that aired on November 15 has a production code of 6149.\" So, the claim makes two assertions:\n1. The episode was aired on November 15.\n2. The production code associated with this episode is 6149.\n\nNext, I need to check each part of the claim against the table provided. To do this, I'll look at the 'original airdate' and 'production code' columns because they directly relate to the two assertions in the claim.\n\nLooking through the table row by row:\n\n- The first row (row 0) has an original airdate of November 02 and a production code of 6139.\n- Row 1: November 08, 6142.\n- Row 2: November 09, 6143.\n- Row 3: November 10, 6144.\n- Row 4: November 15, 6146. Hmm, here's an episode aired on November 15 with a production code of 6146, not 6149.\n- Row 5: November 18, 6149.\n\nSo, there is no episode on November 15 with production code 6149. Instead, the episode on November 15 has code 6146, and the one on November 18 has 6149.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'original airdate' for November 15 is in row 4 (index 4) under the 'original airdate' column. The production code associated with that date is 6146, so the 'production code' cell in row 4 is also relevant.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no episode on November 15 with production code 6149.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"episode 791 , with salvatore giunta as a guest , originally air on november 18\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and map it to the relevant columns in the table.\n\nThe claim has three main parts:\n1. Episode number: 791\n2. Guest: Salvatore Giunta\n3. Original airdate: November 18\n\nI need to check if these details match any row in the table.\n\nStarting with the episode number, I'll look for a row where \"episode\" is 791. From the table, the first row has episode 791. So that's our starting point.\n\nNext, checking the guest column. In the first row, the guests are listed as david frum and katrina vanden heuvel. Wait, but the claim mentions Salvatore Giunta as the guest. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh no, in the table, the first row's guests are indeed David Frum and Katrina Vanden Heuvel. There's no mention of Salvatore Giunta there.\n\nWait, but looking further down, there is a row with episode 801 where the guest is Salvatore Giunta. So that doesn't match episode 791 at all. That means in the claim, it's saying episode 791 has Salvatore Giunta as a guest, which isn't correct based on the table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading something. Let me check each row again. The first row is episode 791 with guests David Frum and Katrina Vanden Heuvel. The sixth row is episode 801 with Salvatore Giunta. So the claim about episode 791 having him as a guest is incorrect.\n\nNow, checking the airdate. In the first row, the original airdate is November 02. But the claim says November 18. That's a different date, so that doesn't match either.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim is saying that episode 791 had Salvatore Giunta as a guest and originally aired on November 18. Looking at the table:\n\n- Episode 791 has guests David Frum and Katrina Vanden Heuvel.\n- Airdate is November 02, not November 18.\n- Episode 801 (not 791) has Salvatore Giunta as a guest.\n\nTherefore, none of the cells in the claim match correctly. So the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the claim is incorrectly referencing the episode number and airdate for the wrong episode. Or maybe there's an error in how the guests are listed. Let me double-check each part to be sure.\n\nEpisode 791: Guests - David Frum, Katrina Vanden Heuvel; Airdate - November 02.\nSo none of these match the claim's numbers or guest.\n\nEpisode 801: Guest is Salvatore Giunta; Airdate isn't specified in the table beyond November something. Wait, in the table, episode 801's airdate is November 18. That matches the claim, but it's for a different episode number.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly combines the airdate from episode 801 with the wrong episode number and guest.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not correctly match any row in the table. The episode number, guest, and airdate do not align with the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"episode\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"guest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
