    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that among all the songs titled \"dead guys remix,\" only one of them isn't from the year 2003. So, my task is to check each row where the song is listed as a remix and see how many are not in 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the \"song\" column for any entry that includes \"dead guys remix.\" The claim specifies that only one such song isn't in 2003. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row (row_index 0):** Song is \"good boys,\" which is under \"dead guys remix.\" The year here is 2003.\n2. **Second Row (row_index 1):** Song is \"locking down,\" also a \"dead guys remix.\" Year is 2003.\n3. **Third Row (row_index 2):** Song is \"wonder,\" another \"dead guys remix.\" Year remains 2003.\n4. **Fourth Row (row_index 3):** Song is \"can't resist,\" part of the \"dead guys remix.\" Year is 2005, which isn't 2003.\n5. **Fifth Row (row_index 4):** The song here is \"turn it up\" by pixie lott. It's a \"dee - lux remix,\" not a \"dead guys remix.\" So, this doesn't apply to the claim.\n6. **Sixth Row (row_index 5):** Song is \"party like ur 18 feat sway,\" which is a \"dee - lux remix\" as well. Again, not relevant to the \"dead guys remix.\"\n\nSo, out of all the entries in the \"song\" column where the song is a \"dead guys remix,\" only one entry (row_index 3) isn't from 2003. It's from 2005. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this verification. The relevant cells are those where the song is listed as part of the \"dead guys remix\" and have a year not equal to 2003. In this case, only row_index 3 meets that criterion because its year is 2005.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each row where the song is \"dead guys remix.\" Only one such entry isn't in 2003 (2005). The relevant cells are those with \"song\" as \"dead guys remix\" and a non-2003 year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this decision.\n\nThe claim says: \"only 1 of the artist list from the remix dead guy remix have the name of a state.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns here are 'artist' and 'remix'. Specifically, the 'remix' column has entries like 'dead guys remix', 'dee - lux remix', etc.\n\nThe claim is about artists in the 'remix' list that have a state name as their artist name. So I need to check each 'artist' whose remix might relate to them being a state name.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row has 'blondie' as the artist and 'dead guys remix' as the remix.\n2. The second row is 'chicane'.\n3. Third row: 'lamb'.\n4. Fourth row: 'texas'.\n5. Fifth row: 'pixie lott'.\n6. Sixth row: 'perry mystique'.\n\nNow, for each artist, I need to see if the name itself corresponds to a state's name. \n\n- 'blondie' doesn't seem like a state.\n- 'chicane' isn't a state either.\n- 'lamb' isn't a state.\n- 'texas' is the U.S. state of Texas, so that counts as one.\n- 'pixie lott' isn't a state.\n- 'perry mystique' doesn't match any state name I know.\n\nSo only the fourth row's artist, 'texas', matches a state name.\n\nNow, checking the relevant cells: for each row where the artist might be related to a state, which in this case is only row 3 (since row indices start at 0). The column is 'artist' because that's where the names are listed.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include the row index 3 and the column name 'artist'.\n</think>\n\nTo verify if \"only 1 of the artist list from the remix dead guy remix have the name of a state,\" we check each artist in the 'remix' cells. Only 'texas' matches a state.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\"\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim to understand what it's saying. It seems like it's talking about the year 2005 and suggests that in that year, there was only one song, meaning no multiple songs. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit confusing. \"Do not have multiple song\" implies that in 2005, there were no multiple songs, but looking at the table, I need to see how many songs are there per artist and year.\n\nNext, I'll look at each row of the table to check for years mentioned. The years present are 2003, 2005, and 2010. The claim specifically mentions 2005, so my focus should be on that year and whether it has multiple songs or just one.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- First three rows (rows 0,1,2) all have the year 2003.\n- The fourth row (row 3) is for 2005. It shows \"texas\" as the artist, \"can't resist\" as the song, and \"dead guys remix\" as the remix.\n- Then there are two more rows in 2010.\n\nSo, in 2005, there's only one song listed: \"can't resist.\" Now, I need to check if other years have multiple songs. The claim says that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs. So, for each other year (2003 and 2010), I should verify if they have multiple songs.\n\nFor 2003:\n\n- The first three rows are under 2003. Looking at each:\n  - First row: artist \"blondie\", song \"good boys\".\n  - Second row: artist \"chicane\", song \"locking down\".\n  - Third row: artist \"lamb\", song \"wonder\".\n\nSo, in 2003, there are three different songs, each with a different artist. Each of these entries has a remix column as well. So, yes, they have multiple songs.\n\nFor 2010:\n\n- The fifth and sixth rows are for 2010.\n  - Fifth row: artist \"pixie lott\", song \"turn it up\".\n  - Sixth row: artist \"perry mystique\", song \"party like ur 18 feat sway\".\n\nSo, in 2010, there are two songs as well.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs. But looking at the table, all years (2003, 2005, 2010) have multiple songs. Wait, no\u2014wait a second: 2005 has one song, and 2003 has three, 2010 has two.\n\nWait, but the claim says that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs, implying that all other years (like 2003 and 2010) have multiple songs. But in reality, 2005 does have a single song, while others have more than one.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because the claim's wording might be interpreted differently. It says \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" So, is it saying that 2005 is the only year where there's no multiple songs? That would mean in 2005, there was just one song, and all other years have multiple songs.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- 2003: three songs.\n- 2005: one song.\n- 2010: two songs.\n\nSo, yes, 2005 is the only year with a single song. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because it's stating that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs, which aligns with the data.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if \"multiple song\" refers to more than one song or exactly two songs. The term \"multiple\" typically means more than one. So, any year with more than one song would satisfy having multiple songs. Therefore, 2005 has only one song, so it doesn't have multiple. But wait, the claim says that 2005 is the only ear without multiple songs. That would mean all other years (2003 and 2010) do have multiple songs.\n\nLooking at 2003: three songs, which definitely have multiple. 2010: two songs, so yes. Therefore, the claim is true because 2005 is the only year without multiple songs, while others do.\n\nWait again\u2014I'm now a bit confused. The user's initial analysis said to check if 2005 has multiple songs or just one. So in row 3 (2005), there's only one song listed: \"can't resist\". So that would mean 2005 does not have multiple songs, making the claim true.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"multiple song.\" If it means more than one, then any year with one song doesn't have multiple. But if it refers to exactly two or more, then it's different. But generally, \"multiple\" implies more than one, so a single song wouldn't count as having multiple.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because 2005 is the only year without multiple songs.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis confirms that in 2005, there was only one song listed compared to other years which have multiple songs. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"there be 1 single song that be produce after 2003 that do not have an album title list.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's looking for a song produced after 2003 that doesn't have an album listed in its row of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has columns: year, artist, song, album, remix. The 'album' column seems to list the album titles. If there's no album listed, that might mean the song is a single track without an album associated with it.\n\nI'll go through each row where the year is after 2003. That would be rows from 2010 onwards because the latest year in the table is 2010.\n\nStarting with 2010:\n\n1. **Row 5**: \n   - Song: \"turn it up\"\n   - Album: \"turn it up\" (so there's an album)\n   \n2. **Row 6**:\n   - Song: \"party like ur 18 feat sway\"\n   - Album: \"n / a\" (no album listed)\n   \nSo, in row 6, the album is missing, which could mean no album title list exists for that song.\n\nNow, checking if there's only one such song. From the table, after 2003, only row 6 has an 'album' cell with \"n / a\". No other rows beyond 2003 have missing albums; the 2010 rows either have an album listed or not, but only one instance where it's missing.\n\nThus, there is exactly one song (\"party like ur 18 feat sway\") produced after 2003 without an album title list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"the song from dee - lux remix be performed by different artist but the song be all from the same year.\"\n\nSo, in simpler terms, it's saying that all songs remixed by \"dee - lux\" are performed by different artists each time, and all these remixes occur within the same year.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check two main points:\n\n1. **Different Artists for Each Remix**: For each row where the 'remix' column is \"dee - lux remix,\" I should verify that the 'artist' (column) is different from other rows with the same remix.\n2. **Same Year for All These Mixtures**: Ensure that all these remixes happen in the same year as specified in the claim.\n\nFirst, let's identify all rows where the 'remix' column is \"dee - lux remix.\" From the table:\n\n- Row 5: artist is pixie lott\n- Row 6: artist is perry mystique\n\nWait, looking back, I might have miscounted. Let me list out each row with their details.\n\nRows with 'remix' as \"dead guys remix\":\n- Rows 0,1,2,3: artists are blondie, chicane, lamb, texas\nRows with 'remix' as \"dee - lux remix\":\n- Row 4: artist is pixie lott\n- Row 5: artist is perry mystique\n\nWait, no. Looking at the table again:\n\nRow 0: dead guys remix, artist blondie\nRow1: dead guys remix, chicane\nRow2: dead guys remix, lamb\nRow3: dead guys remix, texas\nRow4: dee - lux remix, pixie lott\nRow5: dee - lux remix, perry mystique\n\nWait, no. Let me check the original table:\n\nLooking at the 'remix' column:\n- Row 0: dead guys remix\n- Row1: dead guys remix\n- Row2: dead guys remix\n- Row3: dead guys remix\n- Row4: dee - lux remix\n- Row5: dee - lux remix\n\nWait, no. The table shows:\n\nRow4: \"dee - lux remix\"\nRow5: \"dee - lux remix\"\n\nSo, the rows with 'remix' as \"dee - lux remix\" are rows 4 and 5.\n\nNow, for each of these two rows, we need to check if the artists are different from any other row in their respective years.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"the song from dee - lux remix be performed by different artist but the song be all from the same year.\" So, it's about the same song being remixed multiple times, each time by a different artist, and all within the same year.\n\nLooking at rows 4 and 5:\n\nRow4: year is 2010, artist pixie lott\nRow5: year is 2010, artist perry mystique\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. Wait, row4 is 2010, but row5's year is also 2010.\n\nSo, for the remix \"dee - lux remix,\" there are two entries in 2010, each by different artists: pixie lott and perry mystique. Therefore, it seems that for this remix, each artist is performing a different song, but all within the same year.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the 'song' column:\n\nRow4: song is \"turn it up\"\nRow5: song is \"party like ur 18 feat sway\"\n\nSo, two different songs. Therefore, each remix is for a different song, performed by different artists in the same year (2010). So that seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, let's check if all these remixes are from the same year. Yes, both rows4 and 5 are from 2010.\n\nNow, looking at other rows with 'remix' as \"dead guys remix,\" their years are:\n\nRow0: 2003\nRow1: 2003\nRow2: 2003\nRow3: 2005\n\nSo, the claim is only about \"dee - lux remix\" songs. The other remixes (dead guys) may not be relevant.\n\nThus, for the \"dee - lux remix,\" we have two entries in 2010, each with different artists and different songs. So, it seems that the claim holds true because all these remixes are from the same year and each is performed by a different artist.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant rows would be row4 and row5, specifically looking at 'year' and 'artist' columns.\n\nSo, in terms of JSON structure, the answer should be \"TRUE\" and the relevant_cells should include the details from these two rows for the specified columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all \"dee - lux remix\" songs are from the same year (2010) and performed by different artists.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" Hmm, let me parse this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim again. It's a bit confusing, so I need to break it down. It seems like the claim is saying that only one song from \"dee - lux\" is not present in 2005. Wait, no\u2014the phrasing is a bit off. Let me rephrase: Are there only one song that isn't from the year 2005 for \"dee - lux\"?\n\nLooking at the table, I see two rows where the artist is \"dee - lux.\" The first row is from 2010 with the song \"turn it up,\" and the second is also from 2010 with another track. So both songs are from 2010, not 2005.\n\nWait, but let me check all instances of \"dee - lux\" in the table. In the first four rows, there's a column called \"remix\" that has entries like \"dead guys remix,\" which doesn't seem to be \"dee - lux.\" Then in 2010, there are two rows where the remix is \"dee - lux remix.\" So those are the only \"dee - lux\" songs.\n\nSo for \"dee - lux,\" how many songs are not from 2005? Both are from 2010, so both are not from 2005. That would mean that there are two songs not in 2005, but the claim says only one is not. So the claim is false because it's stating only one song isn't in 2005, but actually, both are.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me check again: The \"year\" column shows when the song was released, right? So for \"dee - lux,\" both entries are from 2010, so they're not from 2005. Therefore, neither is present in 2005, meaning zero songs from \"dee - lux\" are in 2005. But the claim says only one is not, implying that there should be two or more.\n\nWait, no\u2014the wording of the claim is tricky. It says \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" So it's saying among the songs by \"dee - lux,\" only one isn't in 2005. But if both are from 2010, then none are from 2005, meaning all (two) are not in 2005, which contradicts the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is that among their songs, only one is not present in the 2005 album or something else. But looking at the table, for \"dee - lux,\" both are from 2010, so if we consider whether they're from 2005, none are.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the claim is saying that only one song from \"dee - lux\" isn't in their 2005 releases. But in the table, \"dee - lux\" doesn't have any entries for 2005. So all their songs (two) are not in 2005. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating only one isn't, but actually, both aren't.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the year 2003 have as many song as 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking.\n\nThe claim compares the number of songs in 2003 to that in 2005. So, I need to count how many songs each artist released in those years and then compare the totals.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various artists, their songs, albums, and remixes for different years: 2003, 2005, and others like 2010. The relevant columns for this task are \"year\", \"song\", and maybe \"album\" if needed, but since the claim is about song count, I'll focus on \"song\".\n\nFirst, I should extract all entries from 2003 and 2005.\n\nIn 2003:\n- Blondie: \"good boys\"\n- Chicane: \"locking down\"\n- Lamb: \"wonder\"\n\nSo that's 3 songs.\n\nIn 2005:\n- Texas: \"can't resist\"\n\nOnly one song listed.\n\nWait, but I should check if the same artist released multiple songs in a year. For example, if an artist has more than one entry in 2003 or 2005, each would count as separate songs.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nIn 2003:\n- Blondie: 1 song\n- Chicane: 1 song\n- Lamb: 1 song\n\nSo total for 2003 is 3.\n\nIn 2005:\n- Texas: 1 song. No other entries listed, so only one song.\n\nTherefore, the count of songs in 2003 is 3, and in 2005 it's 1. The claim says they have as many songs, but since 3 \u2260 1, the statement isn't true.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed some entries. Let me check again. For each year, list all songs.\n\n2003:\n- Blondie: \"good boys\"\n- Chicane: \"locking down\"\n- Lamb: \"wonder\"\n\nThat's three songs.\n\n2005:\n- Texas: \"can't resist\"\n\nOnly one song.\n\nSo yes, 3 vs 1. The claim is false.\n\nWait another thought: sometimes remixes might count as separate songs or variants of the same track. Looking at the 'remix' column:\n\nIn 2003, all entries have \"dead guys remix\", which suggests that each of those songs may be a remix version, possibly different enough to be considered distinct songs. So if we consider each song with a remix as a separate entry, then in 2003, there are three songs plus their remixes? But the 'song' column lists \"good boys\", \"locking down\", etc., so perhaps those are the base songs, and the remix is a different version.\n\nWait, no. The 'remix' column indicates that each of these entries has a remix. So for 2003:\n\n- Blondie's song: \"good boys\" - does this refer to the original or the remix? The 'song' column seems to list the base song, and the remix is a separate entry in the 'remix' column.\n\nSo perhaps each entry in the 'song' column is one song. So in 2003, three songs, and in 2005, one song.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'album' column could affect this, but I don't think so because the claim is about the number of songs per year, not albums.\n\nSo to sum up, 2003 has 3 songs, and 2005 has 1 song. Therefore, the claim that they have as many songs is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's about artists who are part of the \"dee - lux remix\" and whether only one of them has a name that corresponds to a U.S. state.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two entries where the \"remix\" column mentions \"dee - lux remix.\" These are rows 5 and 6 in the table. \n\nRow 5: Artist is Pixie Lott.\nRow 6: Artist is Perry Mystique.\n\nNow, I need to check if either of these artists' names corresponds to a U.S. state. I know that U.S. states have specific names like Alabama, California, Texas, etc. \n\nPixie Lott doesn't seem to match any state name. Perry Mystique also doesn't ring a bell as a state name. Wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there any state named after a person? Hmm, I recall that some states have names derived from Native American names or historical figures, but none that are exactly \"Pixie\" or \"Perry.\" \n\nLooking back at the table, in row 5, the artist is Pixie Lott. The song and album both just say \"turn it up,\" so no additional info there. In row 6, the artist is Perry Mystique, and the album is listed as N/A, which probably stands for Not Available or Not Applicable.\n\nSo, considering all this, neither of these artists' names corresponds to a U.S. state's name. Therefore, the claim that \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state\" is FALSE because neither matches a state name.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"there be 1 single artist that produce after 2005 that have an album title list.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions a single artist who produced after 2005 and has an album titled \"list,\" but it's a bit unclear. Maybe it means an artist who released an album with a specific title or perhaps something else.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are year, artist, song, album, and remix. I need to focus on the artists listed for years after 2005. The relevant rows are from 2010 onward because 2005 is mentioned as \"after 2005.\" So, any artist who released an album in 2010 or later.\n\nFrom the table:\n- In 2010, we have two artists: Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique.\n- Both of these artists' albums are listed. For example, Pixie Lott's album is \"turn it up,\" and Perry Mystique's album is listed as \"n / a,\" which might mean not available or not applicable.\n\nThe claim mentions \"album title list,\" so I'm guessing it refers to an album with a particular title. However, in the table, both artists have their albums named, but there's no indication of a specific list. Alternatively, maybe it means that after 2005, there's only one artist listed who released an album.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is saying that after 2005, there's exactly one artist with an album titled something specific or just that they have an album. But looking at the data, in 2010, two artists (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique) released albums. So if the claim says \"1 single artist,\" but there are two, then it would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It could mean that after 2005, one artist has an album with a certain title, like \"list.\" But in the table, neither album is titled \"list.\" Pixie Lott's album is \"turn it up,\" and Perry Mystique's is \"n / a.\"\n\nWait another angle: maybe the claim refers to only one artist who produced after 2005, regardless of the album title. If that's the case, then in 2010, there are two artists. So again, more than one.\n\nBut the claim says \"1 single artist,\" so it's looking for exactly one. Since there are two, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for an artist who produced after 2005 and has a specific album title, but in this table, both 2010 artists don't have such a title that matches \"list.\" So regardless of the count, the claim might be false because there's no single artist with an album named \"list\" or perhaps more than one artist.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that after 2005, multiple artists released albums, so the claim saying only one is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there is exactly one artist who produced an album after 2005. However, in 2010, two artists (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique) released albums, making the claim false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the claim first: \"the song from the dee - lux remix be performed by the same art and the song be from different year.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are two entries where the 'remix' column mentions 'dee - lux remix'. These are in rows 5 and 6. The claim is about songs from 'dee - lux remix' being performed by the same artist and from different years.\n\nFirst, I check each relevant row for the 'artist' and 'year' columns:\n\n1. Row 5: Artist is \"pixie lott\" and year is 2010.\n2. Row 6: Artist is \"perry mystique\" and year is 2010.\n\nNow, compare these to see if the same artist performed different songs in different years. But wait, looking at 'song' column:\n\n- Row 5's song is \"turn it up\".\n- Row 6's song is \"party like ur 18 feat sway\".\n\nThese are two different songs by two different artists (pixie lott and perry mystique) in the same year, 2010. The claim says that the same artist performed a song from a different year, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo the claim doesn't hold because the same 'dee - lux remix' is associated with different songs by different artists in the same year, not the same artist across different years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
