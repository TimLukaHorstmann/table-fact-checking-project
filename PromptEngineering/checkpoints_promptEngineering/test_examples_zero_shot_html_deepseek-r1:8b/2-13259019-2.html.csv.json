    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the result of the game play at soldier field be 31 - 29\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table and find where \"soldier field\" is mentioned because that's a key location in the claim. Scanning each row, I see in row 10 (which is November 5, 1978) the opponent is Chicago Bears, the result is w 31 - 29, the game site is Soldier Field, and the record goes from 5-5 to 6-5 with attendance of 50697. That seems relevant because it's the only row where Soldier Field is listed as the game site.\n\nNow, the claim specifies \"the result... at soldier field be 31 - 29.\" In this particular row, the result is a win with the score 31 - 29. So that matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI also need to check if there are any other relevant cells beyond just the specific row. The columns involved here are 'opponent', 'result', 'game site', and 'record'. But the only cell that directly ties to the claim is the result column, which shows 31 - 29 in that game at Soldier Field.\n\nWait, but maybe I should make sure there's no other occurrence of Soldier Field. Looking back through the table, row 10 is the only one where the opponent is Chicago Bears and the game site is Soldier Field. So that's the only relevant row.\n\nTherefore, all the cells that are relevant would be in that specific row: 'result' to confirm the score, 'game site' to confirm it's Soldier Field, and perhaps 'week' for context but I think it's not necessary because the claim doesn't specify a particular week. The main points are the result and the location.\n\nSo, putting this together, the relevant cells would be row_index 10 for columns: 'result', 'game site', and maybe others if needed, but since the claim only mentions the result and Soldier Field, those two columns are sufficient.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the game at Soldier Field in the table. The only relevant entry is in row 10 where the result is 31-29.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"after week 10, the result of the game play at soldier field be w 31 - 29.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week from 1 to 16. The columns include 'week', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', 'game site', and 'attendance'.\n\nI need to check if there's a game after week 10 (so weeks 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16) that was played at Soldier Field with the result of \"w 31 - 29\".\n\nLooking at each week:\n\n- Week 11: Opponent is Baltimore Colts. The game site is kingdome. Result is l 14 -17.\n- Week 12: Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs. Game site is Arrowhead Stadium. Result is w 13 -10.\n- Week 13: Opponent is Oakland Raiders. Game site is Oakland Coliseum. Result is w 17 -16.\n- Week 14: Opponent is Cleveland Browns. Game site is Kingdome. Result is w 47 -24.\n- Week 15: Opponent is San Diego Chargers. Game site is San Diego Stadium. Result is l 10 -37.\n- Week 16: Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs. Game site is Kingdome. Result is w 23 -19.\n\nNone of these weeks after week 10 have the game site as Soldier Field or a result of \"w 31 -29\". So, I need to check if Soldier Field is relevant elsewhere.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I see that in Week 14 (row index 13), the opponent is Cleveland Browns at Kingdome. In Week 15, it's San Diego Stadium, and Week 16 is back at Kingdome.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The table shows that in week 12 (row 11) the game site is Arrowhead Stadium, but maybe Soldier Field is only used once.\n\nLooking again, Soldier Field is mentioned as the game site in one row: it's Week 14? No, wait, looking at each row:\n\nRow 13: Opponent is Oakland Raiders, game site is Oakland Coliseum.\n\nWait, no. Let me check each week properly.\n\nWeeks 1-16:\n\nLooking through all rows, I see that the only occurrence of Soldier Field as the game site is in Week 14? No, actually, let me check each row's 'game site' column.\n\nRow 0: Kingdome\nRow 1: Kingdome\n...\nWait, perhaps Soldier Field isn't listed anywhere. Let me check each 'game site':\n\nWeek 1: Kingdome\n2: Arrowhead Stadium\n3: Kingdome\n4: Oakland Coliseum\n5: Kingdome\n6: San Diego Stadium\n7: Kingdome\n8: Kingdome\n9: Kingdome\n10: Soldier Field? No, week 10's game site is Kingdome.\nWait no, in the table provided:\n\nLooking at row 0 to row 15 (since there are 16 weeks), each row corresponds to a week.\n\nRow 14: Opponent is Cleveland Browns, game site is Kingdome. Result w47-24.\nRow 15: San Diego Chargers, San Diego Stadium, l10-37.\nRow 16: Kansas City Chiefs, Kingdome, w23-19.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the rows. Let me list them properly:\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 15, as per the JSON example where row_index starts at 0. So week 1 is row 0, week 2 is row 1, etc., up to week 16 being row 15.\n\nLooking through each row's 'game site' column:\n\nRow 0: Kingdome\nRow 1: Kingdome\nRow 2: Arrowhead Stadium\nRow 3: Kingdome\n...\nContinuing this way, I need to check if any row after week 10 (i.e., rows 10 and beyond) has the game site as Soldier Field.\n\nBut from the table provided, the only time Soldier Field is mentioned is in Week 14? No, looking at each week's 'game site' column:\n\nLooking through all 16 weeks:\n\n- Week 1: Kingdome\n- Week 2: Kingdome\n- Week 3: Arrowhead Stadium\n- Week 4: Kingdome\n- Week 5: Oakland Coliseum\n- Week 6: San Diego Stadium\n- Week 7: Kingdome\n- Week 8: Kingdome\n- Week 9: Kingdome\n- Week 10: Kingdome\n- Week 11: Kingdome\n- Week 12: Arrowhead Stadium\n- Week 13: Oakland Coliseum\n- Week 14: Kingdome\n- Week 15: San Diego Stadium\n- Week 16: Kingdome\n\nWait, I don't see any mention of Soldier Field in the 'game site' column. That suggests that the claim is about a game at Soldier Field after week 10, but according to the table, no such game exists.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each row's 'game site':\n\n- For example, row 11 (week 12) is Arrowhead Stadium.\n- Row 13 (week 14): Oakland Coliseum.\n- Row 15: San Diego Stadium.\n\nNo Soldier Field in any of these. So the claim is incorrect because there is no game at Soldier Field after week 10 with a result of \"w31-29\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the 'game site' column for weeks 11 to 16 to show that none have Soldier Field.\n\nBut wait, the claim refers specifically to \"Soldier Field\" and \"w31-29\". Since no such game exists after week 10 at Soldier Field with that result, it's FALSE.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all rows from 10 (week 11) to 15 (week 16), focusing on 'game site' to show none are Soldier Field.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
