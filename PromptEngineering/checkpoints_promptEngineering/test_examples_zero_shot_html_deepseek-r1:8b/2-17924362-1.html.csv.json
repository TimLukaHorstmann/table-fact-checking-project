Wait, that's not 1975. The claim refers to a game in 1975, which is a different year. There might be an inconsistency here.\n\nLooking at the table, I don't see any games from 1975. All games are in 2019. Therefore, there\u2019s no data about attendance for a game that actually took place in 1975 in the table provided. This means the claim refers to information not present in the table.\n\nAdditionally, the San Diego Stadium appears in row 8 (game 9) and row 12 (game 10), but those games are from November and December 2019, not 1975. The game in question (1975) doesn't exist in the table at all.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be verified because there's no relevant data in the table for a 1975 game, especially one held at San Diego Stadium with low attendance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and the given HTML structure. The claim states: \"in 1975 , the most point the denver bronco score in a loss be 21\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the Denver Broncos' scoring in losses during the 1975 season, specifically that their highest points in any loss was 21.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists games from week 1 to week 14, but the dates go up to December 20, which suggests this might cover the entire 1975 season. Each row has details about the opponent, result, and attendance, among others. However, I notice that the \"opponent\" column doesn't mention any other teams beyond what's listed\u2014like Raiders, Chargers, Steelers, etc.\u2014but the claim is specifically about a loss where Broncos scored 21 points.\n\nWait, but in the table, all games are for the Denver Broncos as the home team, right? The opponents vary. Now, I need to check if there was any game in 1975 where the Broncos lost and scored exactly 21 points.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent is Chiefs, result is a win (37-33), so not a loss.\nWeek 2: Opponent is Packers, result is a win (23-13).\nWeek 3: Opponent is Bills, result is a loss (14-38). Broncos scored 14 points. Not 21.\nWeek 4: Opponent is Steelers, result is a loss (9-20). They scored 9 points. No.\nWeek 5: Opponent is Browns, result is a win (16-15).\nWeek 6: Opponent is Chiefs again, lost (13-26). Scored 13.\nWeek 7: Opponent is Raiders, lost (17-42). Broncos scored 17.\nWeek 8: Opponent is Bengals, lost (16-17). 16 points.\nWeek 9: Opponent is Chargers, won (27-17).\nWeek 10: Opponent is Falcons, lost (21-35). Here, Broncos scored 21 points and lost. This seems to match the claim.\n\nSo there's at least one game in 1975 where the Broncos lost and scored 21 points. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that this is indeed from 1975. The table doesn't have a year column, but based on the dates, week 1 is September 21, which would be in 1975, as typically NFL seasons run through mid-December. So it's safe to assume all these games are part of the 1975 season.\n\nThus, the relevant cell is row 9 (since it's zero-indexed, row 10) and column \"Score\" because that's where they scored 21 points in a loss.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the Denver Broncos in 1975 is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco never have more than 2 win in a row.\" So, we're looking at the Broncos' performance during the 1975 season and checking if they ever had more than two consecutive wins.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists games from week 1 to week 14, but all the dates are in September, October, November, and December. Wait a second, the claim is about 1975, which would likely be their entire season. However, in the table provided, the latest game is on December 20, 1974 (game 14), which seems off because 1975 would typically go into January or beyond for a full season. This discrepancy might mean that the table doesn't cover the entire 1975 season but perhaps a part of it or an earlier year.\n\nAssuming the table does represent the Broncos' games from 1975, I'll proceed. Each row in the table lists the week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The 'record' column seems to track their overall wins and losses up to that point.\n\nTo check for consecutive wins, I should look at how many times they won back-to-back games. Starting from week 1:\n\n- Week 1: Win (1-0)\n- Week 2: Win (2-0) \u2192 Consecutive wins = 2\n- Week 3: Loss \u2192 Streak broken\n- Week 4: Loss \u2192 No streak\n- Week 5: Win (3-2) \u2192 New win, no streak yet\n- Week 6: Loss \u2192 No streak\n- Week 7: Loss \u2192 No streak\n- Week 8: Loss \u2192 No streak\n- Week 9: Win (4-5) \u2192 New win, no streak\n- Week 10: Loss \u2192 No streak\n- Week 11: Win (5-6) \u2192 New win, but it's after a loss, so no consecutive wins yet\n- Week 12: Loss \u2192 No streak\n- Week 13: Win (6-7) \u2192 New win, still only one in a row\n- Week 14: Loss \u2192 No streak\n\nWait, the claim is about having \"more than 2 wins in a row.\" From this analysis, in week 1 and 2, they had two consecutive wins. That's exactly two, not more. The next time they get to two would be after another win, but looking ahead:\n\nAfter Week 11 (5-6), if they were to have another win, that would be three in a row, but the season ends at Week 14 with a loss.\n\nWait, let me recount each week's record and see when there are multiple consecutive wins:\n\n- After Week 1: 1 Win\n- After Week 2: 2 Wins \u2192 This is two in a row. The claim says they never had more than two, so this would be exactly two.\n- After Week 5: 3 Wins, but let's see the actual record. Wait, no\u2014after each game, the 'record' column shows their total wins and losses. For example, after Week 2 (opponent Eagles), they have 2-0. So, up to that point, two wins in a row.\n\nBut the claim is about \"never have more than 2 win in a row.\" So having exactly two would violate this claim if they never exceeded two. Wait, no\u2014having two in a row doesn't exceed two. The claim says \"more than 2,\" so two is allowed, but three or more is not.\n\nWait, the exact wording: \"never have more than 2 win in a row.\" So, if they had three wins in a row at any point, that would make the claim false because they exceeded two.\n\nBut looking back at the table:\n\n- Weeks 1 and 2: Wins \u2192 Two in a row.\n- Then a loss, so streak broken.\n- Later, Week 5: They win again (3-2), but their previous game was a loss. So only one win in a row.\n- Week 11: Win after a loss \u2192 One in a row.\n- Week 13: Win after a loss \u2192 One in a row.\n\nSo, the maximum consecutive wins they had were two. Therefore, the claim that they \"never have more than 2 win in a row\" would be true because they never had three or more in a row. Their longest streak was exactly two, which doesn't exceed two.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any point where they had three consecutive wins. From the table:\n\nLooking at each week's result:\n\n1. Win\n2. Win \u2192 2 in a row\n3. Loss\n4. Loss\n5. Win \u2192 1 in a row\n6. Loss\n7. Loss\n8. Loss\n9. Win \u2192 1 in a row\n10. Loss\n11. Win \u2192 1 in a row\n12. Loss\n13. Win \u2192 1 in a row\n14. Loss\n\nSo, the only time they had multiple wins in a row was weeks 1 and 2, which is two. Therefore, they never had more than two consecutive wins. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned because the table seems to end in December 1974 (game 14), not 1975. That might mean that the data doesn't cover the entire 1975 season. If the Broncos played into January 1975 and had a third consecutive win, but that's not reflected here.\n\nAssuming the table is accurate for 1975, they never had more than two in a row. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, I should check what each part of the claim means. The Denver Broncos are a team, so that's correct. The claim mentions the year 1975, but looking at the table provided, the games listed are from week 1 to week 14, with dates ranging from September 21, 1974 (if we consider week 1 as early September) up to December 20, 1974. Wait, no, actually, the first row is week 1 on September 21, 1974. So all the games in this table are from 1974, not 1975.\n\nThat's a problem because the claim refers to 1975. There\u2019s no data here for 1975. So if someone claims that in 1975 the Broncos went into overtime only once, there's no way to verify it from this table since all games are in 1974. \n\nNow, I need to see if any cells are relevant. The claim mentions \"overtime only 1 time,\" so I should look for columns related to overtime. In the table, the 'result' column sometimes ends with \"(ot)\" which indicates an overtime game. So the 'result' column is relevant because it shows whether a game went into OT or not.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in the 'result' column where the outcome includes \"(ot)\". Additionally, since the claim specifies 1975 and there's no data for that year, even if all games in 1974 had some OT, it doesn't relate to 1975. But still, the 'result' column is the only one that mentions OT, so those are the relevant cells.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE because the table doesn't include any games from 1975, and thus we can't confirm if the Broncos went into overtime only once in that year. The relevant cells are all the rows where 'result' has \"(ot)\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The years mentioned in the table's 'date' column range from September 21 (presumably 1975) to December 20 (also 1975). This suggests that the games listed are from the 1975 season.\n\nNext, I check if the Denver Broncos played a game in the Miami Orange Bowl with a loss in 1975. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Week 1: vs Kansas City Chiefs at Mile High Stadium\n- Week 2: vs Green Bay Packers at Mile High Stadium\n- Week 3: vs Buffalo Bills at Rich Stadium\n- Week 4: vs Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium\n- Week 5: vs Cleveland Browns at Mile High Stadium\n- Week 6: vs Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium\n- Week 7: vs Oakland Raiders at Mile High Stadium\n- Week 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals at Mile High Stadium\n- Week 9: vs San Diego Chargers at San Diego Stadium\n- Week 10: vs Atlanta Falcons at Atlanta - Fulton County Stadium\n- Week 11: vs San Diego Chargers at Mile High Stadium (with an OT win)\n- Week 12: vs Oakland Raiders at Oakland Coliseum\n- Week 13: vs Philadelphia Eagles at Mile High Stadium\n- Week 14: vs Miami Dolphins at Miami Orange Bowl\n\nIn week 14, the Denver Broncos played against the Miami Dolphins with a result of 'l 13 - 14', which means they lost.

The claim says, \"in 1975, the denver bronco never have more than 1 win in a row.\" \n\nFirst, I should check what the table shows. The table seems to list games from week 1 to week 14, but it doesn't specify the year. Since the claim is about 1975, I need to make sure that these games are indeed from 1975. Looking at the dates in the 'date' column: September 21, September 29, October 5, and so on. These are in September and early October, which would be part of the 1975 season because the NFL season typically starts in late August/early September.\n\nNext, I need to analyze each week's result to see if there are any consecutive wins. The 'result' column has either a win (w) or a loss (l), with some scores. I'll go through each row and track the number of consecutive wins.\n\nStarting from Week 1: They won against the Kansas City Chiefs. So that's one win in a row.\n\nWeek 2: Another win against the Green Bay Packers, so now two wins in a row.\n\nWeek 3: Lost to the Buffalo Bills. So the streak breaks at two wins.\n\nWeek 4: Lost again. \n\nWeek 5: Won against the Cleveland Browns, making it one win after a loss.\n\nWeek 6: Lost to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWeek 7: Lost to the Oakland Raiders.\n\nWeek 8: Lost again.\n\nWeek 9: Won against the San Diego Chargers, so that's one win.\n\nWeek 10: Lost.\n\nWeek 11: Won in overtime against the San Diego Chargers, making it two wins after a loss.\n\nWeek 12: Lost.\n\nWeek 13: Won against the Philadelphia Eagles, which is one win.\n\nWeek 14: Lost.\n\nNow, looking for any instance where they had more than one win in a row. In Week 2, they had two consecutive wins (weeks 1 and 2). So that's a streak of two. Therefore, the claim says they never have more than one win in a row, but here in week 2, they had two, which contradicts the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the ones showing each of these consecutive wins, particularly Week 2 where the streak reached two. So I need to identify which columns are important: 'week', 'opponent', 'result', and maybe 'attendance' isn't necessary, but perhaps the opponent is for context.\n\nWait, actually, the claim is about having more than one win in a row, so the key cells would be the 'result' column to see if there's any sequence of two wins. So each week where they won is important, especially consecutive weeks.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include the row indices and 'result' as the column name, specifically for weeks where they had multiple wins.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos never had more than one win in a row.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 be at the Mile High Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being claimed. It mentions the lowest attendance in 1975 specifically for Denver Broncos games held at Mile High Stadium. So, I need to check if such data exists in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists games from week 1 through week 14, with various details like date, opponent, result, game site, and attendance. The dates range from September 21 to December 20, which covers part of 1975 and early 1976. Wait, but the claim is about 1975 specifically, so I need to focus on games that took place in 1975.\n\nThe table's first row is week 1 on September 21, 1975 (since it's September). The last relevant game for 1975 would be December 20, which is week 14. So all the games from weeks 1 to 14 are within or up to December 1975. \n\nNow, I need to look at each row and see if any represent a Denver Broncos game with attendance data at Mile High Stadium in 1975. Wait, but looking at the opponents: in the table, the teams listed as opponents include Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, etc. I don't see \"Denver Broncos\" as an opponent in this table. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about the Denver Broncos games, so perhaps the opponent should be another team, and the home team would be the Broncos. So in each row where the opponent is someone else, if the game was hosted by the Broncos at Mile High Stadium, that's relevant.\n\nLooking through the opponents: Weeks 1-2 are against Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay Packers, both at Mile High Stadium. Weeks 3-4 are against Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers, but those games are at Rich Stadium and Three Rivers Stadium, not Mile High. Week 5 is Cleveland Browns at Mile High, week 6 is Kansas City again at Arrowhead, week 7 is Oakland Raiders at Mile High, week 8 is Cincinnati Bengals at Mile High, week 9 is San Diego Chargers at their home stadium, week 10 is Atlanta Falcons away, week 11 is San Diego again at Mile High, week 12 is Oakland at their place, week 13 and 14 are Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins away.\n\nWait, so the Broncos games in the table are against various opponents, but I don't see any opponent listed as \"Denver Broncos.\" So maybe the claim refers to games where the Broncos were playing, and the lowest attendance among those was at Mile High Stadium. But since the Broncos aren't listed as opponents, perhaps this is a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table doesn't include all games from 1975 because it only goes up to week 14. Maybe there are more weeks beyond what's shown, but in the given data, weeks 1-14 cover part of 1975 and early '76.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the claim is about Denver Broncos games, so the opponents would be other teams, and the attendance at Mile High Stadium. So among all the Broncos home games (where they are the opponent), I need to find if Mile High Stadium has the lowest attendance in 1975.\n\nBut looking through the table, the only team listed as playing the Broncos is Kansas City Chiefs in week 1 and 6, but those are at Arrowhead Stadium. So perhaps the claim is not about games against the Broncos but about the Broncos' games where the opponent was someone else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says \"lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game,\" so it's about their own games, meaning they were the home team. Therefore, in the table, the rows where the opponent is another team (e.g., Chiefs, Packers) and the game was at Mile High Stadium would be relevant.\n\nSo I need to look through each row to see if any are Broncos home games with low attendance.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent Kansas City Chiefs, location Mile High. So this is a Broncos home game.\n- Week 2: Opponent Green Bay Packers, location Mile High. Another home game.\n- Week 3: Opponent Buffalo Bills, location Rich Stadium (Buffalo).\n- Week 4: Opponent Pittsburgh Steelers, location Three Rivers Stadium (Pittsburgh).\n- Week 5: Opponent Cleveland Browns, location Mile High. Home game.\n- Week 6: Opponent Kansas City Chiefs, location Arrowhead. Away game for Broncos.\n- Week 7: Opponent Oakland Raiders, location Mile High. Home game.\n- Week 8: Opponent Cincinnati Bengals, location Mile High. Home game.\n- Week 9: Opponent San Diego Chargers, location San Diego Stadium. Away game.\n- Week 10: Opponent Atlanta Falcons, location Atlanta. Away game.\n- Week 11: Opponent San Diego Chargers, location Mile High. Home game.\n- Week 12: Opponent Oakland Raiders, location Oakland Coliseum. Away game.\n- Week 13: Opponent Philadelphia Eagles, location Mile High. Home game.\n- Week 14: Opponent Miami Dolphins, location Orange Bowl. Away game.\n\nSo the Broncos had home games at Mile High Stadium in weeks 1,2,5,7,8,11,13. Each of these games would have their attendance recorded. The claim is about the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 being at Mile High Stadium. So I need to look at all these home games and see if the lowest one was there.\n\nI should extract the attendance numbers from each relevant row:\n\n- Week 1: 50,000\n- Week 2: 50,000\n- Week 5: 24,327 (this is a low number)\n- Week 7: 35,000\n- Week 8: 30,000\n- Week 11: 50,000\n- Week 13: 18,207\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me check each week's attendance:\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find which columns have \"attendance.\" Wait, in the table provided, each row has a column named \"attendance,\" with numbers like 50,000, 35,000, etc.\n\nSo for each home game at Mile High Stadium:\n\nWeek 1: 50,000\nWeek 2: 50,000\nWeek 5: 24,327 (this is the lowest in the table)\nWeek 7: 35,000\nWeek 8: 30,000\nWeek 11: 50,000\nWeek 13: 18,207\n\nWait, but week 13's attendance is only 18,207? That's lower than week 5's 24k. But that might be a typo because sometimes games in late December might have lower attendances due to weather or other factors.\n\nSo the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium for Broncos home games in 1975 would be either week 5, week 8, or week 13, depending on the numbers.\n\nBut according to the table, week 13 has 18k, which is lower than week 5's 24k. So if that's accurate, then the lowest was at week 13.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the lowest attendance... be at the Mile High Stadium.\" It doesn't specify the exact game or whether it's the absolute lowest across all their games in 1975, just that among their games (as home teams), the lowest was at Mile High.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is about the lowest attendance for any Denver Broncos game (home or away) in 1975 being at Mile High Stadium, but that wouldn't make sense because they play some games on the road with lower attendances.\n\nAlternatively, it's about their home games specifically, and whether the lowest among those was at Mile High. That would require comparing all their home games' attendance to see if Mile High had the lowest.\n\nBut looking at week 5 with 24k and week 13 with 18k, that would make sense that week 13 is lower than others. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because they have a game at another venue (like the Orange Bowl) in week 14 with even lower attendance, but that's an away game.\n\nWait, no, week 14 is against Miami, which was an away game for Broncos, so it wouldn't be counted as Mile High Stadium. So the lowest home game at Mile High would be week 13 with 18k or week 5 with 24k, depending on exact numbers.\n\nBut perhaps I should double-check: in the table provided, the attendances are:\n\nLooking back, each row has a column for attendance:\n\n- Week 1: 50,000\n- Week 2: 50,000\n- Week 3: ?\n- Week 4: ?\n- Week 5: 24,327\n- Week 6: ?\n- Week 7: 35,000\n- Week 8: 30,000\n- Week 9: ?\n- Week 10: ?\n- Week 11: 50,000\n- Week 12: ?\n- Week 13: 18,207\n- Week 14: ?\n\nSo among the home games at Mile High (weeks 1,2,5,7,8,11,13):\n\nWeek 13 has the lowest attendance at 18,207.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is that the lowest attendance for a Broncos game in 1975 was at Mile High, that's incorrect because their away games likely had lower attendances. But if it's about their home games, then week 13 is the lowest.\n\nBut without more data on away games, I can't confirm that. However, assuming that the claim refers to their home games, then yes, the lowest attendance was at Mile High (18k). Alternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because even lower attendances happened elsewhere, but since the table doesn't show those, it's hard to say.\n\nIn any case, based on the data provided, the lowest attendance for a Broncos home game in 1975 was at week 13 with 18,207. Therefore, the claim that the lowest attendance was at Mile High Stadium would be true only if comparing their own home games.\n\nBut since the table doesn't include all games (only up to week 14), maybe there are more weeks beyond that which had lower attendances. However, based on what's given, I can say that among the shown home games, the lowest was at week 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 (specifically their home games) was at Mile High Stadium.\n</think>\n\nThe lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was indeed at Mile High Stadium. Specifically, the game against the Philadelphia Eagles on December 15, 1975, had the lowest attendance among their home games that season, with only 18,207 fans present.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was at Mile High Stadium.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss were 15.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant information from the table provided. The table lists games from weeks 1 through 14, each with details like opponent, result, attendance, etc. But the key columns here are \"result\" and \"record\" which might help determine the points scored in losses.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 1975. Looking at the table, all the dates are from September to December 2019, not 1975. That's a problem because the data doesn't go back that far. The oldest week in the table is week 1 on September 21, which would have been in 2019.\n\nSo if the claim refers to 1975, there's no data here to verify it. Because the games in the table are all from 2019 and later, not 1975. That means any information about Denver Broncos games in 1975 isn't present in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the provided data because the relevant historical games aren't listed here. The answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific year (1975) that is not represented in the provided table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos went into overtime only twice.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"In 1975\" refers to a specific year, which probably corresponds to the data in the table. But looking at the table, the weeks go from 1 to 14, and the dates range from September 21 to December 20. Wait, that's only covering up to December 20. So if this is for the 1975 season, maybe it's missing some games beyond what's shown here.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"went into overtime only twice.\" Looking at the table, I need to find any games where the result indicates an overtime situation. Overtime can be denoted by a score like \"x - y (ot)\" or similar notation. Let me scan through each game.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Week 1: No OT mention.\n- Week 2: No OT.\n- Week 3: No OT.\n- Week 4: No OT.\n- Week 5: No OT.\n- Week 6: No OT.\n- Week 7: No OT.\n- Week 8: No OT.\n- Week 9: No OT.\n- Week 10: No OT.\n- Week 11: The result is \"13 - 10 (ot)\". So that's one overtime game.\n- Week 12: No OT.\n- Week 13: No OT.\n- Week 14: No OT.\n\nSo in the table, there's only one game that went into overtime. But the claim says they went into overtime only twice. Since the table only shows up to week 14, maybe it's missing some weeks after December 20, 1975. \n\nIf I consider that the Broncos might have played more games after week 14 in 1975, perhaps there's another OT game not included here. But without knowing all the games of that season, I can't be certain. However, based on the table provided, they only went into overtime once.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only twice.\" So if in reality, there was only one, then the claim would be FALSE. Or maybe the table is incomplete. If the table includes all games from week 1 to 14, and only week 11 had OT, then the table shows only one OT game. Therefore, the claim's statement that they went into overtime twice isn't supported by this data.\n\nBut I also need to check if any other columns could affect this. The 'result' column is where the OT notation would be, but it's only present in week 11. So based on what's shown here, the Broncos only went into overtime once. Therefore, the claim's assertion of twice is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco finish the season with a win at the miami orange bowl\". \n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table provided. The table lists games from week 1 to week 14, presumably covering the 2019 season since the opponents like Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay Packers are still relevant, but wait, actually Denver Broncos would have been a different team in 1975, so maybe the team names in the table don't correspond directly. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, the table seems to be for a specific year, possibly 2019 based on some of the opponents and game sites like Mile High Stadium, which is Denver's home stadium. So, if the claim is about 1975, when the Broncos were in different ownership and perhaps a different name, maybe it's not directly applicable. But I might be overcomplicating.\n\nLet me focus on the claim: They finished the season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl in 1975. So I need to see if there was a game in 1975 where Broncos won at Miami.\n\nLooking at the table, the games go from week 1 to 14 in the same year (2019), but the claim is about 1975. The table doesn't have any information about 1975, so that's a problem. Therefore, maybe there's no data here to verify the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me check each row for the game site and result in 1975. Wait, all games in the table are from what seems like 2019 or later because of the stadiums and opponents mentioned. So 1975 is way before that.\n\nTherefore, the table doesn't have any data about 1975, so it's impossible to verify if the Broncos won at the Miami Orange Bowl in 1975 based on this table. Thus, the claim must be false.\n\nBut let me double-check: The table shows games up to week 14 of a particular season, likely 2019, with opponents like Oakland Raiders, Philadelphia Eagles, etc., which were relevant teams in recent years but not in 1975.\n\nSo, no relevant data in the table supports the claim about 1975.
