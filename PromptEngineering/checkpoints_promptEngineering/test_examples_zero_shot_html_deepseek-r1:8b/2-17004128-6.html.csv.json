The claim is: \"the home team be leeds united and the away team be portsmouth.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The first part says the home team is Leeds United. So, in the table, I need to find a row where the home team is Leeds United. Similarly, the second part states that the away team is Portsmouth, so I should check if any row has Portsmouth as the away team.\n\nLooking at the table's rows:\n\nRow 1: Home Team - Chesterfield\nRow 2: Home Team - Leicester City\nRow 3: Home Team - Chelsea (replay)\nRow 4: Home Team - Derby County\nRow 5: Home Team - Manchester City\nRow 6: Home Team - Wimbledon\nRow 7: Home Team - Leeds United\nRow 8: Home Team - Birmingham City\n\nSo, in row 7, the home team is Leeds United. That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNow for the away team being Portsmouth. Checking each row:\n\nRow 1: Away Team - Nottingham Forest\nRow 2: Away Team - Chelsea\nRow 3: Away Team - Leicester City (replay)\nRow 4: Away Team - Coventry City\nRow 5: Away Team - Middlesbrough\nRow 6: Away Team - Queens Park Rangers\nRow 7: Away Team - Portsmouth\nRow 8: Away Team - Wrexham\n\nAh, in row 7, the away team is Portsmouth.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Chelsea be the away team when they play Leicester City\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Chelsea is the away team in a match against Leicester City. So, I need to look for instances where Chelsea plays Leicester City and check Chelsea's role in those matches.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. The goal is to find rows where the home team is Leicester City and the away team is Chelsea, or vice versa if needed. Wait, actually, since the claim specifies that Chelsea is the away team when they play Leicester City, we should look for games where Leicester City is the home team and Chelsea is the away team.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: tie no 1, home team Chesterfield, score 1-0, away team Nottingham Forest.\n   - Not relevant since neither team is Chelsea nor Leicester City.\n\n2. Row 2: tie no 2, home team Leicester City, score 2-2, away team Chelsea.\n   - Here, Leicester City is the home team and Chelsea is the away team. So this matches the claim partially. But let's check if there are other instances to confirm if Chelsea consistently plays as the away team against Leicester City.\n\n3. Row 3: tie no replay, home team Chelsea, score 1-0, away team Leicester City.\n   - Now, Chelsea is the home team and Leicester City is the away team. This doesn't fit the claim since Chelsea isn't the away team here.\n\n4. Row 4 onwards: Other rows don't mention either Chelsea or Leicester City as per the relevant columns.\n\nSo, in row 2, the condition of Chelsea being the away team against Leicester City (who is home) is met. However, in row 3, the situation reverses, with Chelsea as home and Leicester as away. This shows that sometimes Chelsea is the away team and sometimes not.\n\nBut the claim specifically says \"when they play,\" which could imply that there are multiple instances where Chelsea plays Leicester City. So I need to check if Chelsea is indeed the away team in at least one game against Leicester City, which it is (row 2). However, since in another instance it's the opposite, does that affect the truth of the claim?\n\nWait, maybe the claim isn't making a statement about all instances but just whether Chelsea can be the away team when they play Leicester. So if there exists at least one game where Chelsea is the away team against Leicester City, then the claim would be true. But looking back, in row 2, Leicester City is home and Chelsea is away. So yes, that exists.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to check whether the claim is fully supported by the table. The claim says \"Chelsea be the away team when they play Leicester City.\" So I need to see if there's any instance where Chelsea is the away team against Leicester City in the matches listed.\n\nYes, row 2 has that. Therefore, the claim is true because at least one match exists where Chelsea is the away team against Leicester City.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"Chelsea be the away team when they play Leicester City\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify relevant matches**: Check for any rows where one team is Chelsea and the other is Leicester City.\n\n2. **Analyze each match**:\n   - Row 2: Leicester City (home) vs. Chelsea (away).\n   - Row 3: Chelsea (home) vs. Leicester City (away).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since there exists at least one match where Chelsea is the away team against Leicester City, the claim is supported.\n\nAnswer: TRUE\n\nRelevant cells: The row where Leicester City is home and Chelsea is away.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"chesterfield be the home team and nottingham forest be the away team in position tie number 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row represents a different match.\n\nThe claim is making two specific statements:\n1. Chesterfield is the home team.\n2. Nottingham Forest is the away team.\n3. This should be in tie number 1.\n\nSo I need to find the row where \"tie no\" is 1. Let's look at the first row after the header. The first data row has tie no as 1, home team as Chesterfield, score as 1 - 0, away team as Nottingham Forest, and the date.\n\nSince the claim specifies tie number 1, I should focus on that row. In that row, the home team is Chesterfield and the away team is Nottingham Forest. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI don't think there's any ambiguity here because the claim specifically refers to tie number 1, which corresponds directly to that first data row.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"tie no 8 be with the away team , wrexham.\" So, I think this means that in tie number 8, Wrexham was the away team. \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. I need to find the row where tie no is 8.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: tie no is 1\n- Row 2: tie no is 2\n- Row 3: tie no is 'replay'\n- Row 4: tie no is 3\n- Row 5: tie no is 4\n- Row 6: tie no is 5\n- Row 7: tie no is 6\n- Row 8: tie no is 7\nWait, that's not right. The table shows:\n\nRow 1: tie no 1\nRow 2: tie no 2\nRow 3: tie no 'replay'\nRow 4: tie no 3\nRow 5: tie no 4\nRow 6: tie no 5\nRow 7: tie no 6\nRow 8: tie no 7\nWait, but the claim is about tie no 8. Hmm, that's confusing because in the table, the highest tie no shown is 7. So maybe the table doesn't include tie number 8?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the tbody:\n\n- First row after <tbody> is 1\nThen 2, then 'replay', which might not be a numbered tie, then 3,4,5,6,7,8? Wait no, looking at the code:\n\nThe table has rows as:\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n...\n</tr>\n\nThen another <tr> with <td>2</td>\n\nAnother <tr> with <td>replay</td>\n\nThen <td>3</td>, and so on up to 8?\n\nWait, no. Let me count the rows properly.\n\nThe table starts at tie no=1, then 2, then 'replay', then 3,4,5,6,7,8? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nLooking at each <tr> in tbody:\n\nFirst is tie 1\nSecond tie 2\nThird 'replay'\nFourth tie 3\nFifth tie 4\nSixth tie5 (wait, no: fifth row has tie 4)\nWait, perhaps it's better to list them all:\n\nRow 1: tie 1\nRow 2: tie 2\nRow 3: tie 'replay'\nRow 4: tie 3\nRow 5: tie 4\nRow 6: tie 5\nRow7: tie6\nRow8: tie7\n\nWait, but in the table provided, there are 8 rows (from <tr> tags), with tie nos 1,2,'replay',3,4,5,6,7. So tie no 8 is not present in the table.\n\nBut the claim refers to tie no 8. So that's a problem because if tie no 8 isn't in the table, then it can't be verified, right?\n\nWait, but looking again at the provided HTML:\n\nLooking at the <tbody> section:\n\n- First row: tie no 1\n- Second: tie 2\n- Third: replay\n- Fourth: tie3 (row4)\n- Fifth: tie4 (row5)\n- Sixth: tie5 (row6)\n- Seventh: tie6 (row7)\n- Eighth: tie7 (row8)\n\nWait, no. Wait the table has 8 rows because each <tr> is one row.\n\nSo in the table, tie no goes up to 7. So there's no tie number 8 in the table.\n\nBut the claim refers to tie no8, so that would mean that either:\n\n- The claim is incorrect because tie no8 isn't in the table.\nOr perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me count the rows again.\n\nLooking at the HTML code for tbody:\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row 1\n\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row2\n\n<tr>\n<td>replay</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row3\n\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row4\n\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row5\n\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row6\n\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row7\n\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n...\n</tr> \u2192 row8\n\nWait, that's 8 rows. So tie no7 is in row8.\n\nSo the table includes tie numbers from 1 to7, and a replay. There's no tie number8 in the table.\n\nTherefore, if the claim refers to tie no8, which isn't present in the table, then the claim would be false because there's no data to support it.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me check again:\n\nEach <tr> is a row:\n\n1. tie1\n2. tie2\n3. replay\n4. tie3\n5. tie4\n6. tie5\n7. tie6\n8. tie7\n\nYes, that's 8 rows, so tie7 is the last one. No tie8.\n\nTherefore, since the table doesn't have a tie number8, the claim about tie no8 can't be verified from the data given.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nLooking at the provided HTML for tbody:\n\nIt's an unordered list of 8 <tr> elements. Each corresponds to one row.\n\nSo the first row: tie1\n\nSecond: tie2\n\nThird: replay\n\nFourth: tie3\n\nFifth: tie4\n\nSixth: tie5\n\nSeventh: tie6\n\nEighth: tie7\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus, tie8 is not in the table. Therefore, the claim about tie no8 can't be found here.\n\nSo if the task is to determine whether the statement is true based on the data given (the table), and since the data doesn't include a tie8, then the statement would be false because there's no information about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 'tie number 8' refers to something else, but in this context, it's about the numbering in the table.\n\nTherefore, the task is to see whether the given data supports the statement.\n\nSince tie no8 isn't present, the answer would be that the statement can't be verified or is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the 'replay' row could be considered as a tie number '0' or something else, but that's not standard. Typically, tie numbers start at 1, so replay would be an additional match, maybe a re-match or a special event.\n\nTherefore, in the table provided, there are ties numbered from1 to7, and one replay.\n\nSo, given that, tie no8 isn't present.\n\nThus, if the claim refers to tie no8, then it's incorrect because there is no such data.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table as provided in the HTML code:\n\nThe first few rows after tbody are:\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n...\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n...\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>replay</td>\n...\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n...\n</tr>\n\n...and so on up to 8 rows.\n\nSo the eighth row has <td>7</td>, which is tie number7.\n\nTherefore, there's no tie number8 in the table.\n\nHence, if the statement refers to a specific match that didn't happen (tie no8), then it's false because the data doesn't support it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to assume that tie no8 exists and check its details. But since it's not present, we can't do that.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, the statement about tie no8 cannot be verified or does not exist in the provided table.\n\nSo, the conclusion would be that the claim is incorrect because there is no tie number8 in the data.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the 'tie number' refers to something else, like an internal reference, but in the context of a table listing matches, it's likely that tie numbers are sequential starting from 1.\n\nThus, without a tie8 entry, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that there is a match referred to as \"Tie No. 8\" in the provided data. However, upon examining the given HTML table, only ties numbered from 1 to 7, along with a special \"replay\" match, are listed. Therefore, there is no entry for Tie No. 8 in the data.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is incorrect because Tie No. 8 does not exist in the provided data.",

The table has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row represents a match between two teams with specific details.\n\nFirst, I'll check if Leicester City is playing against Chelsea at all. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Home team is Chesterfield vs Nottingham Forest.\n- Row 2: Home team is Leicester City vs Chelsea. So here, Leicester City is the home team, and Chelsea is the away team.\n- Row 3: It's a replay of row 2, so again Chelsea plays Leicester City at home but on a later date.\n\nWait, the claim says \"at home,\" so that would mean Leicester City is playing as the home team against Chelsea. In row 2, Leicester City is the home team, which fits because the match was held at their stadium. The attendance for row 2 is 16 February 1997.\n\nBut then I notice that in row 3, it's a replay on 26 February 1997. So there are two matches between these teams: one on 15 Feb and another on 16 Feb.\n\nWait, the claim specifically mentions 16 February 1997 as the date when Leicester City plays Chelsea at home. Looking back, in row 2, the match is on 16 February, with Leicester City as home team vs Chelsea away. So that matches the claim's date and details.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the row where tie no is 2 because that's the specific instance where Leicester City hosts Chelsea on 16 Feb 1997. The columns involved are 'home team' and 'away team'.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 2, columns 'home team' and 'away team'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to suggest that Portsmouth is not the away team in a match where Leeds United is the home team. So, I'm looking for a game where Leeds United is playing at home, and the opposing team isn't Portsmouth.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. The table has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row represents a match with these details.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's a match where Leeds United is the home team and Portsmouth is the away team, or vice versa. Alternatively, I need to check for any match where Leeds United is listed as the home team, and whether Portsmouth is ever the away team in such a scenario.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Tie 1: Home team Chesterfield vs Away Nottingham Forest.\n- Tie 2: Home Leicester City vs Away Chelsea.\n- Tie 3: Home Derby County vs Away Coventry City.\n- Tie 4: Home Manchester City vs Away Middlesbrough.\n- Tie 5: Home Bradford City vs Away Sheffield Wednesday.\n- Tie 6: Home Wimbledon vs Away Queens Park Rangers.\n- Tie 7: Home Leeds United vs Away Portsmouth. Wait, here it is! In tie number 7, the home team is Leeds United and the away team is Portsmouth.\n\nSo, in this case, Leeds United is indeed the home team, and Portsmouth is the away team. Therefore, the claim states that \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\" But according to the table, Portsmouth is the away team when Leeds United is at home, which contradicts the claim.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\" So it's asserting that when Leeds is home, Portsmouth isn't away. However, in tie 7, that's exactly what happened: when Leeds was home, Portsmouth was away. Therefore, the statement in the claim is incorrect because it claims that they aren't the away team, but they were.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the claim again: \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\" So the structure is a bit confusing. It might mean that Portsmouth isn't the away team when Leeds is the home. But in reality, Portsmouth was the away team when Leeds was home (tie 7). Therefore, the statement in the claim is saying that they shouldn't be, but in the table, they are. So the claim is false.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The claim is phrased as \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\" That could be interpreted as when Leeds is home, Portsmouth isn't the away team. But in tie 7, that's exactly what happened: Leeds was home and Portsmouth was away. So the claim says they shouldn't be, but they were, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure of the claim. Let me parse it again: \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united.\" It might mean that in matches where Leeds is home, Portsmouth isn't the away team. But tie 7 shows that Portsmouth was indeed the away team when Leeds was home. Therefore, the claim is false because they were the away team.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key is to see if there's any match where Leeds United is home and Portsmouth is away. Since tie 7 has Leeds as home and Portsmouth as away, that directly contradicts the claim which states that when Leeds is home, Portsmouth isn't away.\n\nSo, the claim is false because in at least one instance, Portsmouth was the away team when Leeds was home.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united,\" we examine each match where Leeds United is the home team. In tie number 7, Leeds United hosts Portsmouth, making Portsmouth the away team. This directly contradicts the claim that Portsmouth isn't the away team when Leeds is home.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Matches Where Leeds United is Home:** Look through each row for entries where \"leeds united\" is listed as the home team.\n2. **Check Opposing Teams in Those Matches:** In tie 7, the home team is Leeds United and the away team is Portsmouth.\n3. **Compare with Claim:** The claim asserts that when Leeds is home, Portsmouth isn't away. However, tie 7 shows Portsmouth was indeed the away team.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because there exists a match where Leeds United is the home team and Portsmouth is the opposing team (away). Therefore, the statement \"portsmouth be not the away team when home be leeds united\" is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"nottingham forest be the away team without a tie number 1\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Nottingham Forest was the away team in a match where there was no tie (i.e., the game didn't end in a draw). The term \"without a tie number 1\" is a bit unclear, but I think it means that there was no tie in the match itself, so the score wasn't something like 0-0 or 1-1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. So, for each row, I can check if Nottingham Forest was the away team and whether their game had a tie (i.e., a draw).\n\nNow, let's go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Tie number is 1. Home team is Chesterfield, away team is Nottingham Forest. The score is 1 - 0. Since it's not a draw, this matches the claim that they were the away team without a tie.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Tie number is 2. Home team is Leicester City, away team is Chelsea. Score is 2 - 2, which is a draw. Not relevant because the claim is about Nottingham Forest being the away team without a tie.\n\n3. **Row 3**: This is a replay of tie number 2. Home team is Chelsea, away team is Leicester City. Score is 1 - 0; no draw here either, but it's not involving Nottingham Forest.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Tie number 3. Home team is Derby County, away team is Coventry City. Score is 3 - 2; no draw, but again, not Nottingham Forest.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Tie number 4. Home team Manchester City, away team Middlesbrough. Score is 0 - 1; no draw, irrelevant for our claim.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Wimbledon vs Queens Park Rangers. No draw, but Nottingham Forest isn't the away team here.\n\n7. **Row 7**: Leeds United vs Portsmouth. No draw, not relevant.\n\n8. **Row 8**: Birmingham City vs Wrexham. Score is 1 - 3; no draw, irrelevant.\n\nSo, from this, the only row where Nottingham Forest was the away team and there was no tie (draw) is Row 1. Therefore, the claim is true based on that single occurrence.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one instance in the table where Nottingham Forest was the away team without a tie.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the tie number with a home team of wrexham be 8\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the 'home team' column to find where 'wrexham' appears as the home team.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Home team is chesterfield\n- Row 2: Leicester City\n- Row 3: Chelsea (replay)\n- Row 4: Derby County\n- Row 5: Manchester City\n- Row 6: Wimbledon\n- Row 7: Leeds United\n- Row 8: Birmingham City\n\nWait, I don't see 'wrexham' listed as the home team in any row. The closest is row 8 where the home team is Birmingham City. So perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. The table has entries from tie numbers 1 to 8, and a replay. None of them list 'wrexham' as the home team. In fact, row 8's away team is wrexham against Birmingham City. So the claim says that the tie number with Wrexham as the home team is 8, but looking at the table, there's no such tie where Wrexham is the home team. The only time Wrexham appears is in the 'away team' column for row 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no tie where Wrexham is the home team with a tie number of 8.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"8 be the tie number with an away team of chelsea.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. The claim is stating that tie number 8 has Chelsea as their away team. So, I should look for a row where the 'tie no' is 8 and the 'away team' is Chelsea.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tie with details like home team, score, etc. The relevant columns here are \"tie no\" and \"away team.\"\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Tie number 1, away team is Nottingham Forest.\n2. Row 2: Tie number 2, away team is Chelsea.\n3. Row 3: Tie number replay (which I think is a special case), away team is Leicester City.\n4. Row 4: Tie number 3, away team is Coventry City.\n5. Row 5: Tie number 4, away team is Middlesbrough.\n6. Row 6: Tie number 5, away team is Sheffield Wednesday.\n7. Row 7: Tie number 6, away team is Queens Park Rangers.\n8. Row 8: Tie number 7, away team is Portsmouth.\n9. Wait, but the rows are labeled from 1 to 8? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table, there are 8 entries:\n\n- The first three have tie numbers 1,2,replay (which I think might be a separate entry, perhaps a playoff or something).\n- Then tie numbers go up: 3,4,5,6,7,8. Wait, in the table provided, the ties are numbered as 1,2, replay, 3,4,5,6,7,8? Or is it that each row has its own tie number?\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nThe first row after the header is tie 1, then tie 2, then 'replay', which might be a different type of match. Then ties 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo, for tie number 8, what's the away team?\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: tie 1, away team Nottingham Forest.\nRow 1: tie 2, away team Chelsea.\nRow 2: replay, away team Leicester City.\nRow 3: tie 3, away team Coventry City.\nRow 4: tie 4, away team Middlesbrough.\nRow 5: tie 5, away team Sheffield Wednesday.\nRow 6: tie 6, away team Queens Park Rangers.\nRow 7: tie 7, away team Portsmouth.\nRow 8: tie 8, away team Wrexham.\n\nWait, but the last row is:\n\n<td>8</td>\n<td>birmingham city</td>\n<td>1 - 3</td>\n<td>wrexham</td>\n<td>15 february 1997</td>\n\nSo tie number 8 has an away team of Wrexham. Chelsea is the away team in tie number 2, which is row index 1.\n\nWait, but the claim is about tie number 8 having Chelsea as the away team. In the table, tie 8's away team is Wrexham, not Chelsea. So the claim would be false because Chelsea isn't the away team for tie number 8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I misread the rows. Let me list out each row with their tie numbers and away teams:\n\nRow index: 0 (tie 1) - home chesterfield, away nottingham forest.\nRow index: 1 (tie 2) - home leicester city, away chelsea.\nRow index: 2 (replay) - home chelsea, away leicester city.\nRow index: 3 (tie 3) - home derby county, away coventry city.\nRow index:4 (tie4) - manchester city vs middlesbrough.\nRow5: tie5: bradford vs sheffield wednesday.\nRow6: tie6: wimbledon vs queens park rangers.\nRow7: tie7: leeds united vs portsmouth.\nRow8: tie8: birmingham city vs wrexham.\n\nSo, in row 1, tie2 has chelsea as away team. So the claim is about tie8 having chelsea as away team, but tie8's away team is wrexham. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting rows. Let me check:\n\nThe table has tbody with 8 <tr> elements? Wait no, looking at the HTML:\n\nLooking at the tbody, it has:\n\n<tr>, <tr>, <tr>, <tr>, <tr>, <tr>, <tr>, <tr>\n\nThat's 8 tr elements, so rows 0-7. So tie numbers are 1 to 8, with each row having a 'tie no' as per the table.\n\nSo, in the 8th row (row index 7), tie number is 8, away team is wrexham.\n\nTherefore, the claim that tie8 has chelsea as away is false because it's wrexham.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that tie number 8 has Chelsea as the away team. However, upon examining the table, tie number 8 involves Birmingham City against Wrexham, making Chelsea the away team only in a different match (tie number 2). Thus, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The columns to check are \"tie no\" and \"away team.\"\n2. **Locate Tie Number 8:** In row index 7, tie number 8 lists Birmingham City as home and Wrexham as away.\n3. **Conclusion:** Chelsea is not the away team for tie number 8.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because in the provided table, tie number 8 has Wrexham as the away team, not Chelsea.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Chelsea be the away team with the home team of Coventry City\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's saying that Chelsea is the away team and the home team in question is Coventry City. So essentially, the claim is stating that in a particular game, Chelsea was the away team against Coventry City.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance date. The columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, attendance.\n\nI need to find if there's any instance where Chelsea is listed as the away team against Coventry City as the home team.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Tie number 1, Home team Chesterfield, Score 1-0, Away team Nottingham Forest. Not relevant since the home team isn't Coventry City.\n2. Row 2: Tie number 2, Home team Leicester City, Score 2-2, Away team Chelsea. Here, Chelsea is the away team against Leicester City, not Coventry.\n3. Row 3: Tie number replay, Home team Chelsea, Score 1-0, Away team Leicester City. Now Chelsea is the home team here, but against Leicester, so not relevant for Coventry.\n4. Row 4: Tie number 3, Home team Derby County, Score 3-2, Away team Coventry City. Here, Coventry City is the away team against Derby. So Chelsea isn't involved here as either team.\n5. Row 5: Tie number 4, Home team Manchester City, Score 0-1, Away team Middlesbrough. Not relevant.\n6. Row 6: Tie number 5, Home team Bradford City, Score 0-1, Away team Sheffield Wednesday. No Chelsea here.\n7. Row 7: Tie number 6, Home team Wimbledon, Score 2-1, Away team Queens Park Rangers. Again, no Chelsea involved.\n8. Row 8: Tie number 7, Home team Leeds United, Score 2-3, Away team Portsmouth. Not relevant.\n9. Row 9: Tie number 8, Home team Birmingham City, Score 1-3, Away team Wrexham. No Chelsea here.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have miscounted the rows. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the table has rows from 1 to 8, with a replay row (row 3). So total 9 rows including the replay. But in any case, looking for where Chelsea is away and Coventry is home.\n\nWait, actually, I'm noticing that in row 4 (tie number 3), the away team is Coventry City against Derby County as home. That's not Chelsea as away. Then, is there a match where Chelsea is away against Coventry?\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n- Row 1: Home Chesterfield, Away Nottingham Forest.\n- Row 2: Home Leicester, Away Chelsea.\n- Row 3: Home Chelsea, Away Leicester (replay).\n- Row 4: Home Derby, Away Coventry.\n- Row 5: Home Man City, Away Middlesbrough.\n- Row 6: Home Bradford, Away Sheffield Wed.\n- Row 7: Home Wimbledon, Away Queens Park.\n- Row 8: Home Leeds, Away Portsmouth.\n- Row 9 (if it's tie number 8): Home Birmingham, Away Wrexham.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row where Chelsea is away against Coventry. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a specific match that isn't listed here or perhaps I'm misunderstanding which rows are relevant.\n\nThe claim says \"Chelsea be the away team with the home team of Coventry City.\" So we need a row where the away team is Chelsea and the home team is Coventry.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Home Chesterfield, Away Nottingham. Not.\n- Row 2: Home Leicester, Away Chelsea. Not Coventry.\n- Row 3: Home Chelsea, Away Leicester. No.\n- Row 4: Home Derby, Away Coventry. So here, home is Derby, away is Coventry. Not relevant for Chelsea as away against Coventry.\nWait, but in this row, the away team is Coventry, so that's not Chelsea.\n\nLooking through all rows, I don't see any where Chelsea is the away team and Coventry City is the home team.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a match where Chelsea is away against Coventry. But from the table provided, it seems that in tie number 3 (row 4), Coventry was the away team against Derby, so they are not home in that case.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim doesn't seem to be supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Chelsea is the away team facing Coventry City at home, we examine each match. None of the rows show Chelsea as the away team against Coventry City as the home team. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
