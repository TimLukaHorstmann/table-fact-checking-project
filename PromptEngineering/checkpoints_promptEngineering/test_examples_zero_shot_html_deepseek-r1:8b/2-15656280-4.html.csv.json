    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"3.0 be the highest number of goal score in the play - offs that have score 2 in the fa cup.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The table has several columns, including 'play - offs' and 'fa cup'. Each row represents a player with their respective data.\n\nI think I need to look at the rows where both 'play - offs' is high and 'fa cup' is 2. Wait, but the claim mentions \"3.0\" as a goal score in play-offs, which might not be an integer since it's written as 3.0. That could mean 3 goals.\n\nI should check each row for both columns. Let me go through each player:\n\n1. Paul Barnes: Play-offs - 1, FA Cup - 2 \u2192 Doesn't have 3 in play-offs.\n2. Kirk Jackson: Play-offs - 0, FA Cup - 1 \u2192 No.\n3. Gregg Blundell: Play-offs - 0, FA Cup - 0 \u2192 No.\n4. Junior Agogo: Both 0 \u2192 No.\n5. Wayne Curtis: 0 and 0 \u2192 No.\n6. Dino Maamria: 0 and 1 \u2192 No.\n7. Daryl Clare: 0 and 0 \u2192 No.\n8. Mark Stein: Play-offs -3, FA Cup -2. Oh, this is interesting. He has 3 in play-offs and 2 in FA Cup.\n9. Christian Moore: 0 and 2 \u2192 Doesn't have 3 in play-offs.\n10. Steve West: 0 and 0 \u2192 No.\n11. David Brown: 0 and 1 \u2192 No.\n12. Neil Grayson: Play-offs -0, FA Cup -5 \u2192 High FA Cup but not relevant since he doesn't have high play-offs.\n13. Mark Stein is the only one with both 3 in play-offs and 2 in FA cup.\n\nWait, so does that mean 3 is the highest? Let me check if any others have higher play-offs. No, looking through all rows, none have more than 3 in play-offs. So 3 is indeed the highest. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"score 2 in the fa cup.\" Does it mean FA Cup should be exactly 2 or at least 2? The example uses \"fa cup\" as a column name, so I think we're looking for where 'fa cup' is 2.\n\nMark Stein has 'fa cup' as 2 and 'play - offs' as 3. So the highest score in play-offs with FA Cup being 2 is 3. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Mark Stein is the only player who has a score of 3 in 'play - offs' and a score of 2 in 'fa cup'. Since there are no other players meeting these criteria with a higher play-off score, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
