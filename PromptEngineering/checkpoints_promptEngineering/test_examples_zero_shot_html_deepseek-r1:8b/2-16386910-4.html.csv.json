    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the san antonio spur play against the los angeles lakers before play against the phoenix sun\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts. The San Antonio Spurs played against the Los Angeles Lakers and then later against the Phoenix Suns. So, I need to check if in the table, there's a game where the opponent is the Lakers followed by the Suns.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with the following columns: date, visitor, score, home, and record. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if any have the Lakers as the opponent before the Suns. Let me scan the 'home' column because that's where the opponent would be listed.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- San Antonio Spurs play against Golden State Warriors.\n- Next, they play Los Angeles Lakers: Home is Lakers? No, home is Warriors and Lakers are visitors in another game.\nWait, I think I might be mixing up. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 0: Visitor is Spurs, Home is Warriors. So that's not Lakers vs. Suns.\nRow 1: Visitor is Spurs, Home is Lakers. So here, the Spurs are playing against Lakers as visitors, meaning Lakers are home? Wait, no, because in the table, 'home' column shows who is hosting. So in row 1, home is Lakers, so the game is Lakers vs. Spurs.\n\nRow 2: Spurs vs. Suns (Phoenix Suns). So that's Lakers not involved here.\n\nRow 3: Hawks vs. Spurs.\nRow 4: Spurs vs. Bucks.\nRow 5: Jazz vs. Spurs.\nRow 6: Knicks vs. Spurs.\nRow 7: Spurs vs. Pacers.\nRow 8: Bulls vs. Spurs.\nRow 9: Cavaliers vs. Spurs.\nRow 10: Warriors vs. Spurs (home is Spurs, so Warriors are visitors).\nWait, no: row 10's home is Spurs because the opponent is Warriors, but in that case, it's Spurs playing against Warriors.\n\nRow 11: Visitor is Bullets (now Wizards), home is Spurs.\nRow 12: Spurs vs. Kings.\nRow 13: 76ers vs. Spurs.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed Lakers somewhere else. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at row 1, the home is Lakers, so that's the game where Lakers hosted Spurs. Now, is there any game after that where Lakers are playing against Suns?\n\nWait, in the table, there's a row for December 3, 1976: visitor is Spurs, home is Lakers. So that's Lakers vs. Spurs.\n\nBut I'm looking for Lakers vs. Suns. In the table, I don't see any games where both Lakers and Suns are involved. The only opponent for Spurs against Suns is on row 2, which is December 5th, 1976: home is Suns, visitor is Spurs. So that's Spurs playing against Suns.\n\nSo in the claim, the Spurs play against Lakers first, then against Suns. Looking at the table, there are multiple games where Spurs played against Lakers and also against Suns. But does a game exist where Lakers were played before Suns?\n\nYes, row 1 is December 3, 1976: Spurs vs. Lakers. Then later, on December 5th, they play against Suns.\n\nSo in the table, yes, there's a game where Spurs played Lakers (row 1) and then later against Suns (row 2). So the claim seems to be TRUE because it's stating that Spurs played Lakers before playing Suns, which aligns with row 1 followed by row 2.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the san antonio spur play against the los angeles lakers before play against the phoenix sun.\" So in terms of order, is there a game where Lakers are played before Suns? Yes, row 1 is Lakers on December 3 and then row 2 is Suns on December 5. So that sequence exists.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the rows for both games: row 1 (Lakers) and row 2 (Suns). But wait, the claim says Spurs play against Lakers before playing against Suns, so in terms of order, yes, Lakers first then Suns. So the relevant cells are where the opponent is Lakers (row 1, home is Lakers) and then where opponent is Suns (row 2, home is Suns).\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any game after row 1 where both Lakers and Suns appear. No, in row 3 onwards, it's other teams.\n\nSo to confirm, the Spurs played against Lakers on December 3 and then against Suns on December 5. So the claim is TRUE because that sequence occurs.\n</think>\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs indeed played against the Los Angeles Lakers before playing against the Phoenix Suns according to the table provided. Specifically, on December 3, 1976, they faced the Lakers, and on December 5, 1976, they played against the Suns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the san antonio spur score more point on december 11 , 1976 than on december 14 , 1976\". \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table correspond to December 11 and December 14, 1976. Looking at the 'date' column:\n\n- December 11, 1976: That's row index 10 (since it starts from 0, right? Let me check the rows. The first row is dec 2, then 3,5,8,10,11,... so row 10 is Dec 11.\n- December 14, 1976: That should be row 13 because the dates are 2,3,5,8,10,11,14,15,17,19,21,23,26,28. Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nRow indices as per the HTML table:\n\n1. dec 2\n2. dec3\n3. dec5\n4. dec8\n5. dec10\n6. dec11 (row index 6)\nWait, wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's list all the dates in order:\n\n- row 0: dec2\n- row1: dec3\n- row2: dec5\n- row3: dec8\n- row4: dec10\n- row5: dec11\n- row6: dec14? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, the rows are:\n\ntr for dec2 (row 0)\ndec3 (1), dec5(2), dec8(3), dec10(4), dec11(5), then dec14 is next? Or wait, after dec11 comes dec14, so row index 6 would be dec14.\n\nWait, let me check the table again. The dates are:\n\n1. dec2\n2. dec3\n3. dec5\n4. dec8\n5. dec10\n6. dec11\n7. dec14\n8. dec15\n9. dec17\n10. dec19\n11. dec21\n12. dec23\n13. dec26\n14. dec28\n\nWait, no, the last row is dec28 as row 14? Wait, in the HTML table, each <tr> is a row, so the first row is index 0, then 1, etc. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the <tbody> section:\n\n<tr> (row 0): dec2\n<tr> (row1): dec3\n<tr> (row2): dec5\n<tr> (row3): dec8\n<tr> (row4): dec10\n<tr> (row5): dec11\n<tr> (row6): dec14\n<tr> (row7): dec15\n<tr> (row8): dec17\n<tr> (row9): dec19\n<tr> (row10): dec21\n<tr> (row11): dec23\n<tr> (row12): dec26\n<tr> (row13): dec28\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in the given HTML, there are 14 <tr> elements, so rows 0 to 13.\n\nSo:\n\ndec2: 0\ndec3:1\ndec5:2\ndec8:3\ndec10:4\ndec11:5\ndec14:6\ndec15:7\ndec17:8\ndec19:9\ndec21:10\ndec23:11\ndec26:12\ndec28:13\n\nYes, so row index 5 is dec11 and row index 6 is dec14.\n\nNext, I need to look at the 'score' column for both dates. The 'score' column is probably in the third position since it's a table with columns: date, opponent, score, etc. So each <tr> has four cells.\n\nSo, for row5 (dec11), the 'score' is in column 2 (0-based index). Similarly, for row6 (dec14).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow5 (dec11): The third cell is \"76-72\" because looking at the scores, San Antonio Spurs are usually listed first. So their score would be the first number.\n\nSimilarly, row6 (dec14): The opponents are the Chicago Bulls, so the score would be \"96-87\".\n\nSo San Antonio's score on dec11: 76 points.\nSan Antonio's score on dec14: 96 points.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in the table, each row shows both teams' scores. For example, in row5 (dec11), it says \"76-72\", so Spurs scored 76.\n\nIn row6 (dec14), the score is \"96-87\", meaning Spurs scored 96.\n\nSo the claim is that San Antonio scored more points on dec11 than on dec14. But according to the table, they scored 76 on dec11 and 96 on dec14. So 96 is higher than 76.\n\nWait, that's contradictory. The claim says Spurs scored more on dec11 than on dec14, but in reality, they scored less on dec11 (76) and more on dec14 (96).\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because their score was higher on dec14, not dec11.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the scores for December 11, 1976 and December 14, 1976. On December 11, the San Antonio Spurs scored 76 points, while on December 14, they scored 96 points. Since their score was higher on December 14, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim is: \"the san antonio spur be the visit team during 8 game.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit unclear. It sounds like it's saying that the San Antonio Spurs were the visiting team in 8 games. So I need to check if there are exactly eight instances where the Spurs were the visitors.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The 'visitor' column lists who the away team was. Wait, but sometimes \"visitor\" might be used interchangeably with \"visiting team.\" So, in this context, the 'visitor' column is likely indicating the home team because when you visit someone, you're not home. Or wait, no, actually, in sports, when a team is visiting another city for a game, they are the away team. So the 'visitor' column might be showing who came to play against the home team.\n\nWait, let me double-check the table's columns. The columns are date, visitor, score, home, and record. So, for each game, the 'visitor' is the team that's visiting another city, meaning they're the away team. Therefore, if the Spurs were visitors, their name would be in the 'visitor' column.\n\nSo I need to count how many times \"san antonio spurs\" appear in the 'visitor' column. Each occurrence means they were the visiting team for that game.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. dec 2, 1976: visitor is Spurs. So that's one.\n2. dec 3, 1976: same, so two.\n3. dec 5, 1976: three.\n4. dec 8, 1976: they're visitors here as well. Four.\n5. dec 10, 1976: five.\n6. dec 11, 1976: six.\n7. dec 14, 1976: seven.\n8. dec 15, 1976: eight.\n9. dec 17, 1976: visitor is Spurs again. That's nine.\n10. dec 19, 1976: tenth.\n11. dec 21, 1976: eleventh.\n12. dec 23, 1976: twelfth.\n13. dec 26, 1976: thirteenth.\n14. dec 28, 1976: fourteenth.\n\nWait, that's more than eight. So the Spurs were visitors in 14 games listed here. But the claim says \"during 8 game.\" So according to the table, there are way more than eight games where they were the visitors. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The claim could be interpreted as whether the Spurs were visiting in exactly eight games, but if the table shows more than eight, then it's false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'home' column indicates their home games, so when they are visitors, they're not in that column. So I think my initial approach was correct\u2014count how many times they appear as visitors.\n\nSince there are 14 such entries, the claim that they were visitors during eight games is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the San Antonio Spurs were the visiting team in exactly 8 games. However, upon reviewing the table, the Spurs appeared as visitors in 14 games. This contradicts the claim, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about the San Antonio Spurs is true or false based on a table provided. The claim is: \"the san antonio spur do not score less than 100 point during any game after december 19 , 1976.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that after December 19, 1976, the Spurs didn't score fewer than 100 points in any of their games. So my task is to check each game after that date and see if they scored less than 100.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists multiple games with dates from December 2, 1976, to December 28, 1976. The relevant part for the claim is after December 19, so I should focus on the games that happened on or after December 21, 1976, because December 21 comes right after December 19.\n\nWait, let me check the dates: The last few rows are December 26 and December 28. So the relevant games are from December 21 onwards. Let's list those:\n\n- December 21, 1976\n- December 23, 1976\n- December 26, 1976\n- December 28, 1976\n\nFor each of these, I need to check their score and see if it's less than 100.\n\nStarting with December 21: The Spurs scored 123 - 120. So that's 123 points. That's above 100.\n\nDecember 23: They scored 116 - 118, which is 116 points. Still above 100.\n\nDecember 26: They had 110 - 105, so 110 points again, still over 100.\n\nFinally, December 28: They scored 116 - 127, totaling 116 points. So all these games after December 19 show the Spurs scoring over 100 each time.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't miss any dates between December 21 and December 26. The table has:\n\n- Dec 21\n- Dec 23\n- Dec 26\n- Dec 28\n\nSo that's all the games after December 19 in the table provided. Since none of these have a score less than 100, the claim holds true.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"after december 19\", so I should include all games after that date, not just the ones on specific days. Let me check if there are any more dates between December 19 and the next mentioned dates in the table. Looking back at the table:\n\nAfter December 19 comes December 21, which is a few days later. So yes, we've covered all the relevant games after that.\n\nTherefore, since none of these post-December 19 games have the Spurs scoring less than 100, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs scored over 100 points in every game after December 19, 1976, as verified by checking each relevant row.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the san antonio spur play against the los angeles lakers after play against the phoenix sun.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions three teams: San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Lakers, and Phoenix Suns. The key actions here are that the Spurs play against the Lakers after playing against the Suns.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game involving two teams with their respective scores. My task is to check if there's a sequence where the Spurs first play the Suns and then later play the Lakers.\n\nI'll go through each row to see the matchups:\n\n1. December 2: Spurs vs Warriors\n2. December 3: Spurs vs Lakers \u2192 This is Lakers, but before playing Suns.\nWait, no, the claim says after playing Suns. So maybe looking for a game where Spurs first play Suns and then later play Lakers.\n\nLet me look for when Spurs play the Suns and then when they play Lakers.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- On December 5: Spurs vs Suns \u2192 This is one of their games.\nThen, do they play Lakers after that? Let's see. Next rows:\n\n- December 8: Hawks vs Spurs\n- December 10: Spurs vs Bucks\n- December 11: Jazz vs Spurs\n- December 14: Knicks vs Spurs\n- December 15: Pacers vs Spurs\n- December 17: Bulls vs Spurs\n- December 19: Cavaliers vs Spurs\n- December 21: Warriors vs Spurs\n- December 23: Bullets vs Spurs\n- December 26: Spurs vs Kings\n- December 28: 76ers vs Spurs\n\nWait, after December 5 (Suns), the next time Spurs play Lakers is... Looking at the table, I don't see any other rows where Spurs face Lakers except on December 3 and December 21.\n\nOn December 3, Spurs play Lakers. But before that, on December 2, they played Warriors, then December 3 Lakers. So the sequence is Warriors then Lakers, not Suns first.\n\nLooking again, the only time Spurs play Suns is on December 5. After that, the next Lakers game is December 10 against Bucks? No, December 10 is Bucks. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the table has multiple rows. Let me list out all the Spurs games and their opponents:\n\n- Dec2: Warriors\n- Dec3: Lakers\n- Dec5: Suns\n- Dec8: Hawks (opponent is Hawks)\n- Dec10: Bucks\n- Dec11: Jazz\n- Dec14: Knicks\n- Dec15: Pacers\n- Dec17: Bulls\n- Dec19: Cavaliers\n- Dec21: Warriors again\n- Dec23: Bullets\n- Dec26: Kings\n- Dec28: 76ers\n\nSo the Spurs play Lakers on December 3. Before that, they played Warriors on Dec2. Then after playing Suns on Dec5, do they play Lakers? Looking ahead from Dec5, the next games are:\n\nDec8: Hawks\nDec10: Bucks\nDec11: Jazz\n...\nWait, I don't see any Lakers game after Dec5. The only other Lakers game is on Dec3, which was before the Suns game on Dec5.\n\nSo in the table, the sequence would be:\n\n1. Warriors (Dec2)\n2. Lakers (Dec3)\n3. Suns (Dec5)\n\nBut according to the claim, it's Spurs playing against Lakers after first playing against Suns. So the correct order should be Suns first, then Lakers.\n\nIn the table, the order is Warriors, Lakers, then later Suns on Dec5. That doesn't match the claim's sequence of Suns first, then Lakers.\n\nTherefore, there isn't a row where Spurs play Suns and then later play Lakers in the same season based on this table. The only time they play Lakers is before playing Suns.\n\nSo the claim would be incorrect because the order in the table doesn't support it. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

The columns include 'date', 'visitor', 'score', 'home', and 'record'. \n\nI need to find if there's a game where the Spurs play against the Kings after playing the Cavaliers. So I should look for rows where the home team is the Cavaliers, indicating that the Spurs played them first, and then later, when they are visiting, they play the Kings.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. December 2: Spurs visit Warriors, so not relevant.\n2. December 3: Spurs vs Lakers, no.\n3. December 5: Spurs vs Suns, no.\n4. December 8: Hawks vs Spurs, no.\n5. December 10: Spurs vs Bucks, no.\n6. December 11: Jazz vs Spurs, no.\n7. December 14: Knicks vs Spurs, no.\n8. December 15: Spurs vs Pacers, no.\n9. December 17: Spurs vs Bulls, no.\n10. December 19: Spurs vs Cavaliers\u2014this is the Spurs playing against the Cavaliers at home.\n11. December 21: Warriors vs Spurs\u2014now, after playing the Cavaliers, the Spurs are visiting the Warriors? Wait, no, that's not Kings.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"after play against the cleveland cavalier,\" so the next game should be against the Kings.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- On December 19, the Spurs host the Cavaliers (row 9).\n- Then, on December 21, the Warriors host the Spurs (row 10). This is not the Kings.\n- Next, row 11: Wizards vs Spurs? Wait, no, row 11 is December 23: Washington Bullets vs Spurs\u2014no.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if there's a game where after playing Cavaliers, they play Kings. Let me list the games in order:\n\nLooking at the dates in order:\n\n- Dec 19: Spurs vs Cavs (Spurs are home)\n- Next is Dec 21: Warriors vs Spurs\u2014so after Cavs, they're visiting the Warriors.\n- Then Dec 23: Wizards vs Spurs\n- Dec 26: Spurs vs Kings (this is the only game where Spurs play against Kings)\n\nSo, on Dec 26, the Spurs are away against Kings. Is there a game right after the Cavaliers? The next game after Cavs is on Dec 21 against Warriors, not Kings.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for any instance where they played Kings after Cavs. So in row 9 (Dec 19), Spurs host Cavs. Then, later, on Dec 26, Spurs visit Kings. But that's two weeks later, not immediately after. The claim says \"after play against\" which might mean the next game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not about the sequence but whether they played both teams in any order. So if there's a row where the home is Cavaliers and another where the visitor is Kings or vice versa.\n\nLooking for games involving Cavs: only Dec 19, Spurs host Cavs.\n\nLooking for games involving Kings: Dec 26, Spurs visit Kings.\n\nSo the Spurs have played against both Cavs and Kings, but in separate rows. Therefore, does this satisfy the claim? The claim says they play against KC after playing Cavs. So is there a game where after playing Cavs, they immediately play KC?\n\nNo, because after Dec 19 (Cavs), the next Spurs game is on Dec 21 vs Warriors. There's no KC in that time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about any point where they played KC after Cavs, not necessarily immediately after. If so, then the Spurs have played both, but it's not clear if it's in sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row to see if after a Cavaliers game, there's a Kings game.\n\nLooking for any instance where the home is Cavs (Dec 19), and then later in the table, Spurs play KC. So Dec 26, Spurs are visitors against KC. So yes, after playing Cavs, they played KC. Therefore, this would support the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- The row where Cavs are hosted by Spurs (row 9): column 'home' is Cleveland Cavaliers.\n- The row where Kings host Spurs (row 12 if considering a later date, but looking at the provided table, it's Dec 26, which is row index 12 in the list. Wait, let me count the rows.\n\nWait, the table has 29 rows? No, wait, from the provided data, I see 29 rows after 'tbody' starts, but perhaps the user counts them as 0-indexed.\n\nWait, looking back, the instruction says to return a JSON with row_index (int) and column_name. So each row is indexed starting at 0.\n\nSo let me list the rows with their indices:\n\n0: Dec2 - Warriors vs Spurs\n1: Dec3 - Lakers vs Spurs\n2: Dec5 - Suns vs Spurs\n3: Dec8 - Hawks vs Spurs\n4: Dec10 - Bucks vs Spurs\n5: Dec11 - Jazz vs Spurs\n6: Dec14 - Knicks vs Spurs\n7: Dec15 - Pacers vs Spurs\n8: Dec17 - Bulls vs Spurs\n9: Dec19 - Cavaliers vs Spurs\n10: Dec21 - Warriors vs Spurs\n11: Dec23 - Wizards vs Spurs (I think the original table might have been truncated, but let's proceed as given)\n12: Dec26 - Kings vs Spurs\n13: Dec28 - Warriors vs Spurs? Or maybe another team.\n14: Dec29 - Pacers vs Spurs?\nWait, perhaps I should count based on the provided data.\n\nLooking at the user-provided table:\n\nThe 'tbody' has multiple rows, each with date, visitor, home, and score. Let me count them as per the given data.\n\nFrom the user's input:\n\n- row 0: Dec2 - visitor is Spurs? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, the first row after tbody starts is:\n\nDec2, visitor is Warriors, home is Spurs.\n\nSo the rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0:\nDate: Dec 2\nVisitor: Warriors\nHome: Spurs\n\nRow1:\nDate: Dec3\nVisitor: Lakers\nHome: Spurs\n\n...\n\nContinuing this way up to row13 or so.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count each row based on the data given. Let me list them with their indices:\n\n0: Dec2 - visitor: Warriors vs home: Spurs\n1: Dec3 - visitor: Lakers vs home: Spurs\n2: Dec5 - visitor: Suns vs home: Spurs\n3: Dec8 - visitor: Hawks vs home: Spurs\n4: Dec10 - visitor: Bucks vs home: Spurs\n5: Dec11 - visitor: Jazz vs home: Spurs\n6: Dec14 - visitor: Knicks vs home: Spurs\n7: Dec15 - visitor: Pacers vs home: Spurs\n8: Dec17 - visitor: Bulls vs home: Spurs\n9: Dec19 - visitor: Cavaliers vs home: Spurs\n10: Dec21 - visitor: Warriors vs home: Spurs\n11: Dec23 - visitor: Wizards vs home: Spurs\n12: Dec26 - visitor: Kings vs home: Spurs\n13: Dec28 - visitor: Warriors vs home: Spurs\n14: Dec29 - visitor: Pacers vs home: Spurs\n15: Dec31 - visitor: Bulls vs home: Spurs\n\nWait, perhaps the exact indices may vary based on how many rows are present. But for this analysis, let's focus on the relevant games.\n\nThe claim is about Spurs playing against KC after Cavs.\n\nSo first, looking for when Spurs play Cavaliers:\n\nIn row9 (Dec19), Spurs host Cavaliers as home team. So column 'home' is Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThen, looking for a game where Spurs play Kings: this occurs in row12 (Dec26), where Kings are the home team, and Spurs are visitors.\n\nTherefore, after playing Cavaliers (row9), there's a game against Kings (row12). However, the next game after row9 is row10 (Dec21 vs Warriors), not KC. So it's not immediately after.\n\nBut the claim says \"after play against\" which might mean at any point later. So if Spurs have played both Cavs and KC, that would fit. Therefore, the relevant rows are:\n\n- row9: home is Cleveland Cavaliers\n- row12: visitor is Kings\n\nThus, the JSON would include these two cells.\n\nBut wait, in row12, the home team is Kings, so column 'home' is Kings. So perhaps it's better to consider which team is which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relevant columns are 'visitor' or 'home' depending on who is playing whom.\n\nThe claim is that Spurs played KC after Cavs. So:\n\n- In row9, home is Cleveland Cavaliers (so 'home' is Cavs)\n- In row12, visitor is Kings (so 'visitor' is KC)\n\nThus, the relevant columns are 'home' for Cavs and 'visitor' for KC.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should include:\n\nrow9: column 'home' = 'Cleveland Cavaliers'\n\nrow12: column 'visitor' = 'Kings'\n\nSo in terms of indices, row9 and row12.\n\nHence, the JSON would be:\n\n[\n  { \"rowIndex\": 9, \"columnName\": \"home\", \"value\": \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" },\n  { \"rowIndex\": 12, \"columnName\": \"visitor\", \"value\": \"Kings\" }\n]\n\nAlternatively, if considering that in row9, it's visitor vs home, but the 'visitor' is Cavs. Wait no, in row9, visitor is Cavaliers, and home is Spurs.\n\nWait, wait, in row9: date is Dec19, visitor is Cavaliers, home is Spurs. So for this game, the visitor is Cavaliers, meaning they are playing against Spurs (home team). So to identify which team is which, perhaps it's better to note that in row9, the visiting team is Cavs.\n\nSimilarly, in row12, Kings are the home team, so visitors are Spurs.\n\nThus, the relevant data points are:\n\n- In row9: visitor is Cavs\n- In row12: home is KC\n\nTherefore, columns 'visitor' and 'home' respectively.\n\nSo the JSON would include these two rows.\n\nThus, the final answer includes these cells.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant data points confirming that the Cleveland Cavaliers played against the San Antonio Spurs before the Spurs faced the Kings are:\n\n1. On December 19th, the Cleveland Cavaliers were visitors against the Spurs.\n2. On December 26th, the Spurs faced the Kings as visitors.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 9,\n    \"columnName\": \"visitor\",\n    \"value\": \"Cleveland Cavaliers\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 12,\n    \"columnName\": \"home\",\n    \"value\": \"Kings\"\n  }\n]\n```",

The claim states: \"The San Antonio Spur score equal point on December 11, 1976 and on December 14, 1976.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant rows for those specific dates. Scanning each row's date column:\n\n- December 11, 1976: This is row index 6.\n- December 14, 1976: This is row index 7.\n\nNext, I need to check the score for each of these days. The 'score' column shows the game results as \"visitor\" vs \"home\". For example, on December 11, the San Antonio Spurs are listed as the visitor against the Golden State Warriors with a score of 106 - 121. So their score is 106 points.\n\nLooking at December 14: The San Antonio Spurs are again the visitor, this time against the New York Knicks, with a score of 98 - 111. Here, the Spurs scored 98 points.\n\nThe claim says that on both dates, the Spurs' score was equal in points. However, according to the table:\n\n- December 11: Spurs scored 106.\n- December 14: Spurs scored 98.\n\nThese are not equal. Therefore, the claim is false because their scores were different on those two dates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says, \"the San Antonio Spur be the visit team less frequently than they be the home team.\" Hmm, first, I should make sure I understand what each part of this claim means.\n\nSo, looking at the table, there are columns for date, visitor, score, home, and record. The 'visitor' column seems to represent the away team, and the 'home' column is the home team for each game. The San Antonio Spur, or Spurs as I know them, play both home and away games.\n\nThe claim is saying that the Spurs are the visiting team less frequently than when they're the home team. So, in other words, do the Spurs have more home games than away games? Or conversely, are their away games fewer in number compared to their home games?\n\nTo check this, I need to look at each row and see whether the visitor is the Spurs or the home team is the Spurs. Then count how many times they are visitors versus how often they host.\n\nSo, going through each row:\n\n1. December 2, 1976: Visitor is San Antonio Spurs. So that's one away game.\n2. December 3, 1976: Same as above. Second away game.\n3. December 5, 1976: Again, visitor is Spurs. Third away game.\n4. December 8, 1976: Home team is Spurs. So that's a home game for them.\n5. December 10, 1976: Visitor is Spurs again. Fourth away game.\n6. December 11, 1976: Home is Spurs. That's the second home game.\n7. December 14, 1976: Home is Spurs. Third home game.\n8. December 15, 1976: Visitor is Spurs. Fifth away game.\n9. December 17, 1976: Home is Spurs. Fourth home game.\n10. December 19, 1976: Home is Spurs. Fifth home game.\n11. December 21, 1976: Visitor is Spurs. Sixth away game.\n12. December 23, 1976: Home is Spurs. Sixth home game.\n13. December 26, 1976: Visitor is Spurs. Seventh away game.\n14. December 28, 1976: Home is Spurs. Seventh home game.\n\nWait, let me count again because I might have messed up the numbers. Let's list each row with their type:\n\n- Row 0: visitor = Spurs (away)\n- Row1: same\n- Row2: same\n- Row3: home = Spurs (home)\n- Row4: visitor = Spurs (away)\n- Row5: home = Spurs (home)\n- Row6: home = Spurs (home)\n- Row7: visitor = Spurs (away)\n- Row8: home = Spurs (home)\n- Row9: home = Spurs (home)\n- Row10: visitor = Spurs (away)\n- Row11: home = Spurs (home)\n- Row12: home = Spurs (home)\n- Row13: visitor = Spurs (away)\n- Row14: home = Spurs (home)\n\nNow, count the number of times they are away vs. home.\n\nAway games for Spurs:\nRows 0,1,2,4,7,10,13 \u2192 that's 7 games.\n\nHome games for Spurs:\nRows3,5,6,8,9,11,12,14 \u2192 wait, rows3 is one, then rows5,6 are two more, rows8,9,11,12,14. Let me count again:\n\nRow3: 1\nRow5: 2\nRow6: 3\nRow8:4\nRow9:5\nRow11:6\nRow12:7\nRow14:8\n\nSo Spurs have 8 home games and 7 away games in the table.\n\nThat means they played more home games than away games. So, as per the claim, \"the San Antonio Spur be the visit team less frequently than they be the home team.\" Since being a visitor is less frequent (7 times) compared to being the home team (8 times), the claim holds true.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that in each of these rows, the Spurs are either visitor or home. So yes, 8 vs 7. Therefore, they have more home games than away, so visiting is less frequent than hosting.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the San Antonio Spur's visitation frequency is less than their home team status, we analyzed each game in the table. The Spurs played 7 away games and 8 home games. This confirms that their away games are fewer, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that the San Antonio Spurs did not score less than 100 points in any game before December 19, 1976.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand what each column represents. The table has columns: date, visitor, score, home, and record. My focus is on the 'visitor' (which team) and their scores. Since the claim is about the San Antonio Spurs as the visitor, I need to check all games where they were the visitor and see if any of those games had them scoring less than 100 points before December 19, 1976.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. Starting from the top:\n\n1. **December 2, 1976**: San Antonio Spurs vs Golden State Warriors. Their score is 116 - 124. So the Spurs scored 116 points here. That's above 100.\n2. **December 3, 1976**: Same opponent, but the Spurs scored 105-114, so 105 points. Still above 100.\n3. **December 5, 1976**: Against Phoenix Suns, they scored 98 - 103. Wait, that's 98 points. That's below 100.\n4. But wait, December 19, 1976 is the cutoff date. So any game before that date needs to be checked.\n\nWait, let me check all rows where the Spurs are the visitor and the date is before December 19. Looking at each row:\n\n- December 2: 116 (above)\n- December 3: 105 (above)\n- December 5: 98 (below)\n- December 8: They're playing as home, so not relevant for visitor.\nWait, no, in the table, 'visitor' is the team listed second. So on December 8, the Hawks are visitors against Spurs (San Antonio). So that's not relevant unless the Spurs are visitors elsewhere.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The claim is about the Spurs as visitors scoring less than 100 points before Dec 19. So I need to find any row where the visitor is San Antonio Spurs and the date is before December 19, 1976, and their score is less than 100.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **December 2**: Spurs visitor? Yes. Score: 116.\n2. **December 3**: Same, score 105.\n3. **December 5**: Same, score 98. That's below 100.\n4. Then December 8: Visitor is Atlanta Hawks, so not relevant for Spurs as visitors.\n5. December 10: Spurs visitor again. Score 136, which is above 100.\n6. December 11: Visitor is New Orleans Jazz, not Spurs.\n7. December 14: Visitor is Knicks, not Spurs.\n8. December 15: Visitor is Indiana Pacers, nope.\n9. December 17: Visitor is Bulls, nope.\n10. December 19: Date is exactly the cutoff, but I think before means up to Dec 19? Wait, \"before\" usually doesn't include the date itself, so maybe only games before Dec 19.\n\nSo in that case, looking for dates strictly before Dec 19:\n\n- December 2\n- December 3\n- December 5\n- December 8 (but Spurs are home)\n- December 10: Spurs visitor, score 136.\n- December 11: Jazz visitors.\n- December 14: Knicks visitors.\n- December 15: Pacers visitors.\n- December 17: Bulls visitors.\n- December 19 is the cutoff.\n\nWait, in the rows, December 5 is before Dec 19. So on that date, Spurs as visitor scored 98, which is below 100. Therefore, there's at least one game where they scored less than 100 as a visitor before Dec 19, 1976.\n\nThat would mean the claim is false because it states they don't score less than 100 in any such game, but December 5th game shows they did.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because on December 5, 1976, the San Antonio Spurs scored 98 points as visitors, which is below 100.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the san antonio spur play against the kansas city king before play against the cleveland cavalier.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions three teams: San Antonio Spur (which I think is a typo and should be Spurs), Kansas City King, and Cleveland Cavalier. The key points are the order of games: Spur plays against King first, then later plays against Cavalier.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the date, visitor, score, home team, and record. So, I need to check if San Antonio Spur (visitor) played against Kansas City King before they played against Cleveland Cavalier.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row in the table:\n\n1. December 2, 1976: Visitor is Spurs vs. Warriors. Not relevant.\n2. December 3, 1976: Spurs vs Lakers. No.\n3. Dec 5: Spurs vs Suns. No.\n4. Dec 8: Hawks vs Spurs.Visitor is Hawks. So, the home team is Spurs. Wait, but the claim is about Spurs playing away games. Not sure if this affects anything yet.\n\nWait, actually, in each row, the visitor is the team that's playing away, and the home team is the one hosting. So, when Spurs are visitors, they're playing on the road against another team.\n\nLooking for rows where Spurs are the visitor:\n\n- Dec 2: Spurs vs Warriors (home Warriors)\n- Dec 3: Spurs vs Lakers (home Lakers)\n- Dec 5: Spurs vs Suns\n- Dec 8: Hawks vs Spurs (so home is Spurs, visitor is Hawks)\nWait, no. Wait, in each row, the first cell is date, second is visitor, third is score, then home team.\n\nSo for example, on Dec 2, visitor is Spurs, so they are playing away against Warriors at Warriors' home. Similarly, Dec 3: Spurs (visitor) vs Lakers (home). So these are games where Spurs are the away team.\n\nThen, looking for when Spurs play against Kings and Cavaliers.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- On Dec 26, visitor is Spurs, home is Kansas City Kings. So that's a Spurs vs Kings game.\n- Then, on Dec 21: Warriors vs Spurs (so Spurs as visitors) but opponent is Warriors, not Cavaliers.\nWait, then looking for when Spurs play against Cavaliers.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Dec 17: Spurs (visitor) vs Bulls (home). Not Cavaliers.\n- Dec 19: Spurs (visitor) vs Cavaliers. So on Dec 19, Spurs played against Cavaliers.\n\nSo now, I need to see if Kings game happened before Cavaliers game.\n\nFrom the table, the Kings game is on Dec 26. The Cavaliers game is on Dec 19.\n\nWait, that can't be right because Dec 19 comes before Dec 26. So if the claim says Spurs play Kings before Cavaliers, but according to the table, they played Cavaliers first, then Kings.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me check the exact dates:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Dec 2: Warriors\n- Dec 3: Lakers\n- Dec 5: Suns\n- Dec 8: Hawks vs Spurs (so home team is Spurs)\n- Dec 10: Bucks\n- Dec 11: Jazz\n- Dec 14: Knicks\n- Dec 15: Pacers\n- Dec 17: Bulls\n- Dec 19: Cavaliers (Cleveland Cavalier)\n- Dec 21: Warriors again\n- Dec 23: Washington Bullets\n- Dec 26: Kings (KC Kings)\n- Dec 28: 76ers\n\nSo the games for Spurs as visitor:\n\n- Dec 2 vs Warriors\n- Dec 3 vs Lakers\n- Dec 5 vs Suns\n- Dec 19 vs Cavaliers\n- Dec 26 vs KC Kings\n\nSo the order is: Cavs on Dec 19, then Kings on Dec 26. Therefore, in the table, Spurs played against Cavaliers before playing against Kings.\n\nBut the claim says Spurs play against Kings before Cavs. So that would mean the claim is FALSE because the opposite happened.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim says \"play against the kansas city king before play against the cleveland cavalier.\" So it's suggesting that KC King game comes before Cleveland Cavalier game.\n\nBut according to the table, Spurs played Cavaliers on Dec 19 and Kings on Dec 26. So Cavs first, then Kings. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says Kings before Cavs, but in reality, Cavs were played earlier.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me confirm if the games are indeed in that order.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\nDec 19: Cavaliers\nDec 26: Kings\n\nYes, Dec 19 is before Dec 26. So Spurs played Cavaliers first, then Kings.\n\nTherefore, the claim is saying that Spurs play Kings before Cavs, which is not true. So answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: We need to identify all rows where Spurs are playing as visitor against both KC King and Cleveland Cavalier.\n\nSo for KC Kings:\n\nLooking at the table, Spurs vs KC Kings is on Dec 26, row index 12 (assuming rows start from 0). Wait, let's count the rows:\n\nThe table has 29 rows (from 0 to 28), as each line in the HTML is a <tr> tag. So Dec 2 is row 0? Or does the first row correspond to the first data row?\n\nWait, looking at the table, it starts with a header row: <thead>, then tbody with multiple rows. Each row in tbody is a game.\n\nLooking at the given table:\n\nThe first row after header is December 2, 1976: that would be row index 0.\n\nSo let's list all rows where Spurs are visitor against KC King and Cleveland Cavalier.\n\n1. San Antonio Spurs vs Kansas City Kings: occurs on Dec 26, 1976 (row 12 in the tbody). So in the table, it's row index 12.\n\n2. San Antonio Spurs vs Cleveland Cavaliers: occurs on Dec 19, 1976 (row index 18).\n\nWait, let me list all rows:\n\nRow 0: Dec 2\n1: Dec3\n2: Dec5\n3: Dec8\n4: Dec10\n5: Dec11\n6: Dec14\n7: Dec15\n8: Dec17\n9: Dec19 (Cavs)\n10: Dec21\n11: Dec23\n12: Dec26 (Kings)\n13: Dec28\n\nWait, no. Wait, the table provided is as follows:\n\nLooking at the initial table structure:\n\nThe tbody has 29 rows (assuming each <tr> is a row). Let's list them with their indices and details.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to find the exact rows where Spurs are the visitor against Kings and Cavaliers.\n\nFrom the given data, Spurs play KC King on Dec26: so that's one cell. They also play Cavaliers on Dec19: that's another.\n\nSo in the table:\n\n- Row for Dec26: Spurs vs KC Kings\n- Row for Dec19: Spurs vs Cavs\n\nTherefore, relevant cells are these two rows.\n\nSo to answer, the claim is FALSE because the order is opposite. And the relevant cells are the ones where Spurs played KC King and Cleveland Cavalier.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the san antonio spur play against the kansas city king before play against the cleveland cavalier,\" we need to check if San Antonio Spurs (visitor) played against Kansas City Kings before Cleveland Cavaliers. \n\nFrom the table, the games occurred on December 26, 1976 (Spurs vs. KC Kings), and December 19, 1976 (Spurs vs. Cleveland Cavaliers). The Cavaliers game happened before the Kings game, so the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are those where Spurs played KC Kings and Cleveland Cavaliers as visitors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
