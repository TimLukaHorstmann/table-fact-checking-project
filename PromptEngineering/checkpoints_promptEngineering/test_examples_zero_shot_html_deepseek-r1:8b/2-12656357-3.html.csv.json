    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to check if Ireland's claim is true based on the table provided. The claim states that Ireland scored only 1 silver medal and no other medals. So I should look for how many silver and other medals Ireland has.\n\nFirst, I'll search for Ireland in the table. Let me go through each row until I find Ireland. Here it is: Row 32, which is Ireland. Now, looking at their medal count: Silver Medals are 1, Gold Medals are 0, Bronze Medals are 0. So that's one silver and no gold or bronze.\n\nThe claim says \"no other medals,\" so I need to check if there are any other types of medals besides the ones mentioned. The table has Gold, Silver, Bronze, and maybe others like Green, Red, etc., but in this context, I think only the main medals are considered for such claims. Since Ireland only has 1 silver and no gold or bronze, it seems they didn't win any other medals.\n\nWait, does \"other medals\" include more than just gold and bronze? If so, since there's nothing else, maybe it's correct. Alternatively, if \"other medals\" refers to higher counts, but here it's zero for the rest. So I think the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
