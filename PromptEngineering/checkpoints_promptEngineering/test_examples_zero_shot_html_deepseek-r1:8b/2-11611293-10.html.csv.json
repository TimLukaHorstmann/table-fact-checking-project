    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"lj burger be a player on 19 - 2 - 2003\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: catches, player, versus, venue, and date. Each row represents a different match or event with details filled in those columns.\n\nThe claim mentions \"lj burger\" as the player and specifies the date \"19 - 2 - 2003\". So, I need to check if there's a row where the player is \"lj burger\" and the date matches that specified.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table one by one. Starting from the top:\n\n1. The first row has catches=4, player=m kaif, versus=sri lanka, venue=johannesburg, date=10 - 03 - 2003. No match here since the player isn't \"lj burger\" and the date is March, not February.\n\n2. Second row: catches=3, player=v sehwag, versus=netherlands, venue=paarl, date=12 - 02 - 2003. Player is different, so moving on.\n\n3. Third row: catches=3, player=lj burger, versus=england, venue=port elizabeth, date=19 - 02 - 2003. Oh, here we go! The player's name matches \"lj burger\" and the date is exactly \"19 - 2 - 2003\". That fits perfectly.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows with the same player or date to ensure this isn't a duplicate, but in this case, since the claim specifically mentions both the player and the exact date, only one row meets both conditions.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the ones in that third row: row index 2 (since it's zero-based), and the columns \"player\" and \"date\". \n\nWait, no. Let me count the rows again. The first row is index 0, so the third row would be index 2? Yes. So, row_index=2, column_names=\"player\" and \"date\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by this specific row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe player \"lj burger\" appears on February 19, 2003, matching the claim exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"jp maher have a date of 19 - 02 - 2003.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see what information it contains. The table has several columns: catches, player, versus, venue, and date. Each row represents a different player with their corresponding details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"jp maher,\" so my first thought is to find jp maher's row in the table. I'll scan through each row:\n\n1. First row: m kaif \u2013 not jp maher.\n2. Second row: v sehwag \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: lj burger \u2013 no, that's another player.\n4. Fourth row: jp maher \u2013 yes, this is the one.\n\nNow, I need to check what the date is for jp maher in that fourth row. According to the table, the date is \"19 - 02 - 2003.\" The claim says jp maher has a date of \"19 - 02 - 2003,\" which matches exactly what's listed here.\n\nSo, since the date provided in the claim aligns perfectly with the date in the table for jp maher, the claim must be TRUE. \n\nTo be thorough, I should also identify the relevant cells that confirm this. The relevant cells would be the row where jp maher is listed and specifically the date column. So, looking at the fourth row (index 3), the columns involved are \"player\" and \"date.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "m kaif have 4 catch vs sri lanka",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"m kaif have 4 catch vs sri lanka\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The claim mentions two specific players: \"m kaif\" and the opponent team \"sri lanka\". It states that m kaif has 4 catches against Sri Lanka. So, my goal is to find in the table if there's a row where the player is \"m kaif\", the number of catches is 4, and the versus column shows Sri Lanka.\n\nI'll start by examining each row of the table to see if any match these criteria. The table has columns: catches, player, versus, venue, date.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- catches: 4\n- player: m kaif\n- versus: sri lanka\n\nThis seems to directly match the claim. The number of catches is indeed 4, the player is m kaif, and the opponent is Sri Lanka.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check all other rows to ensure there's no other instance that might affect the answer. However, since the first row already matches perfectly, it's unnecessary, but for completeness:\n\nThe second row has catches by v sehwag against Netherlands\u2014doesn't match.\nThird: lj burger vs England\u2014nope.\nFourth: jp maher vs Netherlands\u2014no.\nFifth: hh dippenaar vs Bangladesh\u2014nope.\nSixth: d mongia vs Namibia\u2014no.\nSeventh: v sehwag vs England again, but catches are 3.\nEighth: af giles vs Australia.\n\nNone of these match m kaif having 4 catches against Sri Lanka. So the claim is fully supported by the first row.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant cells would be the ones where player is \"m kaif\", catches is 4, versus is \"sri lanka\". In terms of columns, that's 'catches', 'player', and 'versus'. But since we're mapping each relevant cell, I should note each individual cell.\n\nEach row has multiple cells. So for the first row (row_index 0), all four cells are relevant because they contain the information needed to support the claim: catches=4, player=m kaif, versus=Sri Lanka, and venue=johannesburg (though venue isn't part of the claim, but it's still part of the data).\n\nWait, no. The claim doesn't mention venue, so perhaps only the 'catches', 'player', and 'versus' columns are relevant for this specific claim. However, the user's example includes all cells in their answer, including venue. But in our case, since the claim doesn't reference venue, maybe only the three columns are needed.\n\nWait no, looking at the example provided by the user: they included the relevant_cells as a list of objects with row_index and column_name. So for each cell that is relevant to verifying the claim, they include it. The claim \"m kaif have 4 catch vs sri lanka\" requires checking three pieces of information: number of catches, player name, and opponent. Therefore, in the first row, all these three columns are present.\n\nBut perhaps I should only list the cells corresponding to the specific data points needed for the claim. The claim is about catches, player, versus. So, 'catches' (column 0), 'player' (column 1), and 'versus' (column 2). Therefore, in row_index 0, these three columns are relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all cells in that row are considered because the entire row pertains to m kaif's performance. But I think it's more precise to state only the specific columns: catches, player, versus.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be each of those three columns in row 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the first row of the table where \"m kaif\" has 4 catches against Sri Lanka. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"catches\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"versus\"}\n  ]\n}",
