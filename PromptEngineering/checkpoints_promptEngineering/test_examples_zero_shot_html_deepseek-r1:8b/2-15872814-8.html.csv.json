    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"w 109 - 101 (ot) be the score on april 8\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a game where the score was \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\". I know that in basketball scores, the \"w\" stands for a win and the \"l\" for a loss. The numbers represent the team's points followed by the opponent's points. The \"(ot)\" likely means an overtime period.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a game with details like date, team, score, etc. So I need to find the row where the date is April 8 and check if the score matches.\n\nStarting from the top, the first row is game 72 on April 1. That's not it. Game 73 is April 3 against Detroit. No. Then game 74 on April 6 against Memphis. Still not April 8. Game 75 is April 8 against Atlanta.\n\nWait, that's the one. So game number 75 happened on April 8. Let me check the score for that row. The score cell says \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\". That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are satisfied: the date is correct as April 8, the game was against Atlanta, and the score is as mentioned. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in atlanta with a score of w109 - 101 (ot) rafter alston have 8 high assist\". \n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table. Let's parse the claim into key components:\n\n1. **Location**: Atlanta\n2. **Score**: W109 - 101 (OT)\n3. **Player**: Rafter Alston\n4. **Statistic**: 8 high assists\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find the relevant rows and columns that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, team, score, etc. The location is given in the 'location attendance' column, the score is in the 'score' column, and player stats are in 'high points', 'high rebounds', and 'high assists'.\n\nI'll start by identifying which games were played in Atlanta. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 75: Atlanta, April 8, Score W109 - 101 (OT), High Assists?\n- Other rows like 78,79, etc., are for other locations like New York, New Jersey, etc.\n\nSo, the relevant game is row 75.\n\nNext, checking the score: it's indeed a win with a score of 109-101 in overtime, which matches \"w109 - 101 (ot)\" from the claim. So the score part checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the player statistics for Rafter Alston in that game. The 'high assists' column for row 75 shows \"rafer alston (8)\". Wait, the claim says \"rafter alston have 8 high assist\". However, in the table, it's written as \"rafer alston (8)\". I notice a typo: \"rafer\" vs \"rafter\". Is this significant?\n\nWait, no, the player's name is \"rafer alston\", but the claim refers to \"rafter alston\". That might be a problem. So the correct name in the table is \"rafer alston\", not \"rafter alston\". Therefore, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's just a typo and both refer to the same player. But considering the names are different, it could mean that Rafter Alston isn't listed as having 8 high assists in Atlanta with that score.\n\nWait, but let me check again. In row 75, 'high assist' is \"rafer alston (8)\". So if the claim refers to \"rafter alston\", maybe there's a typo, or perhaps I'm misreading it. Maybe both versions are correct, and it's just a variation in spelling.\n\nBut assuming that \"rafter\" and \"rafer\" are different names, then the claim might be incorrect because the player's name doesn't match exactly. However, if they are considered the same person, then it would be correct. But I think in reality, these are two distinct players with similar names, which could lead to confusion.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, I see that row 79 also has \"rafer alston (7)\", and row 80 has \"rafer alston (6)\". So, in row 75, it's specifically \"rafer alston\" with 8 assists. The claim says \"rafter alston have 8 high assist\". So the player's name doesn't match exactly; perhaps the claim is referring to a different person.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and both are intended to refer to Rafter Alston. If that's the case, then the high assists would be correct as 8 in that game. But if \"rafter\" is a different player, then the claim is incorrect because there's no entry for \"rafter alston\".\n\nGiven that the table lists \"rafer alston (8)\" in row 75, and the claim uses \"rafter alston\", I'm leaning towards the claim being FALSE because the names don't match. However, it's possible that this is a typo, and both are meant to refer to the same player.\n\nWait, but perhaps the assistant should consider that the exact name might not be critical as long as the correct player is identified. Alternatively, maybe the assistant shouldn't make assumptions about typos in names. So, strictly speaking, if the claim says \"rafter alston\", and the table lists \"rafer alston\", then it's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be row 75 (since that's where Atlanta and the score match), and column 'high assist' to check for Rafter Alston's assists. But since the names don't match exactly, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 75,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"April 18 have the score higher than w 109 - 101 (ot).\" So, I need to check if there was a game on April 18 where the team scored more points than 109-101.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists games from number 72 to 82, with details like date and score. I should focus on finding any game that happened on April 18.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Game 72: April 1\n- Game 73: April 3\n- Game 74: April 6\n- Game 75: April 8\n- Game 76: April 9\n- Game 77: April 11\n- Game 78: April 12\n- Game 79: April 15\n- Game 80: April 17\n- Game 81: April 19\n- Game 82: April 20\n\nWait, I don't see any game on April 18. That means there's no game listed for that date in the table. Since the claim is about a specific date, and there's no corresponding game data, it can't be verified.\n\nSo, the claim must be false because there isn't a game on April 18 to compare. There's no way to know if their score was higher than 109-101 because such a game doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game on April 18, but the table doesn't include any games for that date. Since there is no relevant data, the claim cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
