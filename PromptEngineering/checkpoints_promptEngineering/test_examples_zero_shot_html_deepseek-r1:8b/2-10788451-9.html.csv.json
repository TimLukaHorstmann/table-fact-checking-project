    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at mcg be the game that have the largest crowd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that there's a game played at the McGraw-Hill (mcg) venue which has the largest crowd among all games listed in the table. So, I need to check if any row in the table where the venue is \"mcg\" has the highest crowd number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant columns for this claim are 'venue' and 'crowd'. \n\nI should identify which rows have the venue as \"mcg\". Let's go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has the venue \"glenferrie oval\" \u2013 not mcg.\n2. Second row: \"lake oval\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Third: \"windy hill\" \u2013 no.\n4. Fourth row: \"mcg\" \u2013 yes, this is relevant.\n5. Fifth: \"western oval\" \u2013 no.\n6. Sixth: \"brunswick street oval\" \u2013 no.\n\nSo only one game is at mcg, which is the fourth row.\n\nNow, I need to check if this crowd number is the largest compared to all other games. Let's list out all the crowd numbers:\n\n- Row 0: 11000\n- Row 1: 32260\n- Row 2: 34900\n- Row 3: 72114\n- Row 4: 25345\n- Row 5: 20140\n\nThe highest crowd is in row 3, with 72114 attendees. Wait, but that's for the Melbourne vs St Kilda game on June 14th, and it's at mcg. So this game has a larger crowd than others.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The claim says \"the game at mcg be the game that have the largest crowd.\" But in row 3, the venue is mcg, and its crowd is 72114, which is higher than all other games. Therefore, it's correct that this particular game at mcg has the largest crowd.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says \"the game at mcg be the game that have the largest crowd.\" So does the game at mcg indeed have the highest crowd? Yes, because 72114 is higher than all other crowd numbers in the table.\n\nHowever, another thought: perhaps the claim refers to a single game at mcg having the largest crowd. In this case, since only one game is at mcg and it has the highest crowd, the claim holds true.\n\nSo, I need to check if there's any row where venue is \"mcg\" with the maximum crowd. Yes, row 3 (index 3) for the Melbourne vs St Kilda game has the highest crowd of 72114. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in the table, specifically row 3 where mcg has the largest crowd.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"the game at brunswick street oval happen at a later date than the game at glenferrie oval.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided. The columns related to dates are 'date'. So, I should focus on that column.\n\nLooking at the rows, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, venue, etc., including the date when it happened. \n\nI need to find two specific venues: brunswick street oval and glenferrie oval. Then, check their respective dates to see if the one at brunswick occurred later than the one at glenferrie.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The game at glenferrie oval is in row 0 with a date of \"12 june 1965\".\n- The game at brunswick street oval is in row 5 (since it's the sixth row, but starting from 0) with a date of \"14 june 1965\".\n\nComparing these dates: June 14th is after June 12th.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"fitzroy be 1 of 2 home team that have a home team score of 9.7.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Fitzroy is one of two home teams that scored exactly 9.7 points in their respective matches.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists several home and away teams with their scores, venue, crowd size, and date. The relevant columns for this claim are \"home team\" and \"home team score.\" \n\nI need to check if there's another home team besides Fitzroy that has a home team score of 9.7. So I'll go through each row in the table.\n\n1. First row: Home team is Hawthorn, score is 14.10 (94). Not 9.7.\n2. Second row: South Melbourne scored 20.9 (129). Not relevant.\n3. Third row: Essendon scored 7.12 (54). No.\n4. Fourth row: Melbourne scored 9.7 (61). That's one home team with the score we're looking for.\n5. Fifth row: Footscray scored 9.11 (65). Not 9.7.\n6. Sixth row: Fitzroy scored 9.7 (61). That's the second home team with the desired score.\n\nSo there are two home teams with a score of 9.7: Melbourne and Fitzroy. Therefore, the claim is correct because Fitzroy is indeed one of two such teams.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. Looking at each relevant row:\n\n- For Melbourne (row index 3), the \"home team\" is Melbourne and the \"home team score\" is 9.7 (61).\n- For Fitzroy (row index 5), same applies.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where the home team is either Melbourne or Fitzroy, and their scores are both 9.7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"collingwood and st kilda have an average away team score of 15.14.\" So, I'm looking for information about Collingwood and St Kilda as home teams and their away team scores.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant part here is the \"away team\" column because we're interested in when they are away, not home.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to Collingwood and St Kilda as the away team. \n\nIn the first row, the home team is Hawthorn, and the away team is North Melbourne. Not relevant for Collingwood or St Kilda.\n\nSecond row: Home team South Melbourne vs Geelong. Away team is Geelong, not relevant.\n\nThird row: Essendon vs Collingwood. Here, the away team is Collingwood. So this row is relevant because it's about Collingwood as an away team. Their score is 12.14 (86).\n\nFourth row: Melbourne vs St Kilda. The away team here is St Kilda. Their score is 18.14 (122). This is also relevant.\n\nFifth and sixth rows don't have Collingwood or St Kilda, so we can ignore them.\n\nNow, the claim mentions both Collingwood and St Kilda, so I need their average away scores. Let's calculate each:\n\nCollingwood as away: 12.14 (86). That's one data point.\n\nSt Kilda as away: 18.14 (122). That's another.\n\nTo find the average, we'd take the sum of these two scores and divide by two.\n\nAdding them: 86 + 122 = 208. Divide by 2 gives an average of 104 per game. But the claim says 15.14, which is way lower than that. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood something. Maybe the score format is different. Let me check the scores again. The format is \"x.y (z)\", where x is goals, y is behinds, and z is total points.\n\nFor Collingwood: 12.14 (86). So their away score is 86 points.\n\nSt Kilda: 18.14 (122), so their away score is 122 points.\n\nThe average would be (86 + 122)/2 = 208/2 = 104.\n\nBut the claim says the average is 15.14, which doesn't match. So the claim is false because the actual average is much higher.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells. The columns involved are \"away team score\" for both Collingwood and St Kilda.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Collingwood (away), it's row index 3, column \"away team score\".\n- For St Kilda (away), it's row index 4, same column.\n\nSo the relevant cells are those two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Collingwood and St Kilda have average away scores of 104, not 15.14. The relevant cells are their respective away team scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the game at mcg be the game that have the second largest crowd.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are important here. The columns are home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim mentions \"mcg\" as the venue, so the relevant column is 'venue' because we need to find which row has \"mcg\" in it. Additionally, the claim talks about the crowd size being the second largest. Therefore, I also need to look at the 'crowd' column for each row.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **First Row:** Venue is \"glenferrie oval.\" Not mcg.\n2. **Second Row:** Venue is \"lake oval.\" Not mcg.\n3. **Third Row:** Venue is \"windy hill.\" Not mcg.\n4. **Fourth Row:** Venue is \"mcg.\" This is the row we need for the venue check.\n5. **Fifth Row:** Venue is \"western oval.\" Not mcg.\n6. **Sixth Row:** Venue is \"brunswick street oval.\" Not mcg.\n\nSo, only the fourth row has \"mcg\" as the venue. Now, let's note down its crowd number. The crowd for this game was 72114.\n\nNext, I need to check if this crowd is the second largest. To do that, I'll list out all the crowd numbers from each row:\n\n- Row 0: 11000\n- Row 1: 32260\n- Row 2: 34900\n- Row 3: 72114\n- Row 4: 25345\n- Row 5: 20140\n\nNow, arranging them in order from largest to smallest:\n\n1. 72114 (Row 3)\n2. 34900 (Row 2)\n3. 32260 (Row 1)\n4. 25345 (Row 4)\n5. 11000 (Row 0)\n6. 20140 (Row 5)\n\nSo, the largest crowd is 72114 at mcg, and the second largest is 34900 at windy hill. The claim says that the game at mcg has the second largest crowd, but according to this, it actually has the largest.

Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that on June 12, 1965, Melbourne was NOT one of the home teams. So I need to check if there's a match where Melbourne is listed as the away team on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: home team, home score, away team, etc. The date column might be useful here. Let me go through each row.\n\nStarting with row 0: home team is Hawthorn, so not Melbourne.\nRow 1: South Melbourne as home, again not Melbourne.\nRow 2: Essendon vs Collingwood\u2014Melbourne isn't involved here either.\nRow 3: Here's the first match where Melbourne is the home team. Their opponent is St Kilda on June 14, 1965. So this row doesn't apply because the claim is about June 12.\n\nContinuing to row 4: Footscray vs Richmond\u2014no Melbourne involved.\nRow 5: Fitzroy vs Carlton\u2014Melbourne isn't the away or home team here.\n\nWait, but in row 3, it's June 14. The claim mentions June 12, so that row is after the date in question. So I need to check if there's a match on June 12 where Melbourne is the away team.\n\nLooking again, all matches on June 12: let me see, rows 0 and 1 are both June 12, but neither of those have Melbourne as the away team. For example, row 0: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne; row 1: South Melbourne vs Geelong. So in both these games, it's not Melbourne.\n\nThen, the claim says Melbourne was NOT one of the home teams on June 12, which is TRUE because all the matches where Melbourne is listed are either as home (row 3) or not present on June 12 (they're on June 14). So, on June 12, Melbourne wasn't a home team. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if there's any row on June 12 where Melbourne is the away team. From the table, no such rows exist. All matches on June 12 don't have Melbourne as either team. So, yes, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"melbourne be not 1 of the home team on 12 june 1965\", we need to check if Melbourne appears as an away team or not at all in any match on June 12, 1965.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns and Rows:** The key columns are 'home team', 'away team', and 'date'. We're interested in matches where the date is June 12, 1965.\n2. **Check Each Match on June 12:** From the table, there are two matches:\n   - Row 0: Hawthorn (home) vs North Melbourne (away)\n   - Row 1: South Melbourne (home) vs Geelong (away)\n3. **No Mention of Melbourne as Away Team:** In both cases, neither team is Melbourne.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Melbourne isn't listed as either home or away on June 12, the claim holds true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Both rows where date is June 12 are checked to confirm Melbourne's absence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The key elements here are the venue names \"brunswick street oval\" and \"glenferrie oval,\" so I need to find their respective game dates.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. I'll scan through each row to locate the games played at these venues.\n\nI see that \"brunswick street oval\" is mentioned in the Fitzroy vs. Carlton game, which is in row index 5 (since it's the sixth row starting from 0). The date for this game is listed as \"14 june 1965.\"\n\nNext, I check for \"glenferrie oval.\" This venue is used by Hawthorn against North Melbourne, located in row index 0.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's about two teams, Collingwood and St Kilda, and their average away team scores being below 14. So, I need to check their away games' scores from the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date. The rows are each a game with these details.\n\nI'll focus on the 'away team' and 'away team score' columns since that's what the claim is about. Now, I need to find Collingwood and St Kilda in the table as the home or away teams.\n\nWait, actually, the claim says \"away team scores,\" so I should look at when these two clubs are the away team. That means I need to check each row where either Collingwood or St Kilda is listed in the 'away team' column.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Hawthorn, away is North Melbourne. Not relevant for Collingwood or St Kilda.\n2. Row 1: Home team South Melbourne vs Geelong. Again, not our teams.\n3. Row 2: Home team Essendon vs Collingwood. Here, Collingwood is the away team. Their score is 12.14 (86).\n4. Row 3: Home team Melbourne vs St Kilda. St Kilda is the away team here with a score of 18.14 (122). Hmm, that's over 14, but since the claim is about their average, I need more data.\n5. Row 4: Footscray vs Richmond. Not relevant.\n6. Row 5: Fitzroy vs Carlton. Not relevant.\n\nWait, so in row 2, Collingwood as away has a score of 12.14 (86). In row 3, St Kilda as away has 18.14 (122). So, both have at least one away game each.\n\nNow, I need to calculate their average away team scores based on the provided data. But wait, looking at the table, I see that only two games are relevant: Collingwood's one and St Kilda's one. Each has one score.\n\nSo, for Collingwood, their away score is 86. For St Kilda, it's 122.\n\nWait, but if we're calculating an average, do they both have multiple away games in the table? Let me check again. The table only shows each team playing once as home and once as away, perhaps?\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Collingwood is away in row 2.\n- St Kilda is away in row 3.\n\nEach has one game as away. So their average would be their single score. For Collingwood, it's 86, which is below 14? No, wait, 86 is way above 14. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the scoring system.\n\nWait, in Australian football, the scores are in points and goals. The format is goals.behinds (total points). So, for example, 12.14 (86) means 12 goals and 14 behinds, totaling 26 points? Or wait, no. Wait, no, actually, each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is 1 point. So 12.14 would be 12*6 + 14 = 72 +14=86 points.\n\nSo in the table, scores are shown as points, not goals and behinds combined. Wait, but the way it's written: 14.10 (94). Hmm, maybe that's goals and behinds as a single number? Or is the number after the period the total points?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn Australian rules football, the scoring system is:\n\n- A goal is worth 6 points.\n- A behind is worth 1 point.\n\nSo when you see \"14.10 (94)\", that's goals and behinds. So 14 goals and 10 behinds, which converts to 14*6 +10=84+10=94 points.\n\nSimilarly, Collingwood away has 12.14 (86): 12 goals and 14 behinds = 72+14=86 points.\n\nSt Kilda away is 18.14 (122): 18*6 +14=108+14=122.\n\nSo both teams have scores above 14 in their away games.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"average away team score below 14.\" So if each of them has only one away game, their average would be equal to that single score. For Collingwood, it's 86, which is way above 14. St Kilda is 122, also above 14.\n\nTherefore, both have individual away scores well above 14, so their average (which is just that single value) is not below 14. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"average away team score.\" So if each of Collingwood and St Kilda has multiple away games in the table, we need to take an average across all their away games. But looking at the table:\n\n- Collingwood is only listed once as the away team (row 2).\n- St Kilda is also only listed once as the away team (row 3).\n\nSo each has one game, so their average is just that single score. Since both are above 14, their averages are above 14.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are A2 and C3, which contain Collingwood's and St Kilda's away scores of 86 and 122, respectively. Both scores exceed 14, so their averages also exceed 14, making the claim false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is \\boxed{false}.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"melbourne play at home on june 12 1965\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim into its components. The claim mentions three things: the team (Melbourne), the location (home), and the date (June 12, 1965). So, to verify this claim, I need to check if Melbourne played at home on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details about both teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date. My task is to find the relevant cells in the table that can confirm or deny the claim.\n\nI'll start by identifying the columns that are important here: \"home team,\" \"venue,\" and \"date.\" These three columns will help me determine if Melbourne played at home on June 12, 1965.\n\nNext, I'll look for rows where the home team is Melbourne. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first row has \"hawthorn\" as the home team.\n- Second row: \"south melbourne.\"\n- Third row: \"essendon.\"\n- Fourth row: \"melbourne.\" Here's our target.\n\nIn the fourth row, the home team is Melbourne. Now, I need to check if the date matches June 12, 1965. The date for this row is listed as \"14 june 1965.\" Wait, that's different from June 12. So the date doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed another row where Melbourne is at home on June 12? Let me check again.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n- Fifth row: \"footscray\" is the home team.\n- Sixth row: \"fitzroy.\"\n\nSo, in the table, Melbourne only appears once as the home team, on June 14, 1965. There's no other instance where Melbourne plays at home on June 12.\n\nThat means the claim is not fully supported because the date doesn't match. The relevant cells are the ones for the fourth row, but since the date doesn't align with June 12, the claim is false.\n\nNow, to structure the JSON response. I need to list the relevant_cells that were checked. Each entry should have \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" For the Melbourne home game on June 14, the row index is 3 (since it's zero-based), so:\n\n- row_index: 3\n- column_name: \"home team\"\n\nSo, the JSON will include only this cell because that's where Melbourne is playing at home, but the date doesn't match. Since the date in the table for that game is June 14, not June 12, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
