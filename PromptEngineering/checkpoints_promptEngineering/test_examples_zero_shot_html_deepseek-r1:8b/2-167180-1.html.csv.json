    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"when M. Night Shyamalan be the director, the rank be 7.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The claim has two main parts: one about the director and another about their rank. So, I should check both aspects in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a movie with several attributes like rank, title, studio, director(s), and worldwide gross. My task is to find if there's any movie where M. Night Shyamalan is listed as the director and the rank is 7.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the \"director (s)\" column for the name M. Night Shyamalan. Let me go row by row:\n\n1. Row 0: Director is Peter Jackson \u2013 not Shyamalan.\n2. Row 1: Chris Columbus \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: Sam Raimi \u2013 different person.\n4. Row 3: George Lucas \u2013 no.\n5. Row 4: Barry Sonnenfeld \u2013 not him.\n6. Row 5: Lee Tamahori \u2013 not Shyamalan.\n7. Row 6: M. Night Shyamalan \u2013 yes! This is the one we're interested in.\n8. Row 7: Chris Wedge \u2013 nope.\n9. Row 8: Joel Zwick \u2013 different director.\n10. Row 9: Steven Spielberg \u2013 no.\n11. Row 10: Same as above, Spielberg again.\n12. Row 11: Rob Marshall \u2013 not Shyamalan.\n13. Row 12: Jay Roach \u2013 nope.\n14. Row 13: Rob Cohen \u2013 not him.\n15. Row 14: Raja Gosnell \u2013 different director.\n16. Row 15: Hayao Miyazaki \u2013 nope, he's a different person.\n17. Row 16: Chris Sanders and others \u2013 Shyamalan isn't here either.\n18. Row 17: Gore Verbinski \u2013 not him.\n19. Row 18: Curt Hanson \u2013 no.\n20. Row 19: Doug Liman \u2013 nope.\n\nSo, the only row where M. Night Shyamalan is the director is row 6. Now, I need to check what his rank is in that row. The \"rank\" column for row 6 is 7. \n\nTherefore, when M. Night Shyamalan is the director, the movie is ranked 7. This matches the claim exactly. There are no other entries where he's the director, so we don't need to consider others.\n\nSo, all conditions in the claim are met: he is the director and the rank is 7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"George Lucas be the director for Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: rank, title, studio, director(s), and worldwide gross. Each row corresponds to a movie with its details.\n\nI need to find George Lucas in the directors' column. Let me go through each row one by one. \n\nLooking at row 4: the title is \"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\" The director listed here is George Lucas. That seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other rows where George Lucas might be a director for that movie. Let me scan through all rows. \n\nIn row 10, Minority Report, he's listed as the director. But that's a different movie. Similarly, in row 11, Catch Me If You Can, he's also the director, but again, it's a separate film. So, for Star Wars Episode II, only row 4 has George Lucas as the director.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"star war episode ii : attack of the clone be develop by barry sonnenfeld for universal picture\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts:\n1. The movie in question is \"Star War Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\"\n2. It was developed by Barry Sonnenfeld.\n3. The studio involved is Universal Pictures.\n\nI'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking for \"star war episode ii : attack of the clones\" in the table, I find it at row 4 (row_index 4). Let's note down its columns: rank, title, studio, director(s), worldwide gross. So, the relevant cells are:\n- column_name: title\n- row_index: 4\n\nNext, checking who directed it. The claim says Barry Sonnenfeld. Looking at row 4, the director is listed as George Lucas, not Barry Sonnenfeld. This discrepancy already suggests a possible false statement.\n\nAdditionally, checking the studio for this movie. In row 4, the studio is \"20th century fox / lucasfilm.\" The claim mentions Universal Pictures, which doesn't match. So, another inconsistency.\n\nSince both the director and studio don't align with the claim, it's clear that the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
