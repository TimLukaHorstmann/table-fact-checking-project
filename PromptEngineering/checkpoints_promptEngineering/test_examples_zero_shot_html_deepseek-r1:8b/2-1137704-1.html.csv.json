    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be 3 entrant with the ferrari 038 305 v12 engine\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions three teams (entrants) that have the Ferrari 038 305 V12 engine. Now, looking back at the table, each row seems to represent an entrant with their respective engine details.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where the engine is listed as \"ferrari 038\". Let me go row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Ferrari - V12? No, it's under Venturi and Lamborghini.\n2. **Row 3**: Ferrari with 038? Yes, here we see \"ferrari 038 305 v12\" in the engine column.\n3. **Row 4**: Another Ferrari 038 entry.\n4. **Row 5**: Ferrari again with 038.\n\nWait, actually looking at the table, the first row is \"central park venturi larrousse\" with \"lc92\", which is Lamborghini 3512 V12. So that's not Ferrari.\n\nThen, rows starting from index 3: let me check:\n\n- **Row 3**: \"scuderia ferrari\" with engine \"ferrari 038 305 v12\".\n- **Row 4**: Another Ferrari entry with the same engine.\n- **Row 5**: Yet another Ferrari with the same engine.\n\nWait, but when I count them, starting from row index 3:\n\n- Row 3: Yes\n- Row 4: Yes\n- Row 5: Yes\n\nThat's three entries where \"ferrari 038\" is mentioned. So there are three entrants using that specific engine.\n\nNow, checking if any other rows might have the same. Let me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Venturi - Lamborghini, so no.\n- **Row 1**: Venturi again with Lamborghini.\n- **Row 2**: Yamaha, no.\n- **Row 3**: Ferrari yes (1).\n- **Row 4**: Ferrari yes (2).\n- **Row 5**: Ferrari yes (3).\n- Row 6 onwards: Not Ferrari.\n\nSo that's three entrants using the Ferrari 038 engine as per the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by these three rows.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Engine\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Engine\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Engine\"}]}",
