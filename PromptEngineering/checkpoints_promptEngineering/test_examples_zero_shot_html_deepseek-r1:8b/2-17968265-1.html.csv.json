The claim says: \"in the 1987 - 88 season, newell 's old boy scored 55 points.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant information in the table. The table has a column named \"1987 - 88,\" which seems to correspond to the 1987-88 season. So that's one of the columns I need to check.\n\nNext, I need to find the row for \"newell 's old boys.\" Scanning through the rows, I see the second row (row index 1) has the team name \"newell 's old boys.\"\n\nNow, looking at the data in that row under the \"1987 - 88\" column. The value is 55. Since the claim states they scored 55 points, this matches exactly.\n\nI should also check if there are other columns relevant to the claim. The claim mentions the season and the points, so \"1987 - 88\" and \"points\" are both important. However, in this case, since the point value directly supports the claim, it's only necessary to highlight these two cells.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because the data in the table confirms that newell 's old boys scored 55 points in the 1987-88 season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that there's a situation where two conditions are met:\n\n1. The average is 114.\n2. The points (probably total points) are 107.\n3. In the specific season column \"1987 - 88\", the value is 31.\n\nSo, I need to look through the table for rows where all three of these conditions are true: average = 114, points = 107, and 1987-88 = 31.\n\nI'll start by identifying which columns correspond to each part. The table has several columns:\n\n- team\n- average\n- points\n- played\n- 1986 - 87\n- 1987 - 88\n- 1988 - 89\n\nSo, \"average\" corresponds to the second column, \"points\" is the third column, and \"1987 - 88\" is the fifth column.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check if any team has:\n\n1. average = 114\n2. points = 107\n3. 1987-88 = 31\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first few rows have an average close to 1.219 or lower, so not 114.\n- Scanning down, I see that most teams have either higher averages (over 1) or lower ones. Wait, but all averages in the table are over 1? No, wait, some are like 0.939 and others have n/a. But 114 is a much larger number, so it's likely that no team has an average of exactly 114.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, I might be misinterpreting the units. The averages in the table for most teams are decimals like 1.219 or 0.939. So 114 would be way higher than any value here. That suggests there's a misunderstanding because none of the averages reach 114. Maybe the claim is referring to a different column, but I need to check all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps \"play\" refers to the number of games played? But in the table, the third column is labeled as points. The fourth column is \"played\", which might refer to the number of games played or goals scored, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is miswritten and meant something else. Let me re-examine the claim: \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31\". Perhaps it's saying that when a team has points equal to 107 in the 1987-88 season, their average is 114 and they played 31 games.\n\nSo, I need to find a row where:\n\n- In the \"points\" column (third), it's 107.\n- In the \"average\" column (second), it's 114.\n- In \"1987 - 88\" (fifth), it's 31.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index 0: points=107, average=1.219, 1987-88=33. So not matching all three conditions.\n\nWait, no, let me check row by row.\n\nRow 0:\nTeam: ferro carril oeste\naverage: ~1.219\npoints: 107 (third column)\n1986-87:44\n1987-88:33\n1988-89:30\n\nSo points=107, but average is ~1.219 and 1987-88 is 33. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 1: Platense\naverage: 0.860\npoints:98\nplayed:27\nn/a for some years.\n\nNope.\n\nRow 2: Instituto de C\u00f3rdoba\naverage: 0.851\npoints:97\n\nNo.\n\nRow 3: Racing de C\u00f3rdoba\naverage:0.851\npoints:97\n\nNo.\n\nRow4: San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n\naverage:0.842\npoints:32\n\nNo.\n\nRow5: Deportivo Armenio\naverage:0.776\npoints:59\n\nNo.\n\nNow, looking further down:\n\nRows 6 and beyond have n/a for some columns, but let's check each.\n\nRow7: Ferro carril oeste already checked.\n\nRow8: Deportivo Mandiy\u00fa has points=33, which is not 107.\n\nRow9: Platense again checked.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me make sure I didn't miss any rows with points=107 and average=114.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nOnly one team (ferro carril oeste) has points=107 in row0, but their average is ~1.219, not 114. So no team meets all three conditions: average=114, points=107, and 1987-88=31.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the columns. Maybe \"average\" isn't the second column? Let me check the table structure again.\n\nThe table starts with:\n\n- Team\n- average\n- points\n- played\n- 1986 -87\n- 1987 -88\n- 1988 -89\n\nYes, so the second column is indeed \"average\", third is \"points\". So no team has an average of 114. All averages are in the 0.8-1.2 range except for some with n/a.\n\nWait a minute\u2014does that mean the claim's first condition (average=114) cannot be met by any team? Because all averages in the table are much lower than 114. So, even if other conditions were met, since average can't be 114, the claim is automatically false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"play\" refers to something else, but given the columns, I think it's about points and season stats.\n\nSo, because there's no row where average=114, points=107, and 1987-88=31, the claim is not supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires a team to have an average of 114, 107 points in the 1987-88 season, but none meet all three criteria. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"No team meets all the required conditions simultaneously.\"\n}\n```",
