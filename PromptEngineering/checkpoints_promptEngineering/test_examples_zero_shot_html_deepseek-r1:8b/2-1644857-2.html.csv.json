    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"Scotland be the country that have stolen end less than 9 and a Craig Brown as the skip.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. Scotland has fewer than 9 stolen ends.\n2. Scotland's skip is named Craig Brown.\n\nI'll start by examining the relevant columns in the table. The columns related to the claim are \"stolen ends\" and \"skip.\" \n\nLooking at the row for Scotland, I find it in the table under the fourth row (index 3). The \"stolen ends\" column shows 10 for Scotland. Since 10 is not less than 9, this part of the claim doesn't hold true.\n\nNext, checking the \"skip\" column for Scotland also shows that the skip is David Murdoch, not Craig Brown. This means both conditions in the claim are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since neither condition is fully supported by the table data, the overall claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
