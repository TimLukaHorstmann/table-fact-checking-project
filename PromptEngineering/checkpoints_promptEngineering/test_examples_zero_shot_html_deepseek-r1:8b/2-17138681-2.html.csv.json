    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"there be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what's being asked. They want me to find an entry where the \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" column equals 3.2 / 8 and then check if the \"viewers (millions)\" for that row is more than 12.42 million.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different entry with various metrics. I'll go through each row to find where \"rating / share\" is exactly 3.2 / 8.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Row 0: 2.6 / 7 \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 1: 2.6 / 6 \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: 3.0 / 8 \u2013 close, but not 3.2.\n- Row 3: 3.1 / 8 \u2013 still not 3.2.\n- Row 4: 3.1 / 8 \u2013 same as above.\n- Row 5: 3.2 / 8 \u2013 yes, this matches the \"rating / share\" value we're looking for.\n\nNow, I'll check the \"viewers (millions)\" column for this row, which is row_index 5. The viewers are listed as 12.42 million. \n\nThe claim says there must be more than 12.42 million viewers. However, the data shows exactly 12.42 million, not more than that. Therefore, the number of viewers does not exceed 12.42 million; it's equal to it.\n\nSince the condition is \"more than,\" and the actual viewers match exactly, the claim is not fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
