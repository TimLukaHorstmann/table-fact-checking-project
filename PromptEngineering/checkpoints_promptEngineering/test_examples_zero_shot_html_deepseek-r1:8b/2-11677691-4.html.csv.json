The claim is: \"connor mcgovern go to college in missouri.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find Connor McGovern. Since his name is unique, it should be easy. Scanning the list, I see that he's listed as the first player in the table: connor mcgovern. That\u2019s row index 0.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'college' column for this row because the claim mentions college. Connor's college is listed as \"missouri.\" So far, it seems like the claim matches what's in the table.\n\nI should make sure there are no other entries with the same name or similar details that might confuse things. But since he\u2019s the only one named Connor McGovern and his college is Missouri, this appears straightforward.\n\nNow, considering the instructions, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For Connor McGovern, the relevant columns would be 'player' (row index 0) and 'college' (row index 0). So the relevant_cells should include both these columns with their respective row indices.\n\nSince his college is Missouri as per the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim about Kevin Mcreynolds is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says two things: \"Kevin Mcreynolds go to college at UCLA and his hometown be Washington, DC.\" So, there are two specific facts to verify.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find Kevin Mcreynolds in the 'player' column. Scanning through the rows, I see he's in row 1 (since the first player is Connor McGovern as row 0). His position is defensive line, school is St John's high school, hometown is Washington, DC, and college is UCLA.\n\nSo for the first part of the claim, going to college at UCLA: In the table, under 'college' for Kevin Mcreynolds, it says 'ucla'. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, his hometown being Washington, DC. In the table, under 'hometown', it's listed as \"washington , dc\". That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nI should also check if there are any other cells relevant to this verification. Since we're focusing on Kevin Mcreynolds, I'll look at his row (row 1) and all columns that relate to his details. The columns are player, position, school, hometown, college. All of these are relevant because they directly support the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1, column 'player' for his name.\n- Row 1, column 'hometown' for Washington, DC.\n- Row 1, column 'college' for UCLA.\n\nWait, but the claim only mentions two specific facts: college and hometown. So perhaps I don't need to include all columns as relevant? But according to the instructions, I should list all cells that are relevant to verifying the claim. Since each part of the claim corresponds to a specific cell, yes, they're all relevant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE because both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Now, what's his position? According to the table, Trey Depriest is a linebacker. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are multiple entries for Trey Depriest or any other details that might affect this. Looking at the rest of the table, only one Trey Depriest is listed as a linebacker. So no issues there.\n\nAlso, the claim specifies \"play linebacker,\" which directly aligns with his position in the table. There's no conflicting information, so I don't need to consider other positions or schools.\n\nI should make sure that the relevant cells are correctly identified. The relevant cells for Trey Depriest are row 5 and the position column. So I'll include those in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"trey depriest play linebacker\" is supported by the table data as Trey Depriest is listed as a linebacker.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

That's row number 8 (since it starts at 0).\n\nNext, I need to check which columns are relevant to verify this claim. The claim mentions his hometown and the city being Coppell, Texas. So, in the table, the 'hometown' column is where his residence should be listed.\n\nLooking at the 'hometown' cell for Brandon Mullins, it says \"coppell , texas\". Wait, there's a space before the comma, which might be a typo or formatting issue, but the content is still Coppell, Texas. So that matches the claim exactly.\n\nThere are also other columns like player, position, school, college, etc., but those aren't needed for this specific check. The only relevant column here is 'hometown'.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because all the information provided in the claim aligns with what's listed in the table for Brandon Mullins.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"hometown\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

In the same row, under the column \"school\", it says \"trinity christian academy\". That matches exactly what the claim states about his high school.\n\nNext, checking his position. The column for position is \"defensive back\" in this row, which matches the claim as well.

The claim says he went to st john 's high school, but according to the table, his high school is shanley high school in fargo. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nI need to verify if any of the cells relevant to this claim support it.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided. The table has several columns: player, position, school, hometown, and college. Since the claim mentions Trey Depriest, I should locate his row in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Connor McGovern - position is defensive line.\n2. Row 1: Kevin Mcreynolds - defensive line.\n3. Row 2: Jesse Hayes - defensive line.\n4. Row 3: Kris Harley - defensive line.\n5. Row 4: Trey Depriest - this looks like the one we're interested in.\n\nTrey Depriest is listed in row 4 (since rows start at 0, but sometimes people count from 1; I'll double-check that). His position is linebacker, and his college is Alabama according to the table. Now, the claim says he's a linebacker at Michigan State, so I need to check if the college column for Trey Depriest matches \"Michigan State\".\n\nLooking at the 'college' column in row 4, it's listed as \"alabama\". That doesn't match Michigan State. So that's a red flag.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't misread anything. The claim says \"at Michigan State\", but the table shows his college is Alabama. Unless there's another player named Trey Depriest at Michigan State, which I don't see here because each row has unique players.\n\nSo, based on the table, Trey Depriest plays linebacker for Alabama, not Michigan State. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The columns that are relevant are 'player' and 'college'. For the player, it's \"trey depriest\" in row 4. For college, it's \"alabama\" in row 4. These two cells confirm that he's not at Michigan State.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because Trey Depriest is listed as attending Alabama, not Michigan State.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
