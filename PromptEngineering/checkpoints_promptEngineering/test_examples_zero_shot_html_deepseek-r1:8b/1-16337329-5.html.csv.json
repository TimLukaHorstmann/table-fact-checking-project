    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do' be the imperative and \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be the past habitual.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with different grammatical categories for each column, such as present/future, past, etc. The rows are categorized by pronouns like first person singular, plural, second person low-grade, middle-grade/plural, high grade, third person singular, and so on.\n\nI need to check if \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares is the imperative form and \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari is the past habitual as per the table.\n\nStarting with \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares: According to the table, in the second person singular low-grade row (row 2), under the column 'imperative', it's written as \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares. That matches the claim stating it's the imperative. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari is mentioned as the past habitual. Looking at the same row, in the 'past habitual' column, it says \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis. But wait, in the table, under row 2 (second person singular low-grade), the past habitual is given as \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis. However, the claim refers to it as \"you did,\" which might be the present perfect or past tense. So I need to verify if this form is indeed considered the past habitual.\n\nFrom what I recall, in Nepali grammar, the past habitual (past continuous) for second person singular is formed with the root minus -\u0928 (n), so for 'do', it would be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0947 but conjugated as \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d/\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b etc. Wait, perhaps I need to cross-reference this.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, in row 2 (second person singular low-grade), the past habitual is listed as \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis, which is translated as \"you did.\" The present perfect or past continuous would typically be formed differently. So if the claim says it's the past habitual, then maybe it's correct because the form given is indeed the past tense.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes 'did' can be considered past habitual. Let me think again: in English, \"you did\" is more like past tense, whereas past habitual would usually involve an auxiliary verb like \"had done.\" However, in Nepali, perhaps the structure is different.\n\nWait, the table's description for column 'past habitual' might refer to the past tense rather than the past continuous. So if the claim says it's the past habitual, but the form given is the simple past (did), that might be incorrect because past habitual usually involves an ongoing action in the past.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Nepali grammar, the term 'past habitual' refers to the same as the past tense here. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the table, it lists \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis as the past habitual, which is translated as \"you did.\" So if the claim states that it's the imperative and past habitual, then according to the table, both are correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because both forms are correctly identified in their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares is listed as the imperative in the second person singular low-grade row, and \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari is listed as the past habitual in the same row of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It has several columns: !simple present / future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. The rows represent different grammatical persons like first person singular, plural, second person low-grade, middle-grade/plural, high grade, third person singular low-grade, middle-grade/plural masculine.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two forms: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari as the past habitual and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas as the probable future.

That matches up correctly.\n\nNext, looking for \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas. This should be under the probable future column.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the given claim about two specific cells in the table is true or false.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do' be the injunctive and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did' be the past habitual.\" So, the user is asserting that garthyo corresponds to the injunctive form and garyo corresponds to the past habitual.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to locate these two cells. The table has several columns: !simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative.\n\nStarting with \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo.\" From the table, in the third person singular low-grade row, under the \"past habitual\" column, it's written as \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo. So, garthyo isn't directly in that spot. Instead, garthyo is in the third person singular low-grade row under the \"simple past\" column and also the \"past habitual\" column? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the table:\n\nThird person singular low-grade row:\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\n\nAh, so in the third person singular low-grade row, under \"past habitual,\" it's garthyo, and under \"simple past\" is garyo. So the claim says garthyo is the injunctive, but according to the table, it's under past habitual.\n\nSimilarly, garyo is listed as the simple past in that same row. The claim says garyo is past habitual, which doesn't align with the table because the past habitual for third person singular low-grade is garthyo, not garyo.\n\nWait, maybe I got it mixed up. Let me go through each cell:\n\nFor \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\":\n- Row index: 6 (third person singular low-grade)\n- Columns: Looking at the table, in row 6, columns are:\n  - !simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\n  - probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e garl\u0101\n  - simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\n  - past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\n  - injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos\n  - imperative: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos\n\nSo \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" is in the \"past habitual\" column, not the injunctive. The claim says garthyo is the injunctive, which is incorrect.\n\nFor \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\":\n- In row 6, it's under \"simple past,\" so that's correct for simple past, but the claim states it's past habitual. That's also incorrect because in the same row, \"past habitual\" is garthyo, and \"simple past\" is garyo.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are wrong. Garthyo isn't injunctive; it's past habitual. G ary o is simple past, not past habitual.

The claim mentions two forms from the table: \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" which is under second person singular low-grade and likely refers to the future tense. It's listed in row index 2, column \"past habitual\". Wait, no, looking at the table, the columns are !simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nSo, for each cell, we have a grammatical category and its form. The claim is talking about the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas. So I need to check if \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" is correctly listed as the past habitual in that row.\n\nLooking at row 2 (second person singular low-grade), the columns are:\n\n- !simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\n- probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938 garl\u0101s\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938 garthis\n- injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\n- imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\n\nWait, the claim says \"past habitual\" of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938 is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\". But in the table, under row 2, column \"past habitual\", it's \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938 garthis\". So that doesn't match. The past habitual form is not \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\", but \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading.

That doesn't align because in the table, the past habitual for second person singular low-grade is \"garthis\", not \"gari\".\n\nSo, according to the table, the correct past habitual form should be \"garthis\", but the claim says it's \"gari\", which seems incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me parse it again: The claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari\" is the past habitual of \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u091b\u0938 garchas\". \n\nLooking at row 2 in the table:\n\n- Column for simple past is \"garis\", so perhaps \"gari\" is a typo or misunderstanding.

So, for third person singular low-grade, the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\".\n\nWait, no. Let me check the table again. Each row has a grammatical category, and columns are moods. For example, the first row is first person singular, then second person plural, etc.\n\nLooking at the third row: second person middle-grade/plural. The past habitual for that is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garyau\". But I'm focusing on \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\", which is in the third row? Wait no, the rows are:\n\n1. first person singular\n2. first person plural\n3. second person singular low-grade\n4. second person middle-grade/plural\n5. high grade\n6. third person singular low-grade\n7. third person middle-grade/plural masculine\n\nWait, the user didn't number them as 1 to 8, but in their description, they have six rows, each with different grammatical categories.\n\nLooking at the last two rows: third person singular low-grade and third person middle-grade/plural masculine.\n\nIn the sixth row (third person singular low-grade), \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\" is under the past habitual column as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\". So yes, that's correct. The past habitual of \"\u0917\u0930\u091b garcha\" is indeed \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\".\n\nNow, the claim says that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\" is the past habitual of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\", which matches what I see in the table.\n\nSo the claim seems to be TRUE based on the information in the provided table. The relevant cells would be the row where \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\" is located and the corresponding past habitual column for that row.\n\nI need to find the exact rows and columns. From the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\" is in the third person singular low-grade row, which is row index 6 (assuming rows start from 0). The past habitual column is the third one, so column index 2 (if we count from 0).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 6 and column \"past habitual\", which is the third column. So I'll list them as {\"row_index\":5? Wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nWait, looking at the HTML table structure:\n\nThe first tr after thead is the first row (index 0), then second (1), etc., up to sixth row (index 5).\n\nIn the last two rows:\n\n- Row index 5: third person singular low-grade\n- Row index 6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\n\nWait, no. The table has six tbody tr elements, so their indices are 0 to 5.\n\nSo \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\" is in row index 5 (sixth row). And the past habitual column is the third one, which is at column index 2.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 5 (since rows are 0-based)\n- Column name \"past habitual\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant_cells include these two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do' be the injunctive for \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". \n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant parts of this statement. It mentions two forms from the table:\n1. The word \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" (gares) and its form in the table.\n2. The word \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (garis) and its form in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a grammatical category, such as first person singular, plural, etc., and columns correspond to different tense forms like simple present/future, probable future, etc. The relevant column here is the \"injunctive\" column because the claim mentions it as the form in question.\n\nNow, I'll locate each word in the table:\n- For \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\", scanning down the rows under the \"third person singular low - grade\" section (row 6), the \"injunctive\" cell is \"gareres 'may you do'\". Wait, no, actually looking back, the third person singular low-grade row's last column is \"garros 'may he do'\", so maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table, each row has the same structure: first cell is the grammatical category, then the cells for each tense. So for \"third person singular low - grade\", the \"injunctive\" column has \"garros 'may he do'\". Similarly, for \"second person singular low - grade\", which is row 3, the \"injunctive\" cell is \"gares 'may you do'\".\n\nSo the word \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" (gares) is indeed in the second person singular low-grade's \"injunctive\" column. It says \"gareres\" but actually, looking at the table again, row 3, which is second person singular low-grade: injunctive is 'may you do' as \"gares\".\n\nWait, no, let me check again. In row 3 (second person singular low-grade), under \"injunctive\", it's written as \"gareres\" or \"gares\"? Looking back, the table shows for second person singular low-grade:\n- injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\n\nYes, so \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\" is correct there. So the claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do' be the injunctive for \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". \n\nNow, looking at \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" (garis), which is also in the same row. In row 3, under \"past habitual\", it's written as \"garis 'you did'\". So the past habitual form of second person singular low-grade is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\".\n\nSo the claim links the injunctive form (\"may you do\") with the past habitual form (\"you did\"). Now, I need to check if this relationship is correct in the table.\n\nIn the table, under the \"injunctive\" column, for second person singular low-grade, it's indeed \"gares 'may you do'\". So that part is correct. \n\nBut what about the claim stating that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares...\" is the injunctive for \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari...\". In other words, is \"may you do\" the injunctive form corresponding to \"you did\"? From the table's structure, each tense has its own column, so the injunctive and past habitual are different columns.\n\nTherefore, in the table, \"injunctive\" (which is 'may you do') corresponds correctly to \"past habitual\" (which is 'you did'). So the claim seems accurate because it's linking the correct forms.\n\nHowever, I should verify if the table indeed shows this connection. Looking at row 3: \n\n- Injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis 'you did'\n\nYes, so the claim correctly states that \"gares\" is the injunctive form corresponding to \"garis\" as the past habitual. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the table provided.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Past habitual\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Injunctive\"}]}",

The claim is about two words: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\". It says that \"garthy o\" is the injunctive form of \"garyo\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent different grammatical categories. The columns are \"!simple present / future\", \"probable future\", \"simple past\", \"past habitual\", \"injunctive\", and \"imperative\". \n\nSo, I need to find in which rows these two words appear under their respective columns. Let me go through each row.\n\nStarting with \"garthyo\": According to the claim, it's in the \"injunctive\" column. Looking at the table, \"injunctive\" is the fifth column. So, I'll look for \"garthyo\" in the fifth column. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 0: injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\"\n- Row 1: \"\u0917\u0930\u094c garau\"\n- Row 2: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\"\n- Row 3: \"\u0917\u0930\u094c garau\"\n- Row 4: \"\u0917arnuhos\" \u2013 not matching\n- Row 5: \"garros\" \u2013 no\n- Row 6: \"gar\u016bn\" \u2013 no\n- So, in the fifth column, \"garthyo\" isn't present. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at row 3, which is third person middle-grade / plural masculine: the columns are first person singular, probable future, simple past, past habitual, imperative, and the last cell for injunctive is \"\u0917\u0930\u094c garau\". So that's not \"garthyo\".\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if \"garthyo\" is in any row's fifth column. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: fifth column is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\"\nRow 1: \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0902 gara\u0169\" \u2013 no\nRow 2: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\"\nRow 3: \"\u0917\u0930\u094c garau\"\nRow 4: \"garnuhos\"\nRow 5: \"garros\"\nRow 6: \"gar\u016bn\"\n\nSo, I don't see \"garthyo\" in any of the fifth columns. That suggests that either it's not in the table or I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps \"garthyo\" is the past habitual form? Let me check where \"garyo\" is found. Looking at the fourth column (past habitual), I see:\n\nRow 0: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901 gar\u1ebd\"\nRow 1: \"\u0917\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0169 garya\u0169\"\nRow 2: \"\u0917\u0922\u093f\u0938\u094d garhis\"\nRow 3: \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau\"\nRow 4: \"\u0917\u0922\u0928\u0941\u092d\u092f\u094b garnubhayo\" \u2013 wait, row 4 is high grade. So, in row 0, first person singular past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901 gar\u1ebd\", which becomes \"gar\u1ebd\". The claim refers to \"garyo\" (he did), so looking at third person singular past: in row 5 (third person middle-grade / plural masculine), the past is \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\".\n\nSo, \"garyo\" is the past form of \"garly\u0101\", perhaps. Now, the claim says that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive form of \"garyo\". But from the table, in row 5, the injunctive column (fifth column) is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d gar\u016bn\".\n\nWait, looking back at row 3: third person middle-grade / plural masculine, the past is \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\", and the imperative is \"\u0917\u0922\u0928\u094d garchan\". The injunctive for this row is \"\u0917\u0922\u0930\u0942 garharu\"? Wait no. Let me check each cell:\n\nRow 5 (third person singular low-grade): fifth column is \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos\" \u2013 that's the imperative, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between past and imperative. The columns are:\n\n1. !simple present / future\n2. probable future\n3. simple past\n4. past habitual\n5. injunctive\n6. imperative\n\nSo for each row, the fifth column is the injunctive form. So, looking at \"garyo\", which is in the fourth column (past habitual) of row 5: \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\". The claim says that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of \"garyo\".\n\nSo I need to see if \"garthyo\" appears as the injunctive form anywhere. From the table, looking at all rows:\n\nRow 0: fifth column is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\"\nRow 1: fifth column \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0902 gara\u0169\"\nRow 2: fifth column \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\"\nRow 3: fifth column \"\u0917\u0930\u094c garau\"\nRow 4: fifth column \"garnuhos\"\nRow 5: fifth column \"garros\"\nRow 6: fifth column \"gar\u016bn\"\n\nSo, \"garthyo\" isn't present. Therefore, the claim that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of \"garyo\" might be false because in the table, \"garthyo\" doesn't appear as an injunctive form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the rows. Let me check row 4: it's high grade, so perhaps \"garthyo\" isn't there. Maybe \"garthyo\" is a past habitual? No, because in row 0, first person singular past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901 gar\u1ebd\", not \"garthyo\".\n\nSo, putting it together, the claim states that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of \"garyo\". From the table, \"garyo\" (he did) appears in the past of row 5, but its injunctive form is \"gar\u016bn\" in row 6's fifth column. Wait no: row 5's fifth column is \"garros\", which might be imperative.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused between the rows and columns. Let me list out all the fifth column entries:\n\nRow 0: garth\u1ebd\nRow 1: gara\u0169\nRow 2: gares\nRow 3: garau\nRow 4: garnuhos\nRow 5: garros\nRow 6: gar\u016bn\n\nSo, none of these is \"garthyo\". Therefore, the claim that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of \"garyo\" is incorrect because \"garthyo\" isn't listed as an injunctive form in any row.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between the words. Maybe \"garthyo\" is a typo or a different conjugation. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is that \"garthyo\" is the past habitual of \"garyo\", but no, because \"garyo\" is already the past form, and past habitual would be longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"garthyo\" is an imperative or future form. But in row 0, first person singular future is \"\u0917\u0922\u093c\u0947 garh\u1ebd\". So that's \"garh\u1ebd\".\n\nSo, in conclusion, based on the table provided, \"garthyo\" doesn't appear as an injunctive form corresponding to \"garyo\". Therefore, the claim seems to be false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where \"garyo\" is found in its past form and \"garthyo\" is identified as the injunctive. However, upon reviewing the table, \"garthyo\" isn't listed under any row's fifth column (injunctive). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"past\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It mentions two forms: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari\" and \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different grammatical categories. The columns are \"!simple present / future,\" \"probable future,\" \"simple past,\" \"past habitual,\" \"injunctive,\" and \"imperative.\"\n\nThe claim is about the past habitual tense.

The columns in the table are: !simple present / future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative.\n\nStarting with \"garchas\" which is under second person singular low-grade, and looking at the column headers, the relevant column for this would be the first one (!simple present / future). \n\nNext, the claim states that its probable future tense is \"gari.\" From the table, in the same row (second person singular low-grade), the probable future is listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". So the second relevant column here would be the probable future column.\n\nNow, I need to map these observations back to the table structure. The first term \"garchas\" is in row 2 (index starting from 0) under the first column. The corresponding probable future form \"gari\" is also in the same row's second column.\n\nI should double-check that both terms are correctly identified and located within their respective columns. Also, ensuring that there's a transition from the probable future to the simple past, which makes sense grammatically.\n\nSince the claim directly links these two forms as counterparts in their respective tenses, I don't see any discrepancies in the table data provided. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table, and thus it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"!simple present / future\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about grammar in Nepali, specifically looking at the simple past tense compared to the future tense.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns like !simple present/future, probable future, simple past, etc., and rows for different grammatical persons like first person singular, plural, second person singular low-grade, middle-grade/plural, high grade, third person singular low-grade, middle-grade/plural masculine.\n\nThe claim mentions two forms: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\" as the simple past, and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\". So I need to find these in the table.\n\nStarting with \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\", which is first person singular low-grade. In the table, under first person singular low-grade row, the 'simple present/future' column has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu 'i (will) do'\", but that's first person singular. Wait, no, actually, looking at the rows, first person singular is the first row. The \"probable future\" for first person singular is \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\", wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, let me look again. Each row represents a grammatical person, and each column represents different tenses. For example, in the second row (first person plural), columns are probable future, simple past, etc. So for \"garis gari\", which is first row, third column (simple past). Let me check:\n\nIn the table:\n- First person singular low-grade: under 'injunctive' it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\", but wait no, that's second row.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking for \"garis gari\" in the simple past column (third column). The first row (first person singular) has \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\" under 'past habitual'? No, wait the columns are:\n\nThe headers are: !simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nSo for the first row (first person singular), in the third column (simple past) it's \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\", but that might be third person. Wait no, let me see:\n\nWait, in the first row: the columns are filled as:\n- !simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu\n- probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0928\u0932\u093e garaul\u0101\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0926 gar\u1ebd (is it?)\nWait, looking at the first row's third column, under 'simple past' for first person singular, it says \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\". No, wait no. Let me check each cell.\n\nLooking back, the table's rows are:\n\n1. First person singular: \n   - simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu\n   - probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0928\u0932\u093e garaul\u0101\n   - simple past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0926 gar\u1ebd\n   - past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0926 garthede (but in the table it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901\" so maybe I'm misreading)\nWait, no. The first row under 'simple past' is \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\"? No, wait, looking at the HTML:\n\nThe third column for each row is labeled \"simple past\". Let me check each row.\n\nFirst row (first person singular):\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0926 gar\u1ebd 'i did'\n\nSecond row (first person plural):\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garya\u0169 'we did'\n\nThird row (second person singular low-grade):\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis 'you did' \u2192 this is the one mentioned in the claim.\n\nFourth row (second person middle-grade/plural):\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c garyau 'you did'\n\nFifth row (high grade):\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u092d\u092f\u094b garnubhayo 'you did'\n\nSixth row (third person singular low-grade):\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis 'he/ she/ it did'? Wait, no, third person would be \"\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\", but here it's second person.\n\nWait, in the table, for first row (first person singular), the 'simple past' is \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\". No, looking at the HTML:\n\nThe first row has:\n- !simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu\n- probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0928\u0932\u093e garaul\u0101\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0926 gar\u1ebd\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0926 garthede (but in the table it's written as \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b\" perhaps? Wait, no, in the HTML code, the first row's third column is \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b\". Let me check:\n\nLooking at the HTML for the first row:\nThe third cell (simple past) says \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". So for first person singular, simple past is \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b\".\n\nWait, but in the claim, it's about \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\", which would be under second person singular low-grade.\n\nLooking at third row (second person singular low-grade), the columns are:\n- !simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\n- probable future: \u0917\u0930\u093e\u0909\u0928\u0941 garau nu\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0928\u0941 garthine nu\n- injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\n- imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947 gar\u00e9\n\nSo in the third row, second column (simple past) is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\", but wait no: looking at the table data, it's \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b\" for first person, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are arranged differently. Let me try to parse each cell correctly.\n\nEach row has six cells corresponding to the six columns:\n1. !simple present/future\n2. probable future\n3. simple past\n4. past habitual\n5. injunctive\n6. imperative\n\nSo for first person singular (row 0):\n- Column 0: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu 'i will do'\n- Column 1: \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0928\u0932\u093e garaul\u0101 'he/ she will do me'\n- Column 2: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0926 gar\u1ebd 'he/ she did me'\n- Column 3: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0926 garthede 'he/ she was doing me'\n- Column 4: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may I do'\n- Column 5: \u0917\u0930\u0947 gar\u00e9 'do!'\n\nFor second person singular low-grade (row 2):\n- Column 0: \u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu 'you will do'\n- Column 1: \u0917\u0930\u093e\u0909\u0928\u0941 garau nu 'he/ she will do you'\n- Column 2: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garisid? Or is it \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b\"? Wait, looking at the HTML:\n\nIn row 2 (second person singular low-grade), the third column says \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the claim says that \"garis gari\" is the simple past for \"garchas garchas\". Wait, no: the claim says \"garis gari\" is the simple past of \"garchas garchas\"? Or perhaps it's referring to the future form being \"garchas\", and the past being \"garis\".\n\nWait, in the claim, \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari 'you did' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\". So \"garchas\" is the present/future form, and \"garis\" is the past.\n\nLooking at the table, for second person singular low-grade (row 2), the future tense in column 0 is \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\", not \"garchas\". Wait, but the claim says \"garchas\". Hmm, perhaps there's a misalignment. Maybe \"garchas\" corresponds to another row.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. The first column is !simple present/future, which in first person singular is \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchu\", not \"garchas\".\n\nSo if the claim refers to \"garchas\" as the future form, but in the table, it's \"garachas\"? Wait, no, looking at the HTML:\n\nIn row 0 (first person singular), column 0: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu\nRow 1 (first person plural), column 0: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu (same as first person)\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"garchas\" is a misspelling or different form. Alternatively, the table may have \"garchas\" in another row.\n\nWait, looking at the second row (first person plural), column 0: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu, same as first person.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"garchas\" refers to third person singular, but that's not in this table.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are arranged differently. Let me count the cells again.\n\nEach row has six cells: 0-5.\n\nSo for row 2 (second person singular low-grade), column 0 is \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\", which is the future tense. So if someone says \"garchas\" as the future, it's not present in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the cell data. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at row 2 (second person singular low-grade), column 0: \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\"\n\nSo the claim seems to refer to a future form \"garchas\", which doesn't match any cell in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to another grammatical person or tense not covered in this table.\n\nBut assuming that the claim is correct, and that \"garis\" is the past of \"garchas\", then we need to find where \"garchas\" is the future form.\n\nLooking at row 0 (first person singular), column 0: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu\nRow 1 (first person plural): same as first person\nRow 2 (second person singular): \u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\nRow 3 (second person plural)\nRow 4 (third person singular masculine)\nRow 5 (third person singular feminine)\n\nWait, perhaps the table includes more rows. But in the provided data, only row 0 to row 5 are present.\n\nSo if \"garchas\" is a future form, it's not listed here, unless I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"garchas\" is the imperative or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim has a typo. Or perhaps \"garis\" is used differently.\n\nBut focusing on what's in the table: for second person singular low-grade (row 2), the simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\", which is present as cell (2,2).\n\nSo the claim is saying that \"garis gari\" is the simple past of \"garchas\". But in reality, in this table, the future form for second person singular is \"garachhu\" or \"garachis\"? Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"garchas\" is a misrendering of another cell. Maybe it's actually \"garchu\" which would be first person future.\n\nBut regardless, based on the table provided, the simple past tense for second person singular low-grade is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\", and the future is \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\".\n\nTherefore, if the claim says that \"garis\" is the past of \"garchas\", but in reality, \"garchas\" isn't a future form in this table. So perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps \"garchas\" is another term for the future tense.\n\nWait, perhaps in the table, column 0 is not always \"future\", but the exclamation mark makes it uncertain.\n\nThe first column is labeled \"!simple present/future\". So perhaps that's an Either-Or, depending on context? Or maybe the exclamation indicates something else.\n\nAlternatively, the exclamation might be a typo and should be a question mark or something else.\n\nBut in any case, based on the table, for second person singular low-grade (row 2), the simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\" (cell 2,2) and future is \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\" (cell 2,0).\n\nTherefore, if the claim says that \"garis\" is the past of \"garchas\", but in reality, the past is \"garis\" when the future is \"garchu\", not \"garchas\". So perhaps the claim is referring to another grammatical person.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that in the table, for second person singular low-grade, the simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\" and the future is \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\".\n\nSo if someone uses \"garchas\" as the future form, but it's not present in the table, perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is correct in a different context or dialect.\n\nBut given that, I think the answer would be to explain that based on the table, the simple past for second person singular low-grade is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\", and the future is \"\u06af\u0627\u0631\u0686\u06be\u0648 garchhu\".\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"garis\" is the past of \"garchas\" may not align with this specific table.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided data, the correct information about the verbs in different grammatical forms for second person singular low-grade is as follows:\n\n- **Future Tense**: The future tense verb form is \"\u0917\u0930\u091b\u0941 garchhu\".\n- **Past Tense**: The past tense verb form is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\".\n\nThus, the claim that \"garis\" is the past of \"garchas\" does not align with the given table. The correct past tense is \"\u0433\u0430\u0440is garis\", and the future tense is \"\u06af\u0627\u0631\u0686\u06be\u0941 garchhu\".",

In the table, I see that each row corresponds to a different grammatical category. For first person plural, the probable future cell is indeed \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091bau\u0901 garcha\u0169\". So this part matches.\n\nNext, the second part of the claim refers to \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do' in the imperative.\" I need to check where this phrase appears in the table. The imperative column is one of the columns under each row, so for each grammatical category (like first person singular, plural, etc.), there's an entry in the imperative column.\n\nLooking at the third person singular low-grade row, specifically, the imperative cell is \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos 'may he do'.\" But the claim says \"he used to do,\" which corresponds more to past habitual or present perfect. Wait, but the table has separate cells for simple past and past habitual. So in the first row (first person singular), the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0901 gar\u1ebd\" and the simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e.\" For third person singular low-grade, the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo,\" which is \"he did.\" The imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos.\"\n\nWait, so in the third person middle-grade plural row, the imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d gar\u016bn 'may they do'.\" But for the third person singular low-grade, the imperative is about may he do, not the past.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says that \"gar\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" (past habitual of he) is in the imperative column. But looking at the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\" is in the past habitual column for third person singular low-grade. However, the imperative for third person singular low-grade is \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos.\" So \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" isn't in the imperative cell but in the past habitual.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says that in the probable future, the phrase is \"gar\u091bau\u0901 garcha\u0169,\" which matches the probable future column for first person plural. Then it says that in the imperative, the phrase is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo.\" But from the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" is under past habitual for third person singular low-grade, not in the imperative.\n\nTherefore, there's a mismatch here. The claim seems to be incorrectly associating \"gar\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" with the imperative instead of the past habitual. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" with the imperative column when it's actually under the past habitual. Thus, the relevant cells don't support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim says. It states: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do'.\" So, I need to check if 'garchas' in the simple present tense corresponds correctly to 'gares' in the imperative form as their simple past counterparts.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different grammatical categories like first person singular, plural, etc., and columns represent different tenses such as present/future, past, habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two forms:\n1. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' \u2013 which is in the first column, marked as \"simple present / future.\"\n2. \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do' \u2013 this is under the \"imperative\" column.\n\nWait, I notice a typo in the claim: it says \"garesis\" but in the table, the correct form is \"gares\". So perhaps the claim meant \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\" as the imperative form. That makes sense because \"may you do\" is an imperative.\n\nNow, checking the columns for each tense:\n\n- For \"simple past\", looking at the third column (simple past) in the row where the subject is \"second person singular low - grade,\" which corresponds to 'you' in a less formal context.\n\nIn that row:\n- Simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\n- Simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\n\nSo, the claim says that 'garchas' (simple present) should be the simple past for 'gares' (imperative). But in reality, the simple past of 'you did' is \"garis,\" not \"garchas.\" Therefore, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, no. The claim seems to mix up tenses. It says that 'garchas' should be the simple past for 'gares.' But looking at the table:\n\n- 'garchas' (second person singular low-grade) is in the future tense, present participle, but actually, it's under \"probable future,\" which I think is a translation issue. Wait, no, the first column is labeled as \"!simple present / future.\" So perhaps that indicates a future tense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the columns. Let me re-examine the table structure:\n\nEach row has six cells corresponding to different tenses:\n1. !simple present/future\n2. probable future\n3. simple past\n4. past habitual\n5. injunctive\n6. imperative\n\nSo for each subject, the first column is the future or present simple (e.g., \"I will do\" in first person singular), the second column is the probable future (which might be a translation of future continuous?), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are arranged as:\n- Column 1: Future tense\n- Column 2: Probable future (maybe a future continuous or another aspect)\n- Column 3: Simple past\n- Column 4: Past habitual (e.g., 'used to')\n- Column 5: Injunctive (used for advice, suggestions)\n- Column 6: Imperative\n\nSo the claim says that \"garchas\" (which is in the first column of the second person singular low-grade row) should be the simple past for \"gares\" (which is in the imperative column of the same row).\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\nIn the second person singular low-grade row:\n- Simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\n- Simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\n\nSo, 'garchas' is the future tense (you will do), 'garis' is the simple past (you did), and 'gares' is the imperative (may you do).\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that 'garchas' is the simple past for 'gares.' That's not accurate because 'garchas' is future, and 'gares' is imperative. The actual simple past is 'garis.'\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. So the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\nThe claim refers to two forms:\n1. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938 garchas (second person singular low-grade, first column: future tense)\n2. \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares (imperative, sixth column)\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row 3 (since rows start from 0, but I need to check how they're indexed). Wait, the rows are likely indexed starting at 0.\n\nLooking back, the table's rows correspond to different subjects:\n\nRow 0: First person singular\nRow 1: First person plural\nRow 2: Second person singular high-grade (formal)\nRow 3: Second person singular low-grade (informal)\nRow 4: First person plural informal\nEtc.\n\nSo 'garchas' is in row 3, column 0 (since columns start from 0). The imperative 'gares' is also in row 3, column 5.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, column 0 (future tense: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938 garchas)\n- Row 3, column 5 (imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares)\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions 'garesis' which is a typo for 'gares.' So perhaps it's correctly pointing to row 3, column 5.\n\nSo in conclusion, the claim is incorrect because 'garchas' is future tense, not simple past. The relevant cells are indeed those two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates \"garchas\" with the simple past tense of \"gares.\" Analysis shows that \"garchas\" is future tense, and \"gares\" is imperative. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim asserts that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938 garchas\" (future tense) corresponds to the simple past of \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\" (imperative).\n\n2. **Review Table Structure:** Each row represents a grammatical subject, with columns for different tenses.\n\n3. **Locate Tense Columns:**\n   - Column 0: Future/Probable future\n   - Column 1: Probable future\n   - Column 2: Simple past\n   - Column 3: Past habitual\n   - Column 4: Injunctive\n   - Column 5: Imperative\n\n4. **Analyze Rows:** Focusing on the second person singular low-grade row (row index 3):\n   - Future/Probable future: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938 garchas\"\n   - Simple past: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis\"\n   - Imperative: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\"\n\n5. **Verify Tenses:** \n   - \"garchas\" is the future tense.\n   - \"gares\" is imperative, not simple past.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The claim mixes up tenses, making it incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** {\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"simple present/future\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}]}",
