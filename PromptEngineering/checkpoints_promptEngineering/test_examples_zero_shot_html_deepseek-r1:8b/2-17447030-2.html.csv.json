The claim states: \"when the opponent be dan severn , the method be submission (arm triangle choke) and the event be ufc japan : ultimate japan\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if any match all three conditions mentioned in the claim. The columns relevant here are 'opponent', 'method', and 'event'. \n\nLooking at row by row:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is johnathan ivey - doesn't match.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is wes sims - nope.\n3. Row 2: Opponent is dan severn, method is submission (arm triangle choke), and event is ufc japan : ultimate japan. This matches all three conditions of the claim.\n4. The rest of the rows don't have dan severn as the opponent with the same method and event.\n\nSo, there's exactly one row that meets all the criteria mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has several columns: res (which seems to be the result of the match), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. My focus is on the \"record\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nThe claim states that only one fighter has a 5-3 record. So I need to check how many fighters have this specific record in the table. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one and note down the records:\n\n1. Row 0: Win, Record 6-4 (1) \u2192 Not 5-3\n2. Row 1: Loss, Record 5-4 (1) \u2192 Close to 5-3 but not exactly.\n3. Row 2: Loss, Record 5-3 (1) \u2192 This is a 5-3 record.\n4. Row 3: Win, Record 5-2 (1) \u2192 Not 5-3\n5. Row 4: Win, Record 4-2 (1) \u2192 Not 5-3\n6. Row 5: Loss, Record 3-2 (1) \u2192 Not 5-3\n7. Row 6: NC, Record 3-1 (1) \u2192 Not 5-3\n8. Row 7: Loss, Record 3-1 \u2192 3-1 is different from 5-3.\n9. Row 8: Win, Record 3-0 \u2192 Not 5-3\n10. Row 9: Win, Record 2-0 \u2192 Not 5-3\n11. Row 10: Win, Record 1-0 \u2192 Not 5-3\n\nFrom this, only Row 2 (Dan Severn) has a record of 5-3. So that's one fighter.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Are there any others? Looking through each row again:\n\nRow 1 is 5-4, which is different. Row 2 is 5-3. No others match 5-3. So only Dan Severn has a 5-3 record.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"only 1 fighter\" and that's correct. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The \"record\" column is where we check for 5-3. Each row has a \"row_index\" (like 0 to 10) and the column name \"record\".\n\nSo the relevant cell is the one in Row 2, Column \"record\". \n\nWait, but let me count again. Rows are from 0 to 10. So Row 2 corresponds to Dan Severn's match where he lost with a 5-3 record.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells should include this specific row and column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the \"record\" column for any fighter with a 5-3 record. Only one fighter (Dan Severn) has such a record, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
