    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the eurovision song contest 1958 consisted of 6 different languages\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim itself. It's stating that in 1958, the Eurovision Song Contest had songs from 6 different languages. My task is to verify this using the given table. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various entries with details like draw number, language, artist, song title, English translation, place, and points. The years mentioned in the table go up to around 2011, so 1958 would be somewhere near the top.\n\nI need to find out how many different languages are represented in the Eurovision 1958 contest based on this table. If there are exactly six different languages, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nFirst, I'll check each row corresponding to the early years. The first few entries: \n\n- Row 1: Italian\n- Row 2: Dutch\n- Row 3: French\n- Row 4: French again (so French is already counted once)\n- Row 5: Swedish\n- Row 6: Danish\n\nWait, but 1958 would only include a selection of countries. The table might not list all participants, just the ones that made it or are highlighted somehow.\n\nLooking at row 10, I see German and Italian as languages, but the song is \"-\" which might mean it didn't participate, so maybe they're not part of Eurovision 1958.\n\nWait, no, because Eurovision 1958 had several countries. Let me count the unique languages in the table up to row 6:\n\n1. Italian (row1)\n2. Dutch (row2)\n3. French (row3)\n4. Swedish (row5)\n5. Danish (row6)\n\nThat's five different languages so far. The claim says six, so maybe I'm missing one.\n\nLooking further, perhaps the sixth language is German. Let me check if any row before 10 has German as the language. \n\nRows:\n\n- Row1: Italian\n- Row2: Dutch\n- Row3: French\n- Row4: French again (already counted)\n- Row5: Swedish\n- Row6: Danish\n- Then rows 7,8,9 are French again and German.\n\nSo row7 is French, row8 is German, row9 is French again. So German is another language, making it the sixth unique language.\n\nWait, but in the table, the first six entries (rows1-6) include Italian, Dutch, French, Swedish, Danish, and then in row8 we get German. So that's five by row6, plus German as row8, making six.\n\nBut wait, does that mean that in 1958, there were six languages? Or is the table representing all participants up to 2011? No, the table seems to list various entries, not just 1958.\n\nI need to focus on Eurovision 1958 specifically. The claim is about that year's contest. So I should look for which countries participated in 1958 and their languages.\n\nFrom what I recall, Eurovision 1958 was held in France (Paris), and the participants were from several European countries. Let me list the countries that took part:\n\n1. Italy\n2. Netherlands\n3. France\n4. Sweden\n5. Denmark\n6. Germany\n\nThat's six countries, each with their own languages: Italian, Dutch, French, Swedish, Danish, German.\n\nLooking back at the table, these are all present in the early rows. For example:\n\n- Row1: Italy (Italian)\n- Row2: Netherlands (Dutch)\n- Row3 and Row4: France (French)\n- Row5: Sweden (Swedish)\n- Row6: Denmark (Danish)\n- Row8: Germany (German)\n\nSo that's six languages in total. Each of these countries had at least one participant in Eurovision 1958, so the claim is TRUE because there were indeed six different languages represented.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify which cells correspond to these languages. Each country corresponds to a row in the table where their language is listed.\n\nI'll list each relevant cell:\n\n1. Italian: row0 (row_index=0)\n2. Dutch: row1 (row_index=1)\n3. French: row2 and row3 (but only one needed, perhaps row2 as an example)\n4. Swedish: row4 (row_index=4)\n5. Danish: row5 (row_index=5)\n6. German: row7 (row_index=7)\n\nWait, in the table:\n\n- Row1 is Dutch\n- Row2 is French\n- Row3 is French again\n- Row8 is German\n\nSo to list all six languages with their corresponding rows:\n\n- Italian: row0\n- Dutch: row1\n- French: row2 (or 3, but row2 is the first occurrence)\n- Swedish: row4\n- Danish: row5\n- German: row7\n\nEach of these rows represents a different language from Eurovision 1958, making the claim TRUE.\n\nSo, in the JSON response, I need to list each of these cells as part of the \"languages\" aspect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the Eurovision Song Contest in 1958 included participants from six different languages: Italian, Dutch, French, Swedish, Danish, and German. Each corresponds to specific rows in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"claim\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"languages\": [\n      {\"row_index\": 0, \"language\": \"Italian\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 1, \"language\": \"Dutch\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 2, \"language\": \"French\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 4, \"language\": \"Swedish\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 5, \"language\": \"Danish\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 7, \"language\": \"German\"}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest point score be by a french artist name andr\u00e9 claveau\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the highest points were achieved by a French artist named Andr\u00e9 Claveau. So I need to check if there's an entry in the table where the language is French, the artist is Andr\u00e9 Claveau, and their points are the highest compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different song with its details. The relevant columns here are 'language', 'artist', and 'points'. I'll need to find rows where both 'language' is French and 'artist' is Andr\u00e9 Claveau.\n\nStarting from row 0: language is Italian, so not relevant. Row 1: Dutch, nope. Row 2: French, artist is Andr\u00e9 Claveau. Let's note down this row. Row 3: French again, but the artist is Solange Berry, so not our guy. Row 4: Also French, but a different artist. Continuing, rows 5 to 10 have other languages or artists.\n\nSo only row 2 has both French language and Andr\u00e9 Claveau. Now, I need to check if this is the highest points. To find the highest, I should look across all 'points' column entries.\n\nLooking at the 'points' values: rows go from 13,1,27,1,10,3,8,5,5,24. The highest here seems to be 27 in row 2, which is Andr\u00e9 Claveau's entry. So yes, he has the highest points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Andr\u00e9 Claveau, a French artist, does have the highest point score of 27.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It states that out of the 10 entries (songs) from the 1958 Eurovision contest, three of them are in French. My task is to check each entry in the table and see if exactly three songs have French as their language.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column called \"language\" which lists the languages of each song. Each row represents an entry, so I need to count how many times \"french\" appears in that column across all 10 rows.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: language is Italian.\n2. Row 1: Dutch.\n3. Row 2: French.\n4. Row 3: French.\n5. Row 4: Swedish.\n6. Row 5: Danish.\n7. Row 6: French.\n8. Row 7: German.\n9. Row 8: German.\n10. Row 9: German and Italian.\n\nSo, I can count the number of times \"french\" appears. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: French (1)\nRow 3: French (2)\nRow 6: French (3)\nRows 7-9 don't have French listed except row 10, which is a combination but not just French.\n\nWait, row 10 has both German and Italian. So, it's a bilingual entry, but since the claim is about entries in French, I think only pure French entries count. So, rows 2,3,6 are the ones with \"french\" as their language. That makes three instances.\n\nSo, there are exactly three entries where the language is French. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because it's stating that three out of ten entries are in French, which matches my count.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that among all 10 entries in the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest, none of the songs are in English. So my task is to check each song's language and see if any are English.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various entries with columns like draw number, language, artist, song, etc. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"language\" because that directly tells us the song's language. I don't think the other columns like \"song\", \"artist\", or \"english translation\" will help here, but maybe the \"english translation\" column could indicate if a song was translated into English, which might imply it was originally another language. However, the claim specifically talks about the songs being English, not their translations.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check the \"language\" column:\n\n1. Row 0: Italian\n2.

Since the condition is about the language, I need to look at the \"language\" column for all rows.

The claim is that \"the Eurovision Song Contest 1958 consisted of more than 6 different languages.\" I need to check if this is true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several rows and columns. The relevant columns for checking the number of different languages would likely be the \"language\" column and perhaps the \"place\" or \"points,\" but those don't directly relate to languages. So the main focus is on the \"language\" column.\n\nI need to count how many distinct languages are represented in the table for Eurovision 1958.

So adding those two, it would be Italian, Dutch, French, Swedish, Danish, German, and then in Row 10, Italian is already there, so maybe not an additional one. Or does the dual language count as a separate entry?\n\nI think each row represents a song, so if a song was performed in multiple languages, that's counted once per row. So in this case, Row 10 has both German and Italian, but it's still just one song. So the distinct languages are still six: Italian, Dutch, French, Swedish, Danish, German.\n\nTherefore, the Eurovision Song Contest 1958 had songs performed in six different languages.

However, in row 3, the language is French, not Dutch. So that's a discrepancy. The name matches, but the country doesn't.\n\nTherefore, there might be confusion here. Maybe I should double-check if any Dutch artists have the highest points. Let me scan the table again for Dutch entries:\n\nLooking at the 'language' column:\n- Row 2: Dutch artist Corry Brokken with points 1.\n- No other Dutch artists listed in the table.\n\nSo, the only Dutch artist is Corry Brokken, but their points are lower than others. The highest points are 27 by Andr\u00e9 Claveau (French) and 24 by Lys Assia (German/Italian). \n\nThe claim specifically mentions a Dutch artist named Andr\u00e9 Claveau, which doesn't exist in the table. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no such entry where an artist with that name is Dutch and has the highest points.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure and data. The table has several columns: draw, language, artist, song, english translation, place, points. Each row represents an entry from the Eurovision 1958 song contest.\n\nThe claim is about the number of entries where the language is French. Specifically, it says more than 3 out of 10 entries are in French. So I need to count how many entries have 'French' as their language and see if that number is greater than 3.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Language is Italian.\nRow 2: Dutch.\nRow 3: French.\nRow 4: French.\nRow 5: Swedish.\nRow 6: Danish.\nRow 7: French.\nRow 8: German.\nRow 9: German.\nRow 10: Both German and Italian.\n\nSo let me count the entries where language is French. Rows 3, 4, and 7 are French\u2014so that's three entries. Wait, the claim says \"more than 3,\" which means 4 or more. But in the table, only three entries are French. Therefore, it doesn't meet the condition of more than 3.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if row 10 counts as a separate entry. The language for row 10 is listed as German and Italian. So does that count as two separate languages or one entry with both? Since the claim is about entries being in French, only the ones explicitly marked as French count towards the total.\n\nSo rows 3,4,7 are three entries. That's exactly 3, not more than 3. Therefore, the claim is false because it claims there are more than 3, but there are only 3.\n\nBut wait, another angle: maybe the Eurovision contest in 1958 had more than one song per country? But the table seems to list each entry as a separate performance, possibly from different countries. So I think the count is correct at three entries.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there are exactly 3 French entries, not more than 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"none of the 10 songs in the 1958 Eurovision song contest were Danish\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that out of all 10 songs entered in the 1958 Eurovision, none were from Denmark. So my task is to check each song and see if any are Danish.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists various entries with columns like 'draw', 'language', 'artist', 'song', etc. The relevant column for this claim is \"language,\" specifically whether any of the songs are in Danish.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Language is Italian.\n2. Row 1: Language is Dutch.\n3. Row 2: Language is French.\n4. Row 3: Language is French.\n5. Row 4: Language is Swedish.\n6. Row 5: Language is Danish. Here, we have \"danish\" in the 'language' column.\n7. Row 6: Language is French.\n8. Row 7: Language is French.\n9. Row 8: Language is German.\n10. Row 9: Language is German and Italian.\n\nSo in row 5, the language is Danish. That means there's at least one song that is Danish. Therefore, the claim that \"none of the 10 songs were Danish\" is false because we have at least one Danish song.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if the 'language' column accurately reflects the song's language. In row 5, it says \"danish,\" so yes, that's correct. There's no indication that this entry is incorrect or that the song isn't in Danish.\n\nTherefore, since there's at least one Danish song among the 10, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there's a Danish song listed in row 5 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
