    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nThe claim is: \"there be no team in the division with less than 13 team and position less than 8 for the season 2003 through 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It seems to state that for each season from 2003 to 2012, every team in the division does not have a position (pos) less than 8 and a team number (tms) less than 13 simultaneously.\n\nWait, actually, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It says \"no team in the division with less than 13 team and position less than 8.\" So, for each season, there should not exist any team that has both tms (team number) < 13 AND pos (position) < 8.\n\nWait, no. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read it again: \"there be no team in the division with less than 13 team and position less than 8.\" So for each season from 2003 through 2012, every team does not have both tms <13 AND pos <8. Or perhaps, any team that has tms <13 must not have pos <8.\n\nHmm, actually, the phrasing is a bit unclear. It could mean that no team in the division for those seasons has both a tms less than 13 and a position less than 8. Alternatively, it might mean that there are no teams with tms less than 13 who have pos less than 8.\n\nWait, perhaps another interpretation: The claim is stating that in each of those seasons (2003-2012), every team either has tms >=13 or pos >=8, but not both. Or maybe it's saying that there are no teams where both tms <13 and pos <8.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to check for each season from 2003 to 2012 whether any team in the division (which is Division 1) has both tms <13 and pos <8. If such a team exists in any of those seasons, then the claim is false; otherwise, it's true.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe table starts with season 2003 up to 2012. Let me go through each row and check for each season if there's a team with tms <13 and pos <8.\n\nStarting with 2003:\n- tms:12, pos:11\nSo, tms=12 (which is less than 13), pos=11 (which is greater than 8). So here, the tms is less than 13 but pos is not less than 8. Therefore, for this season, there's no team with both tms <13 and pos <8.\n\nNext, 2004:\n- tms:13, pos:10\ntms=13 (not less than 13), so even if pos were <8, it doesn't matter because tms is not. So no issue here.\n\n2005:\n- tms:13, pos:8\nAgain, tms=13, pos=8 (which is equal to 8). Since the claim says \"less than 8\", pos=8 doesn't count. Also, tms is 13, so even if pos were less, it wouldn't matter.\n\n2006:\n- tms:14, pos:7\ntms=14 >=13, pos=7 <8. So here, the pos is less than 8, but tms is not less than 13, so no issue. The claim requires both to be less, which isn't the case here.\n\n2007:\n- tms:14, pos:12\ntms=14 >=13, pos=12 >8. No problem.\n\n2008:\n- tms:14, pos:11\nSame as above.\n\n2009:\n- tms:15, pos:15\nNo issue.\n\n2010:\n- tms:15, pos:15\nSame.\n\n2011:\n- tms:16, pos:12\ntms=16 >=13, pos=12 >8.\n\n2012:\n- tms:16, pos:10\npos=10 is greater than 8. So no issue here either.\n\nWait a second, let me check again for each season:\n\nLooking specifically for any row where tms <13 AND pos <8.\n\nIn 2003, tms=12 (which is less than 13), but pos=11 (>=8). So doesn't meet both conditions.\n\nNext, 2004: tms=13, so no.\n\n2005: tms=13, same.\n\n2006: tms=14, which is above 13.\n\nWait, 2003 has tms=12. Let me see if in any season from 2003 to 2012, there's a row where both tms <13 and pos <8.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- 2003: tms=12 (yes), pos=11 (no)\n- 2004: tms=13, no\n- 2005: tms=13, no\n- 2006: tms=14, no\n- 2007: tms=14, no\n- 2008: tms=14, no\n- 2009: tms=15, no\n- 2010: tms=15, no\n- 2011: tms=16, no\n- 2012: tms=16, no\n\nSo in all these seasons, the only time tms is less than 13 is 2003 (tms=12). But in that case, pos is 11, which isn't <8.\n\nWait, but let me check for each season's data again:\n\n- 2003: tms=12, pos=11 \u2192 pos not <8\n- 2004: tms=13, pos=10 \u2192 pos not <8\n- 2005: tms=13, pos=8 \u2192 pos is exactly 8\n- 2006: tms=14, pos=7 \u2192 pos <8 but tms isn't <13\n- 2007: tms=14, pos=12\n- 2008: tms=14, pos=11\n- 2009: tms=15, pos=15\n- 2010: tms=15, pos=15\n- 2011: tms=16, pos=12\n- 2012: tms=16, pos=10\n\nWait, in 2006, pos is 7 which is <8. But since tms=14 (not <13), it doesn't violate the claim.\n\nSo for all these seasons, there's no team where both tms <13 and pos <8. So the claim would be true because there are no such teams in those years.\n\nWait but wait again. Let me check 2006: tms=14 >=13, so even though pos is 7 <8, since tms isn't <13, it's okay. So the only time when tms is less than 13 is 2003, where pos is 11. Therefore, in no season from 2003 to 2012 does any team have both tms <13 and pos <8.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be true as there are no teams in the specified years (2003-2012) with both a team number less than 13 and a position below 8. Therefore, **the statement is true**.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{True}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me first understand the claim: It states that there is no division present in the table with a season after 2012 that reached the round of 16 in the FA Cup.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists seasons from 2003 to 2012 for Division 1, and possibly others? Wait, actually, looking closer, all entries under \"division\" are '1'. So it seems like there's only one division (Division 1) in the table provided. \n\nThe claim is about whether any season after 2012 in this division reached the round of 16. But wait, the table only goes up to 2012. So if I'm checking for seasons after 2012, that would mean beyond 2012, like 2013 onwards. However, the table doesn't have data beyond 2012.\n\nSince there's no data post-2012 in Division 1 of the FA Cup, does that mean there are no such instances? The claim says \"no division present...that reach the round of 16,\" so if there are no seasons after 2012 to check, it implies that indeed, no such division exists beyond 2012 reaching the round of 16. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to verify this carefully. The table only has up to 2012. So for any season after 2012 (2013, 2014, etc.), we don't have data here. Thus, in the context of the given table, there are no such instances. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\nI should also check if any cell beyond 2012 is relevant, but since the table doesn't include those years, those cells aren't present. So the relevant cells would be all rows where \"season\" is after 2012, but since the table ends in 2012, there are none. However, to comply with the instructions, I should list any row beyond 2012 if they existed.\n\nWait, actually, no, because the claim refers to seasons after 2012 that are present in the table. Since the table doesn't have any, maybe the relevant cells are those where season >2012, but since there are none, perhaps no relevant cells? But according to the instructions, I need to list cells that are relevant for verification.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell's season is after 2012, it would be relevant. Since all rows have seasons up to 2012, maybe no relevant cells. But wait, the claim says \"after 2012,\" so any row with a season >2012 would be considered. However, since none exist in the table, perhaps there are no relevant cells.\n\nBut looking back at the instructions: if the claim is fully supported, answer TRUE and list the relevant cells that confirm it. If not, FALSE and list why.\n\nIn this case, because there are no seasons after 2012 in Division 1 (since the table stops at 2012), the claim holds true. So I should indicate that all relevant cells are those with season >2012, but since none exist, perhaps that's enough to confirm the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about whether any division in the table (i.e., within this data) after 2012 reached round of 16. Since there are no such rows, the statement is TRUE. Therefore, the relevant cells would be all rows where season >2012, but since none exist, perhaps it's not necessary to list them.\n\nBut according to the example, in the answer, we have to include the relevant cells that confirm the claim. So if the claim is about whether any division after 2012 reached round of 16, and there are no such rows, then all cells with season >2012 (which don't exist) would be the ones to list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look for any row where the season is greater than 2012. Since none are present, perhaps that's why the claim is TRUE because there are no such instances in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are all rows where season >2012, but since they don't exist, maybe it's an empty list? But I think that might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the relevant cells are any row with a season after 2012, which in this case, none, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, no. The instruction says: if fully supported, answer TRUE and include the relevant cells that verify it. So for each condition in the claim, I need to check against the table.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Division present in the table\n2. Season after 2012\n3. Reached round of 16 in FA Cup\n\nSo first, find all divisions in the table. The \"division\" column is '1' for all rows, so only one division (Division 1).\n\nNext, check if any row has a season >2012. None do, since max is 2012.\n\nTherefore, there are no rows where Division 1 has a season after 2012 that reached round of 16. Hence, the claim is TRUE. So the relevant cells would be all rows with season>2012, but since none exist, perhaps it's an empty list.\n\nBut according to the example, the relevant cells include row indices and column names for the cells being checked. Since no such cells exist (no seasons after 2012), maybe we don't need to include any.\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"Carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\"\n\nSo the conditions are:\n- Division present\n- Season after 2012\n- Reached round of 16\n\nFor each cell that is part of verifying these. So for a row to satisfy, it needs to have division='1', season>2012, and in FA Cup.\n\nBut since no such rows exist, maybe the relevant cells are any cell where season>2012 (which would be none). But perhaps I should consider whether any cells meet all three conditions, but since none do, perhaps the claim is vacuously true.\n\nAlternatively, if a row meets one of the conditions, it's still considered. For example, even if the row doesn't have a high enough season, but maybe other aspects.\n\nBut in this case, the claim is about any division in the table that has a season after 2012 and reached round of 16. Since none exist, the statement is TRUE.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is TRUE, with no relevant cells because there are none to check.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying if any division in the provided data (Division 1) had a season after 2012 that resulted in reaching the Round of 16 in the FA Cup. \n\n- **Division Check**: The table contains only Division 1 ('1' for all rows).\n- **Season Check**: All rows have seasons up to 2012; no row exceeds this.\n- **FA Cup Progression**: Since no row has a season beyond 2012, there's no data to indicate any such achievement.\n\nSince no relevant data exists post-2012, the claim is confirmed as TRUE. \n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"No rows in the table have a season greater than 2012 for Division 1 of the FA Cup.\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"all division in the season prior to 2012 reach round 16 in the FA Cup\" is true based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that every division (which in this context seems to be each season) before 2012 reached at least the Round of 16 in the FA Cup. So, I should check all seasons before 2012 and see if their corresponding FA Cup progressions include a Round of 16.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'season' column goes from 2003 up to 2011 (since 2012 is the last one). Each row represents a different season, and each has a 'fa cup' entry. My task is to go through each of these seasons and note whether their FA Cup progressions include \"round of 16\".\n\nI'll start by listing out all the relevant rows:\n\n- 2003: quarter final\n- 2004: round of 32\n- 2005: quarter final\n- 2006: quarter final\n- 2007: round of 16\n- 2008: semi final\n- 2009: quarter - final (typo, but still)\n- 2010: round of 32\n- 2011: round of 32\n\nWait, no. The instruction says the season prior to 2012, so I should check from 2003 to 2011 inclusive.\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to see if they reached Round 16:\n\n- 2003: Quarter Final \u2013 No\n- 2004: Round of 32 \u2013 No\n- 2005: Quarter Final \u2013 No\n- 2006: Quarter Final \u2013 No\n- 2007: Round of 16 \u2013 Yes (this one is good)\n- 2008: Semi Final \u2013 Yes, which is beyond Round 16, so that's a yes.\n- 2009: Quarter - Final \u2013 No\n- 2010: Round of 32 \u2013 No\n- 2011: Round of 32 \u2013 No\n\nSo, out of the seasons from 2003 to 2011, only 2007 and 2008 reached Round 16 or beyond. The rest did not. Therefore, it's not true that all divisions in the seasons prior to 2012 reached Round 16.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if \"round of 16\" is what they consider as reaching that stage. For example, 2007: Round of 16, which is exactly what we need. 2008: Semi Final, which is after Round of 16, so it's a yes because they went beyond.\n\nBut the claim says \"reach round 16\". So, in 2007 and 2008, they did reach Round 16 or more. However, other seasons like 2003, 2004, etc., did not. Therefore, since not all seasons prior to 2012 reached Round 16, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2006 the team in position 8 get to the quarter final\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in the year 2006, the team that was in position 8 reached the quarter finals. So, I need to check if there's a row in the table for the year 2006 where the position is 8 and the FA Cup stage is the quarter final.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, each row represents a different season, from 2003 to 2012. The columns are: season, division, tms, pos, fa cup. So, I need to focus on the 'season' column for 2006 and the corresponding 'pos' (position) and 'fa cup' columns.\n\nI'll start by locating the row for the year 2006. Scanning through the table:\n\n- 2003: position 11, FA Cup: quarter final\n- 2004: position 10, FA Cup: round of 32\n- 2005: position 8, FA Cup: quarter final\n- 2006: position 7, FA Cup: quarter final\n- 2007: position 12, FA Cup: round of 16\n- 2008: position 11, FA Cup: semi final\n- 2009: position 15, FA Cup: quarter - final\n- 2010: position 15, FA Cup: round of 32\n- 2011: position 12, FA Cup: round of 32\n- 2012: position 10, FA Cup: round of 16\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the years. Let me count correctly.\n\nLooking at each <tr> tag:\n\n1. 2003\n2. 2004\n3. 2005\n4. 2006\n5. 2007\n6. 2008\n7. 2009\n8. 2010\n9. 2011\n10. 2012\n\nSo, row index starts at 0 for 2003.\n\nFor 2006, the row is the 4th one (index 3). The 'pos' column in this row is 7, and the 'fa cup' is \"quarter final\".\n\nWait, but the claim says position 8. So, according to the table, in 2006, the team was in position 7, not 8. Therefore, if the claim states position 8, that's incorrect because the position for 2006 is 7.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake in reading the table. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again at each row:\n\n- 2003: pos 11\n- 2004: pos 10\n- 2005: pos 8\n- 2006: pos 7\n- 2007: pos 12\n- 2008: pos 11\n- 2009: pos 15\n- 2010: pos 15\n- 2011: pos 12\n- 2012: pos 10\n\nYes, that's correct. So in 2006, the position is 7, not 8. Therefore, the claim that the team in position 8 reached the quarter final is incorrect for 2006.\n\nWait another moment\u2014maybe I misread the 'pos' column. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the HTML code, each <td> under 'pos' is as follows:\n\n- 2003: 11\n- 2004: 10\n- 2005: 8\n- 2006:7\n- 2007:12\n- 2008:11\n- 2009:15\n- 2010:15\n- 2011:12\n- 2012:10\n\nYes, that's correct. So in 2006, the position is 7, not 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the team in position 8 didn't reach the quarter final in 2006; it was position 7 that did so.\n\nBut wait, let me check the 'fa cup' column for each year to confirm:\n\n- 2003: quarter final\n- 2004: round of 32\n- 2005: quarter final\n- 2006: quarter final\n- 2007: round of 16\n- 2008: semi final\n- 2009: quarter - final (typo? Maybe it's a formatting issue, but the content is still 'quarter - final')\n- 2010: round of 32\n- 2011: round of 32\n- 2012: round of 16\n\nSo in 2006, the FA Cup stage was indeed the quarter final. But the position was 7, not 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the team in position 8 didn't reach the quarter final in 2006; it's the team in position 7 that did so.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the team in position 8 reached the quarter final in 2006. By examining the table:\n\n- In 2006 (row index 3), the 'pos' column is 7 and the 'fa cup' is \"quarter final\".\n- The 'pos' column for 2006 does not have a value of 8.\n\nSince the position was actually 7, the claim is false. The relevant cells are in row 3 for 'pos'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
