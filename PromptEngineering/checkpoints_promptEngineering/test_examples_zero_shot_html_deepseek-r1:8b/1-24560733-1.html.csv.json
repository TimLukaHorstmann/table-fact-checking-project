    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant. The claim says: \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It seems to be talking about four games where the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless. So, I should look for games where the opponent's points (opponents column) are zero.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 1: Opponent is Ole Miss. They scored 14 points.\n- Game 2: Opponent is Cincinnati. They scored 0 points. That's one game.\n- Game 3: Opponent is Xavier. They scored 7 points.\n- Game 4: Opponent is Georgia (9). They scored 0 points. That's another game.\n- Game 5: Opponent is Vanderbilt (10). They scored 0 points. Third game.\n- Game 6: Opponent is Michigan State. They scored 6 points.\n- Game 7: Opponent is Alabama (18). They scored 13 points.\n- Game 8: Opponent is West Virginia. They scored 6 points.\n- Game 9: Opponent is Evansville. They scored 0 points. Fourth game.\n- Game 10: Opponent is Tennessee. They scored 13 points.\n\nSo, the opponents were scoreless in games 2, 4, 5, and 9. That's four games where Wildcats kept the opponent scoreless.\n\nNow, checking each row:\n\nRow 1 (game 1): Opponents have 14 points \u2192 not scoreless.\nRow 2: 0 \u2192 yes.\nRow 3: 7 \u2192 no.\nRow 4: 0 \u2192 yes.\nRow 5: 0 \u2192 yes.\nRow 6: 6 \u2192 no.\nRow 7:13\u2192no.\nRow8:6\u2192no.\nRow9:0\u2192yes.\nRow10:13\u2192no.\n\nSo, games 2,4,5,9 are the relevant ones where opponents were scoreless. Each of these corresponds to row indices 1,3,4,8 (since rows start at 0). The column is \"opponents\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 1: game 2 \u2192 column opponents\nRow 3: game 5 \u2192 same column?\nWait no, let's correct. The table starts with row index 0 as game 1.\n\nSo, Game 2 is row index 1, column \"opponents\".\nGame4 is row index3.\nGame5 is row4.\nGame9 is row8.\n\nEach of these rows has the opponents' points as zero, so they are relevant for verifying the claim that Wildcats kept the opponent scoreless in four games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 in any game they lose\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It's saying that in any game the Wildcats lost, their points were never more than 7. So, I need to check all games where the result was a loss and see what their score was.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents' points, and record. My focus is on the rows where the result is a loss because that's when the Wildcats didn't win. So I should filter those rows first.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Result is \"loss\". Wildcats scored 7.\n2. Game 7: Result is \"loss\". They scored 0.\n3. Game 10: Result is \"loss\". They scored 6.\n\nWait, that's three games where they lost. Now, the claim says they never scored more than 7 in any game they lost. Let's check their points in these losses:\n\n- In game 1, Wildcats scored 7. That's exactly 7, so it doesn't exceed 7.\n- Game 7: They scored 0, which is way below 7.\n- Game 10: They scored 6 again, still under 7.\n\nSo in all the loss games, their points were 7 or less. The highest they scored in a loss was 7 in game 1. That doesn't violate the claim because it's not more than 7. Therefore, the claim holds true based on this analysis.\n\nI don't see any rows where, in a loss, they scored above 7. So I think the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 in any game they lose,\" we examine all games with a result of \"loss\" and check their points.\n\n- **Game 1**: Wildcats scored 7 (does not exceed 7).\n- **Game 7**: Scored 0.\n- **Game 10**: Scored 6.\n\nIn each case, the score does not exceed 7. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"the wildcat lose 1 game in september and 2 game in november.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'date' column to see which games were played in September and November.\n\nIn the table, each row has a 'date'. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 1: sept 20\n- Rows 2-7: from sept 27 onwards, up to nov 1.\n- Then rows 8-10: nov 8, 15, 22.\n\nSo in September, only row 1 (game 1) was played on sept 20. In November, games 7,8,9,10 were played on nov 1,8,15,22 respectively.\n\nNow, looking at the 'result' column:\n\n- Row 1: loss\n- Rows 2-6: wins\n- Row 7: loss\n- Rows 8-10: wins\n\nSo in September (only game 1), Wildcats lost 1 game. That's correct for the first part.\n\nIn November, games 7 and 8,9,10 were played. The results are:\n\n- Game 7: loss\n- Games 8,9: wins\n- Game 10: loss\n\nSo in November, there are two losses (games 7 and 10) and two wins (games 8 and 9). Wait, but the claim says \"lose 1 game in september and 2 games in november.\" That would mean total of three losses. But looking at the table, Wildcats lost in September once and twice in November, totaling three losses.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't mention the total number, just that they lost 1 in Sep and 2 in Nov. So let's check each part:\n\nSeptember: They lost 1 game (game 1). That matches.\n\nNovember: Looking at November dates (games 7,8,9,10):\n\n- Game 7: loss\n- Games 8,9: wins\n- Game 10: loss\n\nSo in November, they lost two games. Therefore, the claim is correct: 1 loss in September and 2 in November.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor September, only game 1 (row 0) has result 'loss' in the 'result' column.\n\nFor November losses, games 7 and 10 (rows 6 and 9) have 'loss' as their results. But wait, let's check:\n\nRow indices start from 0 to 9.\n\n- Game 7: row index 6\n- Game 10: row index 9\n\nSo the columns relevant are 'result' for each of these games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"the wildcat play 2 game in september , 4 game in october , and 4 game in november.\"\n\nI need to find games played by Wildcats (Arkansas) during September, October, and November based on the table. The table has a 'date' column which I can use to cross-reference.\n\nLooking at each month:\n\n1. **September**: The claim mentions \"game 2.\" In the table, looking for a game in September where Wildcats played and the result is either win or loss. Checking row 0: Sept 20 vs Ole Miss, Wildcats scored 7, opponent scored 14\u2014result is loss. So game 1 was on Sept 20. There's no mention of game 2 in September; maybe it's not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. It says \"play 2 game in september.\" Maybe it refers to two games? Let me check all September games. Only row 0 is in September (game 1), so there's only one game in September. So if the claim mentions playing two games in September, that would be incorrect.\n\nBut let me make sure. The table shows only one game in September: game 1 on Sept 20 against Ole Miss. So if the claim says they played two games in September, that would be FALSE unless there's another game I'm missing. Looking through the dates, after Sept 20, the next is Sept 27, which is Cincinnati (game 2). But that's October.\n\nSo for September, only game 1 exists. So claiming they played two games in September is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to October: The claim says \"4 game in october.\" Looking at the table, games with dates in October are:\n\n- Oct 4 vs Xavier (game 3)\n- Oct 11 vs Georgia (game 4)\n- Oct 18 vs Vanderbilt (game 5)\n- Oct 25 vs Michigan State (game 6)\n\nThat's four games in October. So the claim about four games is correct here.\n\nThen November: The claim mentions \"4 game in november.\" Checking the table, November games are:\n\n- Nov 1 vs Alabama (game 7) \u2013 Wildcats lost\n- Nov 8 vs West Virginia (game 8)\n- Nov 15 vs Evansville (game 9)\n- Nov 22 vs Tennessee (game 10)\n\nSo four games in November as well.\n\nPutting it together, the claim says Wildcats played two games in September, four in October, and four in November. But in September, only one game was played. Therefore, the overall claim is incorrect because the number of games in September doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding \"play 2 game\" as two games? If the claim says they played two games in September, but there's only one, then that part is wrong. So the entire statement would be FALSE because it incorrectly states two games in September.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying they have games numbered 2,4, and 4 across the months. Looking at game numbers:\n\n- Game 1: Sept 20\n- Game 2: Sept 27 (Cincinnati) but that's October? Wait no, game 2 is on Sept 27 which would be September. But in the table, game 2 is on Sept 27, so that's also September.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the games:\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Sept 20: game 1\n- Sept 27: game 2 (Cincinnati)\n- Oct 4: game 3\n- Oct 11: game 4\n- Oct 18: game 5\n- Oct 25: game 6\n- Nov 1: game 7\n- Nov 8: game 8\n- Nov 15: game 9\n- Nov 22: game 10\n\nSo in September, two games: game 1 on Sept 20 and game 2 on Sept 27.\n\nIn October, four games: games 3,4,5,6.\n\nIn November, three games (games 7,8,9) wait, no, up to game 10. Wait:\n\n- Nov 1: game 7\n- Nov 8: game 8\n- Nov 15: game 9\n- Nov 22: game 10\n\nThat's four games in November as well.\n\nSo the claim says two games in September, four in October, and four in November. But according to this breakdown, there are two in Sept (games 1 and 2), four in Oct (3,4,5,6), and four in Nov (7,8,9,10). So that matches.\n\nWait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recount the games by month:\n\n- September: game 1 on 20th and game 2 on 27th \u2013 two games\n- October: games 3,4,5,6 \u2013 four games\n- November: games 7,8,9,10 \u2013 four games\n\nSo the claim is correct. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nWait, this contradicts my initial thought because I didn't realize game 2 was in September initially. So the key is correctly assigning each game to its respective month based on the date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate: two in Sept, four in Oct, four in Nov.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Wildcats played two games in September (games 1 and 2), four in October (games 3-6), and four in November (games 7-10).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"type\": \"True\",\n    \"cells\": [\n      {\n        \"month\": \"September\",\n        \"games\": [\"game 1\", \"game 2\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"month\": \"October\",\n        \"games\": [\"game 3\", \"game 4\", \"game 5\", \"game 6\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"month\": \"November\",\n        \"games\": [\"game 7\", \"game 8\", \"game 9\", \"game 10\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 36 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It seems like the Wildcats (Wildcats) have scored more than their opponents by a significant margin in at least one game. Specifically, they need to have outscored an opponent by 36 points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and their record.\n\nMy task is to check if there's any game where the Wildcats scored 36 more points than their opponent. So I need to look for rows where \"wildcats points\" minus \"opponents\" equals 36 or more.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Game 1: Wildcats scored 7, opponents 14. Difference is -7. Not relevant.\n2. Game 2: Wildcats scored 20, opponents 0. Difference is +20. Not enough.\n3. Game 3: Wildcats 20, opponents 7. Difference +13. Still not 36.\n4. Game 4: Wildcats 26, opponents 0. Difference +26. No.\n5. Game 5: Wildcats 14, opponents 0. Difference +14. Not enough.\n6. Game 6: Wildcats 7, opponents 6. Difference +1. Nope.\n7. Game 7: Wildcats 0, opponents 13. Difference -13. Doesn't help.\n8. Game 8: Wildcats 15, opponents 6. Difference +9. No.\n9. Game 9: Wildcats 36, opponents 0. Oh, here we go! That's a big difference of +36.\n\nSo in game 9, the Wildcats outscore their opponent by exactly 36 points, which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there is at least one instance where they scored 36 more than their opponent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the Wildcats' performance in game 9, where they outscored their opponent by 36 points.

It seems to suggest that in game number 10, the Wildcats (Wildcats) kept their opponents scoreless. So, I should look at game 10 in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result, and opponent's points. Game 10 is on November 22 against Tennessee. The result for that game was a loss, and the opponent scored 13 points. \n\nWait, but the claim says they kept the opponents scoreless. So I need to check if the Wildcats' opponents scored zero points in game 10. However, in the table, under \"opponents\" column for game 10, it shows 13. That means the opponents scored 13 points, not zero. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the Wildcats didn't keep their opponents scoreless in that game.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\". Does this mean that the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless? Or does it refer to the Wildcats being scoreless against their opponents? No, because the Wildcats have points listed as well.

The claim is: \"the wildcat never score more than 7 point in any game they win.\" So, I should check each game where Wildcats won and see if their points ever exceeded 7.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several games where the result is a win. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Game 2: opponent is Cincinnati, Wildcats scored 20 points.\n2. Game 3: Xavier, scored 20.\n3. Game 4: Georgia, 26 points.\n4. Game 5: Vanderbilt, 14.\n5.

The claim says \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" So they're claiming two losses in September, but according to the table, there's only one loss in September (row 1) and one in November (row7). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims two losses in September when there was only one.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow numbers are from 1 to 10.\n\nSeptember games: rows 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nLooking at results:\n- Row1: loss\n- Rows2,3,4,5,6: wins\n\nSo only one loss in September (row1). November games: row7 is the only loss.\n\nThus, the Wildcats lost 1 game in November and 1 game in September. The claim says they lost 1 in November and 2 in September. That's incorrect because there were two losses total across both months, but only one each.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the claim says \"loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" So that would mean 1 loss in November, 2 losses in September. But according to the table, they have 1 loss in November (row7) and 1 loss in September (row1). So the claim is wrong because it's stating two losses in September when there was only one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read again: \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" So they're saying they lost 1 game in November and 2 games in September, making a total of 3 losses? But according to the table, the Wildcats have only two losses: row1 and row7. So that's two total.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because they state three losses (1+2), but there are only two actual losses. Wait no, actually, the claim says \"loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" So it's saying they lost 1 game in November and 2 games in September. But from the table, they have one loss in September and one in November. Therefore, the number of losses doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about the number of losses: 1 in November and 2 in September. But in reality, it's 1 in November and 1 in September. So the claim is false because it claims two losses in September when there was only one, and one in November which is correct.\n\nTherefore, part of the claim is incorrect, making the entire statement FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Wildcats lost 1 game in November and 2 games in September. However, according to the table, they only lost once in each month, totaling two losses. Since the claim incorrectly states there were two losses in September, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the wildcat play 4 game in september , 2 game in october , and 2 game in november.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into three parts:\n1. 4 games in September\n2. 2 games in October\n3. 2 games in November\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'game' column is numbered from 1 to 10, and the 'date' column shows when each game was played. I'll go through each month mentioned in the claim and count how many games were played during that month.\n\nStarting with September:\nThe dates are sept 20 (game 1) and sept 27 (game 2). So only two games in September, not four as claimed. That's a problem because the claim says there should be 4.\n\nNext, October:\nLooking at the dates: oct 4 (3), oct 11 (4), oct 18 (5), and oct 25 (6). That's four games in October, but the claim says only two. Hmm, that doesn't match either.\n\nNovember:\nThe games are nov 1 (7), nov 8 (8), nov 15 (9), and nov 22 (10). Again, four games, but the claim says two.\n\nSo none of the months match the claim. September has two, not four; October has four, not two; November has four, not two. Therefore, all parts of the claim are incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the Wildcats played 2 games in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November, not as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 26 points\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in some game, the Wildcats scored 26 more points than their opponent. So I need to look for any instance where the \"wildcats points\" column is exactly 26 points higher than the \"opponents\" points in the same row.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with details like the game number, date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and their record. I need to focus on the \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\" columns.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 1: Wildcats scored 7, opponents scored 14. So 7 - 14 is -7, not +26.\n2. Row 2: Wildcats scored 20, opponents scored 0. 20 - 0 = 20. Not 26.\n3. Row 3: Wildcats scored 20, opponents scored 7. 20 - 7 = 13. Not 26.\n4. Row 4: Wildcats scored 26, opponents scored 0. 26 - 0 = 26. Oh, that's exactly what the claim is saying.\n5. Row 5: Wildcats scored 14, opponents scored 0. 14 - 0 = 14. Not 26.\n6. Row 6: Wildcats scored 7, opponents scored 6. 7 - 6 = 1. Not 26.\n7. Row 7: Wildcats scored 0, opponents scored 13. 0 - 13 = -13. Not relevant.\n8. Row 8: Wildcats scored 15, opponents scored 6. 15 - 6 = 9. Not 26.\n9. Row 9: Wildcats scored 36, opponents scored 0. 36 - 0 = 36. That's a higher score difference but not exactly 26.\n10. Row 10: Wildcats scored 6, opponents scored 13. 6 - 13 = -7. Not relevant.\n\nSo, in row 4, the Wildcats outscore their opponent by exactly 26 points. That supports the claim.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that this is indeed the maximum. Looking through all rows, no other game shows a difference of +26. The next highest is +20 and then +14, etc., but none reach 26. So the claim isn't about the most they outscore, just whether they did it by 26 at all.\n\nTherefore, since there's at least one instance where they scored 26 more points than their opponent, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
