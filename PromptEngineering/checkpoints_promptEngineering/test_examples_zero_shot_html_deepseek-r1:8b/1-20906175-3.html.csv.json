    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the person with a qb rating of 82.7 score 136 touchdown.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what's being asked. The claim mentions two specific values: a QB rating of 82.7 and scoring 136 touchdowns. My task is to check if there's a row in the table that matches both of these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different person with various statistics. I'll go through each row one by one to see if any match both parts of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first row: charley johnson has a QB rating of 69.6 and scored 108 touchdowns. Neither matches the claim's numbers, so this isn't the one.\n\nNext, jake plummer has a QB rating of 69.0 and 114 touchdowns. Again, doesn't match either number.\n\nThen, jim hart has a QB rating of 66.6 and 247 touchdowns. Still not matching.\n\nMoving on to kurt warner: his QB rating is 91.9 and he scored 100 touchdowns. The QB rating is higher than the claim, so this isn't the one either.\n\nFinally, neil lomax has a QB rating of 82.7, which matches exactly what the claim states. Now, checking the number of touchdowns: his total is 136, which also aligns with the claim.\n\nSo, both the QB rating and touchdown counts in Neil Lomax's row match the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"qb rating\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}]}",

Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"the qb rating for neil lomax be 82.7\". So I need to find Neil Lomax in the table and check his QB rating.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: name, completions, attempts, completion %, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and qb rating. The rows are data about different players.\n\nI'll look for the row where the \"name\" cell is \"Neil Lomax\". Scanning through each row:\n\n1st row: charley johnson \u2013 not him.\n2nd row: jake plummer \u2013 nope.\n3rd row: jim hart \u2013 no.\n4th row: kurt warner \u2013 no.\n5th row: neil lomax \u2013 yes, that's the one.\n\nNow, in Neil Lomax's row, I need to check the \"qb rating\" column. The value there is 82.7. So his QB rating is exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"qb rating\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Charley Johnson having 2047 attempts is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"charley johnson have 2047 attempt\". The key here is that it's referring to the number of attempts made by Charley Johnson.\n\nLooking at the HTML table provided, I see there are several columns related to each player. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'attempts' because that's directly about how many times they've tried something (in this case, probably passing attempts or something similar in a football context).\n\nNext, I'll locate Charley Johnson in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I find Charley Johnson is listed as the first row (row_index 0). So, his attempt count should be checked.\n\nFrom the table data, Charley Johnson has 2047 attempts in the 'attempts' column. That matches exactly what the claim states\u20142047 attempts. Therefore, this supports the claim fully.\n\nSo, I need to structure the response as a JSON object with \"answer\" set to \"TRUE\" and list the relevant cells that confirm this.

The claim says, \"the person who scored 209 touchdowns have a qb rating of 66.6.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row in the table to find someone who has exactly 209 touchdowns. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with the first row: charley johnson. His touchdown column says 108, which is not 209. So that's not him.\n\nNext, jake plummer has 90 touchdowns. Still not 209.\n\nThen, jim hart. He has 209 touchdowns. That matches the claim. Now I need to check his qb rating. Looking at his row, under \"qb rating\" it says 66.6. \n\nSo the claim is correct for this individual.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"100 touchdown be score when the qb rating be 82.7\" is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's asserting that when a quarterback has a QB rating of 82.7, the team scores exactly 100 touchdowns in some context\u2014maybe a game or season? But I'm not entirely sure if \"score\" here refers to touchdowns specifically or total points. Given that the term used is \"touchdown be score,\" it might mean that the number of touchdowns scored is 100.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different quarterback with various stats including completions, attempts, completion percentage, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and QB rating. The QB ratings range from 66.6 to 91.9 in the table. The claim specifically mentions a QB rating of 82.7, so I should look for that in the table.\n\nScrolling through the columns, I see that the last column is \"qb rating.\" Scanning each row:\n\n1. Charley Johnson: 69.6\n2. Jake Plummer: 69.0\n3. Jim Hart: 66.6\n4. Kurt Warner: 91.9\n5. Neil Lomax: 82.7\n\nAh, here we go. Neil Lomax has a QB rating of 82.7. So the relevant row is the fifth one, which is index 4 since it starts from 0.\n\nNow, I need to check if the number of touchdowns for this quarterback is exactly 100. Looking at the \"touchdowns\" column for Neil Lomax: it's listed as 136.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. The claim says 100 touchdowns when QB rating is 82.7, but Neil Lomax has 136 touchdowns with a 82.7 QB rating. So that doesn't add up. \n\nBut hold on, maybe the claim was misinterpreted. Perhaps it's not that in the same game, but rather that achieving a QB rating of 82.7 leads to 100 touchdowns over a season or career. But looking at the data, Neil Lomax has a higher number of touchdowns (136) than 100 with that QB rating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the table. The row for Neil Lomax shows 1817 completions, 3153 attempts, completion percentage 57.6%, 22771 yards, 136 touchdowns, and 90 interceptions, ending up with a QB rating of 82.7. \n\nSo, the number of touchdowns is indeed 136, not 100. Therefore, the claim that \"100 touchdown be score when the qb rating be 82.7\" isn't supported by this data. \n\nI should also consider if there's another QB with a higher number of touchdowns but a lower QB rating, which might invalidate the claim. But since the claim specifically ties 100 touchdowns to an 82.7 rating, and Neil Lomax is the only one with that rating and he has more than 100 touchdowns, it doesn't hold true.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the qb rating for kurt warner be 82.7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It mentions \"qb rating,\" which stands for quarterback rating. The specific quarterback in question is Kurt Warner, and the claimed rating is 82.7.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table to find the relevant data. The table has several columns, including 'name', 'completions', 'attempts', 'completion %', 'yards', 'touchdowns', 'interceptions', and 'qb rating'. My focus is on the row where the name is \"kurt warner\" and specifically on the 'qb rating' column.\n\nLooking through each row, I'll locate Kurt Warner's data. Scanning down, I see that the fourth row corresponds to Kurt Warner. The cells under this row are: 1371 completions, 2105 attempts, 65.1% completion percentage, 15843 yards, 100 touchdowns, 59 interceptions, and finally, the 'qb rating' which is 91.9.\n\nWait a minute, that's not 82.7. The claimed rating is 82.7, but according to the table, Kurt Warner has a qb rating of 91.9. That\u2019s a significant difference. There's no row for Kurt Warner with a qb rating of 82.7 in this table.\n\nI should double-check to ensure I didn't miss any rows or misread the numbers. Let me go through each row again. The first row is Charley Johnson with a qb rating of 69.6, second is Jake Plummer at 69.0, third Jim Hart at 66.6, and fourth Kurt Warner at 91.9. Neil Lomax is fifth with 82.7.\n\nSo, Neil Lomax has the highest qb rating in this table at 82.7, not Kurt Warner. Therefore, the claim that Kurt Warner's qb rating is 82.7 is incorrect.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant for verification. The 'qb rating' column is directly related to the claim, and specifically for Kurt Warner, it's in row 3 (if we start counting from 0). So the relevant cell is row_index: 3, column_name: \"qb rating\".\n\nGiven that the table shows Kurt Warner's qb rating as 91.9 instead of 82.7, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"qb rating\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"charley johnson have 2754 attempt\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it mentions \"charley johnson\" and a number of attempts, specifically 2754. My goal is to find in the table whether this specific information about Charley Johnson's attempts is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player. The columns include name, completions, attempts, completion %, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and qb rating. So, for Charley Johnson, I need to look at the row where his name appears.\n\nThe first step is locating Charley Johnson's row. Scanning through the table, I see that the first row has \"charley johnson\" as the name. Now, focusing on this row:\n\n- Completions: 1030\n- Attempts: 2047\n- Completion %: 50.3%\n- Yards: 14928\n- Touchdowns: 108\n- Interceptions: 110\n- QB Rating: 69.6\n\nThe claim is about attempts, specifically 2754. Wait a second, in Charley Johnson's row, the number of attempts listed is 2047, not 2754. That doesn't match at all. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nI should also check if any other rows have 2754 attempts to see if maybe the claim was referring to another player by mistake. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Jake Plummer: Attempts are 2754.\n- Jim Hart: 5069\n- Kurt Warner: 2105\n- Neil Lomax: 3153\n\nOnly Jake Plummer has 2754 attempts in the table. Therefore, the claim refers to Charley Johnson, but his attempts are not 2754; it's a different number.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim is incorrect for two reasons: either it's referring to the wrong player (Jake Plummer) or it's misstating the number of attempts for Charley Johnson. Either way, the information in the table doesn't support the claim as stated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
