    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medals, total gold medal be 13.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. I think the claim is trying to say two things: that rank 1 has a total medal count greater than 21 and also that the number of gold medals in rank 1 is exactly 13.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a rank, from 1 to 5. The columns are rank, gold, silver, bronze, and total. So for rank 1, I need to look at the 'gold' column and the 'total' column.\n\nIn the first row (rank 1), the gold medals are 13 and the total medals are 22. Now, the claim says \"more than 21 medals.\" Well, 22 is indeed more than 21, so that part checks out.\n\nBut the second part of the claim mentions \"total gold medal be 13.\" Wait, does it mean that in rank 1, the total gold is 13? Yes. So both conditions are met for rank 1: total medals >21 and gold=13.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not misinterpreting the claim. It says \"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medal , total gold medal be 13.\" Maybe it's saying that in rank 1, both the total medals exceed 21 and the gold is 13. Which aligns with what I found.\n\nSo, to check this, I need to look at row index 0 (since rows start at 0) for 'gold' and 'total'. So the relevant cells are row_index=0, column_name='gold' and row_index=0, column_name='total'.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is true because both conditions are satisfied in rank 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a certain claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"rank 3 have 6 total medal.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has columns: rank, gold, silver, bronze, and total. Each row represents a different rank, from 1 to 5. So, rank 3 is one of these rows.\n\nI need to find out what the \"total\" medal count is for rank 3. Looking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific rank. The third row (since ranks start at 1) would be the one where rank is 3. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the third row: rank is 3, gold is 1, silver is 3, bronze is 12. So total medals for rank 3 should be the sum of these. Let's add them up: 1 (gold) + 3 (silver) + 12 (bronze) = 16. Wait, that adds up to 16, not 6.\n\nBut the claim says \"rank 3 have 6 total medal.\" That doesn't match because according to the table, rank 3 has a total of 16 medals. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake adding the numbers. Let me double-check: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 12 makes 16. Yep, that's correct. So the total for rank 3 is definitely not 6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the total medals for rank 3 are 16, not 6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals, but according to the table, rank 3 has 1 gold, 3 silver, and 12 bronze medals, totaling 16. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
