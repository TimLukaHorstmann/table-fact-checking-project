    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"4 of the total match play end in a draw\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table and check the 'result' column because that's where draws are indicated. The claim is specifically about matches ending in a draw, so my focus should be on rows where the result is \"draw\".\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row (index 0):** Result is \"win\". Not a draw.\n2. **Second Row (index 1):** Result is \"win\". Not a draw.\n3. **Third Row (index 2):** Result is \"draw\". This counts as one draw.\n4. **Fourth Row (index 3):** Result is \"loss\". Not a draw.\n5. **Fifth Row (index 4):** Result is \"loss\". Not a draw.\n6. **Sixth Row (index 5):** Result is \"win\". Not a draw.\n7. **Seventh Row (index 6):** Result is \"win\". Not a draw.\n8. **Eighth Row (index 7):** Result is \"win\". Not a draw.\n9. **Ninth Row (index 8):** Result is \"win\". Not a draw.\n10. **Tenth Row (index 9):** Result is \"draw\". That's two draws now.\n11. **Eleventh Row (index 10):** Result is \"draw\". Now we're at three draws.\n12. **Twelfth Row (index 11):** Result is \"win\". Not a draw.\n13. **Thirteenth Row (index 12):** Result is \"loss\". Not a draw.\n14. **Fourteenth Row (index 13):** Result is \"draw\". That brings it to four draws.\n\nWait, the claim says \"4 of the total match play end in a draw.\" So according to my count, there are exactly four draws in the 'result' column. Let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any:\n\nLooking at rows 2 (draw), 9 (draw), 10 (draw), and 13 (draw). That's four in total. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there are more than four draws. Continuing through the list:\n\nRow 14 is a draw, which makes it five. Oh, I see now. So actually, there are five draws, not four.\n\nWait, no, row indices might be different. Let me recount all the 'draw' results properly.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 2: draw (1)\n- Row 9: draw (2)\n- Row 10: draw (3)\n- Row 13: draw (4)\n- Row 14: draw (5)\n\nWait, no, in the table provided, the rows go up to row index 14, right? Let me list out all the 'result' columns with their indices:\n\nRow 0: win\nRow 1: win\nRow 2: draw (count 1)\nRow 3: loss\nRow 4: loss\nRow 5: win\nRow 6: win\nRow 7: win\nRow 8: win\nRow 9: draw (count 2)\nRow 10: draw (count 3)\nRow 11: win\nRow 12: loss\nRow 13: draw (count 4)\nRow 14: draw (count 5)\n\nSo there are five draws in total, not four. That means the claim is incorrect because it states that only four matches end in a draw.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the row indices and results again to make sure I didn't miscount:\n\nLooking at each 'result' column:\n\n1. win\n2. win\n3. draw\n4. loss\n5. loss\n6. win\n7. win\n8. win\n9. win\n10. draw\n11. draw\n12. win\n13. loss\n14. draw\n15. draw\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me list the 'result' for each row:\n\nRow 0: win\nRow 1: win\nRow 2: draw (1)\nRow 3: loss\nRow 4: loss\nRow 5: win\nRow 6: win\nRow 7: win\nRow 8: win\nRow 9: draw (2)\nRow 10: draw (3)\nRow 11: win\nRow 12: loss\nRow 13: draw (4)\nRow 14: draw (5)\n\nSo yes, there are five draws. Therefore, the claim stating that four matches end in a draw is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table's structure. Let me check again because sometimes tables can be confusing with their indices. The user provided a list of rows from 0 to 14 (since the last row index is 14). So total matches are 15. But according to my count, there are five draws.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread some rows. Let me list all 'result' values:\n\n- Row 0: win\n- Row 1: win\n- Row 2: draw\n- Row 3: loss\n- Row 4: loss\n- Row 5: win\n- Row 6: win\n- Row 7: win\n- Row 8: win\n- Row 9: draw\n- Row 10: draw\n- Row 11: win\n- Row 12: loss\n- Row 13: draw\n- Row 14: draw\n\nThat's indeed five draws. So the claim is incorrect because it says four, but there are actually five.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that out of all matches listed, five result in a draw. Therefore, the claim stating that only four matches end in a draw is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the most number of point score in a match be 13 and be a shutout.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The highest points scored in any match should be 13, and that match should have been a shutout, meaning the opposing team scored zero goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row's score column to find the maximum. Let's list out all the scores:\n\n1 - 0, 3 - 0, 1 - 1, 0 - 1, 0 - 3, 1 - 0, 13 - 0, 2 - 0, 3 - 0, 2 - 0, 1 - 1, 0 - 0, 0 - 1, 1 - 0, 0 - 6, 3 - 0.\n\nThe highest score here is 13 - 0. So the maximum points scored in a match are indeed 13. \n\nNext, I need to check if that game was a shutout. A shutout occurs when the opposing team scores zero goals. In this case, the score is 13 - 0, so yes, it's a shutout because the opponent didn't score any goals.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there isn't another match with a higher score or another 13-0. Looking through all the scores, the next highest after 13 is 3 - 0 and others are lower, so 13 is the maximum. And only one row has 13 - 0.\n\nSo both conditions of the claim are satisfied: the highest score is 13, and that game was a shutout (opponent scored zero). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"most of the match play be for world cup qualify.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'result' column because it shows outcomes like win, loss, draw. But wait, the claim is about the type of matches, specifically World Cup qualifying. So I should focus on the 'competition' column to see which matches are related to World Cup qualifying.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. 30 May 1993: Competition is \"1994 world cup qualifying\" \u2013 relevant.\n2. 6 June 1993: Same competition \u2013 relevant.\n3. 31 October 1993: Also same \u2013 relevant.\n4. 27 March 1996: Friendly, not World Cup qualifying.\n5. 24 April 1996: Friendly \u2013 not relevant.\n6. 12 March 1997: Friendly \u2013 nope.\n7. 11 June 1997: \"1998 world cup qualifying\" \u2013 relevant.\n8. 19 June 1997: Same competition \u2013 relevant.\n9. 28 June 1997: Same \u2013 relevant.\n10. 6 July 1997: Same \u2013 relevant.\n11. 22 November 1997: 1998 World Cup Qualifying \u2013 yes, relevant.\n12. 29 November 1997: Same as above \u2013 relevant.\n13. 14 December 1997: 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup \u2013 not relevant for World Cup qualify.\n14. 16 December 1997: Same competition \u2013 not relevant.\n15. 19 December 1997: Same \u2013 nope.\n16. 21 December 1997: Same \u2013 not relevant.\n17. 23 February 2000: Friendly \u2013 no.\n\nSo, I need to count how many matches are for World Cup qualifying. Let's list them:\n\n- Rows 0,1,2 (3 matches)\n- Rows 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 (7 matches)\nWait, row indexes might be off because the first row is index 0? Wait, no, looking at the HTML table, each <tr> is a row. The first tr is row 0, next row 1, etc.\n\nSo rows with \"1994 world cup qualifying\" are 0,1,2 (3 matches).\n\nThen \"1998 world cup qualifying\" starts at row 6: rows 6,7,8,9,10,11,12. That's 7 matches.\n\nWait, row 13 is index 13? Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the first row after venue is 0, then up to 13. Wait, in the HTML, each <tr> is a separate row. So I think the indexes go from 0 upwards as per the list provided.\n\nSo rows with \"1994 world cup qualifying\" are 0,1,2: 3 matches.\n\nThen \"1998 world cup qualifying\" starts at row 6 and ends at row 12, which is 7 matches (rows 6 to 12 inclusive).\n\nPlus, there's \"1997 FIFA Confederations Cup\" from rows 13-17: but those are not World Cup qualifying. So total relevant matches for World Cup qualify are 3+7=10.\n\nNow, the claim says \"most of the match play be for world cup qualify.\" Does that mean the majority? The table has 22 matches in total.\n\nOut of these, 10 are related to World Cup qualifying. 10 out of 22 is approximately 45%, which isn't a clear majority. The next largest group is friendly matches, which are 4 (rows 3,4,5,6 wait no: row 3 is 27 March 1996, and then rows 12,13, etc.\n\nWait, let me count the competitions:\n\n- 1994 WCQ: 3\n- 1998 WCQ: 7\n- Friendly: 4 (rows 3,4,5,6)\nWait no, row 6 is 11 June 1997 which is 1998 WCQ. So friendly matches are rows 3,4,5, and 23 February 2000 which is a friendly.\n\nWait, the 'friendly' category has:\n\n- Row 3: 27 March 1996\n- Row 4: 24 April 1996\n- Row 5: 12 March 1997\n- Row 17: 23 Feb 2000 (index 16)\n\nThat's 4 friendly matches.\n\nThen, the FIFA Confederations Cup has rows 13-17: 5 matches.\n\nSo total:\n\n- WCQ: 10\n- Friendly: 4\n- FIFA Confed: 5\n\nTotal matches: 19? Wait, but the table shows up to row 22 (23 Feb 2000 is row 18). Wait, let me count again:\n\nLooking at the list, from the HTML:\n\n1. 30 May 1993 \u2013 index 0\n2. 6 June 1993 \u2013 1\n3. 31 Oct 1993 \u2013 2\n4. 27 March 1996 \u2013 3\n5. 24 April 1996 \u20134\n6. 12 March 1997 \u20135\n7. 11 June 1997 \u20136\n8. 19 June 1997 \u20137\n9. 28 June 1997 \u20138\n10. 6 July 1997 \u20139\n11. 22 Nov 1997 \u201310\n12. 29 Nov 1997 \u201311\n13. 14 Dec 1997 \u201312\n14. 16 Dec 1997 \u201313\n15. 19 Dec 1997 \u201314\n16. 21 Dec 1997 \u201315\n17. 23 Feb 2000 \u201316\n\nWait, so the table has 17 rows (indices 0 to 16). So total matches are 17.\n\nSo:\n\n- WCQ: 3 + 7 =10 (rows 0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11)\n- Friendly: 4 (rows 3,4,5,16)\n- FIFA Confed: 5 (rows12-16)\n\nWait, no. Rows 12-16 are:\n\n12:14 Dec 1997 \u2013 FIFA Confed\n13:16 Dec 1997 \u2013 FIFA Confed\n14:19 Dec 1997 \u2013 FIFA Confed\n15:21 Dec 1997 \u2013 FIFA Confed\n16:23 Feb 2000 \u2013 Friendly\n\nSo rows 12-15 are FIFA Confed, and row16 is friendly.\n\nThus:\n\nWCQ:10 matches.\n\nFriendly:4.\n\nFIFA Confed:4 (rows12-15).\n\nTotal:18? Wait, indices 0-16 is 17 rows. So 17 matches.\n\nWait, the table starts with 30 May 1993 as first match, then each subsequent year until Feb 2000. I need to count correctly.\n\nFrom the list:\n\nWCQ 94: 0,1,2 (3)\nWCQ98:6,7,8,9,10,11,12? Wait no, row6 is 11 June 1997, which is WCQ98.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, the competition column for each row:\n\nRow 0: 1994 WCQ\n\nRow1: same.\n\nRow2: same.\n\nRow3: Friendly.\n\nRow4: Friendly.\n\nRow5: Friendly.\n\nRow6:1998 WCQ.\n\nRow7: same.\n\nRow8: same.\n\nRow9: same.\n\nRow10: same.\n\nRow11: same.\n\nRow12: FIFA Confed.\n\nRow13: same.\n\nRow14: same.\n\nRow15: same.\n\nRow16: Friendly.\n\nSo from 0-2:3, 6-11:6 (rows6-11 inclusive is 6 matches), and row12-15:4.\n\nPlus friendly rows3,4,5,16:4.\n\nWait, so:\n\nWCQ:3+6=9\n\nFIFA Confed:4\n\nFriendly:4\n\nTotal:17.\n\nSo WCQ has 9 matches.\n\nThe claim says \"most of the match play be for world cup qualify.\" If \"most\" is interpreted as majority, then since 9 out of17 is about 52%, which is a clear majority. So WCQ has more matches than any other category.\n\nThus, the statement in the problem is likely correct.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm:\n\nTotal matches:17\n\nWCQ:9\n\nFriendly:4\n\nFIFA Confed:4\n\nYes, so WCQ has 9, which is more than the others. So yes, most of the matches are for World Cup qualifying.\n\nThus, the answer is that the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"most of the match play be for world cup qualify\" is **True** based on the analysis of the provided data.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Total Matches:**\n   - The table lists matches from 30 May 1993 to 23 February 2000, totaling **17 matches** (indices 0 through 16).\n\n2. **Categorize Each Match:**\n   - **World Cup Qualifying (WCQ):**\n     - Matches are categorized under \"1994 WCQ\" and \"1998 WCQ\".\n     - Counting these, there are **9 matches** in total.\n   - **Friendly Matches:**\n     - Includes four matches from different years.\n     - Total of **4 friendly matches**.\n   - **FIFA Confederations Cup (Confed):**\n     - Four matches occurred during the FIFA Confed tournament.\n     - Total of **4 confederation matches**.\n\n3. **Determine Majority Category:**\n   - WCQ: 9\n   - Friendly: 4\n   - Confed: 4\n   - The majority category is **WCQ with 9 out of 17 total matches**, which is approximately 52.94%.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since WCQ constitutes the highest number of matches, the statement that \"most of the match play be for world cup qualify\" is **True**.\n\n**Answer:** True",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"only 1 game have a total of zero point score end in a draw.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this claim means. It seems to suggest that out of all the games listed in the table, only one game had a score that totals zero and ended in a draw.\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see the relevant columns are 'score' and 'result'. For each row, I'll need to check if the score is \"0 - 0\" because that would be a total of zero points. Then, the result should be a draw.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's asserting that exactly five matches out of all the listed games ended with a draw.\n\nFirst, I should go through each row of the table and count how many matches resulted in a draw. The 'result' column will have values like 'win', 'loss', or 'draw'. So for each row, if the result is 'draw', that's one draw we need to count towards our total.\n\nLet me list out all the matches and their results:\n\n1. 30 May 1993 - Auckland: Win\n2. 6 June 1993 - Melbourne: Win\n3. 31 Oct 1993 - Sydney: Draw (so that's 1)\n4. 27 March 1996 - Glasgow: Loss\n5. 24 April 1996 - Antofagasta: Loss\n6. 12 March 1997 - Skopje: Win\n7. 11 June 1997 - Sydney: Win\n8. 19 June 1997 - Sydney: Win\n9. 28 June 1997 - Auckland: Win\n10. 6 July 1997 - Sydney: Win\n11. 22 Nov 1997 - Tehran: Draw (count 2)\n12. 29 Nov 1997 - Melbourne: Draw (count 3)\n13. 14 Dec 1997 - Riyadh: Draw (count 4)\n14. 16 Dec 1997 - Riyadh: Loss\n15. 19 Dec 1997 - Riyadh: Win\n16. 21 Dec 1997 - Riyadh: Loss\n17. 23 Feb 2000 - Budapest: Win\n\nNow, let me count the number of draws:\n\nLooking through each result:\n- Row 3: Draw (1)\n- Row 11: Draw (2)\n- Row 12: Draw (3)\n- Row 13: Draw (4)\n\nI don't see any more 'draw' results beyond that. So there are 4 draws in total.\n\nThe claim says \"5 of the total match end in a draw\", but I've only found 4.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"very few of the match play be for world cup qualify\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to suggest that only a small number of matches are related to World Cup qualifying. So I should check each row in the table to see if it's associated with World Cup qualification.\n\nLooking at the 'competition' column, I can filter rows where this column mentions \"world cup qualifying\". Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: 1994 world cup qualifying\n- Row 2: same as above\n- Row 3: same\n- Then, after row 3, there's a jump to friendly matches in 1996 and 1997.\n- In 1998, several rows have \"1998 world cup qualifying\".\n- After that, some are for the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and a friendly in 2000.\n\nSo, how many World Cup qualifying matches are there? Let me count:\n\nRows with '1994 world cup qualifying': 3\nRows with '1998 world cup qualifying': 5\n\nThat's 8 rows. The claim says \"very few\", but 8 isn't very few. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nNow, for relevant cells, I need to list all rows where competition is either \"1994 world cup qualifying\" or \"1998 world cup qualifying\". Each of these has a row index starting from 0. \n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 0-2 (first three), then 7-11 (next five). Wait, no, looking again:\n\nRow indices as per the table:\n\n1. Row 0: 1994\n2. Row 1: 1994\n3. Row 2: 1994\n4. Row 3: friendly 1996\n5. Row 4: friendly 1996\n6. Row 5: friendly 1997\n7. Row 6: 1998\n8. Row 7: 1998\n9. Row 8: 1998\n10. Row 9: 1998\n11. Row 10: 1998\n12. Rows 11-13: 1997 Confederations Cup\n13. Row 14: friendly 2000\n\nSo the relevant rows are indices 0,1,2 (three rows) for 1994 and 6,7,8,9,10 (five rows) for 1998.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"almost none of the match play be during the year 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that almost no matches took place in 1997. So, my task is to check each row of the table to see if there are any matches from 1997 and then determine if \"almost none\" is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'date' column where I can check the year. The next step is to go through each row's date and see if it falls in 1997.\n\nI'll start by examining each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Date is \"30 may 1993\" \u2192 Not 1997.\n2. **Row 1**: \"6 june 1993\" \u2192 No.\n3. **Row 2**: \"31 october 1993\" \u2192 No.\n4. **Row 3**: \"27 march 1996\" \u2192 No.\n5. **Row 4**: \"24 april 1996\" \u2192 No.\n6. **Row 5**: \"12 march 1997\" \u2192 Yes, this is in 1997.\n7. **Row 6**: \"11 june 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n8. **Row 7**: \"19 june 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n9. **Row 8**: \"28 june 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n10. **Row 9**: \"6 july 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n11. **Row 10**: \"22 november 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n12. **Row 11**: \"29 november 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n13. **Row 12**: \"14 december 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n14. **Row 13**: \"16 december 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n15. **Row 14**: \"19 december 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n16. **Row 15**: \"21 december 1997\" \u2192 Yes.\n17. **Row 16**: \"23 february 2000\" \u2192 No.\n\nSo, I found several matches that occurred in 1997. Specifically, rows 5 through 15 (with row indices 5 to 15) all have dates in 1997. That's 11 matches in total for the year 1997. \n\nThe claim says \"almost none,\" but there are actually multiple matches. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because a significant number of matches occurred during that year.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether almost none of the matches played in 1997, we need to check each row's date.\n\n- **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n1. Go through each row and extract the date.\n2. Identify which dates fall within the year 1997.\n3. Count how many matches were held during that year.\n\n**Results:**\n- Matches in 1997 are found in rows with indices 5 to 15, totaling 11 matches.\n\nSince there are multiple matches, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most number of point score in a match be 3 and it be a draw",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the most number of point score in a match be 3 and it be a draw.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of this claim means. The term \"most number of point score in a match\" likely refers to the highest score achieved in any match from the table provided. Then, it's specified that this maximum score is 3, and importantly, the match ended as a draw.\n\nSo my first step is to look through each row in the 'score' column to find the maximum value. Let me go through each entry:\n\n- The scores listed are: 1 - 0, 3 - 0, 1 - 1, 0 - 1, 0 - 3, 1 - 0, 13 - 0, 2 - 0, 3 - 0, 2 - 0, 3 - 0, 2 - 0, 1 - 1, 0 - 0, 0 - 1, 1 - 0, 0 - 6, 3 - 0.\n\nWait, actually, the scores are in the 'score' column. Let me list them all properly:\n\nLooking at each row's score:\n1. 1 - 0 \u2192 score is 1\n2. 3 - 0 \u2192 score is 3\n3. 1 - 1 \u2192 score is 1\n4. 0 - 1 \u2192 score is 0\n5. 0 - 3 \u2192 score is 0\n6. 1 - 0 \u2192 score is 1\n7. 13 - 0 \u2192 score is 13\n8. 2 - 0 \u2192 score is 2\n9. 3 - 0 \u2192 score is 3\n10. 2 - 0 \u2192 score is 2\n11. 3 - 0 \u2192 score is 3\n12. 2 - 0 \u2192 score is 2\n13. 1 - 1 \u2192 score is 1\n14. 0 - 0 \u2192 score is 0\n15. 0 - 1 \u2192 score is 0\n16. 1 - 0 \u2192 score is 1\n17. 0 - 6 \u2192 score is 0\n\nWait, the highest score here is 13 in row 7 (index 6). So that's a problem because the claim says \"the most number of point score in a match be 3,\" but we have a score of 13. That already contradicts the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the 'score' column represents the total points for each team combined? For example, if it's like Home Team - Away Team, then 1-0 would mean the home scored 1 and away 0, so total score is 1. Similarly, 3-0 would be 3 total points. But in that case, the highest score is indeed 13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'score' is the combined goals from both teams, so a match where the score was 13 - 0 means 13 points for one team and 0 for the other. So that's a high score of 13, which would make the claim false because it says the maximum is 3.\n\nBut let me think again: The claim could be interpreted as the highest number of goals in any match where the result was a draw. Wait, no, the claim specifically mentions \"most number of point score in a match be 3 and it be a draw.\" So the two conditions are:\n\n1. The maximum score is 3.\n2. That particular match was a draw.\n\nSo first, I need to find if there's any row where the score is 3 and it's a draw (i.e., both teams scored the same number of points).\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 1-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 1: 3-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 2: 1-1 \u2192 Draw. Score is 1 for both, but the score here is 1, not 3.\n- Row 3: 0-1 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 4: 0-3 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 5: 1-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 6: 13-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 7: 2-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 8: 3-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 9: 2-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 10: 3-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 11: 2-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 12: 1-1 \u2192 Draw. Score is 1, not 3.\n- Row 13: 0-0 \u2192 Draw. Score is 0, not 3.\n- Row 14: 0-1 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 15: 1-0 \u2192 Not a draw\n- Row 16: 0-6 \u2192 Not a draw\n\nSo none of the draws have a score of 3. The only scores that are 3 are in matches that ended with a win, not a draw.\n\nAdditionally, there's a match with a score of 13, which is higher than 3, so that directly contradicts the first part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because:\n\n1. There exists a match (row 6) with a score higher than 3.\n2. No match has a score of 3 and ends in a draw.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells are the ones showing that the maximum score is 13 (which is in row 6, column 'score') and that there's no match where the score is 3 and it's a draw.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we analyzed each match's score and result. The claim states the highest score is 3 and that such a match was a draw. However:\n\n1. A match with a score of 13 exists (row 6), exceeding 3.\n2. No match with a score of 3 resulted in a draw.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the claim \"3 games have a total of zero point score end in a draw\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions three games where the total points scored add up to zero and ended in a draw. Wait, but if all points are zero, that would mean each game had zero points. But wait, that doesn't make sense because in football (or any sport), a game can't have negative points or zero points unless it's a draw with no goals. However, typically, even a draw has at least 0-0 as the score.\n\nBut looking back, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"total of zero point score end in a draw.\" So perhaps it means that across three games, the total points scored are zero, and each game ended in a draw.\n\nWait, but in football, every match must have some goals, right? Even if it's 0-0, both teams get zero points for that match. So maybe the claim is referring to three matches where all resulted in 0-0 draws, leading to a total of zero points across those games.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check which rows have a score that leads to zero points and ended as a draw.\n\nSo, let's go through each row:\n\n1. May 30, 1993: Auckland, New Zealand. Score 1-0, result win. So not relevant.\n2. June 6, 1993: Melbourne, Australia. Score 3-0, result win. Not relevant.\n3. October 31, 1993: Sydney, Australia. Score 1-1, result draw. This is a draw with zero points for the winner? Wait no, in football, a draw gives each team 0 points because it's a tie. So this game would contribute to total points as zero, but wait, actually, both teams get zero points each, so across all games, the total could be zero.\n\nWait, but the claim is about three games with zero point scores ending in a draw. Wait, no\u2014each individual game that's a draw gives zero points (since 0-0 is one point for draw, but wait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up systems. In some leagues, a draw gives each team 1 point, while others give zero. But typically, it's one point per draw in many competitions.\n\nWait, the table shows the score and result as 'win', 'draw', or 'loss'. So for example, a draw is when both teams get one point each. So if a game ends in a draw, that adds to the total points of both teams.\n\nBut the claim says \"3 games have a total of zero point score end in a draw.\" Hmm, maybe it's misphrased. Perhaps it means that three games ended in draws, and the total points for those three games across all matches is zero, which doesn't make sense because each draw gives at least two points (1 to each team). So if there are three draws, each contributing 2 points, the total would be 6, not zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's that in these three games, the points scored are zero. But that can't happen unless all games ended with a score of 0-0, but even then, each game would have two teams getting zero points, so the total across the three games would be zero.\n\nWait no, if each of the three games is a draw, then in each game, both teams get one point. So for three games, that's 3*2=6 points in total. But the claim says \"zero point score,\" which suggests no points at all, so maybe it's referring to three games where each had zero points, meaning each was a 0-0 draw.\n\nLooking back at the table, let's check for rows where the result is a draw and the score is 0-0. Wait, but in the table provided, I don't see any scores that are 0-0. Let me look through all the scores:\n\nRow 0: 1-0\nRow 1:3-0\nRow2:1-1 (draw)\nRow3:4-0\n...\nWait, let's list them all out.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a score and result. So for each game, if the result is a draw, what was the score?\n\nRow2: 1-1 \u2192 draw\nRow18:1-0 \u2192 win\nRow19:1-0 \u2192 win\nRow20:1-0 \u2192 win\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted. Let me list each row's score and result:\n\nRow 0: 1-0, Win \u2192 total points for this game is 3 (winner gets 3)\nRow1:3-0, Win \u2192 3 points\nRow2:1-1, Draw \u2192 both teams get 1 point each, so total 2 points for the game.\nRow3:4-0, Win \u2192 winner gets 6\nRow4:4-1, Win \u2192 9 points\nRow5:5-1, Win \u219215 points\n...\nWait, but I think the user provided a specific subset of rows, perhaps from a larger set. But looking at the data given, I need to check each row.\n\nBut let me make this clear. The claim is that \"3 games have a total of zero point score end in a draw.\" So it's about three games where the total points across all three are zero and each ended in a draw.\n\nWait, but if each game ends in a draw, each contributes at least 2 points (1 to each team). So three draws would be at least 6 points. Therefore, it's impossible for three drawn games to have a total of zero points because each draw adds points.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is misphrased or misunderstood. Alternatively, maybe the user means that across those three games, no points were scored in any of them, which again isn't possible unless all scores are 0-0, but even then, each game would have zero points for both teams, leading to a total of zero.\n\nWait, let's see: if a game is 0-0, both teams get zero points. So three such games would indeed sum up to zero points in total. So the claim might be referring to three matches where each was a 0-0 draw, contributing no points across all three.\n\nLooking at the table, are there any rows with 0-0? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the table data provided:\n\nEach row's score is something like:\n\nRow2:1-1 \u2192 so that's a draw with 1 point each. So total for this game is 2 points.\nRows where result is 'draw' but score isn't zero.\n\nWait, in the table, I don't see any rows with 0-0. The only draws are 1-1 and maybe others? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow2:1-1 \u2192 draw\nRow18:1-0 \u2192 win\nRow19:1-0 \u2192 win\nRow20:1-0 \u2192 win\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's list all rows with result 'draw':\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nRow2: 1-1, Draw\nRows 23 to 26: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia:\n- 1-0 (loss)\n- 0-6 (loss)\n- 1-0 (loss)\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the table has rows from row 0 up. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the end of the table:\n\nRows 18 to 21 are in Riyadh:\nRow18:1-0, Win\nRow19:1-0, Win\nRow20:1-0, Win\nRow21:0-6, Loss\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Alternatively, maybe there's a row with score 0-0.\n\nWait, no, in the data provided, all scores are either wins or draws with non-zero scores.\n\nTherefore, there are no games where the result is a draw and the score is 0-0. So if the claim refers to three such games, it can't be found in this dataset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that in these three games, the total points scored by both teams across all three is zero. But since each game contributes at least two points (if it's a draw), or more if someone wins, then three games would have at least six points.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems impossible with the given data.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"zero point score.\" Maybe it refers to the home team having zero points, but that doesn't make sense because both teams play and can score.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user means that no goals were scored in any of these three games. But again, a draw with 1-1 would mean goals were scored, so that wouldn't apply here either.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, there are no three games where each ends in a 0-0 draw, resulting in zero total points across all three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to three games where each had zero points for one team, but that's not how points work. Each game has a winner and possibly a loser; even if it's a tie, both teams get some points.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim cannot be satisfied with the given data. Alternatively, maybe there are no draws in the dataset, so three games can't have zero total points because each would add at least two points.\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps the user is considering only one team's points. For example, if we consider only goals scored by the home team being zero. But that's not how points work; it's about both teams' points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user means that in these three games, no points were awarded to any team, which isn't possible because even a draw gives each team one point.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is based on incorrect assumptions or there's a misunderstanding. With the given data, there are no three games where the total points across all three are zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering some other metric, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided dataset, there are no three games that meet the criteria of having a total point score of zero and each ending in a draw.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, there are no three matches where each game ends in a draw (resulting in at least two points per game) and the cumulative total points across all three games is zero. Therefore, it's impossible to fulfill the given criteria with the provided dataset.\n\n**Answer:** There are no such three matches in the given dataset that result in a total point score of zero while each ending in a draw.",
