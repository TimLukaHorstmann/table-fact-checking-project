    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"There be no competition in the women double the year that there be no competition in both the men double and the men single.\"\n\nSo, I'm looking for years where:\n1. Women's doubles had no competition.\n2. Men's doubles had no competition.\n3. Men's singles also had no competition.\n\nIf such a year exists according to the table, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table and check the relevant columns: 'men 's singles', 'men 's doubles', and 'women 's doubles.\n\nStarting from 1991:\n- Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow (so competition exists).\n- So, not relevant for the claim since the condition requires no competition in men's singles.\n\n1992-1996:\n- The row spans two years. For each year, check if all three conditions are met.\nBut looking at 1992: Men's singles is \"no competition\", but wait, in the table, under 1992 1996, the 'men 's singles' column has \"no competition\". Wait, no, actually, in the second row, it says 'men 's singles' as \"no competition\". But let me confirm each year.\n\nWait, in the HTML table, the rows have years. So for example, the second row is 1992-1996, and all columns say \"no competition\", including men's singles, doubles, etc. Hmm, that's a span of multiple years with no competitions across all categories.\n\nBut let me check each year individually to see if any single year meets all three conditions.\n\nLooking for a year where:\n- Women's doubles: No competition.\n- Men's doubles: No competition.\n- Men's singles: No competition.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1991:\n- Women's doubles: No competition (column shows \"no competition\").\n- Men's doubles: No competition? Wait, in 1991, the 'men 's doubles' column is empty; it says \"no competition\". So yes.\n- Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow, which means there was a competition. So this year doesn't meet all three conditions because men's singles had a competitor.\n\n1992-1996:\n- The entire span from 1992 to 1996 has no competitions in any category. But each specific year within this range would have the same status. Let me check 1992, 1993, etc., but since the row spans multiple years, perhaps considering that all these years have no competition.\n\nWait, looking at the second row: for 1992-1996, all columns are \"no competition\". So in 1992, there's no competition in women doubles (yes), men doubles (yes), and men singles (yes). Therefore, the year 1992 meets all three conditions. However, I need to check if any of those years have a mix. But wait, the row is for multiple years, so each individual year within that range would also have no competition.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The row shows \"1992 1996\" as the year, meaning from 1992 to 1996. So all those years had no competitions in any category. Therefore, every year from 1992 to 1996 meets the condition: women's doubles no competition, men's doubles no competition, and men's singles no competition.\n\nThus, there are multiple years that satisfy the claim, so it's true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for a year where:\n1. Women's doubles had no competition.\n2. Men's doubles had no competition.\n3. Men's singles had no competition.\n\nThe rows from 1992 to 1996 meet all three conditions, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be no competition in women 's single in the following year : 1992 , 1996 , 1999 , 2000 , 2006 , and 2007.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. The relevant columns for this claim are the ones related to women's singles. Looking at the table headers, the column is \"women 's singles\". So, each row corresponds to a year, and under that year, there might be an entry for women's singles.\n\nThe task is to check if in any of those years (1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007) the women's singles have \"no competition\". \n\nI'll go through each of these years one by one and look at the corresponding row in the table.\n\nStarting with 1991: The first row is for 1991. It shows that there were competitions in men's singles and others, but specifically for women's singles, it says \"inga beridse\". So, competition existed, but since the claim is about no competition, this isn't relevant to the claim but might indicate a pattern.\n\nNext, 1992: Looking at the second row (since the first entry is 1991 and the second starts with 1992). The year cell has \"1992 1996\". Under women's singles, it says \"no competition\". So this matches the claim. \n\nThen 1996: Since the second row covers both 1992 and 1996, under women's singles for both years, it's \"no competition\". So that's another match.\n\nMoving on to 1997: The third row is for 1997. Women's singles have \"gaiane tschachoian\", so there was a competitor, meaning no competition didn't occur here. Not relevant.\n\n1998: Fourth row, women's singles again have \"gaiane tschachoian\". So, no competition didn't happen in 1998 either.\n\n1999: Fifth row for 1999 and 2000. Women's singles are \"no competition\" for both years. So 1999 matches.\n\n2000: Same as above, women's singles are \"no competition\", so 2000 is a match.\n\nThen 2001: Sixth row, but it's after 2000. For 2001, women's singles have \"gaiane tschachoian\", indicating no no competition in that year.\n\n2002: Seventh row. Women's singles are \"gaiane tschachoian\" as well, so no match.\n\n2003: Eighth row, same entry for women's singles, so no match.\n\n2004: Ninth row. Women's singles have \"natela mirianaschwili\", which means competition existed; no match.\n\n2005: Tenth row, women's singles are \"ina davidowa\", another competitor; no match.\n\n2006 and 2007: Eleventh row, which covers 2006-2007. Both years have \"no competition\" in women's singles. So both 2006 and 2007 match the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim lists 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007. All these years except for 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 have \"no competition\" in women's singles.\n\nSo the claim is stating that there was no competition in those specific years for women's singles. From the table, all those years do indeed have \"no competition\". Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. For each of these years, I need to find their row index and check the women's singles column.\n\nLooking back at how rows are structured:\n\nRow 0: 1991\nRow 1: 1992-1996\nRow 2: 1997\nRow 3: 1998\nRow 4: 1999-2000\nRow 5: 2001\nRow 6: 2002\nRow 7: 2003\nRow 8: 2004\nRow 9: 2005\nRow 10: 2006-2007\n\nSo, the years 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007 are in rows 1, 1, 4, 4, 10, and 10 respectively.\n\nWait, but row 1 is for both 1992 and 1996. So the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor 1992: row_index=1, column_name=\"women 's singles\"\nFor 1996: same as above\nSimilarly, 1999 is in row 4, 2000 in row 4, 2006 in row 10, and 2007 in row 10.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1, women's singles\n- Row 4, women's singles (for 1999 and 2000)\n- Row 10, women's singles (for 2006 and 2007)\n\nI think that covers all the years mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each specified year in the \"women 's singles\" column. All listed years show \"no competition,\" confirming the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

From the table, Arthur Chatschatourow played men's singles in 1991 because that's when his name appears under \"men 's singles\" in row 0 (row_index:0). \n\nSo, I need to check the same year for women's doubles and men's doubles competitions. The claim says there should be no competition in either of these categories that year.\n\nIn row 0, the years are 1991. Looking at the \"women 's doubles\" column, it shows \"no competition.\" For \"men 's doubles,\" the entry is also \"no competition.\"\n\nSince both women's and men's doubles had no competitions in 1991 when Arthur Chatschatourow won the men's singles, the claim holds true.\n\nI should map these cells: row_index 0 for both columns.

The claim says: \"there be a lot of competition in women 's single in the following year : 1992 , 1996 / 1999 , 2000 / 2006 , and 2007.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It's talking about women's singles competitions happening in specific years: 1992, 1996 to 1999, 2000 to 2006, and 2007. The task is to check if there's a lot of competition in these years for women's singles.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a year (or range of years), and the \"women 's singles\" column indicates whether there was competition or not. The columns are:\n\n- men's singles\n- women's singles\n- men's doubles\n- women's doubles\n- mixed doubles\n\nThe claim is specifically about women's singles, so I'll focus only on that column.\n\nNow, let me go through each relevant year mentioned in the claim and check the corresponding cell in the table.\n\n1. **1992**: The row for 1992 to 1996 shows \"no competition\" under women's singles.\n2. **1996**: Wait, the years are grouped as 1992-1996, so 1996 is included here, but it still says no competition.\n3. **1999** and **2000**: The row for 1999-2000 shows \"no competition.\"\n4. **2000**: Again, same as above, no competition.\n5. **2006**: The row for 2006-2007 has \"no competition\" under women's singles.\n6. **2007**: Also included in the same row as 2006, so again no competition.\n\nLooking at all these years, the women's singles column shows \"no competition\" across all these ranges and individual years. Therefore, there isn't any indication of a lot of competition in women's singles during those years.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is not supported by the data provided.

The claim says: \"Natia Marianaschwili Tschachoian Gaiane win the women's double every year after 2001.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the columns in the table. The relevant column for this claim would be \"women 's doubles\" because it directly relates to the women's doubles competition.\n\nNext, I need to check each row starting from 2002 onwards since the claim mentions every year after 2001. Let's go through each year:\n\n- **2002**: The \"women 's doubles\" cell is \"no competition\". So, no win here.\n- **2003**: Again, \"no competition\". No win.\n- **2004**: The entry is \"natela mirianaschwili ina davidowa\". I don't see Natia Marianaschwili Tschachoian Gaiane listed here.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table data.\n\nThe claim states: \"in 2003, there be no competition for men's double and women's double, but edgar eremian play in the mixed double.\" \n\nBreaking this down, the claim has two main parts:\n1. In 2003, there was no competition in men's doubles and women's doubles.\n2. Edgar Eremian played in the mixed doubles that year.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the second part because it seems more straightforward. The claim mentions Edgar Eremian playing in mixed doubles in 2003. So I need to check the mixed doubles column for 2003. \n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific year or range of years. The rows are:\n- 1991\n- 1992-1996\n- 1997\n- 1998\n- 1999-2000\n- 2001\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2004\n- 2005\n- 2006-2007\n\nFocusing on the 2003 row:\n- Year: 2003\n- Men's singles: Edgar Eremian\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachoian\n- Men's doubles: No competition\n- Women's doubles: No competition\n- Mixed doubles: No competition\n\nWait, according to this row, in 2003, there was no mixed doubles competition either. So the second part of the claim says Edgar Eremian played in mixed doubles, but the table shows 'no competition'. That would mean the claim is incorrect on that point.\n\nNow looking back at the first part: \"there be no competition for men's double and women's double.\" The 2003 row indeed shows both men's doubles and women's doubles as 'no competition'. So this part of the claim is accurate.\n\nBut since the second part is wrong, the overall claim is false. However, I should make sure that the table data doesn't have any discrepancies or that I'm interpreting it correctly. Let me double-check the 2003 row. Yes, under men's doubles and women's doubles, it says 'no competition', so no events took place in those categories.\n\nSo the claim states that despite no competitions in men's and women's doubles, Edgar Eremian played mixed doubles. But according to the table, there was no mixed doubles in 2003 either. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect regarding 2003.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"edgar eremian play in the mixed double\", but perhaps he was part of a team or there's an entry that includes him. Let me check the mixed doubles column for 2003 again. It's listed as 'no competition', so no one played in mixed doubles that year either.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because both the first and second parts are incorrect based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2003, there were no competitions in men's and women's doubles but Edgar Eremian played in mixed doubles. However, the table shows that in 2003, neither men's nor women's doubles had competitions, and also no mixed doubles competition existed. Thus, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"there be a lot of competition in women 's double the year that there be no competition in the men 's double and when arthur chatschatourow win the men 's single.\"\n\nSo, I need to check two main points:\n1. In a specific year where there's no men's doubles competition, there should be a lot of competition in women's doubles.\n2. In that same year, Arthur Chatschatourow wins the men's singles.\n\nLooking at the table provided, which lists data from 1991 to 2007, I'll need to identify relevant rows and columns.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding years where men's doubles have no competition. Scanning through the table:\n\n- 1991: No competition in men's doubles.\n- 1992-1996: No competition in men's doubles.\n- 1997: Competition exists.\n- 1998: Competition exists.\n- 1999-2000: No competition.\n- 2001: Competition exists.\n- 2002: No competition.\n- 2003: No competition.\n- 2004: Competition exists.\n- 2005: Competition exists.\n- 2006-2007: No competition.\n\nSo, the years with no men's doubles are 1991, 1992-1996, 1999-2000, 2002, 2003, and 2006-2007.\n\nNext, for each of these years, I need to check if there is a lot of competition in women's doubles. Looking at the same columns:\n\n- 1991: Women's doubles have no competition.\n- 1992-1996: No competition.\n- 1999-2000: No competition.\n- 2002: No competition.\n- 2003: No competition.\n- 2006-2007: No competition.\n\nHmm, in all these years where men's doubles had no competition, women's doubles also had none. So the first part of the claim seems to be false because there isn't a year where women's doubles have competition while men's don't.\n\nNow, checking for Arthur Chatschatourow winning men's singles. Looking at the men's singles column:\n\n- 1991: Arthur Chatschatourow won.\n- 1992-1996: No winners listed (assuming no competition).\n- 1997: Mjawia Malchas won.\n- 1998: Mjawia Malchas won.\n- 1999-2000: No competition.\n- 2001: Mjawia Malchas won.\n- 2002: Mamuka Dsodsuaschwili won.\n- 2003: Edgar Eremian won.\n- 2004: Nodar Sardlischwili won.\n- 2005: Mamuka Dsodsuaschwili won.\n- 2006-2007: No competition.\n\nSo, Arthur Chatschatourow only won in 1991. But in that year, women's doubles had no competition. Therefore, the second part of the claim isn't supported either.\n\nPutting it all together, both conditions required by the claim aren't met in any single year. Thus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
