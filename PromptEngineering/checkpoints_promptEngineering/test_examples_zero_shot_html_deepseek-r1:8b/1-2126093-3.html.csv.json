    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open is true based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. The claim says: \"the winner of the miyagi tv cup donlop lady open end 2 point under par (-2)\". \n\nBreaking this down, it's saying that in the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open, the winner ended 2 points under par, which is represented by -2 in the table.\n\nNow, looking at the HTML table provided, I should identify the relevant columns and rows. The columns related here are \"tournament\" to pinpoint the specific event, and \"to par\" or \"margin of victory\" since that's where the par information is located.\n\nStarting with the tournament column, I need to find the row where the tournament name matches \"miyagi tv cup donlop lady open\". Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open (as an amateur)\n- Row 14: Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open\n\nSo rows 1 and 14 are relevant for this part of the claim.\n\nNext, looking at the \"to par\" column. The claim is about ending 2 points under par, which translates to -2 in the table's notation. I need to check if either of these rows (1 or 14) has a \"to par\" value of -2.\n\n- Row 1: -5\n- Row 14: -2\n\nOnly row 14 has the \"to par\" value of -2, which matches the claim. Therefore, this row is relevant.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to ensure that the winner in row 14 is indeed the one with the -2 score, but since the table structure doesn't provide detailed information about who the winners are beyond the runner-up names, I can assume that row 14 corresponds to the event's specifics.\n\nSo, putting this together, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 14 for the tournament name\n- Row 14 for the \"to par\" value\n\nThus, these are the two cells that need to be checked against the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the win score of the vernal ladies tournament be 203\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a \"win score\" and refers to the \"vernal ladies tournament.\" So, I need to find in the table where this tournament is and check its win score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament with several columns: no, date, tournament name, winning score, to par, margin of victory, and runner-ups. My focus is on the column \"tournament\" and the \"winning score\" for the Vernal Ladies tournament.\n\nI'll scan through each row's tournament name to see if any match \"vernal ladies.\" \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 1: miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open (as an amateur )\n- Row 2: daikin orchid ladies\n- Row 3: suntory ladies open\n- Row 4: apita circle k sunkus ladies\n- Row 5: masters gc ladies\n- Row 6: daio paper elleair ladies open\n- Row 7: vernal ladies\nHere it is, row 7 has the tournament name \"vernal ladies.\"\n\nNow, I need to check the winning score for this row. The \"winning score\" column in row 7 is \"69 + 64 + 70 = 203.\" So, that adds up to 203.\n\nThe claim says the win score is 203, which matches exactly with what's in the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells are the ones that confirm both the tournament name and the winning score. So, for row 7 (which is index 6 since it starts from 0?), wait no, looking back at the table, each <tr> has a <td> with \"no\" as 1 to 14. Wait, actually, in the first row, the \"no\" is 1, then 2 up to 14, skipping 11. So the vernal ladies are in row 7 (since the list goes from 1 to 14, so row 7 corresponds to no=7). But wait, the user's example uses row_index starting at 0, so I think in the JSON, we need to use the actual index as per their rows. Wait, looking back: the first <tr> is row 0? Or does it start from 1?\n\nWait, in the provided table, each <tr> represents a single tournament. The \"no\" column goes from 1 to 14, but I think in terms of row indices as per the JSON example, which uses 0-based indexing. So, for example, the first row is row_index 0, second is 1, and so on up to 13, then skips to 12 as 11, etc.\n\nWait, actually, the table has <tr> elements from top to bottom, each corresponding to a tournament. The \"no\" column goes 1,2,...,14 but with some missing (like no=11 is skipped). So for row_index in JSON, it's 0-based: first row is 0, second is 1, up to the last one being 13.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table, after row 10 comes row 12. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just list all the rows with their \"no\" value and see where Vernal Ladies are.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe first <tr> is no=1, then no=2, ..., up to no=14. However, looking at the last few rows:\n\nRow 10: no=12\nWait, that can't be right because the \"no\" column should go from 1 upwards, but here it's skipping some numbers. So perhaps the table was not properly generated with consecutive numbers, so I need to map each <tr> to their row_index correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row indices as per the JSON should start at 0 for the first <tr>, then 1 for the next, etc., regardless of the \"no\" column. So the Vernal Ladies are in the 7th position in the \"tournament\" column, which would correspond to row_index=6.\n\nBut wait, let's count:\n\nRow 0: no=1\nRow 1: no=2\n...\nRow 6: no=7 (Vernal Ladies)\nYes, that makes sense. So in JSON terms, it's row_index=6.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index=6, column_name=\"winning score\"\n\nAdditionally, perhaps I should include the \"tournament\" column as well to confirm the name, but the claim refers only to the win score, so maybe just the winning score is needed. But to be thorough, maybe both columns are relevant.\n\nWait, in the instructions, it says to check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant. The claim has two parts: \"the vernal ladies tournament\" and its win score being 203.\n\nSo, to verify that it's about the Vernal Ladies, I need to find the row where tournament is \"vernal ladies,\" which is row_index=6, and also confirm the winning score in that same row. Therefore, both columns are relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be two: one for the tournament name (to ensure we're talking about the correct event) and one for the winning score to check if it's 203.\n\nTherefore, I'll list both relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the Vernal Ladies tournament has a winning score of 203 as listed in row_index=6 under \"winning score.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Row 14 has a margin of \"3 strokes,\" which does match the claim.\n\nTherefore, only row 14 supports the claim. However, since there are two Miyagi TV Cup events in the table, I should check both for consistency. Since one has a 1-stroke and another has a 3-stroke, the claim is only true for the second occurrence.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to find which cells are relevant to verify the claim. So, the key is to identify the row(s) that correspond to the specific tournament mentioned in the claim and check their margin of victory.\n\nTherefore, both rows are relevant because they pertain to the same tournament name, but only row 14 has a 3-stroke margin.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the winner of the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open had a 3-stroke margin. By checking the table, there are two entries for this tournament: one with a 1-stroke margin and another with a 3-stroke margin. Only the second entry supports the claim.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify rows where the tournament is \"Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open\" (rows 1 and 14).\n2. Check their 'margin of victory' column.\n3. Only row 14 has a 3-stroke margin, making the claim partially true for that specific instance.\n4. Since both instances are relevant to verify the claim, both rows are included in the relevant cells.\n\nThe answer is \"FALSE\" because the tournament appears twice with different margins, so the claim isn't universally true across all entries.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the win score of the vernal ladies tournament be set in sept 2006 at 203.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check against the table.\n\n1. **Tournament Name**: It mentions \"vernal ladies tournament.\" Looking through the table, I need to find any row where the tournament name is exactly that. Let me scan each row's \"tournament\" column.\n\n- Row 7: Vernal Ladies \u2013 this seems like a match.\n- Any others? No, looks like only row 7 matches.\n\n2. **Date**: The claim specifies September 2006. I'll check the \"date\" column for a date in September 2006. Let me look at each row's date:\n\n- Row 13: 10 Sep 2006 \u2013 this is September 2006.\n- Any others? No, only row 13 matches.\n\n3. **Winning Score**: The claim states that the win score was set at 203. So I need to find any winning scores in the table for Vernal Ladies in September 2006.\n\nLooking at row 7, the \"winning score\" is 69 + 64 + 70 = 203. That matches exactly with the score mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, checking if all parts of the claim are supported by the table:\n\n- **Tournament Name**: Vernal Ladies exists in row 7.\n- **Date**: September 2006 exists in row 13. Wait, that's confusing because row 7 is May 2005 and row 13 is September 2006. The tournament name for row 13 is JLPGA Championship Konica Minolta Cup, not Vernal Ladies. So actually, the tournament name doesn't match for the date in September 2006. \n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine:\n\n- The claim refers to \"vernal ladies tournament\" with a score of 203 in September 2006. Looking at the table, row 7 is Vernal Ladies on May 15, 2005, with a score of 203. There's no entry for Vernal Ladies in September 2006. \n\nTherefore, even though there is a Vernal Ladies tournament in May 2005 with a score of 203, the claim specifies September 2006, which doesn't have such an entry. So the claim is incorrect because the date and tournament name don't align correctly.\n\nAnother point: In row 13, the tournament is JLPGA Championship Konica Minolta Cup, not Vernal Ladies, but it's in September 2006 with a winning score of 282. None of the rows that have Vernal Ladies are in September 2006. Therefore, there's no matching data for the claim.\n\nSo putting it all together, since the date and tournament name specified in the claim don't correspond to any single row in the table where all conditions are met, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a Vernal Ladies tournament with a win score of 203 in September 2006. However, the table shows Vernal Ladies only in May 2005 and not in September 2006.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winning_score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
