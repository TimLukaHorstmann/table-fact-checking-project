    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the match be played on a grass court with partner mardy fish.\" So, the claim has two main points:\n\n1. The match was played on a grass court.\n2. The partner in the match was Mardy Fish.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table to see if they hold true based on the data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's an HTML table with several columns: outcome, date, surface, partner, opponents, and score. Each row represents a different match with various details.\n\nTo verify the claim, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant to each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part: was the match played on a grass court?\n\nI'll look at the 'surface' column for each row because that's where the type of court is recorded. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: surface is \"grass\"\n- Row 1: \"hard\"\n- Row 2: \"clay\"\n- Row 3: \"clay\"\n- Row 4: \"clay\"\n- Row 5: \"hard\"\n\nSo, only row 0 has a grass court. That means the first condition of the claim is true for that particular match.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: was Mardy Fish the partner in the match?\n\nLooking at the 'partner' column:\n\n- Row 0: partner is \"mardy fish\"\n- Row 1: \"sam querrey\"\n- Row 2: same as row 1\n- Row 3: same as row 1\n- Row 4: same as row 1\n- Row 5: same as row 1\n\nOnly row 0 lists Mardy Fish as the partner. So, again, only that specific match meets this condition.\n\nThe claim states \"the match,\" implying a single instance where both conditions are met. From the table, only row 0 satisfies both parts: grass court and Mardy Fish as the partner.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there exists at least one match in the table that fits both criteria. The relevant cells are the ones from row 0 for both surface and partner.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with the data in the table. Only one match meets both conditions: grass court and Mardy Fish as the partner.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a tennis match is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the final match score be 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 (7 - 1) with partner mardy fish.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if any match this description. The table has several rows, each representing a different match outcome.\n\nLooking at the first row, the date is July 7, 2008. The surface is grass, and the player is Mardy Fish with his partner Rohan Bopanna, etc. The score here is 6-4, 7-6 (7-1). That seems to match the claim's description: the final score is 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) and the partner is Mardy Fish.\n\nWait, but I should check other rows as well to ensure there isn't another match that also fits this description. The second row is from February 21, 2010, with a hard surface and Sam Querrey as the player. That doesn't fit because the score is different (6-4, 6-4), and the partner is different.\n\nThe third row is May 2, 2010, on clay with Sam Querrey, again not matching. The fourth row April 9, 2011, also has a different score and partners. The fifth row May 15, 2011, mentions a w/o score, which doesn't match. The sixth row March 18, 2012, has a different date, surface, and players.\n\nSo only the first row matches all aspects of the claim: it's a winner with Mardy Fish as the partner and the exact score mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"when playing against marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal, the match results in a victory.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify which columns are relevant. The table has several columns: outcome, date, surface, partner, opponents, and score. The claim mentions two specific players: \"marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal\" as an opponent and whether the match was a victory.\n\nI need to check each row to see if it involves marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal as an opponent and whether the outcome is a win. \n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. First row (index 0): Opponents are rohan bopanna aisam - ul - haq qureshi. No match against marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal.\n2. Second row (index 1): Opponents are ross hutchins jordan kerr. Not relevant.\n3. Third row (index 2): Opponent is bob bryan mike bryan. No.\n4. Fourth row (index 3): Same as third, not marc l\u00f3pez.\n5. Fifth row (index 4): Opponents are mardy fish andy roddick. No.\n6. Sixth row (index 5): Here, the opponents are marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal. This is relevant.\n\nNow, check the outcome for this row. The outcome is \"runner - up,\" so it's not a victory. Therefore, the claim that playing against marc l\u00f3pez results in a victory isn't fully supported because there's only one match where they are opponents and it was a loss.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that when Sam Querrey played against Marc L\u00f3pez Rafael Nadal on March 18, 2012, he was the runner-up, not a winner. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about a tennis match is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the match be played on a hard court against opponent marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal for the runner - up outcome.\" So, I need to check if there's an entry in the table that matches all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: outcome, date, surface, partner, opponents, and score. The task is to find relevant cells that confirm each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with \"hard court\": I'll look for rows where the 'surface' column says \"hard\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: grass\n- Row 1: hard\n- Row 2: clay\n- Row 3: clay\n- Row 4: clay\n- Row 5: hard\n\nSo, there are matches on both hard and other surfaces. Now, checking each row with 'hard' surface:\n\nRow 1: outcome is \"winner\", date February 21, 2010, partner Sam Querrey, opponents Ross Hutchins & Jordan Kerr.\n\nBut the claim mentions Marc Lopez Rafael Nadal as the opponent. In this row, the opponents are Ross Hutchins and Jordan Kerr, so that doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: outcome is \"runner - up\", date March 18, 2012, partner Sam Querrey, opponents Marc Lopez & Rafael Nadal.\n\nWait, that seems to fit! The surface here is hard, opponent is Marc Lopez Rafael Nadal, and the outcome is runner-up. So this row matches all parts of the claim except for the 'partner' column. But wait, does the partner matter? Let me think about it.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify anything about the partner; it only mentions the surface, opponent, and outcome. So if these three are satisfied in any row, regardless of the partner, then the claim holds true.\n\nBut wait, in Row 5, the opponents are listed as \"marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal\". The claim says \"opponent marc l\u00f3pez rafael nadal\". Hmm, maybe it's a matter of formatting. In the table, it's written as one cell with both names, so perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlso, in Row 5, the outcome is runner-up, which matches. So all the conditions are met here except for the partner, but since the claim doesn't mention partner details, it might not matter.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other row that could also fit better. For example, are there multiple entries with hard surface and Marc Lopez Rafael Nadal as opponents? From the table, only Row 5 has both hard surface and that specific opponent combination in the 'opponents' column. So yes, this seems to be the matching row.\n\nTherefore, since all conditions of the claim are met in Row 5, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be the ones from Row 5: 'surface', 'opponents', and 'outcome'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"in the match with partner mardy fish , the final score be 5 - 3 , 7 - 6 , (7 - 1)\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has several columns: outcome, date, surface, partner, opponents, and score. Each row represents a different match.\n\nThe claim mentions \"partner mardy fish,\" so I need to find the rows where Sam Querrey's partner is Mardy Fish. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Partner is Mardy Fish\n- Row 1: Partner is Sam Querrey (no, that's not Mardy)\n- Row 2: Partner is Sam Querrey\n- Row 3: Partner is Sam Querrey\n- Row 4: Partner is Sam Querrey and Andy Roddick (so the partner here isn't just Mardy Fish)\n- Row 5: Partner is Sam Querrey\n\nWait, row 0's partner is Mardy Fish, which matches. So that's our relevant row.\n\nNext, I need to check the score in that row. The claim says the final score is \"5 - 3 , 7 - 6 , (7 - 1)\". Looking at row 0's score: it's \"6 - 4 , 7 - 6 (7 - 1)\". \n\nHmm, the scores don't match exactly. The claim has 5-3 and 7-6, but in the table, it's 6-4 and 7-6 with a (7-1). So they're not identical.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The claim says \"5 - 3 , 7 - 6 , (7 - 1)\". But in row 0, the score is \"6 - 4 , 7 - 6 (7 - 1)\". So the first part of the score differs.\n\nSo the final scores don't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the score in the table doesn't match what's stated.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells are where the partner is Mardy Fish and the score is checked. That would be row 0, columns for partner (to confirm it's Mardy) and score (to check if it's as claimed). So the relevant cells are row_index=0, column_name=\"partner\" and \"score\".\n\nSo the JSON should have answer: FALSE, and relevant_cells pointing to those two columns in row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
