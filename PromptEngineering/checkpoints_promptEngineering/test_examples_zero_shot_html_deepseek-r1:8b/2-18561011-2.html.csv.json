    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"the national stadium , in cardiff , wale , be the largest former rugby union stadium , close in 1997 , with a capacity of 53000 at the time of closure.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table provided. The table lists various stadiums along with their capacity at closure, city, country, and the year they were closed.\n\nLooking at the claim, several points are made:\n\n1. It refers to \"the national stadium\" as a specific stadium.\n2. Located in Cardiff, Wales.\n3. Was the largest former rugby union stadium.\n4. Closed in 1997.\n5. Had a capacity of 53000 at closure.\n\nNow, I'll cross-reference these points with the table.\n\nStarting with the first point: \"the national stadium.\" Scanning through the 'stadium' column, I see that the first row is indeed \"the national stadium.\"\n\nNext, location: Cardiff, Wales. In the table, the city is listed as \"cardiff\" (all lowercase in the table). The claim has it as Cardiff, so that matches.\n\nThird point: It's stated to be the largest former rugby union stadium. I need to see if this is accurate based on the capacity. Looking at the 'capacity' column, the first row shows 53000, which is indeed the highest number in the table. So, yes, it's the largest by capacity.\n\nFourth point: Closed in 1997. The 'closed' year for the national stadium is 1997, as per the table.\n\nFifth point: Capacity of 53000 at closure. That matches exactly with the 'capacity (at time of closure)' column for that row.\n\nSo all points in the claim are supported by the corresponding cells in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells that support this claim. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"athletic park , in wellington , be new zealand 's largest stadium , with a total capacity of 39000.\" So, the claim has two main points: the stadium is called Athletic Park, located in Wellington, New Zealand, and it has a capacity of 39,000.\n\nNext, I'll look at the provided HTML table to find the relevant information. The table lists several stadiums with their capacities, cities, countries, and closure years.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"athletic park\" in the 'stadium' column. Scanning through each row, I find that the sixth stadium listed is indeed named \"athletic park.\" Its capacity is 39000, which matches the claim's figure. The city is Wellington, and the country is New Zealand, both of which align with the claim.\n\nNow, to verify if it's the largest stadium in New Zealand, I need to check all stadiums in the table that are in New Zealand. From the table, I see that there are two stadiums in New Zealand: Athletic Park (Wellington) and Carisbrook (Dunedin). The capacities are 39,000 for Athletic Park and 29,000 for Carisbrook. Since 39,000 is higher than 29,000, it makes Athletic Park the larger of the two.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other stadiums in New Zealand that might have a higher capacity. Looking at the list, all other stadiums listed are outside New Zealand. Therefore, within New Zealand, Athletic Park is indeed the largest with its capacity of 39,000.\n\nThus, both points in the claim are supported by the table data: the stadium's name, location, country, and capacity all match, and it's confirmed as the largest in New Zealand based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close , in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim. It says that Edgeley Park and Firhill were the most recent large rugby union stadiums to close in 2012. So, I need to verify if both these stadiums closed around 2012 and are recent compared to others in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a stadium name, capacity, city, country, and the year it was closed. My task is to find out which stadiums closed in or after 2007 because the next most recent would be the ones after that.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. National Stadium: Closed 1997\n2. Lansdowne Road: 2007\n3. Petco Park: 2010\n4. Athletic Park: 1999\n5. Carisbrook: 2011\n6. Stubhub Center: 2007\n7. Loftus Road: 2001\n8. Meadowbank Stadium: 2006\n9. Racecourse Ground: 2009\n10. Stade Jean - Bouin: 2010\n11. Edgeley Park: 2012\n12. Firhill: 2012\n\nSo, the most recent closures are Edgeley Park and Firhill in 2012. The next one before them is Petco Park (2010) and Stade Jean - Bouin (2010), then Carisbrook (2011). So yes, Edgeley Park and Firhill were indeed the most recent large rugby union stadiums to close in 2012.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"most recent large rugby union stadium.\" The table lists both as closing in 2012. I need to check if there are any other stadiums that closed after 2012 because that would make the claim incorrect. But looking through the list, all closures are up to 2012, with Edgeley Park and Firhill being the last two. So they were indeed the most recent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant columns are 'stadium', 'city', 'country', and 'closed' for both Edgeley Park and Firhill.\n\nEdgeley Park is at row 10 (index 10), columns: stadium, city, country, closed.\nFirhill is at row 11 (index 11), same columns.\n\nSo the relevant cells are those four columns for rows 10 and 11. But wait, in the table, each row has all five columns. So I should include all cells that contribute to verifying the claim.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would be:\n- For Edgeley Park: row 10, all columns except 'capacity'.\n- For Firhill: row 11, same.\nWait no, the capacity is part of each stadium's data but isn't directly related to the closure year. The relevant info is in 'closed' column.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to find cells that verify each condition in the claim. The claim mentions both stadiums closed in 2012 and being recent. So the key columns are 'stadium', 'city', 'country', and 'closed'.\n\nTherefore, for Edgeley Park (row 10) and Firhill (row 11), I should include their respective cells under stadium name, city, country, and closed year.\n\nSo relevant_cells would be:\n- Row 10: column 'stadium' (Edgeley Park), 'city' (Stockport), 'country' (England), 'closed' (2012)\n- Row 11: column 'stadium' (Firhill), 'city' (Glasgow), 'country' (Scotland), 'closed' (2012)\n\nThat makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about rugby stadiums is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"England, Scotland, Wales, the United States and New Zealand each have 2 rugby stadiums with a capacity of over 10,000 that closed.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim into specific conditions. It seems like for each country mentioned (England, Scotland, Wales, USA, New Zealand), there should be exactly two rugby stadiums in the table that meet both criteria: a) having a capacity over 10,000 and b) being closed.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it lists various stadiums along with their capacities and the years they were closed. My task is to check for each country how many such relevant entries exist.\n\nStarting with England: From the table, the relevant entries would be any stadium in England with a capacity over 10,000 and a closure year. Looking through each row:\n\n- Loftus Road (capacity 18,500) closed in 2001. That's one.\n- Meadowbank Stadium (16,500) closed in 2006. That's another.\n\nSo England has two stadiums meeting the criteria.\n\nNext, Scotland: Checking for Scottish stadiums with capacity over 10,000 and closed:\n\n- Firhill (10,887) closed in 2012. That's one.\n- Athletic Park (but wait, Athletic Park is in Wellington, New Zealand, so that's not relevant here). Wait, no, the table has Athletic Park as Wellington, which is in New Zealand. So for Scotland, only Firhill meets both conditions.\n\nWait, that's only one stadium. The claim states each country should have two. So this might be a problem. Did I miss any?\n\nLooking again: In the table, the stadiums listed under Scotland are Firhill (10,887) and Meadowbank Stadium is in Edinburgh but perhaps that's considered Scotland as well? Wait no, Meadowbank is in Edinburgh which is in Scotland, but its capacity is 16,500, but it's closed in 2006. So does that count for Scotland?\n\nWait, the table lists Meadowbank Stadium under Scotland, so yes, that would be another one. So both Firhill and Meadowbank are in Scotland. So that gives two.\n\nWait, no: The claim says each country has two. So I need to check if each of those countries has two. Let me re-examine.\n\nEngland: Loftus Road (18k) closed 2001 and Meadowbank Stadium is actually under Scotland, so maybe not. Wait, no, Meadowbank is in Edinburgh, which is part of Scotland. So England's are Loftus Road and perhaps another? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me list all the relevant entries:\n\nLoftus Road: England, 18k, closed 2001 \u2013 yes.\nMeadowbank Stadium: Scotland, 16k, closed 2006 \u2013 counts for Scotland.\nFirhill: Scotland, ~10.9k, closed 2012.\n\nSo for England, is there another stadium? Let me see:\n\nEdgeley Park (11k) is in Stockport, England, closed 2012. So that's a third stadium in England with capacity over 10k and closed.\n\nBut the claim says each country should have two. So if England has three, then the claim would be false because it's more than two.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"each have 2 rugby stadium\", so if any of them doesn't have exactly two, the entire claim is false.\n\nSimilarly, I need to check for each country:\n\n1. England: Let me count all their stadiums in the table with capacity >10k and closed.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Loftus Road: 18,500 \u2013 England \u2013 yes\n- Edgeley Park: 11,000 \u2013 England \u2013 yes\n- Meadowbank Stadium is listed under Scotland, but if it's indeed in Scotland, then that's a separate country. So maybe I'm confusing countries with regions.\n\nWait, the table lists each stadium's city and country. For example:\n\nLoftus Road is London (England)\nEdgeley Park is Stockport (England)\nMeadowbank Stadium is Edinburgh (Scotland)\n\nSo for England, there are two stadiums: Loftus Road and Edgeley Park? Wait no, Edgeley Park is 11k, which is over 10k. So that's two. Or three if I'm missing another.\n\nWait, the table has:\n\nLoftus Road \u2013 18,500 (closed 2001)\nEdgeley Park \u2013 11,000 (closed 2012)\nMeadowbank Stadium: Wait, no, Meadowbank is in Scotland. So for England, only two: Loftus Road and Edgeley Park?\n\nWait, the table has:\n\n- The National Stadium \u2013 Cardiff, Wales\n- Lansdowne Road \u2013 Dublin, Ireland\n- Petco Park \u2013 San Diego, USA\n- Athletic Park \u2013 Wellington, NZ\n- Carisbrook \u2013 Dunedin, NZ\n- Stubhub Center \u2013 Carson, USA\n- Loftus Road \u2013 London, England (18k)\n- Meadowbank Stadium \u2013 Edinburgh, Scotland (16.5k)\n- Firhill \u2013 Glasgow, Scotland (10.9k)\n\nWait, so for England, the only stadium is Loftus Road and Edgeley Park? Or is there another?\n\nLooking again:\n\nLoftus Road: London, capacity 18,500\nEdgeley Park: Stockport, capacity 11,000\n\nThat's two.\n\nWait, no, the table doesn't list Edgeley Park as a separate entry. Wait, let me check each row:\n\n1. The National Stadium \u2013 Cardiff, Wales (16k, closed)\n2. Lansdowne Road \u2013 Dublin, Ireland (55k, closed)\n3. Petco Park \u2013 San Diego, USA (70k, closed)\n4. Athletic Park \u2013 Wellington, NZ (84k, closed)\n5. Carisbrook \u2013 Dunedin, NZ (35k, closed)\n6. Stubhub Center \u2013 Carson, USA (30k, closed)\n7. Loftus Road \u2013 London, England (18k, 2001)\n8. Meadowbank Stadium \u2013 Edinburgh, Scotland (16.5k, 2006)\n9. Firhill \u2013 Glasgow, Scotland (10.9k, 2012)\n\nSo in the table, for England, only Loftus Road meets capacity over 10k and closed. Edgeley Park is not in the table; perhaps it's a separate stadium? Wait no, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, the user didn't list all possible stadiums, just the ones in the table. So in the table provided, the only England entry is Loftus Road (18k) and Meadowbank is Scotland. So Edgeley Park might be another one not listed here. But since we're limited to the data given, I can only go by what's provided.\n\nWait no, the user didn't specify whether these are all the relevant entries or just examples. Assuming that the table represents all the necessary entries for each country, then:\n\nEngland: Loftus Road (18k) \u2013 1\n\nScotland: Meadowbank (16.5k), Firhill (10.9k) \u2013 2\n\nWales: The National Stadium (16k) \u2013 but it's in Cardiff, Wales, so does it count? Capacity over 10k and closed? Yes.\n\nSo for Wales:\n\nThe National Stadium: 16k, closed.\n\nThat's one.\n\nIf the claim says each country has two, then Wales only has one, which would make the entire statement false.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if The National Stadium is still open or not. From the table, it's marked as closed.\n\nSo for Wales: 1 stadium (16k), so less than two, which fails the claim.\n\nSimilarly, checking USA:\n\nPetco Park \u2013 San Diego, 70k, closed\nStubhub Center \u2013 Carson, 30k, closed\n\nThat's two.\n\nFor New Zealand:\n\nAthletic Park \u2013 Wellington, 84k, closed\nCarisbrook \u2013 Dunedin, 35k, closed\n\nBut wait, Carisbrook is in Dunedin, which is in New Zealand. So that's another one.\n\nSo for NZ: two stadiums (Athletic Park and Carisbrook), both over 10k, closed.\n\nWait, no:\n\n- Athletic Park: 84k\n- Carisbrook: 35k\n\nBoth are over 10k and closed. So yes, two.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nEngland: 1 (Loftus Road)\nScotland: 2 (Meadowbank, Firhill)\nWales: 1 (The National Stadium)\nUSA: 2 (Petco Park, Stubhub)\nNew Zealand: 2 (Athletic Park, Carisbrook)\n\nThus, Wales and England only have one each, which doesn't meet the claim's condition of two per country. Therefore, the entire statement is false.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting counts because maybe I miscounted. Let me re-examine:\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- England: Loftus Road (18k) \u2013 1\n- Scotland: Meadowbank (16.5k), Firhill (10.9k) \u2013 2\n- Wales: The National Stadium (16k) \u2013 1\n- USA: Petco Park (70k), Stubhub Center (30k) \u2013 2\n- New Zealand: Athletic Park (84k), Carisbrook (35k) \u2013 2\n\nSo indeed, only England and Wales have one each. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because not all countries have two.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that Edgeley Park is in England but perhaps its capacity is under 10k? Let me check: No, Edgeley Park's capacity is 11,000 which is over 10k, but it's not listed in the table provided. So from what's given, England only has one.\n\nSimilarly, for Wales, The National Stadium is 16k, closed. That's one.\n\nTherefore, the statement that each country has two such stadiums is false because Wales and England only have one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that each country (England, Scotland, Wales, USA, New Zealand) has at least two football (soccer) stadiums with capacities over 10,000 and that are closed is incorrect. Specifically:\n\n- **England**: Only 1 stadium (Loftus Road).\n- **Scotland**: 2 stadiums (Meadowbank and Firhill).\n- **Wales**: Only 1 stadium (The National Stadium).\n- **USA**: 2 stadiums (Petco Park and Stubhub Center).\n- **New Zealand**: 2 stadiums (Athletic Park and Carisbrook).\n\nThus, the claim is false because not all listed countries have two such stadiums.",

The claim is: \"lansdowne road be the only rugby union stadium in ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have close\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions that Lansdowne Road is the only rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000 and it was closed. So I need to check two main things: whether Lansdowne Road meets these criteria and if there are any other stadiums in Ireland that also meet them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different stadium with details like name, capacity, city, country, and the year it was closed. My focus is on the 'stadium' column, specifically looking for those in Ireland, their capacities over 10,000, and if they were closed.\n\nStarting with Lansdowne Road: According to the table, its capacity is 49000 and it's located in Dublin, Ireland, which was closed in 2007. That fits both conditions\u2014capacity over 10,000 and closed. So that's one.\n\nNow I need to check if there are any other stadiums in Ireland with capacities over 10,000 that were closed. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The National Stadium in Cardiff, Wales: capacity 53000, but it's in Wales, so not relevant for Ireland.\n- Lansdowne Road as mentioned.\n- Petco Park is in San Diego, USA.\n- Athletic Park in Wellington, New Zealand.\n- Carisbrook in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n- StubHub Center in Carson, USA.\n- Loftus Road in London, England.\n- Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n- Racecourse Ground in Wrexham, Wales.\n- Stade Jean-Bouin in Paris, France.\n- Edgeley Park in Stockport, England.\n- Firhill in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nWait, all the other stadiums listed either aren't in Ireland or have capacities under 10,000. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the 'city' column for Ireland: Only Dublin has a stadium (Lansdowne Road) with capacity over 10,000 and closed. No others in Ireland meet both criteria.\n\nTherefore, Lansdowne Road is indeed the only one in Ireland with capacity over 10,000 that was closed.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Lansdowne Road is the sole rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000 and whether it was closed. \n\n1. **Lansdowne Road**: Located in Dublin, capacity 49000, closed in 2007.

So, there's a discrepancy in the capacity number mentioned in the claim versus what's in the table. The table shows 53,000 for the national stadium, but the claim says 10,887. That's different.\n\nBut maybe I should check if any other row has 10887 as capacity. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 8 (Firhill) has 10887 in capacity.\n- Row 9 (Loftus Road) is 18,500.\n- No other rows have 10,887 except Firhill.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to \"the national stadium\" specifically. So the relevant cells would be the ones that directly support the claim.\n\nThe claim's first part is correct: it's the national stadium, in Cardiff, Wales, closed in 1997. But the capacity at closure is wrong; it was 53,000, not 10,887. The 10887 figure comes from Firhill, which is a different stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because of the mismatched capacity number.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each part:\n\n- **Stadium Name**: Matches row 0.\n- **Location**: Cardiff, Wales: Correct for row 0.\n- **Closure Year**: 1997: Correct for row 0.\n- **Capacity at Closure**: Claim says 10887, but table shows 53000.\n\nSince the capacity doesn't match, the claim is FALSE. However, the relevant cells include the ones confirming the correct attributes except the capacity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says that England, Scotland, Wales, the United States, and New Zealand each have three rugby stadiums with a capacity over 10,000 that were closed.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. Each country mentioned should have exactly three stadiums meeting two criteria: capacity over 10,000 and having been closed. \n\nI'll start by looking at each country one by one.\n\n1. **England**: From the table, I need to find all rugby stadiums in England with a capacity over 10,000 that were closed. The relevant columns are \"stadium\", \"capacity (at time of closure)\", \"closed\". I'll go through each row where the country is England.\n\n   - Looking at the table, there are two rows for England: Loftus Road and Meadowbank Stadium.\n   \n   - **Loftus Road**: Capacity 18,500 which is over 10,000. Closed in 2001. So this counts as one.\n   \n   - **Meadowbank Stadium**: Capacity 16,500, also over 10,000. Closed in 2006. That's the second.\n   \n   Wait, but the claim says each country has three. I only found two for England. Did I miss any? Let me check again.\n\n   Hmm, in the table provided, there are only two entries for England. So that's a problem because the claim states three. Maybe I made a mistake?\n\nWait no, the table shows Loftus Road and Meadowbank Stadium as the only ones. So England doesn't have three, only two. That would make the claim false, but let me check others.\n\n2. **Scotland**: Checking for Scotland, the relevant rows are Firhill and Meadowbank Stadium.\n\n   - **Firhill**: Capacity 10,887 over 10k, closed in 2012. So one.\n   \n   - **Meadowbank Stadium**: Capacity 16,500, closed in 2006. That's two.\n   \n   Wait, is there another? Let me see: Meadowbank and Firhill are the only ones for Scotland. So only two again. The claim says three, so that's a problem.\n\n3. **Wales**: Looking at Wales rows.\n\n   - National Stadium: Capacity 53k, closed 1997.\n   \n   - Racecourse Ground: Capacity 15,500, closed 2009.\n\n   Wait, is there another? Let me check the table again. There are two for Wales as well. So only two. But the claim says three. Hmm.\n\n4. **United States**: Let's see how many in US with capacity over 10k and closed.\n\n   - Petco Park: Capacity 42,445, closed 2010.\n   \n   - Stubhub Center: 27,000, closed 2007.\n\n   Wait, are there more? Let me check. Only two entries for the US as well. So only two. But the claim says three.\n\n5. **New Zealand**: Check rows for New Zealand.\n\n   - Athletic Park: Capacity 39k, closed 1999.\n   \n   - Carisbrook: 29k, closed 2011.\n\n   Are there more? Only two again. So New Zealand also has two.\n\nPutting this all together: Each country in the claim (England, Scotland, Wales, US, NZ) needs three stadiums with capacity over 10k and closed. But from the table, each of these countries only has two such stadiums. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because none have three.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something? Let me double-check each country again.\n\nFor England: Yes, only two. Scotland same. Wales same. US same. NZ same.\n\nSo yes, all have only two, not three. So the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because each of the listed countries has only two rugby stadiums meeting the criteria instead of three.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close in 2010.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the relevant information. The table lists several stadiums along with their capacity, city, country, and year closed.\n\nStarting with \"edgeley park,\" I scan through each row until I find it. It's in the 8th row (row_index=8) under the \"stadium\" column. The capacity is 10900, but that might not be directly relevant. The important details are the stadium name and the year closed, which is 2012.\n\nNext, I look for \"firhill.\" Scanning through the rows again, I find it in the 9th row (row_index=9). The capacity is 10887, but again, the key info is the stadium name and the year closed, which is also 2012.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says both were closed in 2010. But according to the table, both edgeley park and firhill closed in 2012. That's a discrepancy because the claim mentions 2010 as the closure year for both. \n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any rows or misread the years. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- The first few rows have closures in 1997, 2001, 2006, 2007, etc.\n- Edgeley Park is closed in 2012 (row 8).\n- Firhill is also closed in 2012 (row 9).\n\nSo both were indeed closed later than 2010. The claim mentions 2010 as the year they closed, but the actual data shows 2012. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. For edgeley park, it's row_index=8 and column_name=\"stadium.\" Similarly, firhill is at row_index=9, same column. Therefore, these two cells are the ones that show the stadium names and their closure year in 2012.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"edgeley park\" and \"firhill\" were the most recent large rugby union stadiums to close in 2010. However, upon checking the table, both closed in 2012, not 2010.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the athletic park in Wellington is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"athletic park , in wellington , be new zealand 's second largest stadium , with a total capacity of 39000.\"\n\nI need to check each part of the claim against the table data. \n\nStarting with the stadium name: The claim mentions \"athletic park.\" Looking at the table, I see that there's a row where the stadium is \"athletic park\" located in Wellington, New Zealand, closed in 1999, and has a capacity of 39000. So that part matches.\n\nNext, it says it's \"new zealand 's second largest stadium.\" To verify this, I need to see if there's another stadium with a higher capacity in New Zealand. Scanning through the table, I notice that \"lansdowne road\" in Dublin, Ireland has a capacity of 49000. However, since Ireland is a separate country from New Zealand, it doesn't count towards New Zealand's stadiums. The next closest is \"petco park\" with 42445, but again, that's in the United States. So within New Zealand, the largest stadium would be \"lansdowne road\" at 49000, which is higher than 39000. Therefore, athletic park being the second largest might not be accurate.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking back, I see another stadium named \"carisbrook\" in Dunedin with a capacity of 29000 and \"loftus road\" in London with 18500. But these are in different countries as well. So within New Zealand, the largest stadium is lansdowne road at 49000, making athletic park not the second largest but perhaps third or fourth.\n\nThen, the claim mentions a capacity of 39000. Checking the table, that's exactly what's listed for athletic park. So that part is correct.\n\nPutting it all together: The name and capacity match, but whether it's the second largest depends on other stadiums in New Zealand. Since lansdowne road has a higher capacity (49000) within New Zealand, athletic park isn't the second largest. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"lansdowne road be the 1 of 2 rugby union stadium in ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have close.\"\n\nBreaking down the claim, I can identify several points:\n1. The stadium is called \"lansdowne road.\"\n2. It should be one of two rugby union stadiums in Ireland.\n3. Each of these two stadiums should have a capacity over 10,000 at the time of closure.\n4. Both should have been closed.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there are exactly two rugby union stadiums in Ireland with capacities over 10,000 that were closed.\n\nStarting with \"lansdowne road,\" from the table, it's located in Dublin and was closed in 2007 with a capacity of 49,000. That fits the first point and potentially the second if there's another stadium meeting the criteria.\n\nNext, I'll look for other rugby union stadiums in Ireland. The table lists several Irish stadiums:\n- Lansdowne Road: Capacity 49,000 (closed 2007)\n- Loftus Road: Capacity 18,500 (closed 2001) but it's located in London, not Ireland.\nWait, no, the table shows \"loftus road\" as being in London. So, perhaps I should check for other Irish stadiums.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n- There's \"lansdowne road\" in Dublin, Ireland.\n- Any others? Let me scan the 'country' column for Ireland: only \"lansdowne road\" and maybe another?\n\nWait, no. Checking the table, each row has a 'country'. Scanning all rows, I see:\n- Cardiff, Wales\n- Dublin, Ireland\n- San Diego, United States\n- Wellington, New Zealand\n- Dunedin, New Zealand\n- Carson, United States\n- London, England\n- Edinburgh, Scotland\n- Wrexham, Wales\n- Paris, France\n- Stockport, England\n- Glasgow, Scotland\n\nSo, only \"lansdowne road\" is in Ireland. That means there's only one rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000 that was closed.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 of 2.\" Since I found only one, that contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because there isn't another stadium meeting those criteria in Ireland.\n\nHowever, to make sure, perhaps I missed another Irish stadium. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- The second row is \"lansdowne road\" with 49k capacity (closed 2007).\n- Then, looking at the other rows:\n   - \"loftus road\" is in London, England.\n   - None of the others are in Ireland except for \"lansdowne road.\"\n\nSo yes, only one stadium. Therefore, the claim that there are two such stadiums is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would be the row for \"lansdowne road\" to show it's the only one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Lansdowne Road is one of two rugby union stadiums in Ireland with capacities over 10,000 at closure. However, upon examining the table, only Lansdowne Road meets these criteria, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
