    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"On 8 February, the crowd at Hisense Arena was 8093.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the date in the table. Scanning through the 'date' column, I see that there's an entry for 8 February. So that's relevant.\n\nNext, the venue mentioned is Hisense Arena. Looking at the 'venue' column for that specific row, it should be Hisense Arena. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Hisense Arena? No, it's Adelaide 36ers vs South Dragons at Hisense Arena.\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the first row is 4 February, so I need to go to row 6 (since rows are zero-indexed). Wait, let me count:\n\nRow 0: 4 Feb\nRow 1: 4 Feb\nRow 2: 6 Feb\nRow 3: 6 Feb\nRow 4: 7 Feb\nRow 5: 7 Feb\nRow 6: 8 Feb\n\nSo row 6 is 8 February. The venue for that row is Hisense Arena, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the 'crowd' column for that row. Looking at row 6 (8 Feb), the crowd is listed as 8093. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, all relevant cells match the claim: date, venue, and crowd number are correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",

    "claim": "on 7 february , the box score show that the away team be the new zealand breaker",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table is in HTML format, and the claim is about the box score showing something specific on February 7th.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"On 7 February, the box score shows that the away team is the New Zealand Breakers.\" So I need to check if on that date, when the away team played, it was indeed the New Zealand Breakers according to the box score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The task is to find which cells are relevant to verify this claim.\n\nI need to look for rows where the date is 7 February. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. First row: 4 Feb \u2013 not relevant.\n2. Second row: 4 Feb \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: 6 Feb \u2013 nope.\n4. Fourth row: 6 Feb \u2013 still no.\n5. Fifth row: 7 Feb \u2013 yes, this is the date we need.\n6. Next rows are also 7 Feb, so I'll check all of them.\n\nIn the fifth row (row index 5), the home team is Adelaide 36ers, score is 102 -91, away team is New Zealand Breakers. The box score and report columns have '-', but since we're focusing on whether the away team was correct, that's sufficient.\n\nThen there's another row for 7 Feb: row index 6, where the home team is Cairns Taipans, score is 88-93, away team is Gold Coast Blaze. That doesn't match the claim.\n\nAnd row index 7: Perth Wildcats vs Sydney Spirit, so again not matching.\n\nSo the relevant rows are row indices 5 and 6 because they both have the date 7 February. But wait, no, looking back, the fifth row in the table is actually index 4 (since it's zero-based or one-based? Wait, the user mentioned \"row_index\" as an integer, so probably starting from 0.\n\nWait, the rows are listed as:\n\n1. <tr> \u2013 first game: row index 0\n2. Second: 0, third: 1, etc. No, wait, in the JSON example, they used row_index as 0 and 1 for two rows. So the table starts with the first row as index 0.\n\nSo in the given table:\n\nRow 0: 4 Feb \u2013 no\nRow 1: 4 Feb \u2013 no\nRow 2: 6 Feb \u2013 no\nRow 3: 6 Feb \u2013 no\nRow 4: 7 Feb \u2013 yes, that's one row\nRow 5: 7 Feb \u2013 another game on same date\n\nSo I need to check both rows where the date is 7 February.\n\nIn row 4 (index 4), the away team is New Zealand Breakers. That matches the claim.\n\nIn row 5 (index 5), the away team is Gold Coast Blaze, which doesn't match.\n\nSo for the claim to be true, at least one of these rows must have the away team as New Zealand Breakers. Since there's a row where it does, that supports the claim.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are both row indices 4 and 5 (if considering all games on 7 Feb), but since only row 4 matches the claim, perhaps we should include only that one? Or maybe both because they're part of the same date?\n\nWait, the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim is specifically about the away team being New Zealand Breakers. So the relevant cells are the columns where this information is found, which are 'away team' column.\n\nTherefore, for each row that could potentially have the correct information, I need to include their 'row_index' and 'column_name'.\n\nSo in this case, only row 4 (where away team is NZ Breakers) is relevant because that's where the claim is true. But wait, the other rows on same date don't match, so perhaps only row 4.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014 the user wants all cells that are relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim is about a specific date and the away team being NZ Breakers, I should look at all rows where the date is 7 Feb, because that's when the event happened. So both row 4 and 5 (indices 4 and 5) are relevant because they're the games on 7 Feb.\n\nIn row 4: away team is NZ Breakers \u2013 matches the claim\nIn row 5: away team is Gold Coast Blaze \u2013 doesn't match, but still part of the date in question\n\nTherefore, both rows have to be considered because the claim could be about any game on that date. So I should include all rows where date is 7 Feb.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row 4 (index 4): away team column\n- For row 5 (index 5): away team column\n\nSo in JSON format, it's two objects with \"row_index\" as 4 and 5, and \"column_name\" as \"away team\".\n\nBut wait, the user might be asking for cells that are relevant to check if the claim is true. Since the claim is about a specific game (i.e., on 7 Feb, when NZ played), but in reality, there are two games on that date. So perhaps only one of them matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all rows with the correct date need to be checked, so their 'away team' columns are relevant.\n\nI think the answer should include all such cells, because to verify the claim, you'd need to check each game on 7 Feb whether the away team is NZ Breakers. So even though only one matches, you still have to look at both to confirm which one it is.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index 4 and column \"away team\"\n- row_index 5 and column \"away team\"\n\nThat way, when checking, we can see that in one of those rows, the away team is NZ Breakers.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check all games on February 7th. Here are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true because on February 7th, the away team in one of the games was indeed the New Zealand Breakers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status\": \"True\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The relevant cells indicate that on February 7th, there was a game where the away team was the New Zealand Breakers.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"February 4 have a score smaller than 4485\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions February 4 and a score being smaller than 4485. So, I need to look at all the games that happened on February 4th in the table and check their scores against 4485.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. The dates provided are from February 4 to February 8. So I'm focusing on rows where the date is \"4 february\".\n\nThere's only one row for February 4: \n\n- Date: 4 february\n- Home team: sydney spirit\n- Score: 81 - 89\n- Away team: cairns taipans\n- Venue: state sports centre\n- Crowd: 920\n- Box score: box score\n- Report: -\n\nThe score in this row is \"81 - 89\". To check if this score is smaller than 4485, I need to see what the scores mean. Typically, in basketball, the score is the points for each team, so the total points would be the sum of both teams' scores.\n\nLet me calculate that: 81 (sydney spirit) + 89 (cairns taipans) = 170 points.\n\nNow, compare this to 4485. Clearly, 170 is much smaller than 4485. So the claim that \"February 4 have a score smaller than 4485\" is TRUE because at least one game on February 4 has a total score of 170, which is indeed smaller.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The row in question is row index 1 (since it's zero-indexed). The columns that matter here are \"score\", as it's the numerical value we're comparing, and perhaps \"crowd\" if needed, but in this case, since the score is directly compared to 4485, only the score column is relevant.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all games on February 4. But there's only one game that day with a score of 170, which is definitely smaller than 4485. So yes, it's supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because on February 4, the total score was 170, which is less than 4485.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the state sport centre be the home ground of the south dragon\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by breaking down what the claim is saying. It's stating that the State Sport Centre is the home ground for the South Dragons.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different game with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, crowd, box score, and report. My goal is to find any relevant cells that can confirm or deny the claim.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where \"South Dragons\" are listed as the home team because if their home games are at the State Sport Centre, that would support the claim. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first two rows (row indices 0 and 1) have South Dragons as the home team on February 4th. The venue for both these games is Hisense Arena, not the State Sport Centre.\n2. Next, looking at row index 2, the home team is Townsville Crocodiles at Townsville Entertainment Centre.\n3. Row index 3 has Wollongong Hawks as the home team at WIN Entertainment Centre.\n4. Then, row indices 4 and 5: Adelaide 36ers are home at Distinctive Homes Dome and Cairns Taipans at Cairns Convention Centre.\n5. Finally, in row index 6, South Dragons are again the away team against Melbourne Tigers, so that's not relevant for their home games.\n\nSo, based on this table, South Dragons never play at the State Sport Centre as their home ground. Their home games are all at Hisense Arena. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the venue listed for South Dragons' matches isn't the State Sport Centre.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table for any cells related to \"South Dragons\" and \"State Sport Centre\".\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Identify Rows Where \"South Dragons\" are the Home Team:**\n   - Rows 0 (4 Feb) and 7 (8 Feb): Both list \"South Dragons\" as the home team.\n2. **Check Venue for These Rows:**\n   - Row 0: Venue is Hisense Arena.\n   - Row 7: Venue is Hisense Arena.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since all South Dragons' games in the table are at Hisense Arena, not the State Sport Centre.\n\n**Verification:**\n- The claim suggests \"State Sport Centre\" as South Dragons' home ground. However, no relevant data supports this in the provided table.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
