I need to determine whether the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and \"croire\". The claim is saying that \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has a higher points value compared to \"croire\".\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different song. The columns relevant here are \"song\" and \"points\". So, I need to find the rows where the song is either \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" or \"croire\".\n\nStarting with \"vivo (ti scrivo)\": I'll scan through each row's \"song\" column. I notice that in row 18, the song is listed as \"vivo (ti scrivo)\". So, this is the relevant cell for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\". The points for this row are 52.\n\nNext, looking for \"croire\": I need to find a row where the song is exactly \"croire\". Scanning through the rows, I see that in row 17, the song is \"croire\". The points for this row are 90. Wait, but the claim says \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\". Since 52 (from vivo) is less than 90 (from croire), this would make the claim false.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm if there's only one occurrence of each song. For \"vivo (ti scrivo)\", it appears once in row 18. For \"croire\", it also appears once in row 17. So, comparing these two points: vivo has 52 and croire has 90. Therefore, vivo does not have higher points than croire.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other instances or if perhaps the claim is considering different languages or versions. But based on the table provided, each song is unique per row, so no need to consider variations beyond what's listed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since vivo's points (52) are lower than croire's points (90), the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by comparing the \"points\" of \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and \"croire\". Based on the table, \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has 52 points while \"croire\" has 90 points. Since 52 is less than 90, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
