    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"runner - up, rick huiskamp's margin of victory be 10 stroke.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n1. The runner-up is Rick Huiskamp.\n2. His margin of victory was 10 strokes.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the runner-up is Rick Huiskamp and then check the corresponding margin of victory. \n\nI'll go through each row in the 'runner - up' column:\n- Row 0: Wolfgang Huget (not Rick)\n- Row 1: Mark Grabow Schytter (nope)\n- Row 2: Rick Huiskamp (yes, this is our runner-up)\n  \nNow, I need to check the margin of victory for this row. The 'margin of victory' column shows \"10 strokes.\" So that matches.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the claim again, it specifies that the margin is 10 strokes, which aligns with what's in the table.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"rick huiskamp be a runner - up , finish up with a single - digit margin of victory.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's making two points: one about \"rick huiskamp\" being the runner-up and another about having a single-digit margin of victory.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if these conditions are met. Let me go through each relevant column in the table.\n\nThe columns in the table are: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runner-up. So, for the claim, I'm interested in two things: the \"runner - up\" column and the \"margin of victory\" column.\n\nI'll start by looking for any row where the runner-up is rick huiskamp. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first row has Wolfgang Huget as the runner-up.\n2. The second row mentions Mark Grabow Schytter.\n3. The third row is Rick Huiskamp. Oh, here we go, that's the one.\n\nSo in the third row (row index 2), the runner-up is Rick Huiskamp. That satisfies the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check the margin of victory for this particular row. The \"margin of victory\" column shows \"10 strokes.\" Wait, 10 is a two-digit number, right? So it's not a single digit. \n\nThe claim says that Rick Huiskamp finished up with a single-digit margin of victory. But here, the margin is 10 strokes, which is two digits. That doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, even though Rick Huiskamp was indeed the runner-up, the margin of victory isn't a single-digit number as stated in the claim. So the claim's second condition fails.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim is incorrect because while Rick was the runner-up, his margin wasn't a single digit.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we check each row for \"runner - up\" being \"rick huiskamp\" and the margin of victory being a single-digit number. \n\n- **Runner-up Check**: Found in row 2 (index 2), Rick Huiskamp is the runner-up.\n- **Margin of Victory**: In this row, the margin is 10 strokes, which isn't a single digit.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because the margin is two digits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
