    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"1990 - 01 - 28 be the kickoff date for the round of r4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions a specific date, 1990-01-28, and claims it's the kick-off date for Round 4 (r4). My goal is to check if there's any row in the table that matches both the round number and the kick-off date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: round, kick off, opponents, h/a, result, attendance, and report. I'm interested in the \"round\" column and the \"kick off\" column because they directly relate to the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row (row 0) has r3 as the round with a kick-off date of 1990-01-06.\n2. The second row (r3 replay) is for the same round but on a different date, so not relevant here.\n3. The third row is r4, and its kick-off date is listed as 1990-01-28. This matches the claim's date exactly.\n4. The fourth row is r4 replay, which would be a later date, so not relevant for the initial kick-off.\n5. Subsequent rows are r5, r6, and sf, none of which are r4, so they can be ignored.\n\nSo, in row 3 (index 3), the round is r4 with the kick-off date of 1990-01-28. This directly supports the claim that this date is the kick-off for r4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a matching row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is: \"the result of round r6 replay with h / a of h be 1 - 0.\" So, I'm looking for the match where the round is 'r6 replay', the home/away status is 'h' (which means it's a home game), and the result is '1 - 0'.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has multiple rows, each representing a different match. Each row has several columns: round, kick off date, opponents, h/a, result, attendance, and report.\n\nI need to find the row where the round is 'r6 replay'. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. r3\n2. r3 replay\n3. r4\n4. r4 replay\n5. r5\n6. r6\n7. r6 replay\n8. sf\n\nSo, the 7th row is 'r6 replay'. Now, looking at that row's details:\n\n- round: r6 replay\n- kick off: 1990 - 03 - 14\n- opponents: queens park rangers\n- h/a: h (home)\n- result: 1 - 0\n\nThe result column here is '1 - 0', which matches the claim. Also, the h/a column shows 'h', so it's a home game.\n\nWait, but in the table, the result for 'r6 replay' is listed as '1 - 0'. So all the conditions in the claim are met in this row.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cells would be the ones in the r6 replay row, specifically 'result' and 'h/a', but looking at the instructions, I need to list each relevant cell with their row index and column name.\n\nWait, the row indices start from 0 for the first row. So the 'r3' row is row 0, then 'r3 replay' is row 1, and so on until 'sf' which would be row 7. The 'r6 replay' row is row 6.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row index: 6, column name: result\n- row index: 6, column name: h / a\n\nBut wait, in the table, the columns are in order: round, kick off, opponents, h/a, result, attendance, report. So for row 6 (r6 replay), 'h/a' is the 4th column (index 3 if zero-indexed). But I think the user wants the actual column names as they appear in the table, like \"h / a\", not indexes.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For 'result': row 6, column 'result'\n- For 'h/a': row 6, column 'h / a'\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions both h/a and result. So I need to check both columns in that row to ensure they match the claim.\n\nIn the table, row 6 (r6 replay) has:\n\nh/a: h\nresult: 1 - 0\n\nBoth match what the claim is stating. Therefore, all conditions are satisfied.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the 'result' and 'h / a' columns in the r6 replay row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"h / a\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the 1990 - 01 - 28 kick off date have a round value of r4.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. There's a table with several columns: round, kick off, opponents, h / a, result, attendance, and report. Each row represents a different match, with various details filled in each column.\n\nThe claim mentions \"1990 - 01 - 28\" as the kick-off date. I need to find which row corresponds to this date. Scanning through the table, the fourth row has the kick-off date of 1990 - 01 - 28. The round for that row is listed as r4. \n\nSo, in the relevant row (row index 3), the 'round' column has the value r4. The claim states that this specific kick-off date corresponds to a round value of r4, which matches exactly what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. There are no discrepancies here. So, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and HTML structure. The claim says: \"1990 - 01 - 29 be the kickoff date for the round value of r4.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has a header with several columns: round, kick off, opponents, h/a, result, attendance, report. Each row corresponds to different rounds, like r3, r4, etc., and some have replay dates.\n\nI need to find if there's an r4 round where the kick-off date is 1990-01-29. Looking at the table rows:\n\n- The first few rows are r3, r3 replay, r4, r4 replay, r5, r6, etc.\n- The r4 row has a kick off date of 1990-01-28.\n- Then there's an r4 replay with a kick off on 1990-01-31.\n\nSo, the main r4 match is on 1/28. Since the claim refers to \"r4,\" not the replay, it should be 1/28, not 1/29. Therefore, the claimed date doesn't match the actual kick-off for r4.\n\nI should check which cells are relevant. The round column for r4 is at row index 3 (since rows start from 0: r3 is 0, r4 replay is 3). The \"kick off\" column is the second one. So, the relevant_cells would be for row_index=3 and column_name=\"kick off\".\n\nSince the claim's date doesn't match the table data, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"kick off\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the kick off date be 1990 - 01 - 28 for the round value of r4 and result 8 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see if it matches any data in the table.\n\nStarting with the \"kick off date\" part. The claim specifies the date as 1990-01-28. Looking through the table, I'll check each row to find where the kick-off date is this. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- r3: 1990 - 01 - 06\n- r3 replay: 1990 - 01 - 09\n- r4: 1990 - 01 - 28 (this matches)\n- r4 replay: 1990 - 01 - 31\n- So, the r4 row has the kick-off date of 1990-01-28.\n\nNext, checking the \"round value\" part. The claim says it's for round r4. Looking at the first column, I see that r4 is indeed one of the rounds in the table.\n\nNow, the result part. The claim states the result should be 8 - 0. In the table, each row has a \"result\" column. For the r4 row, the result is listed as 0 - 0. That doesn't match 8-0.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.
