The columns are date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, scorers.\n\nI need to check each condition one by one. The key points from the claim are:\n\n1. Date: March 13, 1990\n2. Opponent: Dundee\n3. Result: 3 - 1\n\nSo I should look for a row where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table's rows:\n\n- Row 0: date is January 26, 1990; opponent is East Fife.\n- Row 1: date is January 29, 1990; opponent is East Fife.\n- Row 2: date is February 23, 1990; opponent is Arbroath.\n- Row 3: date is March 13, 1990; opponent is Dundee. \n  - Venue is home (h).\n  - Result is 3 - 1.\n  - Scorers are McKinnon, Jackson, Ferguson.\n- Row 4: April 6, 1991 vs St Johnstone.\n- Row 5: May 18, 1991 vs Motherwell.\n\nSo the only row that matches March 13, 1990 against Dundee with a 3 - 1 result is row index 3. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row_index 3 and column_name \"result\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on March 13, 1990, a match was played against Dundee resulting in a 3-1 score. Checking the table confirms this occurs in row 3 under the 'result' column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions that when Dundee is the opponent and the result is 3-4. So, I need to check if there's a row in the table where the 'opponent' column is \"dundee\" and the 'result' is \"3 - 4\".\n\nNow, let me examine the table provided. The table has several rows, each with different opponents and results. I'll go through each row one by one to see if any match these conditions.\n\nLooking at the first row: opponent is East Fife, result is 1-1. Doesn't match.\nSecond row: opponent is East Fife again, result is 2-1. Still not matching.\nThird row: opponent is Airdrieonians, result is 2-0. Not our case.\nFourth row: opponent is Dundee, and the result is 3-1. Hmm, that's close, but it's 3-1, not 3-4. So this doesn't satisfy the claim.\n\nFifth row: opponent is St Johnstone, result is 0-0. Not matching.\nSixth row: opponent is Motherwell, result is 3-4. Wait, here we go. The opponent is Motherwell, but the result is 3-4. So the result part matches, but the opponent isn't Dundee; it's Motherwell.\n\nSo the claim specifies that when Dundee is the opponent and the result is 3-4. Looking at all the rows, there's no instance where the opponent is Dundee with a 3-4 result. The only time the result is 3-4 is when Motherwell is the opponent, not Dundee.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data. There's no row that has both \"dundee\" as the opponent and \"3 - 4\" as the result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
