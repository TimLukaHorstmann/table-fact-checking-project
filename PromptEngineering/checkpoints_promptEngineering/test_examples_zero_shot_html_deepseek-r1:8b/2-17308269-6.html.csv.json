    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ann strother (g) be from connecticut\" is true or false based on the provided table. First, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions a player named Ann Strother, who plays as a guard (g). It asserts that she is from Connecticut. My task is to check this against the information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: pick, player, nationality, new wnba team, former wnba team, and college / country / team. Since the claim is about a player's origin (Connecticut), I should focus on the 'player' and 'college / country / team' columns.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find Ann Strother. Let me go row by row:\n\n- Row 1: Carla Thomas from Vanderbilt, not relevant.\n- Row 2: Erika Desouza from Brazil, nope.\n- Row 3: Katie Feenstra from Liberty, not matching.\n- Row 4: Ronneeka Hodges from Florida State, no.\n- Row 5: Ann Strother (g). Here we go. Her college is listed as Connecticut.\n\nWait, the claim says she's from Connecticut, which matches her college. So that seems to support the claim.\n\nI should check other rows just in case there are multiple players named Ann Strother. Continuing:\n\n- Rows 6 through 13 don't have another Ann Strother. The only one is row 5.\n\nSo, based on this, Ann Strother's college is Connecticut, which aligns with the claim that she's from Connecticut. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Ann Strother is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"Ann strother (g) player be from connecticut and be never play on indiana fever.\" So, there are two parts here:\n\n1. Ann Strother is a guard (g) who is from Connecticut.\n2. She has never played for the Indiana Fever.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant cells that could verify these points.\n\nFirst, I'll search for Ann Strother in the player column. Scanning through the rows, I see she's listed as row 5 with player name \"ann strother (g)\". That's one relevant cell: row_index=5, column_name=\"player\".\n\nNext, checking her nationality. The table shows that her nationality is United States. However, the claim says she's from Connecticut. Since the 'nationality' column doesn't specify state but just country, I need to look elsewhere. There's a column called \"college / country / team\", which for Ann Strother is listed as \"connecticut\". So that's another relevant cell: row_index=5, column_name=\"college / country / team\".\n\nNow, regarding her not playing for the Indiana Fever. Looking at the 'former wnba team' column for row 5, it says \"indiana fever\". That directly contradicts the claim that she has never played for them. So this is another relevant cell: row_index=5, column_name=\"former wnba team\".\n\nPutting it all together, there are three cells relevant to verifying the claim:\n1. Her player name in row 5.\n2. Her college information showing Connecticut.\n3. Her former team being Indiana Fever.\n\nSince her former team is listed as Indiana Fever, the second part of the claim is false. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
