    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"ivan \u0111uri\u0107 win the men's single in 1978\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for year, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 1994 to 2001.\n\nThe claim mentions \"ivan \u0111uri\u0107\" winning the men's single in 1978. Hmm, the years in the table start from 1994, so there's no entry for 1978. That immediately makes me think that if Ivan \u0110ur\u00ed\u0107 didn't play or win in any of these years, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking further, I'll check each relevant row and column. The men's singles column is where we should focus since the claim is about men's singles. \n\nIn 1994, the men's singles winner is \"no competition\", so no one won that year. In 1995, it was \"jovan markovi\u0107\". Then in 1996, again \"no competition\", but wait, that might be a typo or mistake because there are winners listed for other years. Maybe I should double-check the data.\n\nWait, looking at 1996: men's singles is \"zoran stepanovi\u0107 radomir jovovi\u0107\"? That seems odd because usually, a single would have one name as the winner. Maybe it's a pairing or something else, but in any case, Ivan isn't mentioned there either.\n\nContinuing down, I see that from 1997 onwards, the men's singles are mostly \"jovan markovi\u0107\" and \"radomir jovovi\u0107\", with some other players like bojan jakovljevi\u0107. None of these names match Ivan \u0110ur\u00ed\u0107, even if I'm considering possible typos or variations.\n\nAlso, since 1978 isn't a year in the table at all, there's no way Ivan could have competed that year based on the data provided. The table starts from 1994, so any claims about earlier years can't be verified and are likely incorrect.\n\nSo putting it together: the claim is about a year not present in the table, and within the available years, Ivan isn't listed as a winner in men's singles. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"in 1994, there be no competition in men, woman or mixed double.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the year 1994 in the table. From the HTML table, the first row (row_index=0) has the year 1994. Under each category\u2014men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles\u2014the competition status is listed as \"no competition.\" \n\nSo, for each of these categories in 1994, there are no competitions. That directly supports the claim because the claim mentions that there should be no competitions in men, women, or mixed doubles. The men's singles and women's singles columns both say \"no competition,\" which aligns with the claim. Additionally, the men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles all also have \"no competition\" entries.\n\nI need to check if these cells are relevant. Since each category mentioned in the claim corresponds to a specific column in row 0, those are the cells I should highlight as relevant. \n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE because all the relevant cells support the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyze the table for the year 1994 and check each relevant competition category.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"jelena obri\u0107 go on to win woman's single in 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions \"jelena obri\u0107\" winning a women's singles event in 1997. So I should check if there's an entry for 1997 and see who won in the women's singles that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific year. The columns are: men's singles, women's singles, etc. So for 1997, I need to find the relevant row.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n- 1994: no competition\n- 1995: nata\u0161a ostoji\u0107 won women's singles\n- 1996: same as 1995? Wait, let me check each year.\n\nWait, for 1997 (row 3), the women's singles column has \"jovanka kne\u017eevi\u0107\". So in 1997, the women's singles winner is not jelena obri\u0107 but someone else. That means the claim might be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check beyond that. The claim says she went on to win, implying maybe a future event, not necessarily 1997 itself. Hmm, but the year specified is 1997, so if she didn't win in 1997, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rows. For 1998 (row 5), the women's singles winner is \"jelena obri\u0107\". But that's not 1997, it's 1998. So in 1997, she didn't win; someone else did.\n\nSo the claim says she won in 1997, which doesn't align with the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"jelena obri\u0107\" won women's singles in 1997. Examining the table for that year (row index 3), the winner is listed as \"jovanka kne\u017eevi\u0107,\" not \"jelena obri\u0107.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant column for this claim is \"women's singles.\"\n\nI should focus on the row where the year is 2001. Let me find that row in the table. \n\nIn the tbody section, there are rows for each year:\n- 1994\n- 1995\n- 1996\n- 1997\n- 1998\n- 1999\n- 2000\n- 2001\n\nThe 2001 row has:\n- Year: 2001\n- Mens singles: radomir jovovi\u0107\n- Womens singles: jelena obri\u0107\n- Mens doubles: radomir jovovi\u0107 zoran stepanovi\u0107\n- Womens doubles: jelena obri\u0107 ana mari\u0107\n- Mixed doubles: bojan jakovljevi\u0107 jelena obri\u0107\n\nSo, the \"women's singles\" column for 2001 is indeed Jelena Obri\u0107.
