    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the november 16 score be i 123 - 126\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what exactly the claim is stating. It mentions a game that happened on November 16 with a specific score of \"i 123 - 126\". The term \"i\" here probably stands for \"the opponent\", as it's common in sports scores to denote the opponent's points after the 'i' or sometimes using an abbreviation like 'I' for Indoors.\n\nNow, I need to look through the table provided to find any game that occurred on November 16. Since the user didn't specify the exact row number, but given that November has multiple weeks, I'll assume each week is a row incrementing from 1 to n.\n\nLooking at the table's rows, the dates are listed for each game. Scanning through, I find:\n\nRow 10: November 20\nRow 11: November 21\nRow 12: November 24\nRow 13: November 27\nRow 14: November 28\nRow 15: November 30\n\nWait, I don't see a row for November 16. That's odd. Let me double-check the rows provided. The last game shown is on November 30 (row 15). So there's no game on November 16 listed here.\n\nThis means that according to the table, there isn't a game on November 16 with any score, let alone \"123 - 126\". Therefore, the claim must be false because such a game doesn't exist in the provided data.\n\nAdditionally, even if I consider that maybe November 16 is present but not shown (though unlikely as the user has listed up to row 15), the score provided doesn't match any of the existing games. For instance, on November 20 (row 10), the score was \"l 83 - 95\", which doesn't fit either.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently conclude that the claim is false because there's no evidence in the table of a game on November 16 with the stated score.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any row corresponds to November 16 and if the score matches \"i 123 - 126\". \n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: \n   - There is no row for November 16 in the table.\n\n2. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there's no game on November 16, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
