    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the given claim about a match is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"the match held on January 26, 2006, the result be 2 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim and identify which parts of it correspond to the data in the table. The key elements are the date of the match, the venue (location), the score, and the result.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with various details. The columns relevant here are 'date', 'score', and 'result'. \n\nStarting with the date: January 26, 2006. I'll scan through each row to find the matching date. Row by row:\n\n- Row 1: June 7, 2000 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: November 17, 2004 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n- Row 3: Same as row 2.\n- Row 4: Same as row 2.\n- Row 5: June 8, 2005 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n- Row 6: September 7, 2005 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n- Row 7: October 26, 2005 \u2013 Doesn't match.\n- Row 8: January 26, 2006 \u2013 This is the row we're interested in.\n\nSo, the relevant row index is 8. Now, let's check the score and result columns for this row.\n\nThe 'score' column for row 8 is \"2 - 1\". The claim mentions that the result should be \"2 - 1.\" \n\nLooking at the 'result' column of row 8: it says \"friendly.\" Hmm, the claim refers to the result as \"2 - 1,\" but in the table, the result is listed as \"friendly.\" This discrepancy suggests a possible mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me double-check the columns. The table has 'score' and 'result' as separate columns. So for row 8:\n\n- Score: 2 - 1\n- Result: friendly\n\nThe claim states that the match on January 26, 2006, had a result of 2 - 1. However, according to the table, the result is \"friendly,\" not \"2 - 1.\" The score is indeed 2 - 1, but the result isn't.\n\nSo, does the claim consider both the score and the result? The claim specifically mentions that the result should be 2 - 1, but in reality, it's classified as a friendly match. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data provided because the result doesn't align with what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the score. But the instruction says to check each condition against the table. Since the date matches and the score is 2 - 1, but the result is different, the claim as a whole might be considered FALSE because one of its conditions isn't met.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'result' in the table refers to the outcome of the match beyond the score. So if the result is friendly, it's not an official match result like a tournament or competition. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the result being 2 - 1 might be incorrect.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes 'result' can refer to the final scoreline, but in this context, the column might mean the type of match, like friendly or competitive. If that's the case, then the claim is incorrect because it states the result as 2 - 1 when it's actually a friendly match.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the relevant cells would be row 8 for both date and score, but since the result doesn't match, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
