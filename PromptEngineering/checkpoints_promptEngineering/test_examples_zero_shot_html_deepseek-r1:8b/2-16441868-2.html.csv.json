    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"srcd - 98004 be the catalog number for the issue title 1958 mile which be under the sony label in 2001.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and map it to the table columns.\n\n1. **Catalog Number**: The term is \"srcd - 98004\". In the table, there's a column named 'catalog', so that's relevant.\n\n2. **Issue Title**: The claim mentions \"1958 mile.\" Looking at the table, two columns mention variations of this title: \"1958 miles\" and \"'58 sessions featuring stella by starlight\". So both could be potential matches.\n\n3. **Label**: The label is mentioned as \"sony\" in the claim. Checking the table, there's a column named 'label', so that's relevant.\n\n4. **Year**: The year specified is 2001. In the table, the 'year' column has data from 1974 onwards, including 2001, so that's relevant.\n\nNow, I need to check each row to see if any match all these criteria.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n\n- Title: \"1958 miles\"\n- Year: 1974\n- Label: \"cbs / sony\"\n- Catalog: \"20ap 1401\" \u2013 Doesn't match srcd - 98004, so not relevant.\n\nSecond row:\n\n- Title: \"1958 miles\"\n- Year: 1979\n- Label: \"cbs records\"\n- Catalog: \"cbs 1401\" \u2013 Not matching, so move on.\n\nThird and fourth rows have \"'58 sessions...\" titles, which don't match \"1958 mile\", so skip these.\n\nFifth row:\n\n- Title: \"1958 miles\"\n- Year: 1991\n- Label: \"cbs\"\n- Catalog: \"cbs 467918 - 2\" \u2013 Not matching srcd - 98004.\n\nSixth row:\n\n- Title: \"1958 miles\"\n- Year: 1991\n- Label: \"cbs , sony records\"\n- Catalog: \"srcs - 9102\" \u2013 Doesn't match the given catalog number.\n\nSeventh row:\n\n- Title: \"'58 sessions...\"\n- So skip.\n\nEighth row:\n\n- Title: \"1958 miles\"\n- Year: 1997\n- Label: \"sony\"\n- Catalog: \"srcd - 65344\" \u2013 Not matching 98004.\n\nNinth row:\n\n- Title: \"1958 miles\"\n- Year: 2001\n- Label: \"sony\"\n- Catalog: \"srcd - 98004\"\n\nWait, this matches all the criteria! So in row 9 (row_index 8), 'catalog' is srcd - 98004, which is what the claim states. The title is \"1958 miles\" as specified, the year is 2001, and the label is sony.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might match just in case, but looking through all the rows, row 9 is the only one that meets all these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are from row 8 (since it's zero-indexed) for the 'catalog' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"catalog\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the name of the catalog title '1958 mile' on Sony after 2006 be 20ap 1401.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. **Catalog Title**: This refers to the 'catalog' column in the table.\n2. **Name**: It's referring to the title, which would correspond to the 'issued title' column.\n3. **Sony**: So the record label should be Sony or a variation like Sony Japan.\n4. **After 2006**: The year is specifically after 2006.\n5. **Catalog Number**: Should be 20ap 1401.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple entries with '1958 miles' as the issued title and various catalog numbers. But the claim specifically mentions \"1958 mile\" (singular), which might be a typo since in the table it's either \"1958 miles\" or variations like \"'58 sessions...\". So maybe that's already a clue that something doesn't match.\n\nNow, focusing on rows after 2006. The table shows entries from 1974 to 2006 and beyond, but let me check specifically for years after 2006. Scanning through the 'year' column:\n\n- The latest is 2006, so I need to look for any row with a year greater than 2006. Wait, the last entry in the table is 2006, so there are no rows beyond that. So actually, all relevant entries are up to and including 2006.\n\nNext, looking at Sony-related labels:\n\n- In rows where the 'label' column mentions \"Sony\" or \"Sony Japan\":\n  \n  - Rows with row_index 8: label is Sony.\n  - Row 9: Sony.\n  - Row 10: Sony.\n  - Row 11: Sony Japan.\n\nNow, checking for catalog numbers in these Sony-related rows:\n\n- Row 8: Catalog is srcd - 1204. Doesn't match 20ap 1401.\n- Row 9: srcd - 98004.\n- Row 10: srcd - 966.\n- Row 11: srcs - 966.\n\nNone of these catalog numbers are 20ap 1401. \n\nAlso, looking back at earlier entries, the only 'catalog' that's 20ap 1401 is in row 0, which has a label of CBS/Sony but the year is 1974. So that's before 2006.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where, after 2006, Sony has a catalog number of 20ap 1401 for '1958 miles'. The claim seems to mix up years and possibly the correct title, as in the table, it's \"1958 miles\" or variations, not just \"1958 mile\".\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [ {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"catalog\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"catalog\"} ]}",
