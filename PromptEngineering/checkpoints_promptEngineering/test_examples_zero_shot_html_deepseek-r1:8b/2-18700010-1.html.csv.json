    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Among the players in the df position, Dave Sutton has the most league goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The df position refers to defensive fullbacks. Among these players, I need to check how many league goals each has, specifically looking for Dave Sutton's total.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple players in the df (defensive fullback) position. Each player's data is listed with various statistics, including 'League Goals'. My task is to find all the df players and then compare their league goals to see if Dave Sutton indeed has the highest number.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row of the table for players whose Position is df. I go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first player in df position is Andy Rankin, but his 'League Goals' are 0.\n2. Next, Alan Starling is a gk, so not relevant here.\n3. Tommy Smith is a fw, not df, so skip.\n4. Brian Stanton is mf, not df.\n5. Dave Sutton is df. His league goals are 6.\n6. Chris Topping is df with 0 league goals.\n7. Fred Robinson is df with 1 goal.\n8. Other players like Tommy Smith and others are either fw or other positions, so they're out of the running.\n\nNow, I compare each df player's league goals:\n\n- Andy Rankin: 0\n- Dave Sutton: 6\n- Chris Topping: 0\n- Fred Robinson: 1\n\nLooking at these numbers, it seems that Dave Sutton has the highest number of league goals among df players listed. Therefore, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other df players with higher goals than Dave. The table lists several players, and from what I can see, Dave's 6 is the highest. No one else in df has more than that. So yes, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"}]}",

The claim is: \"the player with the highest number of league goal be ian robin.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which columns and rows are relevant. The key here is the 'league goal' column and the player in question, Ian Robins. So, I'll look for the 'League Goals' column and check each player's value against it.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different player. The 'League Goals' column is likely the one with header \"League Goals.\" I need to go through each row and find the player named Ian Robins and their corresponding league goals.\n\nI'll scan each row for the name \"Ian Robins.\" Once found, I'll note down the number in the 'League Goals' column. Then, I'll compare this number to see if it's higher than any other players' league goals.\n\nAfter identifying that Ian Robins has a certain number of league goals, I'll need to check if he indeed has the highest count among all players listed in the table. If no other player has a higher number, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nI should also note the row index where Ian Robins is located and which column specifically (i.e., 'League Goals') for the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"the player with the highest number of league goal be ian robin,\" we first identify the relevant columns and rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table. The claim says, \"the 2 player with the highest league apps be malcolm brown and peter hart.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what \"league apps\" refers to in this context. It likely means the number of times a player has appeared in the league matches, which is typically denoted by \"Apps\" or \"Appearances\" in football terminology.\n\nNext, I need to identify the two players mentioned: Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart. Looking through the table, I should find their respective \"League Apps\" values.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for these names. Let's go through the table row by row:\n\n1. The first player listed is Andy Rankin with 24 apps.\n2. Next, Alan Starling has 22 apps.\n3. Dave Sutton has 46 apps.\n4. Chris Topping with 13 apps.\n5. Then, there's Tommy Smith with 0 apps.\n6. Brian Stanton shows up next with 41 apps.\n7. Fred Robinson has 30 apps.\n8. Ian Robins is listed with 45 apps.\n9. John (assuming the name might be missing) with 51 apps.\n10. Alan Starling again, but already checked.\n11. Brian Stanton is also listed again, but same as before.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that some players have high numbers of apps. For example, Dave Sutton has 46, and Fred Robinson has 30, Ian Robins has 45, John (assuming it's a typo) with 51, which seems very high. However, the claim is about Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart.\n\nWait, I'm realizing that in the table provided, I don't see either Malcolm Brown or Peter Hart listed. That could mean there's a mistake or perhaps they were included elsewhere. Let me double-check the table rows again, maybe I missed them.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Alan Starling: 22 apps\n- Andy Rankin: 24 apps\n- Brian Stanton: 41 apps\n- Chris Topping:13 apps\n- Dave Sutton:46 apps\n- Fred Robinson:30 apps\n- Ian Robins:45 apps\n- Tommy Smith:0 apps\n\nI don't see Malcolm Brown or Peter Hart in this list. That's odd because the claim is about them being the top two. So, if they aren't present, then their league apps would be zero, which wouldn't make them the highest.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again. Maybe their names are in different columns or rows that I overlooked.\n\nLooking at the \"gk\" column: Alan Starling and Andy Rankin have higher numbers there, but that's for goalkeepers, so maybe not relevant to league apps.\n\nIn the \"df\" column: Dave Sutton has 46, Chris Topping 15, Fred Robinson 30, Brian Stanton 9.\n\nWait, I'm seeing that Dave Sutton is a defender with 46 apps. That's quite high. Also, Ian Robins has 45 apps as a forward. So perhaps they are the top two in terms of league apps, not Malcolm Brown or Peter Hart.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says that Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart are the top two, but neither is listed in the table, then the claim is incorrect. Alternatively, if there's a mistake in the table, but assuming it's accurate, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be those where the players with the highest league apps are identified. In this case, Dave Sutton has 46 and Ian Robins has 45, so their rows and \"League Apps\" column need to be checked.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"League Apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"League Apps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, my task is to check each player's \"Total Goal\" column and see if Ian Robin indeed has the highest number there.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify where Ian Robin is located.

The key is to find where Ian Robin is listed as a player.\n\nUpon scanning each row's Player column:\n\nI see that at row index 17, the player is \"Ian Robins\" (note the spelling: \"Robins\"). Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nAt row index 15: Ian Robins is listed as \"Ian Robins\". So his row index is 15. His total goals are 27 in the \"Total Goal\" column.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other player has a higher total goal than 27.\n\nGoing through each row's Total Goal column:\n\n- Andy Rankin: 0\n- Tommy Smith: 0\n- Alan Starling: 0\n- Dave Sutton: 7\n- Chris Topping: 0\n- Brian Stanton: 9\n- ...\nWait, I think the highest so far is Ian Robins with 27.

Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 22: Alan Starling? No, Row 12 is Alan Starling with total goals 0.\n\nWait, I think the highest total goal in the table is indeed 27 by Ian Robins. So his total goals are higher than others.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the player with the highest number of total goals be ian robin\" is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe player with the highest total goals is Ian Robins, who has 27 total goals.

The claim is: \"the only player that doesn't have 0 fa cup goal be peter hart.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's stating that Peter Hart is the sole player who does not have zero FA Cup goals. So, my task is to check each player's FA Cup goals and see if this statement holds.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with various stats, including \"fa cup goals.\" I'll need to go through each row and specifically look at that column.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Andy Rankin has 0 fa cup goals.\n2. Alan Starling also has 0.\n3. Dave Sutton has 0.\n4. Chris Topping has 0.\n5. Tommy Smith has 0.\n6. Brian Stanton has 0.\n7. Fred Robinson has 0.\n8. Brian Stanton again, same as above.\n9. Alan Starling again, same.\n10. Andy Rankin again, same.\n11. Peter Hart: Here's the key player. His fa cup goals are... let me check. Looking at his row, it says \"fa cup goals\" as 0? Wait, no, actually, looking closely, I think I might have misread. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, in the table provided, each column has a name and then various stats. For Peter Hart's row, I need to find which column is \"fa cup goals.\"\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify: The columns are labeled as per the headers, but in the table description, it just lists the data without explicitly naming all columns. But from the example given in the problem, when they refer to relevant cells, they use column names like \"Revenue\" and \"Employees.\" So perhaps each row has specific columns, one of which is \"fa cup goals.\"\n\nAssuming that, I need to find for each player whether their \"fa cup goals\" are zero or not.\n\nWait, but the claim says Peter Hart doesn't have 0 fa cup goals. That means his fa cup goals should be non-zero, i.e., at least 1.\n\nSo, going through each row:\n\nLooking for players with FA Cup Goals !=0.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\n- Andy Rankin: 0\n- Alan Starling: 0\n- Dave Sutton: 0\n- Chris Topping: 0\n- Tommy Smith: 0\n- Brian Stanton: 0\n- Fred Robinson: 0\n- Peter Hart: Let's see, I think his FA Cup goals are 2. Wait, looking back at the table:\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided earlier, I need to check each player's \"fa cup goals.\"\n\nLooking again, for example:\n\nRow 13 (assuming indexing starts at 0): Alan Starling has fa cup goals as 0.\n\nBut wait, let me get the exact counts. It might be time-consuming, but necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for players who have FA Cup Goals >0 and see if only Peter Hart is among them.\n\nWait, in the table:\n\n- Brian St Stanton: fa cup goals 0\n- Alan Starling: 0\n- Fred Robinson: 2? Or wait, looking at row 20 (assuming 0-based), Fred Robinson has fa cup goals 1. Wait, no, let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure this more methodically. Let's list each player and their FA Cup Goals:\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: Andy Rankin - 0\n\nRow 1: Alan Starling - 2 (wait, in row 1 it says \"fa cup goals\" as 2?)\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting rows. Let me list each player and their FA Cup Goals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is too large to handle manually, but given that the user provided a JSON example, maybe I can find a pattern or count the relevant cells.\n\nBut wait, for the claim: \"the only player that doesn't have 0 fa cup goal be peter hart.\" So, Peter Hart should be the only one with FA Cup Goals >0. Therefore, all other players should have FA Cup Goals =0, and Peter is the only one with !=0.\n\nSo I need to check if every other player in the table has 0 FA Cup Goals, except Peter Hart.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Andy Rankin: 0\n- Alan Starling: 0\n- Dave Sutton: 0\n- Chris Topping: 0\n- Tommy Smith: 0\n- Brian Stanton: 0\n- Fred Robinson: Let me check his row. Fred Robinson's fa cup goals are... looking at the table, in row 20 (assuming 0-based), Fred Robinson has \"fa cup goals\" as 1.\n\nWait, so Fred Robinson has FA Cup Goals =1, which is >0. That already contradicts the claim because Peter Hart isn't the only one without zero FA Cup Goals; Fred Robinson also has non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the statement in the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for each player's FA Cup Goals:\n\n1. Andy Rankin: 0\n\n2. Alan Starling: 2 (Wait, row 1 shows Alan Starling with \"fa cup goals\" as 2.)\n\n3. Dave Sutton: 0\n\n4. Chris Topping: 0\n\n5. Tommy Smith: 0\n\n6. Brian Stanton: 0\n\n7. Fred Robinson: Let's see, in his row, \"fa cup goals\" is 1.\n\n8. Brian Stanton again: 0\n\n9. Alan Starling again:2\n\n10. Andy Rankin again:0\n\n11. Peter Hart: His FA Cup Goals are... looking at his row, it says \"fa cup goals\" as 2.\n\nWait, so both Alan Starling and Peter Hart have FA Cup Goals =2. So that's two players with non-zero FA Cup Goals.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because there are multiple players (Alan and Peter) who don't have zero FA Cup Goals. Therefore, the initial assumption that only Peter Hart doesn't have zero is wrong.\n\nSo, to find relevant cells:\n\n- For each player, check if their \"fa cup goals\" column has value >0.\n\nThe relevant cells would be those where \"fa cup goals\" !=0.\n\nIn this case, Alan Starling (row 1), Peter Hart (row 10 or wherever he is), and Fred Robinson (row 20) have FA Cup Goals !=0.\n\nTherefore, the claim that only Peter Hart doesn't have zero FA Cup Goals is false because Alan and Fred also don't.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are more than just Peter Hart's. Therefore, the JSON response should list all players with non-zero FA Cup Goals, not just Peter Hart.\n\nSo, in terms of the problem statement, when it says \"the only player that doesn't have 0 fa cup goals be peter hart,\" this is incorrect because there are others.\n\nTherefore, in the thought process, I need to identify that the claim is false and then provide the relevant cells accordingly.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying a claim about a specific player's statistic. After examining each player's FA Cup Goals, it becomes clear that Peter Hart is not the sole player without zero goals; others also have non-zero statistics.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe statement that Peter Hart is the only player without zero FA Cup goals is incorrect. Several players, including Alan Starling and Fred Robinson, also have non-zero FA Cup Goals. Therefore, the relevant cells include all players with FA Cup Goals greater than zero.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"player\": \"Alan Starling\",\n    \"fa cup goals\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"player\": \"Fred Robinson\",\n    \"fa cup goals\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"player\": \"Peter Hart\",\n    \"fa cup goals\": 2\n  }\n]\n```",

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, in the table provided, it's a single table with 14 rows, each row being a player.\n\nSo, players and their league apps:\n\n1. Alan Starling -22\n2. Andy Rankin -24\n3. Brian Stanton -41\n4. Chris Topping -13\n5. Dave Sutton -46\n6. Fred Robinson -30\n7. Ian Robins -45\n8. Tommy Smith -0\n9. Brian Stanton (is this the same as row 3? No, each player is unique.)\nWait, no. Each player is listed once in the table.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct:\n\nLooking at the table again, it's 14 rows, each with one player.\n\nSo players and their 'League Apps':\n\nRow 0: Alan Starling -22\nRow1: Andy Rankin -24\nRow2: Brian Stanton -41\nRow3: Chris Topping -13\nRow4: Dave Sutton -46\nRow5: Fred Robinson -30\nRow6: Ian Robins -45\nRow7: Tommy Smith -0\nRow8: Brian Stanton (this is the same as row2? Or another player?) No, each row is unique. So perhaps it's a different Brian Stanton, but that would mean two players with the same name, which isn't likely. Maybe I misread the rows.\n\nWait, no, in the table provided, after 'Dave Sutton' comes 'Fred Robinson', then 'Ian Robins', then Tommy Smith, and so on.\n\nSo each player is unique. Therefore:\n\nPlayers with their 'League Apps':\n\n- Alan Starling:22\n- Andy Rankin:24\n- Brian Stanton:41\n- Chris Topping:13\n- Dave Sutton:46\n- Fred Robinson:30\n- Ian Robins:45\n- Tommy Smith:0\n\nWait, that's 8 players. But the table has 14 rows. Wait, no, perhaps I missed some.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe table provided by the user seems to have more than 8 rows. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the initial data given in the problem statement, the table is as follows (partial):\n\nLine 1: Alan Starling | 22\nLine2: Andy Rankin |24\nLine3: Brian Stanton|41\nLine4: Chris Topping|13\nLine5: Dave Sutton|46\nLine6: Fred Robinson|30\nLine7: Ian Robins|45\nLine8: Tommy Smith|0\nLine9: Brian Stanton| same as line3? Or another player?\n\nWait, perhaps the table has more players. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each row after 'Tommy Smith' is another player with their stats.\n\nBut without the exact table, it's a bit difficult. However, from the problem statement, we can focus on Chris Topping and Dave Sutton.\n\nAssuming that Dave Sutton has 46 league apps, which is higher than others except maybe Brian Stanton (41) or Ian Robins (45). So let me check:\n\nFrom the data I have so far:\n- Dave Sutton:46\n- Ian Robins:45\n- Brian Stanton:41\n\nSo Dave's 46 is higher than both.\n\nTherefore, if Chris Topping has 13 and Dave Sutton has 46, their league apps are not the highest. The highest is Dave Sutton with 46, followed by Ian Robins with 45, then Brian Stanton with 41.\n\nThus, neither Chris nor Dave have the highest number of league apps. Therefore, it's incorrect to say that either of them has the most league apps; instead, Dave Sutton leads.\n\nSo the conclusion is that Dave Sutton has the highest 'league apps' count among all players listed.\n</think>\n\nNeither Chris Topping nor Dave Sutton has the highest number of 'League Apps'. Instead, Dave Sutton holds the top position with 46 League Apps. \n\n**Answer:** Neither Chris Topping nor Dave Sutton has the highest number of league apps; Dave Sutton is the leader with 46.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my decision. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"there be 2 player with the highest number of total goal ian robin and chris topping.\" So, the claim is suggesting that there are two players who have the highest total goals, specifically mentioning Ian Robins and Chris Topping. Wait, no\u2014actually, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"there be 2 player with the highest number of total goal ian robin and chris topping.\" So, they're saying that there are two players who have the highest total goals, and those two are Ian Robins and Chris Topping. Hmm, but looking at the table, I need to check if both of these players indeed have the same highest total goals.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim might be stating that there are two players with the highest total goals, and one of them is Ian Robins, while the other is Chris Topping. So I need to find their total goal counts from the table.\n\nLet me go through each row in the table to locate Ian Robins and Chris Topping.\n\nLooking for Ian Robins: Scanning the table, I see him in row 10, which lists his stats as:\n\n- Position: fw\n- Total goals: 27\n\nThen, looking for Chris Topping: He's in row 20. His stats are:\n\n- Position: df\n- Total goals: 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says he has a high total goal count. Let me double-check.\n\nRow 20 is Fred Robinson, not Chris Topping. Wait, maybe I misread the names. Let me look again.\n\nNo, row 20 is Fred Robinson with 1 goal. Then, further down, row 22 is Alan Starling, and so on. Oh, wait\u2014Chris Topping's row is at the very end? Let me count:\n\nRows go from 0 to 28. Row 18 is Brian Stanton, row 19 is Alan Starling, row 20 is Dave Sutton, row 21 is Chris Topping.\n\nYes, there we go. Chris Topping is in row 21. His total goals are 0. So he has 0 goals.\n\nWait, that seems off because the claim says both have high totals. But according to the table, Ian Robins has 27 goals, and Chris Topping has 0. That doesn't align with the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the names. Let me check again for Chris Topping. Row 21 is indeed Chris Topping with total goals 0.\n\nSo if the claim says both have high total goals, but according to the table, only Ian Robins has a high total goal count (27), while Chris Topping has 0, which is not high at all.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because Chris Topping doesn't have a high number of total goals. Instead, he has none.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's saying that there are two players with the highest total goals, and one of them is Ian Robins, while the other might not necessarily be Chris Topping but another player. But the way the claim is phrased, it specifically mentions \"ian robin and chris topping\" as the two players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the names. Let me check again for both players.\n\nIan Robins: Yes, row 10 has 27 goals.\n\nChris Topping: Row 21, total goals 0.\n\nSo that doesn't make sense. Therefore, the claim is false because Chris Topping does not have a high number of total goals; he has zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check the column headers to ensure I'm looking at the correct data.\n\nThe table's first row (header) shows columns like Position, Total Goals, etc. So yes, \"Total Goals\" is correct.\n\nTherefore, since Chris Topping has 0 goals and Ian Robins has 27, they cannot both have the highest number of total goals unless there's another player with 27 or more. Let me check if any other players have higher than 27.\n\nLooking at the table, Alan Starling (row 19) has 0, Dave Sutton (row 20) has 7, Chris Topping (row21) 0, Brian Stanton (row18) 9, Tommy Smith (row17) 0, Fred Robinson (row16) 1, Ian Robins (row10) 27. So no one else has more than 27.\n\nThus, only Ian Robins is at the top with 27 goals, while Chris Topping is at the bottom with 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both have the highest total goals is incorrect because Chris Topping does not. Hence, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: The user wants to know which cells are relevant. So for each player mentioned, I need to identify their position and total goals in the table.\n\nFor Ian Robins:\n\nHe's in row 10 (assuming rows start at 0), so index 10, columns: Position= 'fw', Total Goals=27.\n\nSo the cell is row 10, column 'Total Goals'.\n\nSimilarly, Chris Topping is in row21, same as above.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 10, 'Total Goals' for Ian Robins\n- Row21, 'Total Goals' for Chris Topping\n\nTherefore, these two cells show their total goals, which are 27 and 0 respectively.\n\nSo the final answer is that the claim is false because while Ian Robins has a high total of 27, Chris Topping has only 0. The relevant cells are where each player's total goals are recorded.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because while Ian Robins has the highest total goals with 27, Chris Topping has 0. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Players in the Claim:** The claim mentions two players: Ian Robins and Chris Topping.\n2. **Locate Their Data in the Table:** \n   - Ian Robins is found in row 10 with a total of 27 goals.\n   - Chris Topping is located in row21, but he has only 0 goals.\n3. **Analyze Their Goal Counts:** Since Chris Topping does not have a high goal count (0), the claim that both have the highest is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row10, 'Total Goals' for Ian Robins\n- Row21, 'Total Goals' for Chris Topping\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 other players apart from peter hart have fa cup goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions that there are two other players, besides Peter Hart, who have FA Cup goals. So I need to look into the table for any players with FA Cup goals and count how many such players exist apart from Peter Hart.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player, and the columns include various statistics. The specific column we're interested in is \"FA Cup Goals.\" So I'll go through each row and check the value under this column.\n\nStarting from the top, I see that most of the players have zero FA Cup goals. For example, Alan Starling has 0, Andy Rankin has 0, Brian Stanton has 0, Chris Topping has 0, Dave Sutton has 0, Fred Robinson has 0, Ian Robins has 2, but wait\u2014that's for another column. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct one.\n\nWait, the FA Cup Goals column\u2014let me confirm. Yes, that's correct. So each player's FA Cup Goals count is in that specific column. Now, I'll list out all players with non-zero FA Cup Goals:\n\n1. Ian Robins has 2 FA Cup Goals.\n2. Alan Starling has 0\u2014no.\n3. Andy Rankin has 0.\n4. Brian Stanton has 0.\n5. Chris Topping has 0.\n6. Dave Sutton has 0.\n7. Fred Robinson has 0.\n8. Ian Robins has 2 as mentioned.\n9. Peter Hart's FA Cup Goals\u2014I need to check, but the claim is about others besides him.\n\nWait, looking at the table, I can't find any other players with non-zero FA Cup Goals except Ian Robins and maybe Alan Starling? Wait no, Alan Starling has 0 in FA Cup Goals. Let me recheck each row:\n\n- Row 0: Andy Rankin - 0\n- Row 1: Alan Starling - 2 (FA Cup Goals)\nWait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table shows \"FA Cup Goals\" as a column. So I need to go through each row:\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\nEach player has entries like:\n\n- Andy Rankin: 24 (probably appearances), 0 (goals), etc.\n- Alan Starling: 22, 0, 2 (that's in the FA Cup Goals? Or is that another column?\n\nWait, no. The columns are \"FA Cup Goals\" and others. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are as follows:\n\n- Player\n- Position\n- App\n- Goals\n- Y_Card\n- Y_Red\n- FA Cup Goals\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the columns earlier. Let me check again: The FA Cup Goals column is separate from regular goals.\n\nSo for each player, their FA Cup Goals are listed as a specific column. Now, let's go through each row:\n\n1. Andy Rankin - 0 (FA Cup Goals)\n2. Alan Starling - 0\n3. Brian Stanton - 0\n4. Chris Topping - 0\n5. Dave Sutton - 0\n6. Fred Robinson - 0\n7. Ian Robins - 2\n8. Tommy Smith - 0\n9. Brian Stanton - 0 (duplicate, maybe)\n10. Alan Starling - 0\n11. Andy Rankin - 0\n12. Ian Robins - 2\n13. Peter Hart - 0 (since his FA Cup Goals are likely zero unless specified otherwise)\n\nWait, but looking at the table provided by the user, let me check each row:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Andy Rankin has FA Cup Goals = 0\n- Row 1: Alan Starling FA Cup = 0 (from the data: 2 in another column, maybe)\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up columns. Let me look at the specific FA Cup Goals for each player.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nEach row has various stats, and one of them is \"FA Cup Goals.\"\n\nSo let's list them all:\n\n- Andy Rankin - 0\n- Alan Starling - 0 (since his FA Cup Goals are 0)\n- Brian Stanton - 0\n- Chris Topping - 0\n- Dave Sutton - 0\n- Fred Robinson - 0\n- Ian Robins - 2\n- Tommy Smith - 0\n- Brian Stanton - 0 (duplicate, maybe a different player?)\nWait, no, each row is a different player. So, looking at the table:\n\nThe rows are:\n\n1. Andy Rankin: FA Cup Goals = 0\n2. Alan Starling: FA Cup Goals = 0\n3. Brian Stanton: 0\n4. Chris Topping: 0\n5. Dave Sutton: 0\n6. Fred Robinson: 0\n7. Ian Robins: 2\n8. Tommy Smith: 0\n9. Brian Stanton (maybe a different person, but FA Cup =0)\n10. Alan Starling (again, same as row 2? Maybe it's a typo in the table)\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me parse the data correctly.\n\nLooking at the table provided by the user:\n\nEach player has columns like Player, Position, App, Goals, Y_Card, Y_Red, FA Cup Goals, etc.\n\nNow, let's list each player and their FA Cup Goals count from the table:\n\n1. Andy Rankin - 0\n2. Alan Starling - 0 (from his row)\n3. Brian Stanton - 0\n4. Chris Topping - 0\n5. Dave Sutton - 0\n6. Fred Robinson - 0\n7. Ian Robins - 2\n8. Tommy Smith - 0\n9. Peter Hart - 0 (assuming since it's about others)\n10. Alan Starling again? Or is that a different player?\nWait, perhaps the table has some duplicates or I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only Ian Robins has FA Cup Goals of 2, and everyone else, including Peter Hart, has zero.\n\nSo total players with FA Cup Goals: only Ian Robins with 2. So besides Peter Hart (assuming he has none), there is only one other player with FA Cup Goals.\n\nThus, the claim says that there are two others besides Peter Hart who have FA Cup Goals. But according to this, only Ian Robins has them, so it's not correct. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nWait, but I might be miscounting because perhaps Alan Starling or another player also has non-zero.\n\nLooking again at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Andy Rankin - 0\n- Row 1: Alan Starling - FA Cup Goals = 0 (from his stats)\n- Row 2: Brian Stanton - 0\n- Row 3: Chris Topping - 0\n- Row 4: Dave Sutton - 0\n- Row 5: Fred Robinson - 0\n- Row 6: Ian Robins - FA Cup Goals = 2 (from his stats)\n- Row 7: Tommy Smith - 0\n- Row 8: Brian Stanton - 0\n- Row 9: Alan Starling - 0\nWait, that can't be right because each player should have their own row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured differently. Maybe I'm confusing the columns.\n\nLooking at the exact data provided by the user:\n\nThe table has headers like Player, Position, App, Goals, Y_Card, Y_Red, FA Cup Goals, etc.\n\nEach row's FA Cup Goals are as follows (from the data):\n\nRow 1: Andy Rankin - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRow 2: Alan Starling - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRow 3: Brian Stanton - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRow 4: Chris Topping - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRow 5: Dave Sutton - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRow 6: Fred Robinson - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRow 7: Ian Robins - FA Cup Goals = 2 (from the data)\n\nRow 8: Tommy Smith - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRow 9: Peter Hart - FA Cup Goals = 0\n\nRows 10 onwards? No, that's all.\n\nSo in total, only Ian Robins has FA Cup Goals of 2. Therefore, besides Peter Hart (who has 0), there is only one other player with FA Cup Goals.\n\nThus, the statement that \"there are two others\" is incorrect. It should be one person, not two.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing some players. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through each row, only Ian Robins has non-zero FA Cup Goals (2). The rest have 0. So total of only one player besides Peter Hart? Or maybe the count includes Peter Hart as part of \"others.\"\n\nWait, no. The claim is about two others besides Peter Hart.\n\nTherefore, since only one other player (Ian Robins) has FA Cup Goals, the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the data and Alan Starling or another player also have non-zero.\n\nLooking again:\n\nEach row's FA Cup Goals:\n\n- Andy Rankin: 0\n\n- Alan Starling: 0\n\n- Brian Stanton: 0\n\n- Chris Topping: 0\n\n- Dave Sutton: 0\n\n- Fred Robinson: 0\n\n- Ian Robins: 2\n\n- Tommy Smith: 0\n\n- Peter Hart: 0 (assuming)\n\nTherefore, only one player besides Peter Hart has FA Cup Goals. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nThus, the task was to evaluate whether the statement \"There are two others\" is correct, and after analysis, it's not; only one other person has FA Cup Goals.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that there are two others (besides Peter Hart) who have participated in FA Cup games. However, upon reviewing the data, only Ian Robins has a non-zero count of FA Cup participations with 2 appearances. Therefore, the original claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is false. Only one other person (Ian Robins) has participated in the FA Cup besides Peter Hart.",
