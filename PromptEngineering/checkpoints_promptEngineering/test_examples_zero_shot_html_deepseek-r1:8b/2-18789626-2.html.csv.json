    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the Mavericks are the only team that joined after 1970. So I need to look for any teams that joined after 1970 and check if they are only the Mavericks.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with details like their name, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. The \"year joined\" column is crucial here because we're interested in when each team joined, specifically after 1970.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the \"year joined\" for each team. \n\n1. **Sheridan** - Joined in 1948, which is before 1970.\n2. **Southwestern** - 1958, also before.\n3. **Western** - 1958, same as above.\n4. **Carroll** - 1961, still pre-1970.\n5. **Clinton Prairie** - 1961, again before.\n6. **Central Catholic** - 1970, exactly at the year mentioned.\n7. **Harrison (west lafayette)** - 1970, same as above.\n8. **Mccutcheon** - 1975, which is after 1970.\n\nWait, so McCutcheon joined in 1975, which is after 1970. That's another team besides the Mavericks who joined post-1970. \n\nNow, checking for Mavericks: They are listed under \"mavericks\" as the team name in row McCutcheon (row index 8). Their year joined is 1975, so they did join after 1970.\n\nSo, there's at least one more team besides Mavericks that joined after 1970. Specifically, McCutcheon joined in 1975. That means the claim is incorrect because it says Mavericks are the only ones to join after 1970, but McCutcheon also did.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"year joined\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the rossville school leaving the conference 30 years after joining is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join.\" So, I think it's saying that rossville joined a conference and then left it 30 years later. My task is to verify if this is true using the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should find the row in the table where the school name is \"rossville\". Scanning through the rows, I see there's one with \"rossville\" as the school name. Let me look at that row more closely.\n\nIn that row, under the \"team name\" column, it says \"hornets.\" The \"year joined\" is 1947 and \"year left\" is 1977. So rossville joined in 1947 and left in 1977. Now, I need to check if they left exactly 30 years after joining.\n\nCalculating the difference between 1977 and 1947 gives me 30 years. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on this row.\n\nWait a second, but sometimes schools might join multiple conferences or have different timeline events. However, in this table, each school is listed once, so it's likely referring to their participation in one specific conference. So if they joined in 1947 and left in 1977, that's exactly 30 years later.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells. The \"year joined\" and \"year left\" columns for rossville are directly related to the claim, so those two cells (row index 5, column names year joined and year left) are definitely relevant.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is true because rossville did leave the conference exactly 30 years after joining. Therefore, I'll mark the answer as TRUE and note the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join,\" we need to check the relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Rossville**: The row corresponding to \"rossville\" is found at index 5.\n2. **Check Join and Leave Years**: According to the table, rossville joined in 1947 and left in 1977.\n3. **Calculate the Duration**: The difference between 1977 and 1947 is exactly 30 years.\n\n**Verification Conclusion**: The claim holds true as supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year left\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim to verify: \"the team from the city of attica leave before the team from the city of west lafayette join.\" I need to check if this is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table. The claim mentions two cities: Attica and West Lafayette. So, I'll look for rows where the 'city' column matches these names.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row with \"attica\" as the school name and city, so that's one relevant part. Now, for West Lafayette, I need to find if it exists in any row. Scanning through the 'city' column, I see rows like \"lafayette\", but not \"west lafayette\". Wait, there is a row with \"harrison (west lafayette)\" as the school and city. So that's another relevant part.\n\nNext, I need to find out when each team left and joined. For Attica, in the 'year left' column, it says 1966. That means they left in 1966. Now, for West Lafayette (harrison), I look at their joining year. The row shows \"1970\" as the year joined.\n\nThe claim states that Attica's team leaves before West Lafayette joins. So, Attica left in 1966 and West Lafayette joined in 1970. Since 1966 is before 1970, this seems to be true. \n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other teams from West Lafayette or Attica that might affect this. However, in the table, only one team each from these cities are present. So, no conflicting information here.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds because Attica's departure in 1966 indeed precedes West Lafayette's joining in 1970.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the relevant rows for the city of Attica and West Lafayette (harrison).\n\n- **Attica** left in 1966 (year_left).\n- **West Lafayette** joined in 1970 (year_joined).\n\nSince 1966 is before 1970, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year_left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year_joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the hornet be not the only team from 12 clinton county\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. First, I should break down the claim and figure out what it's asserting.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the hornet\" as a team. Looking at the table, I see that in row 4 (since it starts counting from 0), the team name is \"hornets\". So, \"the hornet\" refers to this team. The claim says that this team is not the only one from \"12 clinton county\".\n\nNext, I need to find out if there are other teams associated with \"12 clinton county\". From the table, I'll look at the 'county' column for rows where the county is listed as \"12 clinton\" or similar. \n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 4: county is \"12 clinton\", team name \"hornets\".\n- Row 8 (carroll): county is \"08 carroll\", not relevant.\n- Row 10: county is \"79 tippecanoe\".\n- Row 11: county is \"79 tippecanoe\".\n- Row 12: county is \"79 tippecanoe\".\n- Row 13: county is \"79 tippecanoe\".\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the table has several entries. For example:\n- Row 4 (index 4) is rossville with county \"12 clinton\" and team name \"hornets\".\n- Then later, there's a row for Clinton Prairie (row 10, index 10) with county \"12 clinton\", but that's under the 'county' column. Wait no, looking at row 10: school is \"clinton prairie\", city \"frankfort\", county \"12 clinton\". So that's another team from 12 Clinton County.\n\nSo, there are two teams associated with \"12 clinton\" county:\n1. hornets (rossville) - row 4\n2. gophers (clinton prairie) - row 10\n\nTherefore, the claim states that the Hornets are not the only team from 12 Clinton County, which is TRUE because there's at least another team, the Gophers.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells for this verification. The relevant columns would be 'team name' and 'county', specifically for rows where county is \"12 clinton\".\n\nSo, row 4 (school: rossville) has team name \"hornets\" and county \"12 clinton\".\nRow 10 (school: clinton prairie) has team name \"gophers\" and county \"12 clinton\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- For rossville (row 4), both 'team name' and 'county'.\n- For clinton prairie (row 10), both 'team name' and 'county'.\n\nSo, in terms of row indices and column names:\n\nRow 4: columns \"team name\" and \"county\".\nRow 10: same.\n\nI should structure this as a list of objects with \"row_index\" (starting from 0) and \"column_name\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"team name\"}\n- {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"county\"}\n- {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"team name\"}\n- {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"county\"}\n\nThat's four cells in total.\n\nPutting it all together, the claim is TRUE because there are multiple teams from 12 Clinton County.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking that both the Hornets and Gophers represent different teams from 12 Clinton County.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the school of rossville and clinton prairie leave 3 year apart.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which schools these refer to in the table. Looking at the table, there are two rows that catch my eye: one for Rossville and another for Clinton Prairie. \n\nFor Rossville, the row is:\n- School: rossville\n- City: rossville\n- Team Name: hornets\n- County: 12 clinton\n- Year Joined: 1947\n- Year Left: 1977\n\nFor Clinton Prairie, the row is:\n- School: clinton prairie\n- City: frankfort\n- Team Name: gophers\n- County: 12 clinton\n- Year Joined: 1961\n- Year Left: 1974\n\nNow, I need to check how many years each school stayed. For Rossville, they joined in 1947 and left in 1977. To find the duration, subtract 1947 from 1977: 1977 - 1947 = 30 years.\n\nFor Clinton Prairie, they joined in 1961 and left in 1974. Calculating their stay: 1974 - 1961 = 13 years.\n\nThe claim says both schools leave \"3 year apart.\" That would mean the difference between their departure years should be 3. Let's check:\n\nRossville left in 1977, and Clinton Prairie left in 1974. The difference is 1977 - 1974 = 3 years apart. \n\nWait, but that's about the difference between when they left, not their total duration of stay. The original claim might be referring to how long each stayed before leaving. Rossville stayed for 30 years, Clinton Prairie for 13. Those aren't both 3-year stays. However, looking at their departure years, it is a 3-year gap.\n\nSo the claim says both schools leave 3 years apart, which aligns with their departure years differing by 3.

Let's break down the claim: \"rossville school in rossville join the conference in 1958 and leave 10 year later.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate rossville in the table. Looking through each row, I see that there's a row with the school name \"rossville.\" That's the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, the claim says they joined the conference in 1958. So I need to check the \"year joined\" column for rossville. In the table, under \"year joined,\" it shows \"1947\" and then later \"1961.\" Wait, that doesn't match 1958. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the row for rossville has \"team name\" as hornets and \"year joined\" as 1947. So according to the table, they joined in 1947, not 1958. That's conflicting with the claim. \n\nThen there's a part about leaving 10 years later. The \"year left\" for rossville is listed as 1977. If they joined in 1947, 10 years later would be 1957, but that doesn't align with the table since they actually left in 1977.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says they joined in 1958 and leave 10 years later, which would be 1968. But looking at the table, rossville's \"year left\" is 1977. So even if their joining year was 1947, leaving in 1977 doesn't match a 10-year period from 1958 either.\n\nHold on, perhaps I should check other rows to see if any mention of rossville has different years. Wait, no, the table seems to have only one row for rossville with \"year joined\" as 1947 and \"year left\" as 1977. So that's a span of 30 years, not 10.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't align with the table data.

Not relevant.\n- Rows up to maybe 5 or 6 don't mention Clinton or Carroll counties in their 'county' column.\n\nLooking for rows where county is either \"12 clinton\" or \"carroll.\"\n\nRow 7: school is \"carroll,\" city is \"flora.\" So, this is from Carroll County. The year joined is 1961 and left in 1977.\n\nRow 8: Clinton Prairie, Frankfort. The county is \"12 clinton,\" so that's one team from Clinton County. Joined in 1961, left in 1974.\n\nRow 9: Central Catholic, Lafayette. County is \"79 tippecanoe.\" Not relevant.\nRow 10: Harrison (west lafayette). Also tippecanoe county. Not relevant.\nRow 11: McCutcheon. Tippecanoe again. Not relevant.\n\nSo now, I see that in Clinton County, there's at least one team: Clinton Prairie. But wait, are there more? Let me check the rest of the table.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- Row 5 is Rossville, with county \"12 clinton.\" Wait, no, row 5 is Rossville, county \"12 clinton\"? No, let's see. The counties in the 'county' column are as follows:\n\nWait, I think I might have confused some rows. Let me list them all properly.\n\nLooking at each row's 'county' column:\n\n- Row 0: 23 fountain\n- Row 1: 08 carroll\n- Row 2: 08 carroll\n- Row 3: 37 jasper\n- Row 4: 12 clinton\n- Row 5: 66 pulaski\n- Row 6: 29 hamilton\n- Row 7: 08 carroll (carroll school)\n- Row 8: 12 clinton (Clinton Prairie)\n- Row 9: 79 tippecanoe\n- Row 10: 79 tippecanoe\n- Row 11: 79 tippecanoe\n- Row 12: 34 howard\n- Row 13: 08 carroll (carroll)\n- Row 14: 12 clinton (Clinton Prairie again? Wait, no. Row 8 is Clinton Prairie, Frankfort, with county 12 clinton. Then row 14 is Clinton Prairie again? No, row 14 is Clinton Prairie? Wait, no, row 14 is \"clinton prairie\" and city \"frankfort.\" So that's the same as row 8?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the rows properly with their counties:\n\n1. attica - 23 fountain\n2. delphi community - 08 carroll\n3. flora - 08 carroll\n4. rensselaer central - 37 jasper\n5. rossville - 12 clinton\n6. winamac - 66 pulaski\n7. sheridan - 29 hamilton\n8. southwestern - 79 tippecanoe\n9. western - 34 howard\n10. carroll - 08 carroll\n11. clinton prairie - 12 clinton\n12. central catholic - 79 tippecanoe\n13. harrison (west lafayette) - 79 tippecanoe\n14. mccutcheon - 79 tippecanoe\n\nWait, so in row 5: rossville has county 12 clinton? Or is it 12 clinton for another team?\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nRow 0: attica - 23 fountain\nRow1: delphi community - 08 carroll\nRow2: flora - 08 carroll\nRow3: rensselaer central - 37 jasper\nRow4: rossville - 12 clinton (yes, that's one team from Clinton)\nRow5: winamac -66 pulaski\nRow6: sheridan -29 hamilton\nRow7: southwestern -79 tippecanoe\nRow8: western -34 howard\nRow9: carroll -08 carroll\nRow10: clinton prairie -12 clinton (another team from Clinton)\nRow11: central catholic -79 tippecanoe\nRow12: harrison west lafayette -79 tippecanoe\nRow13: mccutcheon -79 tippecanoe\n\nWait, so rows 4 and 10 have 'county' as 12 clinton. So that's two teams from Clinton County.\n\nThen, looking for Carroll County:\n\nRows where county is \"carroll\" or \"08 carroll.\" Let me see:\n\nRow1: delphi community -08 carroll\nRow2: flora -08 carroll\nRow9: carroll -08 carroll\n\nSo that's three teams from Carroll County. Wait, but the claim says only 1 team from each county joined.\n\nBut according to the table, Clinton has at least two teams (rows4 and10), and Carroll has three teams (row1, row2, row9). So the claim is false because there are more than one team from both counties.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"only 1 team from 12 clinton county and 1 team from carroll county join.\" So if in reality there are two from Clinton and three from Carroll, then the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check row10: \"clinton prairie\" with county 12 clinton. That's another team from Clinton, making it at least two.\n\nSo for the claim to be true, only one team each should be present in both counties. But according to the table, there are more than that. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the county is either \"12 clinton\" or \"carroll.\" From the table, there are multiple teams from both counties, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"winamac join 10 year after southwestern join\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern did. So, I should look for the joining years of both winamac and southwestern from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with details like their name, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. I need to find the 'year joined' column for both winamac and southwestern.\n\nStarting with winamac: Scanning through the rows, I see that winamac is listed in the 6th row (row index 6) of the table. The 'year joined' for winamac is 1947 according to the data.\n\nNow, looking for southwestern: Southwestern appears further down the table, specifically in the 8th row (row index 8). Its 'year joined' is listed as 1958.\n\nTo check the time difference between when southwestern joined and when winamac joined, I subtract the joining year of southwestern from that of winamac. So, 1947 (winamac's join year) minus 1958 (southwestern's join year) would give a negative number, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of years after.\n\nWait, maybe I should reverse it. The claim says winamac joined 10 years after southwestern. So, the correct calculation should be southwestern's joining year plus 10 years to see if it equals winamac's joining year. Let me add 10 years to southwestern's 1958: 1958 + 10 = 1968. But winamac joined in 1947, which is way before 1968. That doesn't fit either.\n\nHold on, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Maybe it's saying that the time between when winamac joined and when southwestern joined is 10 years? Let me recalculate. Southwestern joined in 1958, winamac in 1947. The difference is 1947 to 1958, which is 11 years apart (from 1947 to 1958 is 11 years later). That's not exactly 10 years either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me check again: If winamac joined in 1947 and southwestern in 1958, then from 1947 to 1958 is 11 years after. So, if the claim says that winamac joined 10 years after southwestern, that wouldn't be accurate because it's actually 11 years later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misinterpreted by me. Maybe I should look at when each team left or something else, but the claim specifically mentions joining years. So, based on the data, the difference between southwestern's join year (1958) and winamac's join year (1947) is 11 years apart, not 10. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}]}",
