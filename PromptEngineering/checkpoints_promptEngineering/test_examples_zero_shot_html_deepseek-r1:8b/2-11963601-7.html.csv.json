    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"raptor be the home team of the game with manu gin\u00f3bili (34) as the lead scorer.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It has two main parts:\n\n1. The home team in a specific game was the Raptors.\n2. The leading scorer in that same game was Manu Gin\u00f3bili, scoring 34 points.\n\nI need to find if such a game exists in the table where both these conditions are met. So I'll go through each row of the table and check for these conditions.\n\nLooking at each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Visitor is Spurs, so not Raptors as home.\n- Rows 1-4: All involve Spurs as visitor or home, with Tim Duncan as leading scorer. None have Raptors as home and Manu as leader.\n- Row 5: Visitor is Spurs, opponent is Cavaliers, leading scorer is Manu with 46 points. Not Raptors.\n- Row 6: Home team is Spurs, so no.\n- Rows 7-9: These are from February 19 to 28, 2008. Looking at each:\n\nRow 7: Visitor is Bobcats, home is Spurs. Leading scorer is Manu with 18 points. So not Raptors.\n\nRow 8: Visitor is Spurs, opponent is Timberwolves. Leading scorer is Manu with 44 points. Not Raptors as home.\n\nRow 9: Visitor is Hornets, home is Spurs. Leading scorer is Manu with 30 points. Still not Raptors.\n\nRow 10: Visitor is Hawks, home is Spurs. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 23 points. So no.\n\nRow 11: Visitor is Mavericks, home is Spurs. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 31 points. Not relevant.\n\nWait, so going through each row, I don't see any where the home team is Raptors and Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 34 points as the leading scorer. \n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a row. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row 11: It's Mavericks vs Spurs, Tim Duncan scores 31. No Raptors involved.\n\nSo none of the rows have Raptors as the home team with Manu scoring 34. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the score of the game with manu gin\u00f3bili (44) as the leading scorer be 100 - 99.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to specific cells in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two key points:\n1. Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points.\n2. The game's score was 100 - 99.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details. The columns relevant here are 'leading scorer' and 'score'.\n\nI need to find rows where the leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (specifically 44) and check if the score in that row is 100-99.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: February 5, 2008 - Spurs vs. Pacers. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan (19). Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: February 6, 2008 - Spurs vs. Wizards. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan (23). Not relevant.\n3. Row 2: February 8, 2008 - Spurs vs. Knicks. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan (21). Not relevant.\n4. Row 3: February 10, 2008 - Spurs vs. Celtics. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan (22). Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: February 11, 2008 - Spurs vs. Raptors. Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34). Score is 93-88. Not matching.\n6. Row 5: February 13, 2008 - Spurs vs. Cavaliers. Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (46). Score is 112-105. Not matching.\n7. Row 6: February 19, 2008 - Bobcats vs. Spurs. Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (18). Score is 65-85. Not matching.\n8. Row 7: February 21, 2008 - Spurs vs. Timberwolves. Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44). Here we go, this row might be relevant.\n9. Row 8: February 23, 2008 - Hornets vs. Spurs. Leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (30). Score is 89-98. Not matching.\n10. Row 9: February 25, 2008 - Hawks vs. Spurs. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan (23). Not relevant.\n11. Row 10: February 28, 2008 - Mavericks vs. Spurs. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan (31). Not relevant.\n\nFrom this, only row 7 has Manu Gin\u00f3bili as the leading scorer with 44 points. The score in that row is 100-99. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo, the claim is true because there's a game where Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points and the score was 100-99.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"when manu gin\u00f3bili (44) be the leading scorer and the visitor be the maverick , the date be february 28 , 2008\". I need to verify if there's a row in the table that matches all these conditions simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home, leading scorer, attendance, and record. So, I should check each row to see if it meets all three conditions: leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 44 points, visitor is Mavericks, and the date is February 28, 2008.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: date is Feb 5, visitor is Spurs. Doesn't match.\n2. Row 1: same as above but different date. No.\n3. Row 2: Spurs again. No.\n4. Row 3: Feb 10, Celtics vs Spurs. Leading scorer is Duncan. No.\n5. Row 4: Feb 11, Raptors vs Spurs. Leading scorer Gin\u00f3bili, but visitor is Spurs. Not Mavericks.\n6. Row 5: Feb 13, Cavaliers vs Spurs. Gin\u00f3bili scores 46, visitor is Spurs. No.\n7. Row 6: Bobcats vs Spurs. Visitor is Spurs again. No.\n8. Row 7: Spurs as visitor against Timberwolves. Leading scorer is Gin\u00f3bili with 44? Wait, in this row, the leading scorer is listed as manu gin\u00f3bili (44). Let me check: yes, it says manu gin\u00f3bili (44) in the leading scorer column. The date here is February 21, which doesn't match Feb 28.\n\n9. Row 8: Hornets vs Spurs. Visitor is Spurs. No.\n10. Row 9: Hawks vs Spurs.Visitor is Spurs. No.\n11. Row 10: Mavericks as visitor against Spurs. Leading scorer is Tim Duncan with 31. So that's not Gin\u00f3bili.\n\nWait, so none of the rows have both the visitor being Mavericks and the leading scorer being Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44) on February 28, 2008. \n\nLet me double-check row 10: date is Feb 28, visitor is Mavericks, but the leading scorer is Tim Duncan (31). So even though the date matches and the visitor is correct, the leading scorer isn't Manu with 44.\n\nSo there's no row where all three conditions are met simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table was examined for each row to check if the visitor is Mavericks, leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44), and date is February 28, 2008. None of the rows meet all these criteria, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
