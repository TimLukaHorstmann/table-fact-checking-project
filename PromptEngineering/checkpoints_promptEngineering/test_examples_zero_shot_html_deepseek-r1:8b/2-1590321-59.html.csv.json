The claim states: \"active from 1947 - 1964 , titus ozon score 157 goal.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts. The first part mentions the active years for Titus Ozon as being 1947-1964. The second part refers to his score and goals, specifically 157 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row corresponding to \"titus ozon.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that the last row (row index 9) has the name Titus Ozon. His active years are listed as 1947 - 1964, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the goals. The column for goals is \"goals\" in the table. For row index 9, Titus Ozon's goal count is 157. This directly supports the second part of the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the relevant cells of the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"during the year of 1950 through 1965 , the goal score be less than 160.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is checking for. It's about the period from 1950 to 1965 and whether any player's goals during that time were below 160.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their name, rank, years active, matches, and goals. My task is to find if there are any players whose goal score during their tenure in those years was less than 160.\n\nI should check each player's active years to see if they fall within 1950-1965. For each relevant player, I'll look at their goals.\n\nStarting with row 1: dudu georgescu from 1970-1986. That's outside our range.\nRow 2: ionel danciulescu started in 1993, which is after the period.\nRow 3: rodion camataru active from 1974-1989. Also after 1965.\nRow 4: marin radu same as above.\nRow 5: ion oblemenco from 1964-1976. Wait, 1964 is before 1950? No, the claim starts at 1950. So 1964 is within 1950-1965? Let me think: 1964 is between 1950 and 1965, so yes. His goals are 170, which is above 160.\nNext row has same rank 5 but a different player: florea dumitrache active from 1966-1983. 1966 is within the period, goals 170 again above 160.\nRow 7: mircea sandu 1970-1987. After the period.\nRow 8: victor piturca 1975-1989. Also after.\nRow 9: mihai adam 1962-1976. 1962 is within 1950-1965, but his goals are 160 exactly. The claim says \"less than 160,\" so 160 isn't less.\nRow 10: titus ozon from 1947-1964. His years overlap with our period starting in 1947. He was active up until 1964. So during 1950-1965, he's still active. His goals are 157, which is below 160.\n\nSo the claim says \"goal score be less than 160.\" Since ozon scored 157, which is indeed less than 160, that makes the claim TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the claim might be about the entire period. So any player active during 1950-1965 with goals below 160 would make it true. Ozon fits both conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those of Titus Ozon, who was active during the specified years and scored less than 160 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
