The claim says, \"all game be play on 8 august 1908.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to check what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is stating that every game in the table was played on August 8, 1908. So my task is to verify if all the games listed have this date.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, and date. The key here is the 'date' column because that's where I need to check if each game was indeed played on August 8, 1908.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nFirst row: The date is \"8 august 1908.\" That matches the claim. So this cell is relevant.\n\nSecond row: Same date. So another relevant cell here.\n\nThird row: Again, same date. Relevant again.\n\nFourth row: Same date as before. Relevant.\n\nFifth row: August 8, 1908. Yes, that's consistent. Another relevant cell.\n\nWait, all the dates in every row are \"8 august 1908.\" So each of these cells supports the claim that all games were played on that specific date.\n\nTherefore, since every game listed has this date, the claim is fully supported.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"south melbourne score the most point out of every team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"south melbourne.\" Looking at the table, there's a row for \"south melbourne\" in the home team column. Their score is 18.12 (120). I should check their points to see if they have the highest.\n\nNext, the phrase says \"score the most point out of every team.\" So, I need to compare south melbourne's score with all other teams in the table to find the highest scorer.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Fitzroy: 13.16 (94) \u2013 that's less than 120.\n2. Essendon: 17.17 (119) \u2013 also less than 120.\n3. Collingwood: 10.10 (70) \u2013 way lower.\n4. South Melbourne: 18.12 (120)\n5. Geelong: 5.9 (39) \u2013 much lower.\n\nSo, south melbourne has the highest score of 120 points, which is more than all other teams mentioned here. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row for south melbourne is in row index 3 (since it's the fourth entry). The columns involved are \"home team\" and \"home team score.\" So, these two cells are crucial for verifying the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"no team score more than 120 points in a game\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that none of the teams scored more than 120 points in any of their games listed here. So my task is to check all the scores in the 'home team score' and 'away team score' columns to see if any of them exceed 120.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are five rows, each representing a different game. Each row has the home team, their score, the away team, and the away team's score, among other details like venue and date. For this claim, the relevant columns would be 'home team score' and 'away team score'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Home Team: fitzroy with 13.16 (94 points)\n   - Away Team: university with 11.7 (73 points)\n   Both scores are well below 120, so no issue here.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Home Team: essendon with 17.17 (119 points)\n   - Away Team: melbourne with 8.11 (59 points)\n   The home team scored 119 points. Wait, that's very close to 120 but not over. Hmm, does the notation matter? The score is shown as \"17.17 (119)\", which likely means 17 goals and 17 behinds, totaling 119 points. So yes, it's under 120.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Home Team: collingwood with 10.10 (70 points)\n   - Away Team: st kilda with 7.9 (51 points)\n   Both scores are way below 120.\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - Home Team: south melbourne with 18.12 (120 points)\n   - Away Team: richmond with 4.4 (28 points)\n   Here, the home team scored exactly 120 points. The claim says \"no team score more than 120 points\", so exactly 120 would technically not be more than 120. But I need to check if 'more than' includes equal or just strictly greater. Since the claim is about \"no team scoring *more* than 120,\" then 120 is acceptable because it's not more, just equal. So this might not violate the claim.\n\n5. **Fifth Row:**\n   - Home Team: geelong with 5.9 (39 points)\n   - Away Team: carlton with 6.13 (49 points)\n   Both are under 120.\n\nNow, looking through all these scores, I see that in the fourth row, south melbourne scored exactly 120 points. So the maximum score is 120, not exceeding it. Therefore, no team scored more than 120; they all were at or below that number.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if 'more than' includes equal to. The claim says \"no team score more than 120 points in a game.\" So if a team scores exactly 120, is that considered as scoring more than? No, because 120 is not more than 120. Therefore, the claim holds.\n\nHowever, I should check all cells related to the score columns to ensure no other teams scored higher elsewhere. From the table, the highest score is 120, so no team went over that.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as TRUE because none of the scores exceed 120 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

There are five rows of data, each representing a game on August 8, 1908.\n\nThe claim is that each game was played at a different venue. So I need to check if all the venues listed in the table are unique or not. If any two games were played at the same venue, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the 'venue' column:\n\n1. The first row has \"brunswick street oval\".\n2. The second row lists \"emcg\". I'm not sure what that stands for, but it's a different name from the first one.\n3. The third row is \"victoria park\".\n4. The fourth row is \"lake oval\".\n5. The fifth row is \"corio oval\".\n\nI need to check if any of these venues repeat across the rows. Let me list them out:\n\n- brunswick street oval\n- emcg\n- victoria park\n- lake oval\n- corio oval\n\nThey all look different from each other. None of the venue names are duplicated in the table. Therefore, each game was indeed played at a unique venue.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about \"emcg\". Is that an abbreviation for something else? Maybe it stands for Melbourne Cricket Ground or another venue name.

For this claim, I'm interested in the scores of the teams mentioned\u2014south melbourne, richmond, and carlton.\n\nLooking at the table, south melbourne is a home team with a score of 18.12 (120). That seems high. Now, I need to find the scores for richmond and carlton.\n\nRichmond is an away team against south melbourne on August 8, 1908. Their score is 4.4 (28).

Each row represents a game between two teams with their respective scores, played at a certain venue on a specific date.\n\nThe claim in question is about all games being played on 5 August 1908.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"south melbourne score the least point out of every team\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that South Melbourne scored the least points among all teams in their respective matches listed in the table. To verify this, I need to check each row of the table where South Melbourne is the home team and see how many points they scored compared to their opponents.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for the home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, and date. Each row represents a single match between two teams on a particular date.\n\nNow, let's go through each relevant row in the table:\n\n1. The first row is about the match between Fitzroy (home) and University of Melbourne (away). South Melbourne isn't involved here, so I can skip this row.\n2. The second row is Essendon vs. Melbourne; again, no South Melbourne, so not relevant.\n3. The third row is Collingwood vs. St Kilda; same as above.\n4. The fourth row is South Melbourne (home) vs. Richmond (away). Here, the home team is South Melbourne with a score of 18.12 (120 points), and the away team scored 4.4 (28 points).\n5. The fifth row is Geelong (home) vs. Carlton (away); not relevant as South Melbourne isn't playing here.\n\nWait, that's only four rows. Let me count again to make sure I haven't missed any:\n\n- Row 0: Fitzroy vs University\n- Row 1: Essendon vs Melbourne\n- Row 2: Collingwood vs St Kilda\n- Row 3: South Melbourne vs Richmond\n- Row 4: Geelong vs Carlton\n\nSo, only row 3 involves South Melbourne as the home team. The claim is about their score relative to all teams, so I need to check if in any match where they played, they scored less than their opponents.\n\nIn row 3, South Melbourne scored 18.12 (120 points), and Richmond scored 4.4 (28 points). So, South Melbourne's score is higher than their opponent here.\n\nWait a second\u2014does the claim say that South Melbourne scored the least points overall, or just in every game they played? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But looking at the table, South Melbourne has only one match listed where they are the home team. They scored 120 points, which is more than their opponent that day.\n\nI need to check if there's any other row where South Melbourne is involved as either home or away. Scanning through, I see that in all other rows, South Melbourne isn't present. So, based on the table provided, South Melbourne only played once and scored more points than their opponent.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"south melbourne score the least point out of every team\" would be false because in the game they played, they did not have the lowest score; instead, their score was higher.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyze each row where South Melbourne is involved. In the only relevant match, their score is 120 points, which is higher than their opponent's 28 points.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Only rows where South Melbourne is a team need to be considered.\n2. **Evaluate Scores:** In each relevant row, compare South Melbourne's score with their opponents'.\n3. **Conclusion:** South Melbourne did not have the lowest score in any of their matches based on the table.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"no team score more than 110 points in a game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and check the scores of both the home and away teams. Each game has a home team and an away team, and their scores are listed under \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" respectively.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Home team: fitzroy scored 13.16 (94 points)\n- Away team: university scored 11.7 (73 points)\n\nBoth of these are well below 110, so no issue here.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home team: essendon scored 17.17 (119 points)\n- Away team: melbourne scored 8.11 (59 points)\n\nHere, the home team's score is exactly 119, which is just under 120 but still under 110? Wait, no, 119 is more than 110. So this might be a problem because 119 exceeds 110.\n\nWait, let me double-check the conversion of scores to points. The format is \"goals.behinds (total points)\". For example, if a team scores 13 goals and 16 behinds, that's 13*6 + 16 = 78 + 16 = 94 points. Similarly, 17 goals and 17 behinds would be 17*6 +17=102+17=119.\n\nSo in the second row, the home team scored 119, which is over 110. That would mean the claim is FALSE because there exists a team that scored more than 110 points in a game.\n\nBut I should check all rows to make sure if any other scores exceed 110.\n\nThird row:\n- Home: collingwood - 10.10 (70)\n- Away: st kilda -7.9 (51)\n\nBoth under 110.\n\nFourth row:\n- Home: south melbourne -18.12 (120)\n- Away: richmond -4.4 (28)\n\nHome team scored 120, which is even higher than the previous one, definitely over 110.\n\nFifth row:\n- Home: geelong -5.9 (39)\n- Away: carlton -6.13 (49)\n\nBoth under 110.\n\nSo looking at the second and fourth rows, both home teams have scores exceeding 110 (119 and 120 respectively). Therefore, the claim that \"no team score more than 110 points in a game\" is false because there are teams that scored over 110.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: I need to list which cells are relevant. For each row where either home or away team's score exceeds 110, I should note their respective columns.\n\nIn row 1 (index 0), no issues.\nRow 2 (index 1): home team's score is 119 in \"home team score\" column.\nRow 3: no issue.\nRow 4 (index 4): home team's score is 120 in \"home team score\" column.\nRows beyond that don't matter as they're already checked.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 1, column \"home team score\"; and row 4, same column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}]}",

Therefore, it's not true that every game was played at the same place.\n\nSo the answer should be false because the venues vary across the games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"south melbourne score less point than richmond and carlton combine\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. I need to carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: It's saying that South Melbourne's score is less than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton. So, essentially, we need to compare South Melbourne's points with the sum of Richmond's and Carlton's points.\n\nLooking at the HTML table provided, I can see that it lists various matches with details like home team, away team, their respective scores, venue, and date. My focus here is on the scoring sections because that's where the numerical data lies.\n\nLet me start by locating South Melbourne in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Home team is Fitzroy\n2. Row 1: Home team is Essendon\n3. Row 2: Home team is Collingwood\n4. Row 3: Home team is South Melbourne\n5. Row 4: Home team is Geelong\n\nSo, South Melbourne is in row 3. Looking at their score: \"18.12 (120)\". Wait, that's the home team's score. So South Melbourne scored 120 points.\n\nNow, I need to find Richmond and Carlton's scores. Let me scan each row:\n\n- In row 3, the away team is Richmond, and their score is \"4.4 (28)\".\n- For Carlton, I don't see it listed as a home or away team in this table. Hmm, maybe it's only playing when they're the away team? Or perhaps I need to check both teams' scores wherever they appear.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim is about Richmond and Carlton combining their points. So, regardless of whether South Melbourne is at home or away, we just need their individual scores. But in this table, Carlton isn't listed as an away team in any row except when playing against Geelong (row 4), where they scored \"6.13 (49)\". Wait no, in row 3, the away team is Richmond with a score of 28, and in row 4, the away team is Carlton with 49 points.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"south melbourne score less point than richmond and carlton combine.\" So South Melbourne's score (as the home team) is 120. We need to find Richmond's and Carlton's scores from wherever they appear in the table and sum them.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Richmond appears as an away team in row 3 with a score of 28.\n- Carlton appears as an away team in row 4, but wait, no: In row 4, home team is Geelong, away team is Carlton, so their score is 49. So Carlton scored 49.\n\nWait, but in row 3, the away team is Richmond with a score of 28. So Richmond's score is 28, and Carlton's score from row 4 is 49. Therefore, their combined score would be 28 + 49 = 77.\n\nNow, South Melbourne's score is 120. Is 120 less than 77? No, it's higher. So that would make the claim FALSE because 120 is not less than 77.\n\nWait a second, did I get Carlton's score correctly? Let me double-check:\n\nIn row 4: Home team is Geelong, away team is Carlton. The away team's score is \"6.13 (49)\", so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo Richmond scored 28 and Carlton scored 49. Combined, they have 77 points. South Melbourne scored 120, which is higher than 77. Therefore, the claim that South Melbourne's score is less than the combined scores of Richmond and Carlton is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check if there are other instances of Richmond or Carlton in the table. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Fitzroy vs University\n- Row 1: Essendon vs Melbourne\n- Row 2: Collingwood vs St Kilda\n- Row 3: South Melbourne vs Richmond\n- Row 4: Geelong vs Carlton\n\nYes, that's all the data given. So Richmond only has one match here with a score of 28, and Carlton has one match with 49.\n\nTherefore, the combined score is indeed 77, which is less than South Melbourne's 120. So the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Melbourne's score is less than the sum of Richmond's and Carlton's scores. From the table, South Melbourne scored 120 points as the home team. Richmond scored 28 points when playing against South Melbourne, and Carlton scored 49 points as the away team against Geelong. Adding these together gives a combined total of 77 points. Since 120 is greater than 77, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify South Melbourne's score:** In row 3, home team South Melbourne scored 120.\n2. **Locate Richmond and Carlton's scores:** \n   - Richmond scored 28 as the away team in row 3.\n   - Carlton scored 49 as the away team in row 4.\n3. **Sum the scores of Richmond and Carlton:** 28 + 49 = 77.\n4. **Compare South Melbourne's score to the combined total:** 120 > 77, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- South Melbourne's home team score (row 3, column \"home team score\").\n- Richmond's away score (row 3, column \"away team score\").\n- Carlton's away score (row 4, column \"away team score\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
