    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim: \"cup noodle honda be the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 point.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts. The first part says that \"cup noodle honda\" is the only team with the \"nsr250\". The second part mentions that this team has less than 8 points.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify the relevant cells. Let's go row by row.\n\nIn the first row (row_index:0), the class is 250cc and the machine is nsr250. The team here is \"cup noodle - honda\". So this team does have the nsr250 in 1993. Their points that year were 8, which is exactly 8. Hmm, but the claim says less than 8, so maybe this row's points don't directly disprove it because 8 isn't less than 8.\n\nIn the second row (row_index:1), same team, class 250cc, nsr250 again, with 11 points in 1994. So they have the machine and more points, but the claim is about being the only team with nsr250. Since they're still the only ones with it here, this might be relevant.\n\nThird row (row_index:2) is for 500cc, different class, so probably not relevant unless another team uses nsr250 in 500cc, which I don't see here.\n\nFourth row (row_index:3) is also 500cc, so same as above.\n\nFifth row (row_index:4) is for 1997, class 500cc. The machine is nsr500v, which is a different model number. So no, the team \"repsol - honda\" doesn't have nsr250 here.\n\nSo focusing on whether \"cup noodle honda\" is the only team with nsr250. From the table, in 1993 and 1994, only they have nsr250. In other years, the class changes to 500cc or there's a different machine like nsr500v. Therefore, it seems that \"cup noodle honda\" are indeed the only ones with nsr250.\n\nNow, checking their points: in 1993, they had exactly 8 points. The claim says less than 8, which would mean strictly below 8. Since 8 is not less than itself, this might be a point against the claim. However, if we consider that the team has less than or equal to 8, then it's acceptable, but the claim specifies \"less than,\" so maybe this row is relevant because it contradicts the points part.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says they have less than 8 points. But in 1993, their points are exactly 8. So that would mean the claim isn't fully supported for that year. However, in 1994, they had 11 points, which is more than 8 and also doesn't satisfy \"less than.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"cup noodle honda\" have less than 8 points. Looking at their points: 8, 11, 0, 0, etc. So in 1993, they had exactly 8, which isn't less than, and in 1994, 11, which is more. So the claim might not be entirely true because for some years, their points are equal or higher.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is about a specific year? No, it's general. The table includes multiple years. So if we consider all data, then \"cup noodle honda\" don't have less than 8 points in any of their nsr250 races. They either had exactly 8 (1993) or more like 11 (1994). Therefore, the claim that they have less than 8 points isn't accurate across all their instances with nsr250.\n\nBut then again, maybe the user is referring to a specific time when they were under 8 points, but since in 1993 they had exactly 8, it's not strictly less. So the claim would be false because their points aren't consistently below 8.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. The claim says \"cup noodle honda\" are the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 points. So both conditions must be true for the claim to hold. They are the only team with nsr250 (which seems true based on the table), but their points aren't consistently below 8. In 1993, they had 8, which is not less than 8.\n\nSo does that mean the claim is false because their points were equal to or greater than 8 in all cases where they used nsr250? Therefore, the relevant cells would be those rows where they have nsr250 and their points. So for row_index:0 (1993), column_name:points is 8, which equals 8, not less than. For row_index:1 (1994), points are 11, which is more. Therefore, these cells show that the claim about points being less than 8 isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is only referring to a specific year or context where they had less than 8. But looking at all the data provided, the claim isn't entirely true because in some years their points are equal or higher.\n\nSo putting it all together: the team is indeed the only one with nsr250 (so that part of the claim holds), but their points aren't consistently below 8. Therefore, the overall claim is false because while they are the only team with nsr250, they don't have less than 8 points across their relevant races.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim could be interpreted as in all years when they used nsr250, their points were less than 8. But in 1993, they had exactly 8, which is not less than. So that breaks the condition. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo the answer would be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells are the rows where they have nsr250 and their points, because those are the data points needed to disprove the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
