The claim says, \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry. The claim is about their \"to par\" scores being tied for the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns. The columns involved are \"player,\" \"country,\" \"score,\" \"to par,\" and \"money.\" Since the claim is specifically about \"to par,\" the focus should be on that column.\n\nI'll scan through each row to locate Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry. \n\nMark Brooks is in row 0 (index 0). His \"to par\" is -11.\nKenny Perry is in row 1 (index 1). His \"to par\" is also -11.\n\nNext, I check if any other players have a lower \"to par\" score than -11. Lower means more negative, which would be worse scores. From the table, the lowest \"to par\" is -11, as seen with Mark and Kenny. There are no rows where \"to par\" is less than -11.\n\nTherefore, both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry do tie for having the lowest \"to par\" score of -11.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. The claim is specifically about a player named Nick Price and whether he's the only one from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo, my first task is to locate Nick Price in the table. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see that there are multiple players with various last names. I notice that in row 8 (t8), under the player column, it says \"nick price\" and his country is listed as Zimbabwe.\n\nNow, the claim says he's the only one from Zimbabwe. To verify this, I need to check if any other players have their country listed as Zimbabwe. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: mark brooks, united states\n- Row 2: kenny perry, united states\n- Row 3: steve elkington, australia; tommy tolles, united states\n- Row 5: justin leonard, united states; jesper parnevik, sweden; vijay singh, fiji\n- Row 8: lee janzen, united states; per - ulrik johansson, sweden; phil mickelson, united states; larry mize, united states; frank nobilo, new zealand; nick price, zimbabwe\n\nI'm particularly interested in any other players from Zimbabwe. Scanning through all the 'country' columns:\n\n- The only player listed as Zimbabwean is Nick Price in row 8.\n\nTherefore, there are no other players from Zimbabwe besides him. So the claim that \"nick price be the only player from zimbabwe\" seems to hold true based on the table provided.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this verification. The relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The row where Nick Price is listed.\n2. The 'country' column for that row, as it's Zimbabwe.\n3. Any other rows where country might be Zimbabwe, but since there aren't any others, the focus is on Nick Price's row.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include Nick Price's row index and the country column name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim says that Frank Nobilo is the only player from New Zealand. So, my task is to check if there's any other player listed in the table who is also from New Zealand besides Frank Nobilo.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table and look at the 'player' and 'country' columns specifically for players from New Zealand.\n\nStarting with the first few rows:\n- Mark Brooks: United States\n- Kenny Perry: United States\n- Steve Elkington: Australia\n- Tommy Tolles: United States\n- Justin Leonard: United States\n- Jesper Parnevik: Sweden\n- Vijay Singh: Fiji\n\nNone of these players are from New Zealand. Now, looking further down:\n\nRows 8 and beyond:\n- Lee Janzen: United States\n- Per-Ulrik Johansson: Sweden\n- Phil Mickelson: United States\n- Larry Mize: United States\n- Frank Nobilo: New Zealand\n- Nick Price: Zimbabwe\n\nHere, Frank Nobilo is listed as being from New Zealand. Now, I need to check if there's any other player from New Zealand in the table besides him.\n\nScanning through all the rows again, I don't see another player with 'New Zealand' under their country.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate the relevant players in the table. The claim mentions Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks. Looking at the 'player' column, Mark Brooks is in row 0, and Kenny Perry is in row 1. So, their respective data is in rows 0 and 1.\n\nNext, I need to look at the money column for both players. For Mark Brooks (row 0), the money is 430000. For Kenny Perry (row 1), it's 260000. The claim says that Kenny earned 170000 less than Mark. So, I should check if 430000 minus 260000 equals 170000.\n\nCalculating that: 430000 - 260000 = 170000. That matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the statement is true based on the provided data.\n\nI don't see any other cells that are relevant here because the claim only compares Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks in terms of their earnings.

The claim says: \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par.\" Hmm, first, I should make sure I understand what each part means.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. So, the claim is specifically about the \"to par\" column for two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry.\n\nWait, but in the table, I see that under \"player,\" there's a Mark Brooks entry at row 0 (row_index=0) and Kenny Perry at row 1. Both are from the United States. Their scores add up to 277 each, and both have a \"to par\" of -11.\n\nSo, the claim says they tie for the lowest \"to par.\" I need to check if any other players have a lower (more negative) \"to par\" than -11 because that would mean Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry aren't the lowest. If no one else has a lower number, then their \"to par\" is indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking through the rest of the table:\n\n- Steve Elkington, Tommy Tolles: to par is -10.\n- Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh: all have -9.\n- Lee Janzen and others tied at t8 have -8.\n- No one has a \"to par\" lower than -11. The lowest seems to be -11 held by Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry.\n\nSo, their \"to par\" is the same and the lowest among all players in the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nAs for relevant cells, I need to identify which rows and columns are important. Since the claim is about \"to par,\" that's column_name=\"to par\". The specific rows are row 0 (Mark Brooks) and row 1 (Kenny Perry).\n\nSo, the JSON should include those two rows with their respective details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kenny perry be the player who earn the most money\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find where Kenny Perry is mentioned and then check his money value compared to others. The table has several columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find Kenny Perry. Scanning the 'player' column, I see:\n\n1. mark brooks\n2. kennedy perry (wait, no, it's Kenny Perry)\n3. steve elkington\n4. tommy tolles\n5. justin leonard\n6. jesper parnevik\n7. vijay singh\n8. lee janzen\n9. per - ulrik johansson\n10. phil mickelson\n11. larry mize\n12. frank nobilo\n13. nick price\n\nSo Kenny Perry is in the second row, which is row index 1 (since indexing starts at 0). His money is listed as $260,000.\n\nNow, I need to compare this with other players to see if anyone has a higher amount. Looking through each player's 'money' column:\n\n- mark brooks: $430,000\n- Kenny Perry: $260,000\n- Steve Elkington: $140,000\n- Tommy Tolles: $140,000\n- Justin Leonard: $86,667\n- Jesper Parnevik: $86,667\n- Vijay Singh: $86,667\n- Lee Janzen: $57,500\n- Per - Ulrik Johansson: $57,500\n- Phil Mickelson: $57,500\n- Larry Mize: $57,500\n- Frank Nobilo: $57,500\n- Nick Price: $57,500\n\nFrom this list, the highest amount is Mark Brooks with $430,000. Kenny Perry's $260,000 is less than that. So the claim that Kenny Perry earns the most money isn't true because someone else has a higher amount.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The 'money' column is where the earnings are tracked, so all rows in the 'money' column are relevant. But since we're focusing on Kenny Perry specifically, only his row's money value is directly compared. However, to verify whether he's the highest, we also need to check Mark Brooks' row.\n\nWait, actually, the instruction says to include the cells that are relevant to verifying the claim. So for the claim about Kenny Perry being the top earner, we need to check his own 'money' cell and compare it against others. So, all rows in the 'money' column might be considered relevant because they show who has the highest earning.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the claim is specifically about Kenny Perry, only his row's money is directly related. However, to confirm that he isn't the top earner, we also need to check Mark Brooks' money to see if it's higher. So both their rows in the 'money' column are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all rows under 'money', but perhaps focusing on Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks since those are the two with the highest amounts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just their respective rows because they're the top two earners.\n\nBut to follow the instructions correctly, I should list each row where the 'player' is either Kenny Perry or Mark Brooks because those are the ones involved in the claim. However, looking back, the relevant cells should be all the rows for the 'money' column since that's what the claim refers to.\n\nWait, but the instruction says: \"carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\" The claim is about Kenny Perry being the top earner, so we need to see his money value and compare it. So the relevant cells would be all rows that have a higher or lower amount than Kenny's.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to include all the 'money' column cells because that's where the comparison happens. However, for efficiency, maybe only including the ones where the player's name is mentioned in the claim, which is Kenny Perry and Mark Brooks.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about Kenny Perry being the top earner, so we need to check if anyone else has a higher amount. So all players' 'money' cells are relevant because we need to see who has more than Kenny. But that's a lot of data. Alternatively, perhaps just the rows where the money is higher than Kenny's.\n\nBut I think the instruction expects us to include the specific cells that are being checked for the claim. So in this case, since the claim is about Kenny Perry's earnings, his row is definitely relevant. Additionally, Mark Brooks' row is also relevant because he has a higher amount. Others might not be necessary unless their money is higher than Kenny's.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The claim is that Kenny Perry earns the most money.\n- To verify this, we look at the 'money' column for each player, including Kenny Perry and any others who have a higher or equal amount.\n- In the table, Mark Brooks has $430,000, which is higher than Kenny's $260,000.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n1. The row where the player is Kenny Perry (row index 1) and the 'money' column.\n2. The row where the player is Mark Brooks (row index 0) and the 'money' column, because his amount is higher than Kenny's.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both of these cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"phil mickelson be the the only player from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Phil Mickelson is the only player from the United States in the table. So, I need to check if there are any other players from the US besides Phil Mickelson in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'player' column with their names and the 'country' they're from. My task is to scan through these rows to see who else is from the United States.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Mark Brooks: United States\n- Kenny Perry: United States\n\nSo already, there are two players from the US besides Phil Mickelson. \n\nContinuing:\n- Steve Elkington: Australia\n- Tommy Tolles: United States\n- Justin Leonard: United States\n- Jesper Parnevik: Sweden\n- Vijay Singh: Fiji\n- Lee Janzen: United States\n- Per-Ulrik Johansson: Sweden\n- Phil Mickelson: United States\n- Larry Mize: United States\n- Frank Nobilo: New Zealand\n- Nick Price: Zimbabwe\n\nFrom this list, Mark Brooks, Kenny Perry, Tommy Tolles, Justin Leonard, Lee Janzen, Phil Mickelson, and Larry Mize are all from the United States. That's a total of seven players.\n\nSo the claim says that Phil is the only one, but clearly, there are others. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to find which cells are relevant: I need to identify each row where the player is from the US and their name is Phil Mickelson or another US player.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n- The 7th row (index 6) is Phil Mickelson from the US.\n- Rows 0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9 are US players. Wait, no, let me check the indexes properly. Each row in the tbody has a row index starting at 0.\n\nRow indices: 0 (Mark Brooks), 1 (Kenny Perry), 2 (Steve Elkington), 3 (Tommy Tolles), 4 (Justin Leonard), 5 (Jesper Parnevik), 6 (Vijay Singh), 7 (Lee Janzen), 8 (Per-Ulrik Johansson), 9 (Phil Mickelson), 10 (Larry Mize), 11 (Frank Nobilo), 12 (Nick Price).\n\nSo US players are at rows 0,1,3,4,7,9,10,12.\n\nWait, row 9 is Phil Mickelson. So for the claim, I need to check if any other US players exist besides him.\n\nSo all these rows where country is United States are relevant: rows 0,1,3,4,7,9,10,12.\n\nEach of their 'player' cells needs to be considered as they are from the US. So for each of those rows, the column_name would be \"player\" and row_index as per their position in the tbody.\n\nBut wait, the claim is specifically about Phil Mickelson being the only one. So perhaps only rows where the player is Phil Mickelson and country is US, but also to check if any other US players exist.\n\nWait no, the relevant cells are all the ones that are from the US because they disprove the claim.\n\nSo for each row where country is United States, we need to note their player name and row index. Because their existence contradicts the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant cells should include the specific columns needed to verify the claim. The claim is about the number of US players, so the 'player' column and 'country' column are relevant for each US player.\n\nBut in the instructions, it says: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" So to verify, I need to check that there are no other US players besides Phil Mickelson. Therefore, all rows where country is US are relevant because they show others exist.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be all the rows where country is United States, each with their row_index and column_name \"player\".\n\nWait, but in the example given, they have columns like Revenue and Employees, which might not be directly about the claim. So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nThe claim is that Phil Mickelson is the only US player. Therefore, any other US players are relevant because they disprove the claim. So for each row where country is United States, their player name is relevant because it's a US player besides Phil.\n\nTherefore, in the table, all rows with country as United States should be included as relevant cells.\n\nSo let me list them:\n\nRow 0: Mark Brooks (US)\nRow1: Kenny Perry (US)\nRow3: Tommy Tolles (US)\nRow4: Justin Leonard (US)\nRow7: Lee Janzen (US)\nRow9: Phil Mickelson (US)\nRow10: Larry Mize (US)\n\nWait, rows 0,1,3,4,7,9,10 are US players.\n\nBut in the table, row indices go up to 12. So let's count again:\n\nRows:\n0: Mark Brooks - US\n1: Kenny Perry - US\n2: Steve Elkington - Australia\n3: Tommy Tolles - US\n4: Justin Leonard - US\n5: Jesper Parnevik - Sweden\n6: Vijay Singh - Fiji\n7: Lee Janzen - US\n8: Per-Ulrik Johansson - Sweden\n9: Phil Mickelson - US\n10: Larry Mize - US\n11: Frank Nobilo - New Zealand\n12: Nick Price - Zimbabwe\n\nSo rows 0,1,3,4,7,9,10 are from the US.\n\nEach of these players is a cell relevant to the claim because they show that there are other US players besides Phil Mickelson.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include each of these rows' player information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me count.\n\nWait, in the table provided, the rows are:\n\n1. mark brooks\n2. kenny perry\n3. steve elkington (t3)\n4. tommy tolles (t3)\n5. justin leonard (t5)\n6. jesper parnevik (t5)\n7. vijay singh (t5)\n8. lee janzen (t8)\n9. per - ulrik johansson (t8)\n10. phil mickelson (t8)\n11. larry mize (t8)\n12. frank nobilo (t8)\n13. nick price (t8)\n\nWait, actually, the table has 14 rows including t3, t5, t8, etc., but each row is a <tr>. So I need to check which players are from Zimbabwe.\n\nLooking at each player's country:\n\n- Frank Nobilo is in row index... let me count. The first two rows (indices 0 and 1) are Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry, both US.\nThen rows 2,3: t3, t3, US, Australia.\nRows 4-6: t5 players, US, Sweden, Fiji.\nRows 7-12: t8 players, US, Sweden, US, US, NZ, Zimbabwe.\n\nWait, in row index 12 (assuming the first is 0), which player is that? Let me list all rows with their indices:\n\nAssuming the initial table starts at row index 0 for the first <tr>:\n\nRow 0: mark brooks\nRow 1: kenny perry\nRow 2: steve elkington (t3)\nRow 3: tommy tolles (t3)\nRow 4: justin leonard (t5)\nRow 5: jesper parnevik (t5)\nRow 6: vijay singh (t5)\nRow 7: lee janzen (t8)\nRow 8: per - ulrik johansson (t8)\nRow 9: phil mickelson (t8)\nRow 10: larry mize (t8)\nRow 11: frank nobilo (t8)\nRow 12: nick price (t8)\n\nSo, row index 11 is Frank Nobilo from New Zealand. Wait, no, looking back at the table:\n\nWait in the last few rows:\n\n<tr>\n<td>t8</td>\n<td>nick price</td>\n<td>zimbabwe</td>\n<td>68 + 71 + 69 + 72 = 280</td>\n<td>-8</td>\n<td>57500</td>\n</tr>\n\nSo, Nick Price is from Zimbabwe. Frank Nobilo is in another row.\n\nLooking for Frank Nobilo's country:\n\nIn the table, I see:\n\n<tr>\n<td>t8</td>\n<td>frank nobilo</td>\n<td>new zealand</td>\n...\n</tr>\n\nWait no, looking at the table provided, let me check each player:\n\nRow 0: mark brooks, US\nRow1: kenny perry, US\nRow2: steve elkington, Australia\nRow3: tommy tolles, US\nRow4: justin leonard, US\nRow5: jesper parnevik, Sweden\nRow6: vijay singh, Fiji\nRow7: lee janzen, US\nRow8: per - ulrik johansson, Sweden\nRow9: phil mickelson, US\nRow10: larry mize, US\nRow11: frank nobilo, New Zealand\nRow12: nick price, Zimbabwe\n\nSo Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand, not Zimbabwe. Nick Price is from Zimbabwe.\n\nThe claim says \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe\". But in the table, there's another player from Zimbabwe: Nick Price.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are two players from Zimbabwe: Frank Nobilo (from New Zealand) and Nick Price (from Zimbabwe). Wait, no. Frank is from New Zealand, Nick from Zimbabwe. So the claim says \"frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe\", but there's another player, Nick Price.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Where is Frank Nobilo? In row index 11, column 'player' (to check his country)\n- And where is the other player from Zimbabwe: Nick Price in row index12, column 'country'.\n\nWait, to verify the claim that Frank is the only one from Zimbabwe, I need to check if any other players are from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The cell for Frank Nobilo's country (to confirm he's not from Zimbabwe)\n2. The cell for Nick Price's country (since he is from Zimbabwe)\n\nWait no, the claim says Frank is the only one from Zimbabwe, but in reality, Nick Price is also from Zimbabwe. So to verify this, we need to check both:\n\n- Frank Nobilo's country: row 11, column 'country'\n- Nick Price's country: row12, column 'country'\n\nBut since the claim is about Frank being the only one, and there is another player (Nick) from Zimbabwe, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 11, 'country' to check Frank's country\n- Row 12, 'country' to check Nick Price's country\n\nThus, in the JSON, I need to list these two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe. However, another player, Nick Price, is also listed as being from Zimbabwe. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"kenny perry earn 170000 more than mark brook\". Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for both players in the table. Mark Brooks is listed in row 0 (since it's zero-indexed) under the 'player' column, and Kenny Perry is also in row 1. \n\nNext, I need to check their earnings. Looking at the 'money' column: Mark Brooks has 430000, and Kenny Perry has 260000. The difference between these two amounts is 170000 (430,000 - 260,000). So Kenny Perry does earn more than Mark Brooks by 170,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
