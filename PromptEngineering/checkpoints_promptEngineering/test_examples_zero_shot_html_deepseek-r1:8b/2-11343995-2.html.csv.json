    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"jacqueline du bief earn 14 placings where her total score be 188.67.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Jacqueline Du Bief in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that she's in row number 1 (since rows are 0-indexed). Her name is listed as \"jacqueline du bief\".\n\nNext, I need to check two specific data points: placings and total score. \n\nFor placings: The claim says she earned 14 placings. Looking at the table, each row has a number under the column named \"placings\". In Jacqueline's row (row index 1), the number is 14. So that part checks out.\n\nNow for the total score: The claim states her total score is 188.67. I look for the \"total\" column in her row. The number there is indeed 188.67, so that matches too.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are satisfied with the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"placings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
