    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to check if the claim that the Polish word for Friday is \"pi\u0105tek\" is true. Let's look at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll search for Polish in the column_names. It should be under the row where Language: Polish is listed. Looking at the table, there are multiple languages, and Polish is one of them. Now, focusing on the Polish row, I see that each cell corresponds to a day of the week.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Friday,\" so I need to find the entry for Friday in Polish. Scanning through the columns: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So the fifth column should be Friday.\n\nIn the Polish row, under the days, the entries are:\n- Monday: poniedzia\u0142ek\n- Tuesday: wtorek\n- Wednesday: \u015broda\n- Thursday: czwartek\n- Friday: pi\u0105tek\n- Saturday: sobotka\n- Sunday: niedziela\n\nSo yes, Friday is listed as \"pi\u0105tek.\" That matches the claim. I should check if there are any other relevant cells. Since it's directly matching the specific word, only the Polish row and the Friday column are relevant here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Friday\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Polish\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "subota be the mongolian word for sunday",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"subota be the mongolian word for sunday\" is true by checking the provided table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: It says \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday. So, I need to find in the table if \"Sunday\" corresponds to \"subota\".\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, it's a grid where each row represents a language or dialect, and columns represent days of the week. For example, the first row seems to be English, with column headers like Monday to Sunday.\n\nThe claim is about Mongolian, so I'll focus on rows that mention Mongolian. Scanning down, I see two relevant sections under Mongolian: one labeled \"mongolian (numerical)\" and another as \"mongolian (tibetan)\". The numerical section lists words for each day starting from Monday to Sunday, with their corresponding numbers.\n\nIn the numerical mongolian row, column 5 is \"Sunday\". Let me check that. Yes, under Mongolian (numerical), the fifth column corresponds to Sunday, and the entry there is \"x\u012bngq\u012bw\u01d4\". Wait, but the claim uses \"subota\", which might be in a different dialect or language variant.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The numerical row for Mongolian lists each day's name in pinyin. For example:\n\n- 1: Monday - x\u012bngq\u012by\u012b\n- 2: Tuesday - x\u012bngq\u012b'\u00e8r\n- 3: Wednesday - x\u012bngq\u012bs\u0101n\n- 4: Thursday - x\u012bngq\u012bs\u00ec\n- 5: Friday - x\u012bngq\u012bw\u01d4 (which is Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, in the Chinese section, the fifth column is Saturday, sixth is Sunday.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the structure. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the table, each row represents a language, and columns represent days from Monday to Sunday. So for Mongolian (numerical), let's list them out:\n\n1: neg dekh \u00f6d\u00f6r (Monday)\n2: hoyor dahi \u00f6d\u00f6r (Tuesday)\n3: gurav dahi \u00f6d\u00f6r (Wednesday)\n4: d\u00f6r\u00f6v dekh \u00f6d\u00f6r (Thursday)\n5: tav dahi \u00f6d\u00f6r (Friday)\n6: hagas sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r (Saturday)\n7: b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r (Sunday)\n\nSo Sunday is the seventh day, which corresponds to \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\".\n\nBut the claim uses \"subota\". I need to see if \"subota\" matches any Mongolian word for Sunday.\n\nLooking at the Tibetan section of Mongolian, under row 20: \"mongolian (tibetan)\", columns correspond to days:\n\n1: davaa (Monday)\n2: myagmar (Tuesday)\n3: lhagva (Wednesday)\n4: p\u00fcrev (Thursday)\n5: baasan (Friday)\n6: byamba (Saturday)\n7: nyam (Sunday)\n\nHere, Sunday is \"nyam\". So the claim says \"subota\" is the word. But in both numerical and Tibetan sections, Sunday is \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\" and \"nyam\", not \"subota\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. The Chinese section has pinyin for each day, but that's separate from Mongolian. The Turkish section also lists days.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if \"subota\" is another term used in another dialect or language within Mongolian. But according to the table provided, both numerical and Tibetan sections don't list \"subota\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the claim. So, checking all relevant cells:\n\n- For Mongolian (numerical), Sunday is \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\".\n- For Mongolian (Tibetan), Sunday is \"nyam\".\n\nNeither of these is \"subota\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo, to answer, I need to check which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones under Mongolian, both numerical and Tibetan rows, specifically their columns for Sunday (7th column).\n\nThus, the relevant_cells would include:\n\n- For mongolian (numerical): row index 19, column 6? Wait, wait: looking back at the table, each row's columns are Monday to Sunday. So in the Mongolian (numerical) row, which is row 20, the days go from Monday to Sunday as columns 0 to 7.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Let me check the structure again. The first column is Monday, then Tuesday up to Sunday as columns 0 through 6 or 1 through 7.\n\nIn the example provided in the JSON-like structure, it's written as:\n\n{\n  \"English\": {\n    \"Monday\": \"...\",\n    \"Tuesday\": \"...\",\n    ...,\n    \"Sunday\": \"...\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\nSo each row is a language, and each column corresponds to a day from Monday to Sunday.\n\nTherefore, for Mongolian (numerical) which is row 20, the columns are:\n\n0: Monday\n1: Tuesday\n2: Wednesday\n3: Thursday\n4: Friday\n5: Saturday\n6: Sunday\n\nSo Sunday is in column 6 of row 20. Similarly, in the Tibetan section, row 21, Sunday is also column 6.\n\nThus, to check Sunday, I need to look at columns 6 for rows 20 and 21.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells are:\n\n- Row 20 (Mongolian numerical), column 6\n- Row 21 (Mongolian Tibetan), column 6\n\nSo these are the cells that show Sunday in Mongolian. Since neither is \"subota\", the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"subota\" being the Mongolian word for Sunday is incorrect based on the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Focus on rows labeled as \"mongolian (numerical)\" and \"mongolian (tibetan)\". These are under row 20 and 21 respectively.\n\n2. **Locate Sunday's Column:** Each row has columns for Monday to Sunday, starting from column 0 (Monday) to column 6 (Sunday).\n\n3. **Check Corresponding Entries:**\n   - In the \"mongolian (numerical)\" row, Sunday is listed as \"b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\".\n   - In the \"mongolian (tibetan)\" row, Sunday corresponds to \"nyam\".\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:** The claim uses \"subota\", which does not match either of these entries.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false. To verify, examine columns 6 in rows 20 and 21 of the table provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"is_correct\": false,\n    \"reason\": \"Sunday in Mongolian (numerical) is 'b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r', and in Tibetan Mongolian it's 'nyam'. Neither matches 'subota'.\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_index\": 6 },\n      { \"row_index\": 21, \"column_index\": 6 }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
