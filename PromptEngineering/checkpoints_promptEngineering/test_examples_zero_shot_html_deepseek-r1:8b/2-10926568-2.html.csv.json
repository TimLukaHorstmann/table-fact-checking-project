    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about an episode title is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the title of the episode that aired on March 31, 2008, be 'new york : secret societies'\". So, the claim is specifically about an episode that aired on March 31, 2008, and its title.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. My goal is to find the row where the original airdate is March 31, 2008, and then check the corresponding episode title.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's original airdate:\n\n- Row 15: January 28, 2008\n- Row 16: February 4, 2008\n- Row 17: February 11, 2008\n- Row 18: February 25, 2008\n- Row 19: March 3, 2008\n- Row 20: March 10, 2008\n- Row 21: March 17, 2008\n- Row 22: March 24, 2008\n- Row 23: March 31, 2008\n- Row 24: April 14, 2008\n- ... and so on.\n\nI see that the original airdate for row 23 is March 31, 2008. That's the row we need to check for the episode title.\n\nLooking at row 23, under the \"episode title\" column, it says \"new york : secret societies\". This matches exactly with the claim provided.\n\nSo, since the title of the episode that aired on March 31, 2008, is indeed \"new york : secret societies\", the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones in row 23 (since it's the specific row) and the \"episode title\" column, as those contain the information needed to verify the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row_index 23 and column_name \"episode title\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"episode number 202 air on february 4 , 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"episode number 202.\" Looking at the table, there's a column called \"episode no,\" which I assume stands for episode number. So, I should look for row where \"episode no\" is 202. \n\nNext, the claim says that this episode aired on February 4, 2008. The table has an \"original airdate\" column, so I need to check if the date for episode number 202 matches February 4, 2008.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to find where \"episode no\" is 202 and then check the corresponding \"original airdate.\"\n\nStarting from the first row, production no 15 has episode no 201. Moving down, I see:\n\n- Row 1: production 16, episode 202, airdate February 4, 2008.\nWait, that's exactly what the claim is saying. So, in row index 1 (since it starts from 0), the \"episode no\" is 202, and the \"original airdate\" is February 4, 2008.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are met. The episode number matches, and the airdate matches.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"the title of the episode that aired on January 28, 2008, was 'Vietnam' hosted by Don Wildman.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the relevant information. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nThe table has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. I'm looking for the episode that aired on January 28, 2008. So I'll check the 'original airdate' column for that date.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 1 (production 15) has an airdate of January 28, 2008.\n- Row 2 (production 16) is February 4, 2008.\nWait, no, let me list them properly:\n\nRow 0: Jan 28, 2008\nRow 1: Feb 4, 2008\nRow 2: Feb 11, 2008\nRow 3: Feb 25, 2008\nRow 4: Mar 3, 2008\n... up to Row 13: May 5, 2008.\n\nSo the first row (row index 0) has the airdate of January 28, 2008. Now, I need to check what the episode title and host were for that row.\n\nLooking at the 'episode title' column for row 0, it's \"underground apocalypse.\" Hmm, but the claim says the title was \"Vietnam.\" So that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait no, in the table provided, each row is a different production number. So the first row (production 15) has the airdate of January 28, 2008, and the episode title is \"underground apocalypse.\"\n\nBut the claim says the title was \"Vietnam.\" That seems incorrect because according to the table, the title for that date is not Vietnam but underground apocalypse.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again: looking at the HTML code, each <tr> represents a row. The first row after <thead> is:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>15</td>\n  <td>201</td>\n  <td>january 28 , 2008</td>\n  <td>underground apocalypse</td>\n  <td>don wildman</td>\n</tr>\n\nYes, so production 15, episode 201, aired on Jan 28, 2008, and the title is \"underground apocalypse.\"\n\nSo the claim is stating that the episode title was \"Vietnam,\" but according to the table, it's \"underground apocalypse.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The claim says \"the title of the episode that air in january 28 , 2008 be vietnam host by don wildman.\" So they're saying the title was Vietnam. But according to the table, it's not Vietnam; it's underground apocalypse. Also, the host is correctly Don Wildman.\n\nSo the only discrepancy is the title. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the episode title on that date wasn't Vietnam but underground apocalypse.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the episode titled \"Vietnam\" aired on January 28, 2008, hosted by Don Wildman. However, upon reviewing the table, the episode airing on that date is actually titled \"underground apocalypse,\" not \"Vietnam.\" Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"host\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"episode number 213 air on january 28 , 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions episode number 213 airing on January 28, 2008. So I need to check if there's an entry in the table where the episode number is 213 and the original airdate is January 28, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. The relevant columns for the claim are \"episode no\" and \"original airdate\". So I should focus on these two columns.\n\nNow, let's scan through each row to find where episode number 213 is located. Starting from row 0:\n\n- Row 0: production no 15, episode no 201\n- Row 1: production no 16, episode no 202\n- ...\n- Continuing this way until I reach the relevant episode.\n\nLooking at the rows, I notice that the episode number increments by 1 each time. So row 26 has production no 26 and episode no 212. Then row 27 would be:\n\nRow 27: production no 27, episode no 213, original airdate May 5, 2008.\n\nWait a second, the claim says that episode 213 aired on January 28, 2008, but according to the table, it actually aired much later in May. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nNext, I should check if any other rows have episode number 213. Since each row increments production no and episode no, I don't think there are two episodes with the same number. So the only relevant row is row 27 with episode no 213.\n\nNow, comparing the original airdate in that row (May 5, 2008) to the claim's date (January 28, 2008), they don't match. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because episode number 213 didn't air on January 28, 2008\u2014it aired in May instead.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
