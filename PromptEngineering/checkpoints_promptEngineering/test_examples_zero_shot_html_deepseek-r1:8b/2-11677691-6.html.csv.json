    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my decision. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"Stanford have a linebacker from Lessburg High School.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Stanford has any players in the table who went to Lessburg High School and are listed as linebacks.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a player with their position. The relevant columns here are \"player,\" \"position,\" \"school,\" \"hometown,\" and \"college.\" Since the claim is about Stanford having a linebacker from Lessburg, I need to find if any player's college is Stanford, their position is linebacker, and their high school is Lessburg.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Mario Edwards Jr.: Position is defensive line, so not a linebacker. High school is Ryan, which isn't Lessburg.\n2. Ellis McCarthy: Defensive line again. School is Monrovia. Not relevant.\n3. Noah Spence: Bishop McDevitt high school. Not Lessburg.\n4. Tommy Schutt: Glenbard West. Not relevant.\n5. Darius Hamilton: Don Bosco. No.\n6. Vince Biegel: Lincoln High. College is Wisconsin, not Stanford.\n7. Scott Starr: Norco High. Southern California.\n8. Noor Davis: Lessburg High School! Wait, let me check her position. It's linebacker. Her college is Stanford. So this fits the claim.\n\nSo, there is a player from Lessburg High School who is a linebacker at Stanford. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. Looking at Noor Davis's row: row index 8 (since it's zero-based), columns are \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"college.\" So I need to include those.\n\nWait, but does \"lessburg high school\" match exactly? The hometown is Leesburg, Florida, and the high school is Lessburg. Hmm, sometimes there might be typos or different spellings. But in this case, it's spelled as lessburg high school, so it matches.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 8, columns \"position\" (linebacker), \"school\" (lessburg high school), and \"college\" (stanford). Wait, but in the table, the column names are \"player,\" \"position,\" \"school,\" etc. So for each relevant cell, I need to specify the column name.\n\nNoor Davis is at row index 8, her position is linebacker, school is lessburg high school, and college is stanford. So all three columns are relevant because they confirm the claim: Stanford has a linebacker from Lessburg High School.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with those cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the HTML table provided. It has several columns: player, position, school, hometown, and college. The task is to find any cells that might relate to Stanford having a linebacker from Norco High School.\n\nI know that the claim mentions two specific things: the player's position is linebacker and their high school is Norco. So I need to check if there's a player in the table who is a linebacker from Norco High School and attends Stanford.\n\nLooking through the table row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Mario Edwards Jr. - Defensive Line, Ryan HS, Denton TX, Florida State. No mention of Stanford.\n2. **Row 1:** Ellis McCarthy - Defensive Line, Monrovia HS, Monrovia CA, UCLA. Not relevant.\n3. **Row 2:** Noah Spence - Defensive Line, Bishop McDevitt HS, Harrisburg PA, Ohio State. Not relevant.\n4. **Row 3:** Tommy Schutt - Defensive Line, Glenbard West HS, Glen Ellyn IL, Ohio State. No.\n5. **Row 4:** Darius Hamilton - Defensive Line, Don Bosco Prep HS, Ramsey NJ, Rutgers. Not Stanford.\n6. **Row 5:** Vince Biegel - Linebacker, Lincoln HS, Wisconsin Rapids WI, Wisconsin. Position is linebacker but high school isn't Norco.\n7. **Row 6:** Scott Starr - Linebacker, Norco HS, Norco CA, Southern California (USC). Here's a potential match: position is linebacker and high school is Norco. But the college is USC, not Stanford. So this might be a false lead.\n8. **Row 7:** Noor Davis - Linebacker, Lessburg HS, Leesburg FL, Stanford. College is Stanford, but high school is Lessburg, which isn't Norco.\n9. **Row 8:** Shaq Thompson - Defensive Back, Grant Union HS, Sacramento CA, Washington. Not relevant as position is defensive back and high school isn't Norco.\n10. **Row 9:** Landon Collins - Defensive Back, Dutchtown HS, Geismar LA, Alabama. Not applicable.\n11. **Row 10:** Leon McQuay III - Defensive Back, Armwood HS, Seffner FL, Southern California. Position is defensive back, not linebacker.\n12. **Row 11:** Tracy Howard - Defensive Back, Miramar HS, Miramar FL, Miami (FL). Again, position isn't linebacker.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 6, Scott Starr's high school is Norco, and his college is Southern California. So he's a linebacker from Norco but not at Stanford. That doesn't support the claim. Then, looking further, I realize that Noor Davis in Row 7 goes to Stanford, but his high school isn't Norco.\n\nSo none of the players listed are both a linebacker and from Norco High School while attending Stanford. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because there's no player at Stanford who fits those criteria.\n\nI should also check if there are any other players with similar details. Scanning through again, I don't see any linebackers from Norco HS attended by Stanford. The closest is Scott Starr, but he goes to USC. So the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Stanford has a linebacker from Norco High School. After examining each row of the table, it's evident that while there are players from Norco High School in the table, none of them attend Stanford. For example, Scott Starr is from Norco but attends Southern California (USC), and Noor Davis attends Stanford but from a different high school.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. **Identify positions and schools:** Look for players with the position \"linebacker\" and high school \"Norco High School.\"\n2. **Check colleges:** Verify if any such players attend Stanford.\n3. **Review each row:** None of the players meet both criteria; Scott Starr is from Norco but attends USC, while Noor Davis attends Stanford but isn't from Norco.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
