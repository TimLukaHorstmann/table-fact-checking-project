    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the home team, fitzroy, lose to the away team, south melbourne, 12.15 (87) to 11.22 (88).\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two teams: Fitzroy as the home team and South Melbourne as the away team. The scores are given as 12.15 (87) for South Melbourne and 11.22 (88) for Fitzroy.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, their score, away team, etc. I need to find if there's a row where Fitzroy is the home team playing against South Melbourne as the away team with those specific scores.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Home team is Fitzroy, scored 11.22 (88). Away team is South Melbourne, scored 12.15 (87). So the scores match the claim but reversed: Fitzroy is home and South Melbourne is away, with their respective scores as given.\n\nWait, the claim says that the home team (Fitzroy) loses to the away team (South Melbourne), so according to the score, who won? Let's see: 12.15 (87) vs 11.22 (88). Since in Australian rules football, higher points mean victory. So South Melbourne scored 87 and Fitzroy scored 88. That would mean Fitzroy actually won, not lost.\n\nBut the claim says that Fitzroy loses to South Melbourne with those scores. That's a contradiction because if Fitzroy scored more, they should have won. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo I need to check which cells are relevant. The home team is Fitzroy (row 0), their score is 11.22 (88) (column 1). The away team is South Melbourne (row 0), their score is 12.15 (87) (column 3). So the relevant cells are row_index 0 for both home team and away team's scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Fitzroy lost to South Melbourne with scores 11.22 (88) and 12.15 (87), respectively. However, since Fitzroy scored higher (88 vs. 87), they won the game, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a specific claim about a sports game is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the crowd for the game on May 15, 1976 between Carlton and Richmond be 30095.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game.\n\nThe claim mentions May 15, 1976, which is the date of one of the games in the table. I should look for that specific date in the 'date' column to find the relevant row. Scanning through each row's date, I see that the fifth row (row index 4) has the date \"15 may 1976\". So this is the game between Melbourne and Hawthorn.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check again. The first row after the headers is row 0: May 15, 1976, Carlton vs Richmond? No, looking back at the table:\n\n- Row 1 (index 0): fitzroy vs south melbourne\n- Row 2 (index 1): carlton vs richmond\n- Row 3 (index 2): melbourne vs hawthorn\n- Row 4 (index 3): geelong vs footscray\n- Row 5 (index 4): st kilda vs essendon\n- Row 6 (index 5): collingwood vs north melbourne\n\nWait, no. The first row after the headers is fitzroy at home, then second row is Carlton hosting Richmond. So when I look for May 15, it's the same date in all rows? Let me check each date:\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 0: 15 may 1976\n- Row 1: 15 may 1976\n- All rows have the same date. That can't be right because usually, a venue hosts one game per day. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait no, looking again at the table:\n\nIn the <tbody> section, there are six rows. Each row has the same date: May 15, 1976. That seems odd because it's unlikely that all games happened on the same day unless they're multiple games in one day, but for the purpose of this task, I have to consider each row as a separate game.\n\nBut according to the claim, the game is between Carlton and Richmond on May 15, 1976. So I need to find the row where the home team is Carlton and the away team is Richmond.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 0: fitzroy vs south melbourne\n- Row 1: carlton vs richmond\n- Row 2: melbourne vs hawthorn\n- Row 3: geelong vs footscray\n- Row 4: st kilda vs essendon\n- Row 5: collingwood vs north melbourne\n\nSo row index 1 is Carlton (home) vs Richmond (away). That's the game in question.\n\nNow, check the crowd number for that specific game. The 'crowd' column for this row (row index 1) has a value of 30095. So the claim says the crowd was 30095, which matches exactly with the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the crowd for that game on May 15, 1976, between Carlton and Richmond is indeed 30095.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd for the game on May 15, 1976, between Carlton and Richmond was 30,095. By examining the table, we find that this specific row (index 1) has a crowd of 30,095. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim might be referring to an older game on May 15, but it's important to check.\n\nNext, I'll look at the teams involved. The claim says \"melboume\" and \"hawthom.\" In the table, there is a team named \"melbourne\" (without the 'u' in boume) and \"hawthorn\" (similar spelling but without an 'o'). So there's a possible typo here. The correct team names in the table are melbourne and hawthorn, not melboume and hawthom as stated in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if the crowd number matches.
