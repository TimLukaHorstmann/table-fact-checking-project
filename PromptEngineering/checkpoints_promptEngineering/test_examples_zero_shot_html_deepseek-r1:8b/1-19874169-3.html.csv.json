The claim is: \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro be the branding for the call sign dxyr.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two specific elements from the table: the branding and the callsign. It's stating that the branding \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" corresponds to the callsign \"dxyr.\"\n\nLooking at the HTML table provided, it has several rows with different stations. Each row includes the branding, callsign, frequency, power in kW, and location.\n\nI should start by identifying which parts of the claim correspond to the table data. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Branding**: \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\"\n2. **Callsign**: \"dxyr\"\n\nSo, I need to find a row in the table where the callsign is \"dxyr\" and check if the corresponding branding matches.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Callsign: dwys\n  - Branding: yes! fm 101.1\n\nNot matching.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Callsign: dzvm\n  - Branding: yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\n\nNope.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Callsign: dyyr\n  - Branding: yes! fm 91.1 boracay\n\nNot this one either.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Callsign: dyyd\n  - Branding: yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\n\nStill not matching.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Callsign: dxyr\n  - Branding: yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\n\nAha, this row has the callsign \"dxyr\" and the branding exactly as stated in the claim.\n\nSo, the claim is asserting that \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" is the branding for \"dxyr.\" From the table, this is indeed true because in the fifth (fourth index) row, callsign dxyr corresponds to that exact branding.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"callsign\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"branding\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz.\" So, it's stating that a radio station named \"yes! fm\" is broadcasting at 101.1 MHz.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's a row where the branding is \"yes! fm\" and the frequency matches 101.1 mhz. The table has five rows, each representing different stations.\n\nLet me examine each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Branding is \"yes! fm 101.1\", callsign is dwys, frequency is 101.1 mhz, power is 25 kw, location is metro manila.\n   - Here, the branding starts with \"yes! fm\" and the station name includes \"101.1\". So, this seems to match both parts of the claim.\n\n2. **Second Row**: Branding is \"yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\", callsign dzvm, frequency 104.1 mhz.\n   - The branding has \"yes! fm\" but the frequency is different (104.1), so this doesn't match.\n\n3. **Third Row**: Branding \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\", frequency 91.1 mhz.\n   - Again, \"yes! fm\" but a different frequency.\n\n4. **Fourth and Fifth Rows**: Similar patterns but frequencies are 106.3 and 104.7 respectively, none of which is 101.1.\n\nSo, only the first row matches both conditions: branding starts with \"yes! fm\" and operates at exactly 101.1 mhz. \n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by this row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"branding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"frequency\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"1 kw be the power for yes! fm 91.1 boracay\". So, I'm looking for a station named \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" and check if its power is exactly 1 kilowatt.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location. Each row represents a different radio station with various details.\n\nI need to find the row where the branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\". Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: branding is \"yes! fm 101.1\"\n- Row 1: branding is \"yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\"\n- Row 2: branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" \u2192 This matches.\n- Row 3: branding is \"yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\"\n- Row 4: branding is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\"\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 2.\n\nNext, I need to check the power (kw) for this station. Looking at column 'power (kw)', row 2 has \"1 kw\". \n\nNow, does this support the claim? The claim says that \"1 kw be the power\" for that specific branding. Since in row 2, the power is indeed 1 kw and the location matches \"boracay\", all details align.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. Now, I need to specify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones that confirm both the station's name and its power. So, for row 2, the 'branding' and 'power (kw)' columns are important because they directly address the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include both \"branding\" and \"power (kw)\" from row 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power (kw)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the frequency for callsign dxyr be from brand yes! fm 101.1\". \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of this claim means and which parts need to be checked in the table. \n\nThe key elements here are:\n- The callsign is \"dxyr\".\n- The frequency needs to be verified.\n- The brand is \"yes! fm 101.1\".\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location.\n\nI'll start by searching for the row where the callsign is \"dxyr\". Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: callsign dwys \u2013 not dxyr.\nRow 1: callsign dzvm \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: callsign dyyr \u2013 no, different from dxyr.\nRow 3: callsign dyyd \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: callsign dxyr \u2013 yes, this is the row we need.\n\nSo the relevant row is row index 4. Now, I need to check which columns are relevant for the claim. \n\nThe claim mentions two things: the frequency and the brand associated with \"dxyr\". So I should look at the 'frequency' column and the 'branding' column in this row.\n\nIn row 4, under 'branding', it says \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\". Wait, that doesn't match \"yes! fm 101.1\" from the claim. That's a discrepancy.\n\nUnder 'frequency', it's \"104.7 mhz\". The claim says \"be from brand yes! fm 101.1\", so I'm guessing it refers to the frequency of 101.1 MHz, which is in row 0 for callsign dwys. But that's not dxyr.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is trying to say that the frequency of dxyr is 104.7 mhz, but the brand associated with dxyr is different from what's stated. The claim says it should be \"yes! fm 101.1\", which isn't the case for dxyr. So actually, the branding in row 4 is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\". \n\nSo putting this together: The callsign dxyr has a frequency of 104.7 mhz and is part of brand yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro. Therefore, the claim that its frequency comes from yes! fm 101.1 is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is mixing up two different stations. The \"yes! fm 101.1\" has callsign dwys, which is in row 0. So dxyr's details are separate.\n\nThus, since the brand and frequency for dxyr don't match what the claim states, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a different radio station.\n\nThe claim mentions \"dyyd\" as the callsign. So, I should look for rows where the callsign column is \"dyyd.\" Let's check each row:\n\n1. Row 0: callsign is \"dwys\" \u2013 not dyyd.\n2. Row 1: callsign is \"dzvm\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: callsign is \"dyyr\" \u2013 close, but not dyyd.\n4. Row 3: callsign is \"dyyd\" \u2013 yes! So row index 3 has the callsign dyyd.\n\nNext, the claim specifies the branding as \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\" Let me check the 'branding' column for this exact string. \n\nLooking at each row's branding:\n- Row 2: \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" \u2013 that's a match.\n\nThe claim also mentions a power of 1 kw. So I need to check the 'power (kw)' column for this value in the same row as the matching callsign and branding.\n\nIn row 3, the power is 10 kw \u2013 which doesn't match the 1 kw mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, that's an issue. The claim says 1 kw, but the corresponding row has 10 kw. So does that mean the claim is false?\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another row where callsign is dyyd with branding yes! fm 91.1 boracay? No, only row 3 matches both callsign and branding.\n\nSo, in row 3, the power is 10 kw, not 1 kw as stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim's second condition isn't met, which makes the entire claim false.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to check if all conditions are fully supported by the table.

The callsign should be \"dyyr\".\n2. The branding should be \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\".\n\nI need to check each row of the table to see if any match both conditions.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: branding is \"yes! fm 101.1\", callsign \"dwys\". Doesn't match.\nRow 1: branding is \"yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\", callsign \"dzvm\". No match.\nRow 2: branding is \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\", callsign \"dyyr\".

No match.\nRow 4: branding is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\", callsign \"dxyr\". Here, the callsign is dxyr, which doesn't match \"dyyr\". But wait, the claim says \"dyyr\" as the call sign for that branding.\n\nWait, in row 4, the callsign is dxyr. So does that mean no? Because the claim's call sign doesn't match. But let me double-check each cell.\n\nThe relevant cells are where the branding matches \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" and the callsign matches \"dyyr\". Looking through the table:\n\nLooking at each row's branding column:\n- Only row 4 has the correct branding: \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\".\n\nNow, in row 4, the callsign is dxyr. The claim says it should be dyyr. So this doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. In row 2, the callsign is dyyr for Boracay station. Row 4 has a different callsign, dxyr.\n\nSo the correct cells to check would be the ones where branding is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" and callsign is \"dyyr\". But in that row, the callsign isn't dyyr; it's dxyr. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the call sign doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. Let me make sure. Each row has a branding, which includes the frequency and location as part of the name. So yes, row 4 is correct for the branding but wrong for the callsign.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 4, columns 1 (callsign) and 0 (branding). But since the call sign doesn't match, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that \"dyyr\" is the callsign for a specific radio station.
