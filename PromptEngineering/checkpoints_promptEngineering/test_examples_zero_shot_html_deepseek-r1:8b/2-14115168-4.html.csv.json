The claim states: \"both the bellevue bruin and the york panther play in the midland conference.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: checking if Bellevue Bruin plays in the Midlands Conference and if York Panther also does so.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the rows corresponding to \"Bellevue University\" and \"York College.\" \n\nStarting with Bellevue University:\n- The school is listed in row 0.\n- The mascot is \"Bellevue Bruins.\"\n- The conference is \"Midlands.\"\n\nSince the conference for Bellevue University is Midlands, this part of the claim holds true.\n\nNext, checking York College:\n- The school is in row 8 (since there are 9 rows, with indices from 0 to 8).\n- The mascot is \"York Panthers.\"\n- Looking at the conference column, it's also \"Midlands.\"\n\nSo both Bellevue Bruin and York Panther are indeed in the Midlands Conference. \n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant. For Bellevue University, it's row 0, columns \"mascot\" and \"conference.\" For York College, it's row 8, same two columns.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to \"both...bellevue bruin and york panther.\" The table shows mascots as \"Bellevue Bruins\" and \"York Panthers,\" which matches. Also, their conferences are both Midlands. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells would be:\n- Bellevue University's mascot (row 0) and conference.\n- York College's mascot (row 8) and conference.\n\nSo I should include these two rows and columns in relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"According to the date of founding, Peru State College be the oldest.\" So, I need to verify if Peru State College is indeed the oldest based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should look at the 'founded' column in the table since it relates directly to the age of each institution. The claim specifically mentions Peru State College, so I'll focus on its row in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, Peru State College is listed in the sixth row with a founding year of 1865. Now, I need to check if this makes it the oldest among all the listed institutions. \n\nI'll go through each row's 'founded' year:\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nComparing these, the earliest founding year is 1865 for Peru State College.

The claim is: \"only 1 school, york college, have won more than 20 titles.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'national titles' column in the table because that's what the claim is referring to. Each row represents a different school and their number of national titles.\n\nI see York College has 28 national titles. Now, I need to check if any other schools have more than 20 titles. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 titles - less than 20.\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles - way below.\n3. Concordia University: 1 title - nope.\n4. Doane College: 10 titles - still under.\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles - not enough.\n6. Midland University: 2 titles - nope.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles - almost there, but just under 20.\n8. Peru State College: 2 titles - not relevant.\n9. York College: 28 titles - meets the criteria.\n\nWait a second, that's two schools with more than 20 titles. York has 28 and Nebraska Wesleyan has 19? No, wait, 19 is less than 20. So only York College meets the \"more than 20\" threshold. \n\nLet me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't misread any of them.\n\n- York: 28\n- Nebraska Wesleyan: 19\n\nYes, so only York has more than 20 titles.

It has several columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. Each row represents a different institution.\n\nThe key points in the claim are:\n1. The college of Saint Mary has 0 national titles.\n2. This is the lowest number among all institutions listed.\n\nI'll need to check two things: whether Saint Mary's national title count is indeed 0 and whether that's the lowest.\n\nLooking through each row, I see that:\n\n- Bellevue University has 14 titles.\n- College of Saint Mary has 0.\n- Concordia University has 1.\n- Doane College has 10.\n- Hastings College has 3.\n- Midland University has 2.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University has 19.\n- Peru State College has 2.\n- York College has 28.\n\nSo, the national titles range from 0 up to 28. The lowest is 0, which is Saint Mary's count. No other institution in the table has fewer than that.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data. I should confirm that the relevant cell is indeed Saint Mary's row and the 'national titles' column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index for College of Saint Mary: looking at the HTML, it's the second row (index 1), but since indexing starts at 0 in the example, maybe it's 1. Wait, no, in the sample JSON, the first row is index 0. So in the table provided, each row has a tr tag, so I need to count them.\n\nWait, the HTML has 9 rows.

The claim is: \"in term of its founding date , the youngest school be bellevue university.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's talking about the founding date of each school and which one is the youngest. So the claim is asserting that Bellevue University is the youngest because it has the latest founding date.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several schools with their founded year. The task is to check if Bellevue University has the most recent founding year compared to others. If that's the case, then the claim would be true; otherwise, false.\n\nNow, let me go through each row in the table and note down the school names along with their founding years.\n\n1. Bellevue University was founded in 1966.\n2. College of Saint Mary in 1923.\n3. Concordia University in 1894.\n4. Doane College in 1872.\n5. Hastings College in 1882.\n6.

The table has several columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The claim mentions Peru State College specifically, so I should focus on its row.\n\nLooking for Peru State College in the table, I find it's in the last row (row_index 7). Its \"founded\" year is 1865. That's actually in the mid-19th century, not towards the end. \n\nNow, checking other institutions to see if any were founded later in the 19th century after Peru State.

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data.\n\nThe claim is: \"the Bellevue Bruins be the only Nebraska team to play in the Midland Conference.\" Hmm, okay. So the key points here are that Bellevue Bruins are a Nebraska team (even though their name might suggest being from Bellevue, maybe it's Bellevue University?) and that they're the only ones from Nebraska playing in the Midland Conference.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different school with various attributes like mascot, conference, etc. The columns relevant to this claim are likely \"school\", \"mascot\", \"conference\", and maybe \"national titles\" but probably not directly relevant here.\n\nFirst, I need to check if Bellevue University is listed in the table as a Nebraska institution playing in the Midland Conference. Let me look through each row:\n\n- Bellevue University is in the first row. Its conference is \"Midlands\".\n- Checking other schools: College of Saint Mary, Concordia University, Doane College, Hastings College, Midland University, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Peru State College, York College.\n\nNow, which of these are in Nebraska? Well, Bellevue University is based in Nebraska, I believe. The others: College of Saint Mary might be Nebraska, but sometimes \"Nebraska\" could refer to the state or something else. Wait, no, actually, College of Saint Mary is in Nebraska as well. Similarly, Peru State College is in Peru, Nebraska.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the only Nebraska team,\" so I need to check which schools are from Nebraska and which conferences they belong to.\n\nLooking at each school:\n\n1. Bellevue University: Conference is Midlands. It's a Nebraska school.\n2. College of Saint Mary: Also in Nebraska? Maybe. Conference is Midlands.\n3. Concordia University: In Nebraska, conference Great Plains.\n4. Doane College: Nebraska, Great Plains.\n5. Hastings College: Nebraska, Great Plains.\n6. Midland University: Nebraska, Great Plains.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: Nebraska, Great Plains.\n8. Peru State College: Nebraska, Midlands.\n9. York College: Nebraska, Midlands.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the Bellevue Bruins being the only Nebraska team in the Midland Conference. So I need to see if any other Nebraska schools are in the Midland Conference besides Bellevue.\n\nLooking at conferences:\n\nMidlands: Bellevue University, Peru State College, College of Saint Mary, York College.\n\nGreat Plains: Concordia, Doane, Hastings, Midland, Nebraska Wesleyan.\n\nSo within the Midlands conference, there are multiple Nebraska schools: Bellevue U, Peru State, St. Mary's, York.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Bellevue Bruins are the only Nebraska team in Midland is false because there are others like Peru State College and York College also playing in the Midlands conference from Nebraska.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. The schools in Midlands are:\n\n- Bellevue University\n- College of Saint Mary\n- Peru State College\n- York College\n\nAll four are listed as part of the Midlands conference, so they're all Nebraska schools.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because there are other Nebraska teams (Peru State and York) also playing in the Midland Conference.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. Now, to find which cells are relevant: we need to identify the rows where school is from Nebraska and conference is Midlands. Because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Bellevue U, Midlands - Nebraska, so relevant.\nRow 1: St. Mary's, Midlands - Nebraska.\nRow 4: Peru State, Midlands - Nebraska.\nRow 8: York College, Midlands - Nebraska.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, the rows are numbered from 0 to 8. So row indices 0 (Bellevue), 1 (St. Mary's), 4 (Peru State), and 8 (York). But the claim is only about Bellevue being the only one, so the relevant cells would be all those where school is Nebraska and conference is Midlands.\n\nBut perhaps the task is to find all cells that are from Nebraska and in Midlands conference because they disprove the claim. So, for each row where school is Nebraska (all except maybe some) and conference is Midlands.\n\nWait, actually, the table shows:\n\nSchools in Midlands: Bellevue, St Mary's, Peru State, York.\n\nAll these four are Nebraska schools. Therefore, all their rows are relevant because they show other Nebraska teams besides Bellevue in Midlands.\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be all these four rows: row 0,1,4,8.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nRow 0: Bellevue U - Nebraska, Midlands.\nRow 1: St Mary's - Nebraska, Midlands.\nRow 4: Peru State - Nebraska, Midlands.\nRow 8: York College - Nebraska, Midlands.\n\nYes, that's four rows. But the claim is about Bellevue being the only one, so these four are relevant because they show others as well.\n\nSo, in the JSON, I need to include all these row indices and column names (which is \"conference\" since it shows they're in Midlands).\n\nWait, but the instruction says: If fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.

Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nThe relevant data points are all rows where the school is from Nebraska and the conference is Midlands:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Bellevue University - Nebraska, Midlands\n2. **Row 1**: College of Saint Mary - Nebraska, Midlands\n3. **Row 4**: Peru State College - Nebraska, Midlands\n4. **Row 8**: York College - Nebraska, Midlands\n\nThese rows demonstrate that the claim is false as there are other Nebraska teams in the same conference.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"false\",\n  \"relevant_rows\": [\n    { \"index\": 0, \"column\": \"conference\" },\n    { \"index\": 1, \"column\": \"conference\" },\n    { \"index\": 4, \"column\": \"conference\" },\n    { \"index\": 8, \"column\": \"conference\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

So my task is to check how many national titles each institution has from the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several rows, each representing a different school along with their mascot, conference, number of national titles, and the year they were founded. The relevant column here is \"national titles.\" \n\nI need to focus on Saint Mary's row specifically. From the table, Saint Mary has 0 national titles.

The claim says they hold the highest number, which is false. \n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells. The \"national titles\" column is where the comparison happens, so all rows in that column are relevant. Each row's index and the column name should be noted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because Saint Mary does not hold the most national titles.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"bellevue university be the first college found in the 20th century\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It says Bellevue University was the first college founded in the 20th century. So, I need to check when Bellevue University was founded and see if it's indeed the earliest among all the listed colleges in that century.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different college with details like school name, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded year. I'll focus on the \"founded\" column for this task.\n\nI'll start by identifying Bellevue University's entry. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. Bellevue University is in row 0 (row_index: 0) under the 'founded' column with the value 1966.\n2. The next entries are College of Saint Mary (1923), Concordia University (1894), Doane College (1872), Hastings College (1882), Midland University (1883), Nebraska Wesleyan University (1887), Peru State College (1865), and York College (1890).\n\nNow, the claim is about the 20th century. The 20th century runs from 1901 to 2000. So any college founded in this period would qualify.\n\nLooking at the \"founded\" years:\n\n- Bellevue University: 1966 (20th century)\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923 (also 20th century, as it's between 1901-2000)\n- Concordia University: 1894 (19th century)\n- Doane College: 1872 (19th century)\n- Hastings College: 1882 (19th century)\n- Midland University: 1883 (19th century)\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887 (19th century)\n- Peru State College: 1865 (19th century)\n- York College: 1890 (19th century)\n\nSo, among the listed colleges, Bellevue is one of several that were founded in the 20th century. However, the claim says it's \"the first college found\" in that century. To check this, I need to see which of these colleges have a founded year earliest within the 20th century.\n\nThe earliest among them would be the one with the smallest \"founded\" year in the 1900s. Let's list the 20th-century entries:\n\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n\nSo, College of Saint Mary was founded earlier in the 20th century than Bellevue. That means Bellevue wasn't the first college in that century; someone else was.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because another college (College of Saint Mary) was established earlier in the 20th century.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because College of Saint Mary was founded in 1923, which is earlier than Bellevue University's 1966 founding year within the 20th century.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
