    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"both of Kelly Dullanty's losses have come in the first round.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Kelly Dullanty even exists in the table. Looking at the 'record' column, I see names like Lance Wipf, Matt Serra, Nuri Shakir, Rudy Vallederas, Duane Ludwig, and Shad Smith. I don't see any mention of Kelly Dullanty here. That makes me think that maybe she's not in this table at all.\n\nIf Kelly Dullanty isn't in the table, then it's impossible for her losses to be in the first round because there are no records of her fights. So, if the claim says both of her losses came in the first round, but she doesn't have any fights listed here, the statement must be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check the table again to ensure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Lance Wipf: loss, 4-2, KO punch, PureCombat event, round 1.\n2. Matt Serra: loss, 4-1, submission, UFC 36, round 1.\n3. Nuri Shakir: win, 4-0, decision, IFC WC 13, round 4.\n4. Rudy Vallederas: win, 3-0, TKO, same event as above, round n/a.\n5. Duane Ludwig: win, 2-0, decision, KotC 6, round 3.\n6. Shad Smith: win, 1-0, TKO strikes, KotC 3, round 1.\n\nNo Kelly Dullanty here. So the claim is making a statement about her losses, but there's no data to support that. Therefore, it's false because either she doesn't exist in this table, or her losses aren't recorded here. Either way, the claim can't be fully supported by the given data.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells would be all the rows where the 'record' column has a loss, just in case there's another Kelly Dullanty somewhere not shown, but I think it's irrelevant here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Kelly Dullanty's wins is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and cross-reference it with the table.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"2 of Kelly Dullanty's win be by decision, and each last at least 3 rounds.\" So, I need to check if there are two instances where Kelly Dullanty won by a decision, and each of these wins occurred in at least three rounds.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the \"record\" column shows the result of each fight, the opponent, method, event, round, etc. Let's go through each row to find Kelly Dullanty's wins.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014Kelly Dullanty isn't listed in any of the opponents' names in the table. The opponents are lance wipf, matt serra, nuri shakir, rudy vallederas, duane ludwig, and shad smith. None of these names is Kelly Dullanty. So maybe there's a mistake here. Perhaps the claim refers to someone else, or perhaps Kelly Dullanty isn't in this table.\n\nIf Kelly Dullanty isn't present as an opponent, then she might not have any wins listed in this table. Therefore, checking if two of her wins were by decision isn't possible because there are no records of her winning in the first place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Kelly Dullanty is the fighter, and I need to look for her name in the \"opponent\" column. But again, none of the opponents match her name. So either she's not present, or perhaps the table only lists opponents, not fighters.\n\nAssuming the table lists all relevant fights where she participated, if Kelly Dullanty isn't there, then she has zero wins. Therefore, she can't have two decision wins because there are none. \n\nAlso, regarding the second part of the claim about each win lasting at least three rounds\u2014without any wins to check, this condition also fails.\n\nAnother angle: maybe \"Kelly Dullanty\" is a misprint or refers to a different fighter. If it's supposed to be someone else, like Kelly Reuben or another similar name, but without more context, I can't assume that.\n\nGiven the information provided, there's no data supporting the claim because Kelly Dullanty isn't present in any of the opponent rows, hence no wins to evaluate. Therefore, the claim is based on incorrect assumptions or missing data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions a technical knockout via strikes deciding two of Kelly's fights. So, I'm looking for rows where \"res\" is either \"win\" or \"loss,\" but more importantly, the method used in those wins should be a knockout by strikes. Also, it should be specifically two such instances.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a fight. The \"res\" column indicates whether it was a win or loss. The \"method\" column describes how the fighter won or lost. The \"record\" seems to show the fighter's stats in that fight.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row:\n\n1. **First Row**: res is loss, method is ko (punch). Doesn't match since it's a loss and not a win.\n2. **Second Row**: res is loss, method is submission. Not a knockout by strikes.\n3. **Third Row**: res is win, method is decision. Not a knockout; opponent was decided via points.\n4. **Fourth Row**: res is win, method is tko. This fits because it's a technical knockout, and Kelly won this fight.\n5. **Fifth Row**: res is win, method is decision. Again, not a knockout.\n6. **Sixth Row**: res is win, method is tko (strikes). Another fit as it's a technical knockout.\n\nSo, there are two rows where Kelly has wins via technical knockout by strikes. The claim says \"2 of Kelly's fights,\" so that matches. \n\nI need to find the relevant cells: row indices for these two wins and their \"method\" column.\n- Row 3 (index 3) and Row 5 (index 5). But wait, looking at the table, rows are zero-indexed in JSON but in the table, they start from row 1 as the first. So, the relevant rows are indices 3 and 5? Wait no: let's check the HTML. The <tbody> has six <tr> elements, so the first is index 0 (row 0), then 1, up to 5.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe table has six rows in the tbody:\n- First row: index 0\n- Second: index 1\n- Third: index 2\n- Fourth: index 3\n- Fifth: index 4\n- Sixth: index 5\n\nSo Kelly's two wins via tko are at rows 3 and 5. Therefore, their \"row_index\" is 3 and 5, and the column to check is \"method.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"Kelly's third win come against Rudy Vallederas by TKO, but outside of the typical round.\"\n\nFirst, I'll analyze each part of the claim:\n\n1. **\"Kelly's third win\":** The term \"third win\" suggests that Kelly has three wins in total. Looking at the table, each row represents either a win or a loss for someone named 'res'. So, I need to check if Kelly has exactly three wins.\n\n2. **Against Rudy Vallederas:** The claim mentions that one of Kelly's third wins was against Rudy Vallederas. Therefore, I need to find a row where the opponent is \"Rudy Vallederas\" and see if it's a win.\n\n3. **By TKO (Technical Knockout):** The method used in this particular win should be a TKO. So, the 'method' column for this row must be \"tko\".\n\n4. **But outside of the typical round:** This implies that the fight didn't end in a standard number of rounds, perhaps in a later or earlier round than usual. Looking at the table, the 'round' column is either 1, 3, 4, n/a (which probably stands for not applicable or unknown), etc.\n\nNow, I'll check each row in the table to see which ones are wins and against whom.\n\n- **Row 0:** Loss, so not relevant.\n- **Row 1:** Loss, same reason.\n- **Row 2:** Win against Nuri Shakir by decision.\n- **Row 3:** Win against Rudy Vallederas by TKO. This seems relevant because the opponent is Rudy and method is TKO.\n- **Row 4:** Win against Duane Ludwig by decision.\n- **Row 5:** Win against Shad Smith by TKO.\n\nNow, focusing on Kelly's wins:\n\nLooking at the 'res' column, I see that each row has either 'win' or 'loss'. The claim refers to \"Kelly's third win\", so Kelly must have three wins in total. Let me count the wins in the table:\n\nRow 2: Win (1)\nRow 3: Win (2)\nRow 4: Win (3)\nRow 5: Win (4)\n\nWait, that's four wins, not three. So there might be a misunderstanding here. Perhaps Kelly isn't the fighter in all these rows? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 2: res is 'win' but opponent is Nuri Shakir.\n- Row 3: res is 'win' against Rudy Vallederas by TKO.\n- Row 4: res is 'win' against Duane Ludwig.\n- Row 5: res is 'win' against Shad Smith.\n\nIf Kelly has four wins, then the claim about her third win might be incorrect. However, maybe Kelly only has three relevant wins, but I need to see how the table is structured.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a different fighter's record. The table's first column is the result for that particular fight (win or loss), and it's not clear if these are all under one fighter named Kelly. Alternatively, each row could be a different fighter's wins and losses. That would make more sense because otherwise, the table would be inconsistent.\n\nBut in the table, the 'res' column shows either 'loss' or 'win', which likely indicates the result of that particular fight for whoever is in the record column.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Row 3: res is 'win' (so Kelly won this fight), opponent is Rudy Vallederas by TKO. If this is her third win, then we need to see if she has exactly three wins in total.\n\nLooking at all rows where res is 'win':\n\nRow 2: Nuri Shakir - that's one.\nRow 3: Rudy Vallederas - two.\nRow 4: Duane Ludwig - three.\nRow 5: Shad Smith - four.\n\nSo Kelly would have four wins, not three. Therefore, the claim about her third win might be incorrect unless she only has three relevant wins in the table, but that's not clear.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"Kelly's third win come against Rudy Vallederas by TKO\". So regardless of how many total wins Kelly has, this particular win is her third. Therefore, even if she has more than three wins, this specific one is the third.\n\nWait, but in the table, Kelly's wins are:\n\nRow 2: Nuri Shakir (probably not Rudy)\nRow 3: Rudy Vallederas\nRow 4: Duane Ludwig\nRow 5: Shad Smith\n\nSo if Kelly has four wins, her third win would be against Duane Ludwig or Shad Smith, not Rudy. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the specific win against Rudy is actually her second win (if counting from Row 3 as first).\n\nWait, but how are we ordering the wins? The table doesn't specify the order of fights, so without knowing when these events occurred, it's impossible to determine which win is third. Therefore, the claim could be true or false depending on the context.\n\nHowever, the claim specifies that the win against Rudy was her third and by TKO outside a typical round. So I need to check if that particular fight meets both conditions.\n\nLooking at Row 3:\n\n- res: win\n- opponent: Rudy Vallederas\n- method: tko\n- event: ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\n- round: n / a\n\nSo the method is TKO, which matches. The location is California, but the claim mentions \"outside of the typical round.\" Looking at the 'round' column for this row, it's marked as n/a, which likely means not applicable or unknown. So that could imply that the fight didn't end in a standard number of rounds, making it outside typical.\n\nTherefore, Row 3 meets both criteria: win against Rudy by TKO and round is unknown (n/a). So the claim is correct about this particular win being her third.\n\nBut earlier I thought Kelly might have four wins. However, without knowing how many total fights she has, perhaps this is her second or third win. The table doesn't provide order, so it's possible that Kelly could have more than three wins, making this the third one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'res' column refers to the fighter in the row (i.e., each row is a different fighter). But that would make the table confusing because then how do we know which fighter won or lost each fight. It's unclear.\n\nGiven that ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that Row 3 is Kelly's third win against Rudy by TKO and outside a typical round.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kelly's third win was against Rudy Vallederas by TKO, occurring outside a typical round. Based on the table:\n\n- **Row 3** shows a win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO, with the round listed as \"n/a,\" indicating an unusual or unspecified round.\n- If this is her third win, considering she has at least four wins in total (Rows 2, 3, 4, 5), it's possible that Kelly could have more than three victories. However, without knowing the order of these fights, we can't definitively state it's her third unless specified.\n- Assuming Row 3 is her third win, the claim holds true for this specific match.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is accurate based on the provided data.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"kelly dullanty have an overall record of 4 - 2, by win their first 4 and then lose the rest on event kotc 6 - road warrior.\" \n\nI notice that the name mentioned is \"kelly dullanty,\" but looking at the table, I don't see any fighter named Kelly Dullanty. The table lists opponents such as Lance Wipf, Matt Serra, Nuri Shakir, Rudy Vallederas, Duane Ludwig, and Shad Smith. So Kelly Dullanty isn't among them. This is a red flag because if the claim is about her record, but she's not in the table, then maybe she's not part of the data presented here.\n\nNext, let's break down what the claim says about her record. It states that she has an overall record of 4-2. In mixed martial arts (MMA), a 4-2 record could mean four wins and two losses. The next part says she \"by win their first 4,\" which suggests she won her first four fights, then lost the rest. The claim also mentions that she lost on event kotc 6 - road warrior.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check if there's any fighter with a 4-2 record and if they fought on KotC 6 - Road Warriors. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Loss (4-2) vs. Lance Wipf at PureCombat - Bring the Pain. No mention of KotC here.\n2. Second row: Loss (4-1) vs. Matt Serra at UFC 36. Again, not KotC.\n3. Third row: Win (4-0) vs. Nuri Shakir at IFC WC 13. Not relevant for a loss.\n4. Fourth row: Win (3-0) vs. Rudy Vallederas at IFC WC 13. Still a win, so doesn't fit the claim.\n5. Fifth row: Win (2-0) vs. Duane Ludwig at KotC 6 - Road Warriors. So here's a fighter with a 2-0 record after this fight, but the claim says she has four wins first, then losses.\n6. Sixth row: Win (1-0) vs. Shad Smith at KotC 3. Again, a win, not relevant for a loss.\n\nWait, none of these rows have a fighter named Kelly Dullanty, and also, none of them match a 4-2 record after losing the rest. The table shows some fighters with wins and losses, but each row is an individual fight, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a specific event where she had multiple fights. But in the table, each row seems to represent a single fight, not cumulative records. So the first row is her losing 4-2 against Lance Wipf, but then other rows are different fighters.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the 'record' in the claim. The term \"overall record\" could imply that she has four wins and two losses across all her fights listed in the table. Let's count:\n\nLooking at each row where she loses or wins:\n\n- If we sum up all the wins: 4 rows with 'win' (third, fourth, fifth, sixth). So total of four wins.\n- Losses: first and second rows, so two losses.\n\nSo her overall record in the table is indeed 4-2. Now, the claim says she \"by win their first 4,\" meaning she won her first four fights before losing the rest. But looking at the table, it's not clear that her wins are consecutive. The third row shows a fighter with a 4-0 record after winning against Nuri Shakir, but that's in the same event as another fighter's win.\n\nWait, actually, the fifth row is the first one where the location is KotC 6 - Road Warriors. So that might be the event referred to in the claim. The fighter there has a record of 3-0 (win) vs. Rudy Vallederas via TKO. But in the claim, Kelly Dullanty lost on this event, which contradicts this row.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row is an individual fight, not cumulative. So if she has a 4-2 record overall, that would mean across multiple events and fights. The claim says she \"by win their first 4\" before losing the rest, implying that her initial four fights were wins, then losses. But in the table, her wins are spread out across different opponents and events.\n\nAlso, the fifth row is a win, not a loss, so it doesn't align with the claim that she lost on KotC 6 - Road Warriors.\n\nMoreover, Kelly Dullanty isn't present in any of these rows. The claim might be mixing up fighters or misrepresenting data.\n\nAnother point: The claim says \"kotc 6 - road warrior,\" but looking at the table, the fifth row is under KotC 6 - Road Warriors, where she won against Rudy Vallederas with a TKO. So perhaps that's the event in question, but she didn't lose there; she won. Therefore, the claim's assertion that she lost on that event is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, since Kelly Dullanty isn't listed as an opponent or fighter in the table, her record can't be verified from this data. The name doesn't match any in the table, which makes the claim questionable.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim references a fighter (Kelly Dullanty) not present in the table, misstates her fight outcomes (she has wins on KotC 6 - Road Warriors), and misrepresents her record as 4-2 without consecutive wins followed by losses. Therefore, the claim is likely incorrect or based on inaccurate information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made about Kelly Dullanty's MMA record and fights is not supported by the data provided in the table. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n1. **Absence of Kelly Dullanty**: None of the fighters listed in the table are named Kelly Dullanty. This absence makes it impossible to verify any details about her record or specific fights from the given information.\n\n2. **Overall Record Analysis**: If we consider the claim that she has an overall 4-2 record, this would imply four wins and two losses across all her fights listed in the table. Examining each row:\n   - Wins: 4 rows (third, fourth, fifth, sixth).\n   - Losses: 2 rows (first and second).\n   \n   This does indeed sum up to a 4-2 record overall.\n\n3. **Fight Outcomes**: The claim suggests that she won her first four fights before losing the rest. However, looking at the table:\n   - Her wins are spread across different opponents and events.\n   - The fifth row shows her winning on KotC 6 - Road Warriors, contradicting the claim that she lost on this event.\n\n4. **Specific Event Misrepresentation**: The fifth row is the only one mentioning KotC 6 - Road Warriors, where she won against Rudy Vallederas via TKO. Therefore, she did not lose on this specific event as claimed.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While she does have a 4-2 record overall in the table, the claim's assertion that she lost on KotC 6 - Road Warriors and had consecutive wins followed by losses is incorrect. Additionally, the absence of her name from the table means her actual record and fight outcomes cannot be accurately verified from the provided data.\n\n**Final Answer**: The claim about Kelly Dullanty's MMA record and specific fights is based on misinformation, as she isn't listed in the table, and the details provided do not align with the given data.",

The claim says: \"2 of Kelly Dullanty's win be by decision, and each last at least 3 round in location nevada , united state.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asserting.\n\n1. **Two wins by Decision**: This means that out of Kelly Dullanty's victories listed in the table, exactly two should have \"decision\" as their method.\n2. **Each of these wins occurs in Nevada, United States**: So, both wins must be located in Nevada.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to find all the entries for Kelly Dullanty, or any K.Dullanty if that's how it's spelled. Wait, the claim mentions \"Kelly Dullanty,\" but looking at the table data, I don't see any fighter named Kelly Dullanty. The opponents listed are Lance Wipf, Matt Serra, Nuri Shakir, Rudy Vallederas, Duane Ludwig, and Shad Smith.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a typo or I'm misreading it. Let me check the table again. Each row has an opponent, method, event, round, etc., but no mention of Kelly Dullanty. So perhaps this claim is about another fighter named Kelly Dullanty who isn't in the table.\n\nIf Kelly Dullanty isn't present in the table, then there are zero wins by her. Therefore, the first part of the claim (\"2 of Kelly Dullanty's win be by decision\") can't be true because she has no wins in this dataset. Hence, the entire statement is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if \"Kelly Dullanty\" exists elsewhere or if it's a different name. For example, sometimes fighters have similar names that get mixed up, like Kelly vs. Kelly Ann or something. But given the exact name in the claim, and not seeing any match in the table, I think it's safe to say she isn't present.\n\nTherefore, since there are zero wins for Kelly Dullanty, the condition of having two decision wins can't be met. Also, regardless of location, if she has no wins here, both conditions fail.\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kelly Dullanty has two decision wins in Nevada, but upon examining the table, there are no entries for her. Hence, the claim is unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"kelly's be the only 1 never have third win come against rudy vallederas by tko , but outside of the typical round.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It mentions Kelly being the only fighter who hasn't achieved a third win against Rudy Vallederas via TKO (Technical Knockout), and this happens in fights that are not in the usual round structure.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to identify the relevant rows and columns related to this claim. The table has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, and location.\n\nThe key elements in the claim are:\n1. Fighter (Kelly) who hasn't achieved a third win against Rudy Vallederas.\n2. The win is by TKO.\n3. This occurs outside of the typical round structure.\n\nSo, I should look for rows where the opponent is \"Rudy Vallederas\" and the method is \"TKO.\" Then, check if Kelly has only one or no wins against him without reaching a third via TKO in non-typical rounds.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In row 4: opponent is Rudy Vallederas, method is TKO. The event is IFC WC 13 - Warriors Challenge 13, and round is n/a.\n- Kelly's name isn't directly mentioned here, but assuming Kelly is the fighter in question, this might be a relevant cell.\n\nI also need to check if Kelly has other wins against Rudy Vallederas by TKO that are not part of typical rounds. If Kelly hasn't achieved three such wins, especially outside the usual round structure, the claim could be true.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 4 shows a win for someone (probably Kelly) against Rudy via TKO in a match with n/a round, which might mean it's an exhibition or not following standard rounds. If Kelly only has one such win, then claiming they've never had a third is accurate.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other rows where opponent is Rudy Vallederas and method is TKO, and see how many wins Kelly has in that category, especially outside typical rounds.\n\nBut since the table doesn't provide Kelly's name explicitly, maybe I need to infer. The fifth row shows a win against Shad Smith, but not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to Kelly as the fighter who hasn't achieved three TKO wins over Rudy Vallederas in non-typical rounds. So, if Kelly only has one such win, that's correct.\n\nI need to find all cells related to this: rows where opponent is Rudy Vallederas and method is TKO, which would be row 4. Also, any other relevant rows for Kelly's wins against Rudy Vallederas by TKO in non-typical rounds.\n\nBut without more data, I can only confirm that there's at least one such win if Kelly is the fighter here. So, the claim seems to suggest Kelly hasn't achieved a third, which would be true based on row 4 if Kelly has only one win.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are where opponent is Rudy Vallederas and method is TKO, specifically in non-typical rounds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells. Let's break down the claim and compare it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"a technical knockout (strikes) have decide 2 of kelly 's fight with the same event.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse this sentence to understand what it's claiming. It mentions a technical knockout via strikes deciding two of Kelly's fights within the same event.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check for rows where \"res\" is either win or loss and the method involves a technical knockout by strikes.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. First row: res is 'loss', opponent Lance Wipf, method 'ko (punch)'. Doesn't involve strikes.\n2. Second row: res is 'loss', opponent Matt Serra, method 'submission'. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: res is 'win', opponent Nuri Shakir, method 'decision'. Not a knockout by strikes.\n4. Fourth row: res is 'win', opponent Rudy Vallederas, method 'tko' (strikes). This fits as it's a win with tko via strikes, but the event column says \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\".\n5. Fifth row: res is 'win', opponent Duane Ludwig, method 'decision'. Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: res is 'win', opponent Shad Smith, method 'tko (strikes)'. Another win via tko by strikes, same event as the fourth row.\n\nSo, both wins (rows 4 and 6) are against different opponents but within the same event (\"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\"). However, in the table, each row has a unique 'event' value. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait no, the 'event' column for rows 3 and 4 is \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\", but let me check. Row 4's event is \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\" as well. Hmm, actually, in row 3, it's listed as \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\" and row 4 also the same. Wait no, looking again:\n\nRow 3: event is \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\"\nRow 4: same event\nWait, but that can't be right because each row is a separate fight. Maybe I misread.\n\nLooking back, rows 3 and 4 have the same event? That seems odd because in reality, an event would have multiple fights, so it's possible for Kelly to have two wins in the same event via different methods.\n\nBut the claim says \"the same event\", which might mean that both technical knockouts happened in the same event. From the table, rows 4 and 6 are both in \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\". Wait no, row 6's location is California but the event is different? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the 'event' column:\n\nRow 3: ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\nRow 4: same as row 3? Or different?\nLooking again, row 4's event is \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\", and row 6's event is \"kotc 6 - road warriors\".\n\nWait no, the table shows:\n\nRow 3: ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\nRow 4: same as row 3?\nNo, looking carefully:\n\nIn the table provided, each row has a unique 'record' but some share the same event. For instance, rows 3 and 4 both have event \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\". Wait no, let me check:\n\nRow 3: ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\nRow 4: ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13? Or is it different?\n\nWait, in the table, row 3's event is \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\" and row 4's event is \"kotc 6 - road warriors\". So, they are different events. Therefore, the two tko by strikes wins (rows 4 and 6) are in different events.\n\nThis means that Kelly didn't have two technical knockout wins in the same event. She has one in \"ifc wc 13\" and another in \"kotc 3\". So the claim is incorrect because she doesn't have two such fights in the same event.\n\nWait, but wait: the fourth row's opponent is Rudy Vallederas with a tko, and the sixth row's opponent is Shad Smith also via tko. Their events are different. Therefore, Kelly did not have two technical knockouts decide her fights within the same event. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut I need to check if any cells support the claim. The relevant columns would be 'res' (to see wins/losses), 'method' (looking for tko by strikes), and 'event' (to check if they're the same).\n\nSo, rows where res is win and method is tko (strikes) are rows 4 and 6.\n\nTheir event columns are:\n\nRow 4: \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\"\nRow 6: \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare\"\n\nTherefore, different events. So the claim's assertion that two of Kelly's fights with the same event were decided by technical knockout via strikes is false.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the rows where res is win, method is tko (strikes), and their 'event' column for each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Kelly had two fights within the same event decided by a technical knockout via strikes. However, in the table, these two wins occurred in different events. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look for rows where 'res' is \"win\" and 'method' is \"tko (strikes)\".\n   - Row 4: Win via tko (Rudy Vallederas)\n   - Row 6: Win via tko (Shad Smith)\n\n2. **Check Event Column:** Verify if both events match.\n   - Row 4's event: \"ifc wc 13 - warriors challenge 13\"\n   - Row 6's event: \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare\"\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the events differ, Kelly did not have two such wins in the same event.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe claim is false because Kelly had two wins via technical knockout but in different events. The relevant rows are where 'res' is win and method is tko (strikes).\n\n\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}",
