    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"tom hilde from norway be rank 2nd overall with 682 overall wc points.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should identify where Tom Hilde fits. The table has a column for 'name', so I'll search for \"tom hilde\". \n\nIn the second row of the tbody, I find:\n- Name: tom hilde\n- Nationality: nor (which matches Norway)\n- Rank: 2\n- Points: 185.6\n- Overall WC points: 682 (4)\n\nWait, the claim says Tom Hilde has \"682 overall wc points.\" But according to the table, his overall WC points are listed as 682 with a rank of 4 in parentheses. That means the overall ranking is 4th, not 2nd. \n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. The rank for Tom Hilde is indeed 2, which matches the claim, but the overall wc points he has is 682, which also seems to match. However, the parenthetical note (4) indicates his overall position is 4th, not 2nd.\n\nTherefore, while some aspects of the claim are correct, the part about being \"rank 2nd overall\" doesn't hold because the overall wc points rank is 4th. This means the claim is incorrect as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim says Tom Hilde is ranked 2nd overall with 682 points. Checking the table:\n- Tom Hilde's rank is 2 in the list, but his overall WC points are listed as 682 with a rank of 4.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"anders jacobsen , represent nor , have the same number of point as tom hilde , also represent nor.\" \n\nLet's break this down into two main parts:\n1. Anders Jacobsen and Tom Hilde both represent Norway (nor).\n2. They have the same number of points.\n\nStarting with the first part, I'll look for Anders Jacobsen in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I find that row 3 has \"anders jacobsen\" with a nationality of nor. Then, checking if Tom Hilde also represents Norway, I see that Tom is in row 2 and his nationality is listed as nor. So both represent Norway\u2014part one checks out.\n\nNext, the second part involves comparing their points. The claim says their points are equal. Looking at the 'points' column: Anders Jacobsen's points are 181.2, while Tom Hilde has 185.6. These numbers are not the same; they differ by about 4.4 points. Therefore, the second part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nSince one part of the claim is false, the entire claim should be considered FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Tom Hilde's overall WC points rank is higher than Janne Ahonen's is true or false. Let me start by looking at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll identify who Tom Hilde and Janne Ahonen are in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Tom Hilde is ranked 2 with nationality 'nor' and his overall WC points rank is listed as 682 (4). On the other hand, Janne Ahonen is ranked 1 with nationality 'fin', and his overall WC points rank is 810 (2).\n\nThe claim says that Tom's overall WC point rank is more than Janne's. So I need to compare their respective ranks. Looking at the numbers: Janne has a higher rank of 2, while Tom has a rank of 4. Wait, no, because lower numbers mean higher rank. So if Janne is ranked 2 and Tom is ranked 4, Janne actually has a higher overall WC point rank than Tom.\n\nWait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me double-check. In racing points, the smaller the number, the better the rank. So rank 1 is the best, then 2, up to 13 in this table. So if Janne Ahonen's overall WC points are ranked 2 and Tom Hilde's are 4, that means Janne has a higher (better) rank than Tom.\n\nSo the claim says Tom's is more than Janne's, but in reality, Janne's is better. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
