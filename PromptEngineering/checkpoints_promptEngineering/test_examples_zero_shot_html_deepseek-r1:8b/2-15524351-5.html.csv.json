    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest attendance figure in a game be 6500\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the smallest number of people attending any game listed in the table is exactly 6,500.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. My task is to find the lowest attendance figure among all these games and see if it's 6500.\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table and noting down the attendance numbers:\n\n1. 17,000\n2. 20,175\n3. 66,266\n4. 15,000\n5. 25,000\n6. 27,000\n7. 16,000\n8. 38,689\n9. 18,025\n10. 18,000\n11. 6,500\n\nNow, I'll list all these attendance figures to easily see the smallest one. The numbers are: 17,000; 20,175; 66,266; 15,000; 25,000; 27,000; 16,000; 38,689; 18,025; 18,000; and 6,500.\n\nLooking at these, the smallest number is 6,500. So, according to the table, yes, there's a game with an attendance of exactly 6,500.\n\nNow, I need to verify which cell in the table corresponds to that 6,500 figure. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first few rows have higher numbers, so they're out.\n- Row 7 has 16,000, still higher.\n- Then row 11: attendance is 6,500.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is in row index 10 (since it's zero-indexed) and column \"attendance\". Wait, no\u2014row indices start at 0. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: 17,000\nRow 1: 20,175\nRow 2: 66,266\nRow 3: 15,000\nRow 4: 25,000\nRow 5: 27,000\nRow 6: 16,000\nRow 7: 38,689\nRow 8: 18,025\nRow 9: 18,000\nRow 10: 6,500\n\nYes, row index is 10. So the relevant cell is at row_index 10 and column_name \"attendance\".\n\nWait, but looking back, in the table provided, the rows are numbered from 0 to 14 (since there are 15 rows). Let me recount:\n\n- The first data row after <thead> is row 0: date 09/09/1972\n- Next is row 1: SMU game\n- And so on, up to row 14.\n\nWait, actually, in the HTML table, each <tr> represents a row. Let me count how many rows there are:\n\nLooking at the tbody section, it's a list of 15 <tr> elements. So the indices go from 0 to 14.\n\nIn my earlier count, I went up to row 10 as having attendance 6,500. So row_index is 10, and column_name is \"attendance\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be an array containing one object: {row_index:10, column_name:\"attendance\"}.\n\nSo, the claim says the lowest attendance figure is exactly 6500. Since that's indeed present in the table, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cell pointing to row 10 and attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as there is a game with an attendance of 6,500.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the deacon be shutout 3 time during the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a \"shutout\" means in this context. A shutout occurs when one team scores zero points against another. So, the claim suggests that \"the deacon\" was shut out three times during their season. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns include opponent, location, result, and attendance. The 'result' column shows the score of the game, with the team's performance indicated by 'w' for win or 'l' for loss, followed by the score.\n\nI need to identify which rows are relevant to this claim. Since \"the deacon\" is mentioned in the opponent column, I'll look for any row where the opponent is \"deacon.\" However, scanning through each row, I don't see an entry where the opponent is listed as \"deacon.\"\n\nWait, but maybe \"the deacon\" refers to the home team. Let me check if the home teams are called \"deacon.\" Looking at the opponents column, I see entries like 'davidson,' 'smu,' '5 tennessee,' etc. None of these are \"deacon.\" The locations mentioned are places like 'groves stadium winston - salem, nc' and others, but that doesn't necessarily indicate the home team is called \"deacon.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the deacon\" refers to a specific team that isn't listed as an opponent. If that's the case, maybe the claim is about how many times the home team (like North Carolina State or others) had shutouts against \"the deacon.\" But without \"deacon\" being in the opponents column, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check each row for any mention of \"deacon.\" Scanning through the table again, I still don't see an opponent named \"deacon.\" So if the claim is about the deacon being shut out three times, and there are no games where the opponent was the deacon, then it's not supported by this data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term refers to a specific team like Duke or Virginia Tech, but that seems less likely. The key point is whether \"deacon\" is an opponent in any game. Since it isn't listed, the claim can't be fully supported as there are no relevant games where the deacon was shut out.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is not supported by the data provided, making it FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

First, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that there were 7 games played in North Carolina.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The relevant columns for the location are \"location\" and possibly \"opponent,\" but wait, no\u2014the claim is about the venue being in North Carolina, not necessarily about the opponents.\n\nSo I need to check how many games were played at locations that are in North Carolina. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. First game: location is \"groves stadium winston - salem , nc\". That's in NC.\n2. Second game: location is \"texas stadium irving , tx\". Not NC.\n3. Third game: \"neyland stadium knoxville , tn\". No.\n4. Fourth: \"byrd stadium college park , md\". No.\n5. Fifth: again, \"groves stadium winston - salem , nc\". Yes.\n6. Sixth: same venue as first, so yes.\n7. Seventh: same venue, so yes.\n8. Eighth game: \"williams - brice stadium columbia , sc\". No.\n9. Ninth game: \"wallace wade stadium durham , nc\". Yes.\n10. Tenth game: back to groves stadium in NC.\n\nNow counting the ones in NC: rows 1,5,6,7,9,10. That's six games. The claim says seven, so that would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: yes\nRow 1: no\nRow 2: no\nRow 3: no\nRow 4: no\nRow 5: yes\nRow 6: yes\nRow 7: yes\nRow 8: no\nRow 9: yes\nRow 10: yes\n\nSo that's six games in NC, not seven.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the demon deacon win 2 game and lose 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It seems like it's about a team called \"demon deacon\" winning 2 games and losing 9 others over some period. So, I need to check the table for any such wins and losses by this team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The result column shows either 'w' for win or 'l' for loss, followed by scores. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if \"demon deacon\" is mentioned as the team. Scanning the 'opponent' column:\n\n- 1st row: opponent is 'davidson' \u2014 not demon deacon.\n- 2nd row: 'smu' \u2014 not relevant.\n- 3rd row: '5 tennessee' \u2014 likely Tennessee, so probably not demon deacon.\n- 4th row: 'maryland' \u2014 nope.\n- 5th row: 'north carolina state' \u2014 no.\n- 6th row: 'north carolina' \u2014 no.\n- 7th row: 'clemson' \u2014 no.\n- 8th row: 'south carolina' \u2014 not demon deacon.\n- 9th row: 'duke' \u2014 nope.\n- 10th row: 'virginia' \u2014 no.\n- 11th row: 'virginia tech' \u2014 no.\n\nWait, none of the opponents are \"demon deacon.\" Hmm. That's odd because the claim refers to them winning and losing games. Maybe I missed it or there's another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the team name is mentioned elsewhere. Let me check the location column for any mention of demon deacon in the location field:\n\nLooking at 'location' column:\n- Most are places like \"groves stadium winston - salem , nc\", but none mention \"demon deacon.\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread the opponents. Let's look again:\n\nRow 9: opponent is 'duke' \u2014 no.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"demon deacon\" refers to a team nickname or mascot. So maybe it's an alternate name for one of these schools. For example, North Carolina State has a demon mascot, sometimes called \"demon deacons.\" Maybe that's what it is referring to.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to check if any rows have 'north carolina state' as the opponent and whether they won 2 games and lost 9.\n\nLooking for 'north carolina state' in the table:\n\nRow 5: opponent is 'north carolina state', date 10/14/1972. Result is 'l 13 - 42'. So that's a loss.\n\nAre there other rows where opponent is 'north carolina state'? No, it seems only once.\n\nWait, but I need to see if North Carolina State as the demon deacon won 2 games and lost 9 in total over all their games. So, let me check each row for when the opponent is 'north carolina state'.\n\nOnly row 5: they lost that game. But did they have any wins? Let me check other rows where perhaps North Carolina State was the home team.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that Groves Stadium is in Winston-Salem, NC, and it's used by several teams, including Davidson, North Carolina State, etc.\n\nWait, let me list all opponents to see which ones could be the demon deacon's opponents:\n\nLooking for any row where the opponent might be demon deacon. Since none of the opponents are named that, perhaps the claim refers to a different team. Alternatively, maybe the demon deacon is the home team in some games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"demon deacon\" refers to a specific team's nickname. For example, North Carolina State uses \"demon deacons,\" so perhaps their games are being referred to here.\n\nSo, looking at all rows where the opponent is 'north carolina state', but also checking if they might have won some games when they were playing away or home.\n\nWait, in row 5: opponent is north carolina state, result is loss.\n\nLooking for any other rows where the team (not opponent) could be demon deacon. For example, if the location is Groves Stadium and the opponent is someone else, maybe that's the demon deacon's home games.\n\nLet me check all 'location' entries for Groves Stadium:\n\nRows 1: Davidson vs ??? at Groves Stadium \u2014 result is win.\nRow 5: North Carolina State lost at Groves Stadium.\nBut none of these are about demon deacons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the team in question is another one. Let's see if any rows have a 'result' that aligns with wins and losses.\n\nThe claim says they won 2 games and lost 9, so total of 11 games.\n\nLooking through all results:\n\nI'll list out all the results to count wins and losses for each team, assuming that the opponents are other teams. But since we don't know which team is demon deacon, this approach might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"demon deacon\" refers to a specific team's nickname, like North Carolina State's demon deacons. So, looking at their games:\n\nIn row 5: opponent is north carolina state, result is loss.\nIs there another row where the same team (north carolina state) has a win? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\nRow 1: Davidson won at Groves Stadium \u2014 but that's Davidson vs ???.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all opponents and their results when playing against others. But without knowing which is the demon deacon, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"demon deacon\" refers to another team, like Wake Forest or someone else, but in the table, none of the opponents are named that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says \"the demon deacon win 2 game and lose 9.\" Maybe it's a typo for \"demon deacons,\" meaning a team known as demon deacons won 2 games and lost 9.\n\nIn that case, looking at the table, let me see if any row has a result where the home team (perhaps demon deacon) won twice and lost nine times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to a specific season or series. Let me tally up all wins and losses for each team:\n\n- Davidson: Looking at their results when they played away, perhaps they have some wins.\n- North Carolina State: They have at least one loss (row 5). Maybe more?\n- Others: Not much info.\n\nBut without clear data on the demon deacon's performance, I can't be certain. Wait, maybe the claim is that the team won 2 games and lost 9, so total of 11 games. Let me check if any row indicates a team with 2 wins and 9 losses.\n\nLooking at each team's results:\n\nEach row represents one game, so let's count per opponent:\n\n- Davidson: Looking through all their games:\n  - Row 1: Win.\n  - Any others? No, only one row where they are the opponent.\n\nSo Davidson has at least 1 win.\n\n- North Carolina State: Only in row 5 as opponent, lost that game.\n\n- Others: Not much info.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the home and away perspective. Maybe demon deacon is a team that played 11 games (2 wins, 9 losses) in total.\n\nLooking through all rows for any team that might have 2 wins and 9 losses:\n\nLet me list each row's result and see which teams won or lost:\n\n1. Davidson W\n2. smu L\n3. tennessee L\n4. maryland L\n5. north carolina state L\n6. north carolina L\n7. clemson L\n8. south carolina L\n9. duke L\n10. virginia L\n11. virginia tech L\n\nWait, that's all the results as losses except row 1 which is a win.\n\nSo total of 11 games: 1 win and 10 losses? But that doesn't add up to 2 wins and 9 losses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row could represent a different game, so if we have multiple rows for each team's games, but in this case, it seems like each row is a single game.\n\nSo maybe the demon deacon isn't in this table, or perhaps the claim refers to a different dataset.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the opponent column. Maybe \"demon deacon\" is one of the opponents' team names, but spelled differently. For example, it might be \"Demon Deacons,\" which could be a typo for demon deacon.\n\nLooking again at the opponents:\n\nRow 9: opponent is 'duke' \u2014 no.\nRow 5: opponent is 'north carolina state' \u2014 which might be demon deacons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a different team altogether not listed here. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \"demon deacon\" isn't present in the table at all. So if the claim is about a team not present in the opponents list, then the data doesn't support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data is structured differently. Perhaps each row includes both teams, so we can count total wins and losses for each team.\n\nLet me try that approach:\n\nEach row has two teams: one winning (W) or losing (L).\n\nSo let's list all results and tally per team:\n\n1. Davidson W\n2. smu L\n3. tennessee L\n4. maryland L\n5. north carolina state L\n6. north carolina L\n7. clemson L\n8. south carolina L\n9. duke L\n10. virginia L\n11. virginia tech L\n\nWait, that's only 1 W and 10 Ls, but if the table is incomplete, or perhaps each row represents a single team's game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is part of a season where teams play multiple games, so perhaps the data needs to be parsed differently.\n\nBut without clear information on which team is the demon deacon, it's difficult to verify the claim based solely on this table.\n\nTherefore, I think there isn't enough evidence in the provided data to confirm that \"the demon deacon\" won 2 games and lost 9. It might refer to a team not present here or requires more context.\n</think>\n\nThe provided dataset does not contain sufficient information to determine whether \"the demon deacon\" team has won two games and lost nine. The analysis of the given results shows that only one game is recorded with a win (Davidson), and the rest are losses, which doesn't align with the claim of two wins and nine losses. Therefore, based on the current data, it's not possible to confirm the statement.\n\nAnswer: There isn't enough information in the provided data to confirm that \"the demon deacon\" won 2 games and lost 9.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the most point score by a team in 1 game be 56\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions the highest points scored by a team in one game being 56. So, I need to look through each game's result in the table and see if any team scored 56 points in a single match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The 'result' column shows the score in the format of team1 w/x - y or l/x - y. For example, in the second row, it says \"l 10 - 56\", which I think means the team lost by a score of 10-56.\n\nSo, the key here is to parse each 'result' to find out what the scores are for both teams. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Result is \"w 26 - 20\". So, the winning team scored 26 and the opponent scored 20.\n2. Second row: \"l 10 - 56\" indicates the team lost, so the opponent scored 56. That's a significant point total.\n3. Third row: \"l 6 - 45\". The opponent scored 45 here.\n4. Fourth row: \"l 0 - 23\". Opponent scored 23.\n5. Fifth row: \"l 13 - 42\". Opponent scored 42.\n6. Sixth row: \"l 0 - 21\". Opponent scored 21.\n7. Seventh row: \"l 0 - 31\". Opponent scored 31.\n8. Eighth row: \"l 3 - 35\". Opponent scored 35.\n9. Ninth row: \"w 9 - 7\". Winning team scored 9, opponent 7.\n10. Tenth row: \"l 12 - 15\". Opponent scored 15.\n11. Eleventh row: \"l 9 - 44\". Opponent scored 44.\n\nFrom this analysis, the highest points in a single game by an opponent is 56, as seen in the second row where the result is \"l 10 - 56\". The team lost that game, meaning their score was 10 and the opponent's was 56. So, it seems like the claim is true because a team did score 56 points in one game.\n\nI should also check if any team scored higher than 56. Looking at all the results, the highest opponent score is indeed 56, so no other row shows a higher score. Therefore, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"the game with an attendance of 6500 be the fourth lowest attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that there's a game with 6,500 attendees, and this figure is the fourth smallest in terms of attendance across all games listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game, including details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. My task is to find out if any game has an attendance of exactly 6,500 and then check its rank among all attendances.\n\nSo, step one: Identify which row has an attendance of 6,500. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first game on September 9th had 17,000.\n- Next, September 16th had 20,175.\n- September 23rd had 66,266.\n- October 7th was 15,000.\n- October 14th: 25,000.\n- October 21st: 27,000.\n- October 28th: 16,000.\n- November 4th: 38,689.\n- November 11th: 18,025.\n- November 18th: 18,000.\n- November 25th: 6,500.\n\nSo the game on November 25th had exactly 6,500 attendees. That's the only one with that number in the attendance column.\n\nNow, to check if this is the fourth lowest attendance. I need to list all attendances and rank them from smallest to largest to see where 6,500 falls.\n\nListing all attendances:\n\n17,000; 20,175; 66,266; 15,000; 25,000; 27,000; 16,000; 38,689; 18,025; 18,000; 6,500.\n\nNow, I should order these numbers from the smallest to largest:\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The smallest is 6,500.\n- Next would be 15,000 (October 7th).\n- Then 16,000 (October 28th).\n- 18,000 (November 18th).\n- 18,025 (November 11th) \u2013 Wait, no. 18,025 is slightly higher than 18,000, so after that comes:\n\nWait, actually, let's list them numerically:\n\n6,500; 15,000; 16,000; 18,000; 18,025; 20,175; 25,000; 27,000; 38,689; 66,266.\n\nSo the order is correct. Now, the attendance of 6,500 is first on this list. But the claim says it's the fourth lowest, which would mean there are three attendances lower than it. However, in reality, 6,500 is the smallest, so it should be ranked number one, not four.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"fourth lowest.\" Sometimes people might consider the lowest as the highest number, but that's not standard. The fourth lowest attendance would imply that there are three attendances higher than it, making it the fourth from the bottom when sorted in ascending order.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf we have a list of numbers, the \"lowest\" is the smallest, and each subsequent is higher. So the first lowest is 6,500, second is 15,000, third is 16,000, and so on. Therefore, saying that 6,500 is the fourth lowest would mean there are three attendances lower than it, but in reality, 6,500 is the smallest, no others are lower.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect. The attendance of 6,500 isn't the fourth lowest; it's actually the lowest (first) when ordered from smallest to largest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the game with 6,500 attendees has the highest (lowest rank, first place) attendance among all listed games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect. The game with an attendance of 6500 has the highest number of attendees, making it the lowest, not the fourth lowest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the demon deacon win as many game as they lose\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"demon deacon\" probably refers to Wake Forest University's football team, known as the Demon Deacons. The claim states that they win as many games as they lose. So I need to count their wins and losses from the table and see if these numbers are equal.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The 'result' column shows either a win (w) or loss (l), along with the score. My task is to count how many times the Demon Deacons won and lost based on these results.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **09/09/1972**: Result is w 26-20. That's a win.\n2. **09/16/1972**: Result is l 10-56. That's a loss.\n3. **09/23/1972**: Result is l 6-45. Another loss.\n4. **10/07/1972**: Result is l 0-23. Loss again.\n5. **10/14/1972**: Result is l 13-42. Loss.\n6. **10/21/1972**: Result is l 0-21. Loss.\n7. **10/28/1972**: Result is l 0-31. Loss.\n8. **11/04/1972**: Result is l 3-35. Loss.\n9. **11/11/1972**: Result is w 9-7. Win.\n10. **11/18/1972**: Result is l 12-15. Loss.\n11. **11/25/1972**: Result is l 9-44. Loss.\n\nNow, let's count the wins and losses:\n\nWins: Only two games where they won. Specifically, row 0 (09/09) and row 8 (11/11).\n\nLosses: The rest are losses. From row 1 to row 7, that's seven losses, plus rows 9,10,11\u2014wait, no. Wait, the rows go from index 0 to 13? Let me recount.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure, each <tr> is a row. So counting each row as a game:\n\nRow 0: Win\nRows 1-7 (that's seven rows): Losses\nRow 8: Win\nRows 9-13 (five rows): Losses\n\nSo total wins = 2, losses = 8.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the claim is about winning as many games as they lose. So if they have two wins and eight losses, that's not equal. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount each row:\n\nRow 0: Win (1)\nRow 1: Loss\nRow 2: Loss\nRow 3: Loss\nRow 4: Loss\nRow 5: Loss\nRow 6: Loss\nRow 7: Loss\nRow 8: Win (2)\nRows 9-13: Five rows, all losses. So total losses = 8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So they have only two wins and eight losses. Therefore, the number of wins is not equal to the number of losses; they lost more games than they won.\n\nSo the claim is false because the Demon Deacons did not win as many games as they lost.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Demon Deacons have two wins and eight losses. Since 2 \u2260 8, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the deacon be shutout 3 time , but never by more than 10 point",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the deacon be shutout 3 time , but never by more than 10 point.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim means. It seems like it's talking about a team called \"The Deacon\" being shut out three times, and each of those times, the opposing team didn't win by more than 10 points.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that the opponents include teams like Davidson, SMU, 5 Tennessee, Maryland, North Carolina State, North Carolina, Clemson, South Carolina, Duke, Virginia, and Virginia Tech. There's no opponent named \"The Deacon,\" so maybe the term refers to a specific team or perhaps it's an error in understanding. Wait, perhaps \"The Deacon\" is referring to Wake Forest, as they have a nickname of Demon Deacons, which is often shortened to Deacons.\n\nNow, I need to look through each game where The Deacon (Wake Forest) was the opponent. So I'll go through each row and check if The Deacon is listed as an opponent, which in this table seems not to be the case. Wait, but looking at the table, the opponents are all universities like Davidson, SMU, 5 Tennessee, etc. Maybe \"The Deacon\" refers to another team or perhaps it's a typo, but given the context, I think it's Wake Forest.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, I see that one of the opponents is \"south carolina,\" which might be South Carolina Gamecocks, not related to Deacons. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"The Deacon\" refers to North Carolina State or another school with a similar nickname? Or perhaps it's a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"The Deacon\" is Wake Forest, and their opponents in these games are the ones listed. So for each of these opponents, when Wake Forest was playing against them, The Deacon would have been shut out three times, and in each case, the margin of victory didn't exceed 10 points.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each row is a game where one team played another. So if \"The Deacon\" (Wake Forest) was shut out three times, we need to find three instances where Wake Forest lost by more than 10 points but never by more than 10? Or wait, the claim says \"shutout 3 time,\" which I think means that they were shut out on three occasions. But looking at the table, I don't see any games where The Deacon (Wake Forest) was the home team or played away and lost with a shutout.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's read the claim again: \"the deacon be shutout 3 time , but never by more than 10 point.\" So maybe it means that on three occasions, The Deacon was shut out (i.e., scored 0 points), and each of those times, the opposing team didn't win by more than 10 points.\n\nBut looking at the table, I need to find any games where The Deacon was shut out. But in the given table, the opponents are various teams like Davidson, SMU, etc., but there's no entry for Wake Forest as an opponent. So perhaps this indicates that the claim is false because in the provided data, The Deacon (Wake Forest) wasn't shut out three times.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at each row to see if any of these games were against The Deacon. Let me go through each row:\n\n- 09/09/1972 vs Davidson: result was a win, 26-20.\n- 09/16/1972 vs SMU: loss, 10-56.\n- 09/23/1972 vs 5 Tennessee: loss, 6-45.\n- 10/07/1972 vs Maryland: loss, 0-23. This is a shutout for The Deacon if they were the home team.\n- 10/14/1972 vs North Carolina State: loss, 13-42.\n- 10/21/1972 vs North Carolina: loss, 0-21. Another shutout.\n- 10/28/1972 vs Clemson: loss, 0-31. Third shutout.\n- 11/04/1972 vs South Carolina: loss, 3-35.\n- 11/11/1972 vs Duke: win, 9-7.\n- 11/18/1972 vs Virginia: loss, 12-15.\n- 11/25/1972 vs Virginia Tech: result not shown, but in the given table, it's the last row.\n\nAssuming that \"The Deacon\" is Wake Forest, let's check if they were the home team in these games. The table doesn't specify home or away, but typically, the first part of the date might indicate home games. Alternatively, looking at opponent names, some like Davidson and others are likely opponents in different sports, but given that all opponents are universities, perhaps it's safer to assume that each row is a different game.\n\nIf \"The Deacon\" was shut out three times, then we need to see if in the table there are three instances where they lost with a score of 0- something. Looking at the results:\n\n- 10/07/1972: 0-23 (shutout)\n- 10/21/1972: 0-21 (shutout)\n- 10/28/1972: 0-31 (shutout)\n\nThat's three shutouts. Now, the claim says that each time, they were never shut out by more than 10 points. Let's check the scores:\n\n- 0-23: margin is 23 points.\n- 0-21: margin is 21 points.\n- 0-31: margin is 31 points.\n\nSo in two of these cases, the margin was over 10 points (21 and 31). Therefore, the claim that they were never shut out by more than 10 points is false because in some games, the opposing team won by more than 10 points.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"never by more than 10 point.\" So if any of those three shutouts had a margin over 10, then the claim is false. Since two of them have margins over 10, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that The Deacon was shut out three times with each opponent not winning by more than 10 points. However, analyzing the table, there are three instances where The Deacon (Wake Forest) was shut out, but in two cases, the margin of victory exceeded 10 points. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"false\",\n  \"reasoning\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\",\n      \"value\": \"0-23\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\",\n      \"value\": \"0-21\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\",\n      \"value\": \"0-31\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim states: \"7 game be play in north carolina , and they be all at the same stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's saying that there are seven games played in North Carolina, and all these games took place at the same stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. My task is to find out if any of these games were played in North Carolina and whether they all occurred at the same venue.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **09/09/1972**: Opponent is Davidson, location is Groves Stadium in Winston-Salem, NC. So this is a game in NC.\n2. **09/16/1972**: Opponent SMU, location Texas Stadium in Irving, TX. Not in NC.\n3. **09/23/1972**: Opponent 5 Tennessee, location Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, TN. Not NC.\n4. **10/07/1972**: Opponent Maryland, location Byrd Stadium in College Park, MD. Not NC.\n5. **10/14/1972**: Opponent North Carolina State, location Groves Stadium, NC. So this is another game in NC.\n6. **10/21/1972**: Opponent North Carolina, location Groves Stadium, NC. Third game in NC.\n7. **10/28/1972**: Opponent Clemson, location Groves Stadium, NC. Fourth game in NC.\n8. **11/04/1972**: Opponent South Carolina, location Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, SC. Not NC.\n9. **11/11/1972**: Opponent Duke, location Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham, NC. Fifth game in NC.\n10. **11/18/1972**: Opponent Virginia, location Groves Stadium, NC. Sixth game in NC.\n11. **11/25/1972**: Opponent Virginia Tech, location Groves Stadium, NC. Seventh game in NC.\n\nSo there are 7 games that took place in North Carolina: rows 0,5,6,7,9,10,11 (assuming row indices start at 0). Now, I need to check if all these games were played at the same stadium.\n\nLooking at their locations:\n- Groves Stadium is mentioned multiple times: rows 0,5,6,7,9,10,11.\n- The other game in NC is against Duke on November 11th, which is at Wallace Wade Stadium. That's a different venue.\n\nSo not all seven games were played at the same stadium because one was at Wallace Wade Stadium and others at Groves Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. I need to identify the relevant cells for North Carolina games:\n- The rows where opponent is either Davidson, North Carolina State, North Carolina, Clemson, Duke, Virginia, or Virginia Tech.\n- These correspond to specific row indices and columns like 'opponent' and 'location'.\n\nI should list each of these rows and their column names as per instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest number of point anyone score be below 50\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The claim seems to be about points scored by an individual, so the relevant column should be \"result\". Each entry in the \"result\" column shows the score of the game, like \"w 26 - 20\" or \"l 10 - 56\".\n\nI need to check each row's result and see what the highest point anyone scored is. The claim says that this highest number is below 50. So, I should extract all the scores from the results column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. First row: \"w 26 - 20\" \u2013 here, the team won with 26 points.\n2. Second row: \"l 10 - 56\" \u2013 lost, opponents scored 56. But wait, is that the team's score or the opponent's? The format seems to be \"result\", so I think it's their own result. So if they lost 10-56, then their points are 10.\n3. Third row: \"l 6 - 45\" \u2013 again, the team scored 6 points.\n4. Fourth row: \"l 0 - 23\" \u2013 0 points.\n5. Fifth row: \"l 13 - 42\" \u2013 13 points.\n6. Sixth row: \"l 0 - 21\" \u2013 0 points.\n7. Seventh row: \"l 0 - 31\" \u2013 0 points.\n8. Eighth row: \"l 3 - 35\" \u2013 3 points.\n9. Ninth row: \"w 9 - 7\" \u2013 won with 9 points.\n10. Tenth row: \"l 12 - 15\" \u2013 12 points.\n11. Eleventh row: \"l 9 - 44\" \u2013 9 points.\n\nNow, compiling the points scored by the team in each game:\n\n26, 10, 6, 0, 13, 0, 0, 3, 9, 12, 9.\n\nLooking for the highest number here. The highest score is 26 and 13, but wait, in row 11, it's 44 points by the opponent, but that's not our focus. The claim is about the highest point anyone scored being below 50, which I think refers to the team's own points.\n\nSo the highest team score is 26, which is indeed below 50. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because no one scores above 49 points in their games during that season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest number of points anyone scored is below 50. Examining the \"result\" column, the highest points scored by the team (not opponents) are 26 and 13, both below 50.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
