The claim says: \"the people from the country / region of Vietnam speak the language Vietnamese.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the relevant cells in the table that can verify this. Let's go through each step.\n\n1. **Identify the Country/Region**: The claim mentions Vietnam, so I'll search for \"Vietnam\" in the table. Scanning down, I find it's at row 26 (since counting starts from 0). \n\n2. **Check the Language Column**: Next, I need to see what language is associated with Vietnam. Looking at row 26, under the column named \"language\", it says \"vietnamese\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\n3. **Double-Check for Other Relevant Info**: The claim also talks about people from Vietnam speaking Vietnamese, which directly relates to their language. There's no need to consider other columns like \"country / region\" since that's just confirming the country.\n\nSo, both the country and the language in the table support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells confirm that Vietnam is associated with the Vietnamese language, supporting the claim fully.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check whether the claim is true based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the show in Israel be in the Hebrew language and be ongoing.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts. The first part says the show is in Israel and is in Hebrew. The second part says it's ongoing.\n\nI'll start by looking for rows where the country is Israel. Scanning through the table, I see that there's a row with \"Israel\" as the country. Let me note down the relevant cells here. \n\nIn the Israel row, the columns we need to check are: \n1. Language\n2. Status\n\nLooking at the language column for Israel, it says \"hebrew.\" So that part of the claim is correct.\n\nNext, checking the status column for Israel. The status shows \"ongoing.\" That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are satisfied by the relevant cells in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones for row 20 (assuming rows start at 0) with country as Israel.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
