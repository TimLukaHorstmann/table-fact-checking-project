    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a crowd size is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"against south melbourne , the croud size be 15736.\" There are a few things to check here. The claim mentions two main points: the opponent is South Melbourne and the crowd size is 15,736.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. My task is to find which cells in the table are relevant to verify this claim.\n\nStarting with the opponent, the claim says \"against South Melbourne.\" In the table, each row represents a game where one team is the home team and the other is the away team. So, I need to check if any row has South Melbourne listed as either the home or away team because that's when they would be playing against someone else.\n\nNext, the crowd size in the claim is 15,736. So, I should look for a row where the 'crowd' column matches this number exactly.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Home Team: St Kilda\n   - Away Team: South Melbourne\n   - Crowd: 15,736\n   - This seems relevant because the away team is South Melbourne, and the crowd size matches.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Home Team: Essendon\n   - Away Team: Melbourne\n   - Crowd: 22,824\n   - Not matching the opponent or crowd size.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Home Team: Carlton\n   - Away Team: North Melbourne\n   - Crowd: 23,824\n   - Opponent is not South Melbourne, and crowd doesn't match.\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - Home Team: Geelong\n   - Away Team: Footscray\n   - Crowd: 17,158\n   - Neither opponent nor crowd matches.\n\n5. **Fifth Row:**\n   - Home Team: Fitzroy\n   - Away Team: Collingwood\n   - Crowd: 17,626\n   - No match here either.\n\n6. **Sixth Row:**\n   - Home Team: Hawthorn\n   - Away Team: Richmond\n   - Crowd: 39,496\n   - Opponent is Richmond, crowd doesn't fit the claim.\n\nFrom this analysis, only the first row has South Melbourne as the away team and a crowd size of 15,736. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on that particular game.\n\nHowever, I should make sure there are no other instances where South Melbourne is involved with a crowd of 15,736. But looking at all rows, only the first one meets both conditions. So, it's safe to conclude the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking for South Melbourne as the opponent and a crowd size of 15,736 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"carlton score 14.18 (102) in the home team game against north melbourne.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. The home team is carlton, their score should be 14.18 (102), and they played against north melbourne.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details for both teams. So I need to find the row where the home team is carlton.\n\nChecking the table:\n- Row 2: Home team is Carlton with scores 14.18 (102) against North Melbourne away.\n- The crowd number and date also match this row.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row_index 2, columns for home team score, away team, and date. Wait, but according to the instruction, I should check each condition in the claim. So:\n\n- Home team: Check the \"home team\" column.\n- Score: Check the \"home team score\" column.\n- Opponent: Check the \"away team\" column.\n\nIn row 2, home team is Carlton, home team score is 14.18 (102), and away team is North Melbourne. The date also matches, though that's not part of the claim. So all parts of the claim are satisfied by this row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because the table shows Carlton scored 14.18 (102) at home against North Melbourne on April 19, 1975.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim to verify: \"north melbourne's away team score in the game at prince park be 9.12 (66).\" I need to check if this is true by looking at the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has headers like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"north melbourne\" as the away team, so I need to look for rows where the away team is north melbourne. Looking at the table:\n\n1. The first row has the home team st kilda, away team south melbourne.\n2. Second row: essendon vs melbourne.\n3. Third row: carlton vs north melbourne. Here, the away team is north melbourne. So this might be the relevant row.\n\nNext, I need to check if their score matches 9.12 (66). Looking at the third row, the away team's score is 9.17 (71), not 9.12 (66). So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The claim says \"north melbourne 's away team score...\". In the table, north melbourne is listed as an away team in the third row. Their score is 9.17 (71), not 9.12 (66). So the score doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, could there be another game where north melbourne is the away team? Let me check all rows:\n\n- The third row: carlton vs north melbourne, north melbourne's score is 9.17 (71).\n- Any other rows with north melbourne as away team? No, I don't see any others.\n\nSo the claim is about a specific game at prince park. Wait, looking back, in the third row, the venue is princes park, not prince park. The claim mentions \"prince park.\" Hmm, that's different. So the venue doesn't match either.\n\nWait, the claim says \"at prince park,\" but the actual venue for north melbourne's game is princes park. There's a slight difference in spelling: one has an 'e' and the other doesn't. So that's another discrepancy.\n\nSo putting it all together, there are two issues:\n\n1. The away team score doesn't match (9.17 vs 9.12).\n2. The venue is princes park, not prince park as stated in the claim.\n\nSince both the score and venue don't align, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"when the away team be south melbourne , the crowd be 22824\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that whenever the away team is South Melbourne, the crowd number is 22,824. So I need to check if there's any row in the table where the away team is South Melbourne and the crowd is exactly 22,824.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, scores, venue, etc. The relevant columns for this claim are \"away team\" and \"crowd\". \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First row**: Away team is South Melbourne. The crowd is 15,736. That's not 22,824.\n2. **Second row**: Away team is Melbourne. Crowd is 22,824. But the claim specifically mentions South Melbourne as the away team, so this doesn't apply.\n3. **Third row**: Away team is North Melbourne. Crowd is 23,824. Not matching.\n4. **Fourth row**: Away team is Footscray. Crowd is 17,158. No match.\n5. **Fifth row**: Away team is Collingwood. Crowd is 17,626. Doesn't fit.\n6. **Sixth row**: Away team is Richmond. Crowd is 39,496. Not matching.\n\nI notice that in the second row, the crowd is 22,824 when the away team is Melbourne, not South Melbourne. So there's no row where the away team is South Melbourne and the crowd is 22,824. \n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data.

The claim states: \"the home team score be 14.18 (102) against the away team score of 14.14 (98).\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific home team score of 14.18 (102). Looking through the table columns, the relevant column for the home team's score is \"home team score\". Similarly, the away team's score mentioned in the claim is 14.14 (98), so I'll need to look at the \"away team score\" column.\n\nNext, I need to find rows where both the home and away scores match these exact numbers. Each row represents a different game with its own home and away teams.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is St Kilda with 11.21 (87). Away team is South Melbourne with 9.17 (71). Neither score matches the claim.\n2. **Row 1**: Home is Essendon, score 16.21 (117); away is Melbourne, 15.10 (100). Doesn't match.\n3. **Row 2**: Home Carlton, 14.18 (102); away North Melbourne, 9.12 (66).

Neither match.\n5. **Row 4**: Fitzroy vs Collingwood; both have 12 scores, which don't reach 14.\n6. **Row 5**: Hawthorn vs Richmond; Hawthorn's score is 17.14 (116), Richmond's is 12.15 (87). Doesn't match.\n\nOnly in Row 2 does the home team have the exact score mentioned in the claim. However, the away team's score in that row is 9.12 (66), which doesn't match the claim's 14.14 (98).\n\nSo, there's no row where both the home and away scores exactly match the numbers given in the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and then list the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the away team score be 9.12 (66) play against fitzroy\". So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the away team scored exactly 9.12 (66) points and they played against Fitzroy.\n\nI'll start by examining each row in the table to find matching data.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- Home team: st kilda\n- Home score: 11.21 (87)\n- Away team: south melbourne\n- Away score: 9.17 (71)\nSo, away score here is 9.17 (71), not 9.12 (66). So this doesn't match.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home team: essendon\n- Home score: 16.21 (117)\n- Away team: melbourne\n- Away score: 15.10 (100)\nNot matching the away score we're looking for.\n\nThird row:\n- Home team: carlton\n- Home score: 14.18 (102)\n- Away team: north melbourne\n- Away score: 9.12 (66)\nWait, this seems promising. The away score here is exactly 9.12 (66). But who did they play against? It's North Melbourne.\n\nFourth row:\n- Home team: geelong\n- Home score: 13.12 (90)\n- Away team: footscray\n- Away score: 14.14 (98)\nNo match.\n\nFifth row:\n- Home team: fitzroy\n- Home score: 12.13 (85)\n- Away team: collingwood\n- Away score: 12.15 (87)\nNot the right away score.\n\nSixth row:\n- Home team: hawthorn\n- Home score: 17.14 (116)\n- Away team: richmond\n- Away score: 12.15 (87)\nNope.\n\nSo, in the third row, the away team is North Melbourne with a score of 9.12 (66), but they played against Carlton, not Fitzroy as mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other rows have the away team as Fitzroy and their score as 9.12 (66). Looking through all rows:\n\nWait, in the third row, it's Carlton vs North Melbourne, away score 9.12 (66).\n\nI don't see a row where the away team is Fitzroy with that specific score. Let me double-check each row again.\n\nFirst row: South Melbourne away, score 9.17.\nSecond: Melbourne away, 15.10.\nThird: North Melbourne away, 9.12.\nFourth: Footscray away, 14.14.\nFifth: Collingwood away, 12.15.\nSixth: Richmond away, 12.15.\n\nSo no row matches the claim exactly. The only time the away score is 9.12 (66) is when they played Carlton, not Fitzroy.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no match in the table where the away team scored 9.12 (66) against Fitzroy. Instead, it was against North Melbourne.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: we need to identify which cells were checked. In the third row, columns \"away team\" and \"away team score\" are relevant because they show that the away team was North Melbourne with a score of 9.12 (66), which is what the claim refers to but against the wrong opponent.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 2 (since indexing starts at 0, so third row is index 2)\n- Columns \"away team\" and \"away team score\"\n\nI think that's all. So, the answer is FALSE because the away team with that score didn't play Fitzroy.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
