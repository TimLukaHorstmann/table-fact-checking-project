Let me scan through each row looking for names matching St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 and Larrys Mabiala.\n\nI found St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 in row 25 under the column \"Name\". The column for appearances is \"Appearances\", so his total is 0 as a defender, I think.\n\nThen, looking for Larrys Mabiala. Hmm, scanning each row... Wait, I don't see a row with the name Larrys Mabiala. That's odd because if he's not in the table, we can't compare their appearances.\n\nAssuming that Larrys Mabiala isn't present, there's no data to verify the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify the claim: \"11 of the players for the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club be not of French nationality.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what data we have at our disposal. There's a table provided with 26 rows, each representing a player and their details. Each row includes several columns such as Player Name, Position, Nationality, etc.\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I should check if there are indeed 11 players on Paris Saint-Germain who are not French. So, my first step is to identify which players are associated with Paris Saint-Germain and then check their nationalities.\n\nLooking at the table, each row lists a player's name, position, etc., but it doesn't explicitly state which club each player is associated with. This is a bit confusing because I need to know if the player is part of Paris Saint-Germain to count them towards the claim. Without this information, it's impossible to accurately verify the claim.\n\nPerhaps there's an assumption that all players in the table are from Paris Saint-Germain? If that's the case, then we can proceed. But given the data provided doesn't specify the club for each player, I might be making a wrong assumption here. It could be that only certain players belong to Paris Saint-Germain, and others might be from different clubs.\n\nAssuming all 26 players are part of Paris Saint-Germain, let's examine their nationalities. I need to count how many have nationalities other than French. If the count is at least 11, then the claim holds; otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first player's nationality isn't specified\u2014missing data.\n2. The second player is Congolese.\n3. The third is French.\n4. Fourth is Portuguese.\n5. Fifth is Italian.\n6. Sixth is Spanish.\n7. Seventh is Uruguayan.\n8. Eighth is Colombian.\n9. Ninth is Mexican.\n10. Tenth is Argentinian.\n11. Eleventh is Algerian.\n\nAt this point, I've found 11 players whose nationalities are not French. However, since the first player's nationality isn't specified, there might be a possibility that they are French, which could affect the count. If that first player is indeed French, then the total would still be 10 non-French players, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, perhaps the first row doesn't have a nationality listed. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table, each row after \"Player Name\" has several columns like Position, Nationality, etc. The first row (row 0) might not have a nationality column or it's blank. If there's no nationality data for that player, we can't include them in the count.\n\nSo, if the first player is Paris Saint-Germain's player but their nationality isn't listed, they wouldn't be counted as non-French. Therefore, the maximum number of non-French players would be 10, which is less than 11.\n\nHence, the claim that \"11 of the players for Paris Saint-Germain are not French\" would be FALSE because there aren't enough players with non-French nationalities in the table.\n\nAlternatively, if the first player is considered to have a different nationality, say French, then even more players might be French. But since their nationality isn't specified, it's safer to assume they're either not part of the count or could be French, making the total non-French below 11.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the assumption that the first player's nationality isn't listed, the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Micka\u00ebl Madar and J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez are in the table. Looking through the rows, I see that there's a row for \"j\u00e9r\u00e9my m\u00e9nez\" at row index 9, columns: midfielders with 31 goals. Wait, but the claim says both scored 17 goals. So maybe I'm looking for someone named Micka\u00ebl Madar as well.\n\nHmm, scanning through the table again, I don't see an entry for \"Micka\u00ebl Madar.\" The closest names are \"micka\u00ebl madar\" and \"j\u00e9r\u00e9my m\u00e9nez.\" Wait, let me check row by row. Row 0: \"fabrice moreau,\" no. Row 1: \"roland mitoraj.\" Hmm, I don't see an exact match for Micka\u00ebl Madar in the table. Maybe he's not listed? Or perhaps it's a different spelling.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I missed him. Let me go through each row carefully. Row 0: fabrice moreau. Row1: roland mitoraj. Row2: franck m\u00e9relle. Row3: marco monteiro. Wait, no, there's \"monteiro\" at row 9? No, maybe I'm confusing the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is too long, but looking for Micka\u00ebl Madar specifically. If he isn't in the table, then his goals can't be checked. But since the claim says both scored 17, and if one of them isn't in the table, that might make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering the players. Let me try to recall: Micka\u00ebl Madar is a French player, but perhaps he's not as prominent or not listed here. On the other hand, J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez is definitely listed at row index 9, column \"midfielders,\" with 31 goals. So if the claim says both have 17 goals, that would be incorrect for him since he has 31.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row seems to represent a player's name and other details. For example, row 9 is J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez: midfielders, 31 goals. So if Micka\u00ebl Madar isn't in the table, then his scoring 17 can't be confirmed. Therefore, since one of them (M\u00e9nez) has more than 17 goals, and the other (Madar) isn't present, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong about Madar not being in the table. Let me check again. Looking through all the rows:\n\nRow 0: Fabrice Moreau\nRow1: Roland Mitoraj\nRow2: Franck M\u00e9relle\nRow3: Mario Mongelli\nRow4: Monteiro\nRow5: Bernard Moraly\nRow6: Fabrice Moreau\nRow7: Thierry Morin\nRow8: Thiago Motta\nRow9: Jean-Michel Moutier\nRow10: Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9\nRow11: Youssuf Mulumbu\nRow12: Edwin Murati\n\nNo, I don't see Micka\u00ebl Madar here. So he's not in the table, meaning we can't verify his goals.\n\nTherefore, since J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez has 31 goals and Micka\u00ebl Madar isn't listed, their combined claim of both scoring 17 is incorrect. So the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The first part is about Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 being the highest scorer. The second part mentions Bernard Mendy having the most appearances.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find cells related to these two aspects: goals scored and appearances.\n\nFor Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9:\n- His row in the table is under \"fran\u00e7ois m'pel\u00e9\" as the player.\n- In his row, there's a column named \"Goals\". Since the claim is about being the highest scorer, this \"Goals\" column would be relevant to check if he indeed has more goals than others.\n\nFor Bernard Mendy:\n- His row is under \"bernard mendy\".\n- The columns for appearances or games played are what we need. The claim says he has the most appearances, so I should look for either a \"Games Played\" or \"Appearances\" column to verify if his count is higher than others.\n\nSo, from the table structure, each player's row has several columns: Player Name, Position, Nationality, etc., plus some that might be relevant like Goals and Appearances. \n\nI need to check which columns are directly related. The \"Goals\" column for M'Pel\u00e9 and an \"Appearances\" or similar column for Mendy.\n\nNow, going through each row:\n- Find Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9's row (probably around row 24) and note the \"Goals\" value.\n- Find Bernard Mendy's row and note his \"Appearances\" count.\n\nOnce I have these numbers, compare them. If M'Pel\u00e9 has more goals than any other player and Mendy has more appearances than all others, the claim is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\nBut wait, the table might not list all players, so it's possible that another player has higher stats.

The claim says, \"only 2 people have 1 appearance for the team , franck m\u00e9relle and mario mongelli.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this means. It seems like they're talking about players who have made exactly one appearance in the team. So, I need to look through the table and find how many players have only one game under their name.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's a list of people with various details: name, position, years active, games played, and nationalities. The columns relevant here are \"Name\", \"Position\", \"Years Active\", \"Games Played\". \n\nI need to focus on the \"Games Played\" column because that's where the number of appearances is indicated. So, any player who has 1 in this column should be considered.\n\nNow, the claim says there are only two such players: Franck M\u00e9relle and Mario Mongelli. Let me check their entries in the table.\n\nStarting with Franck M\u00e9relle: Looking for his name, position, games played... According to the table, he is a goalkeeper who played 1 game. So that's one person with exactly one appearance.\n\nNext, Mario Mongelli: He is listed as a forward who played 1 game as well. So that's two people so far.\n\nI should check if there are any other players with 1 in the \"Games Played\" column to see if the claim is accurate or not.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Roland Mitoraj: Defender, 68 games.\n- Mario Mongelli: Forward, 1 game. (Already counted)\n- Monteiro: Forward, 9 games.\n- Bernard Moraly: Midfielder, 21 games.\n- Fabrice Moreau: Midfielder, 0 games? Wait, the table says \"3\" but looking again, it's probably 3. So maybe it's a typo, but in any case, he has more than one appearance.\n- Thierry Morin: Defender, 174 games.\n- Thiago Motta: Midfielder, 31 games.\n- Jean-Michel Moutier: Goalkeeper, 38 games.\n- Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9: Forward, 217 games? That seems high but he's from the Republic of the Congo, so perhaps it's a different context. He has more than one appearance.\n- Youssuf Mulumbu: Midfielder, 22 games.\n- Edwin Murati: Midfielder, 24 games.\n\nLooking through these, I don't see any other players besides Franck M\u00e9relle and Mario Mongelli with exactly 1 game played. That would make the claim true because only two people have one appearance each.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I missed someone. Let me go row by row again:\n\nRow 0: Franck M\u00e9relle - 1 game (counted)\nRow 1: Fabrice Moreau - 3 games\nRow 2: Mario Mongelli - 1 game (counted)\nRow 3: Monteiro - 9 games\nRow 4: Bernard Moraly -21\nRow 5: Fabrice Moreau again? Wait, no, row 5 is Thierry Morin with 174.\nRow 6: Thiago Motta -31\nRow7: Jean-Michel Moutier-38\nRow8: Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9-217\nRow9: Youssuf Mulumbu-22\nRow10: Edwin Murati-24\n\nSo, beyond rows 0 and 2, no one else has 1 game played.

The claim says: \"St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has less than 10 more appearances as a defender than Larrys Mabiala.\"\n\nFirst, I need to locate both individuals in the table. Let me scan through each row to find their names.\n\nStarting from the top, St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 isn't immediately obvious. Wait, looking at row number 13: it's \"fran\u00e7ois m'pel\u00e9\" as a forward. Hmm, that's not him. Moving on, row 14 is another name\u2014still not St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: It has \"st\u00e9phane mah\u00e9\" listed under the \"Name\" column, and his role is a goalkeeper. So that's not relevant for defender appearances.\n\nNext, looking for Larrys Mabiala\u2014let's see if he's in the table. Scanning down, I find row 27: \"larrys mabiala\" as a midfielder. Okay, so Larrys Mabiala is indeed in the table.\n\nNow, the claim compares their appearances as defenders. Since both might not be defenders, this could be tricky. Let me check each of their roles.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 is listed as a goalkeeper (row 0), so he doesn't have any defender appearances. On the other hand, Larrys Mabiala is a midfielder (row 27). So again, he has no defender appearances in the table.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if both have zero defender appearances, then comparing them would mean St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has less than 10 more appearances than Larrys Mabiala because both are at zero. The claim is that St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has less than 10 more as a defender than Larrys. Since both have none, the difference is zero, which is certainly less than 10.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The table lists each player's name, position, years, and some other stats. For defenders, it's under the 'Position' column as well.\n\nLooking at St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 (row 0), his position is goalkeeper, so no defender appearances. Larrys Mabiala (row 27) is a midfielder, so also no defender appearances.\n\nSo both have zero appearances as defenders.

The rows are from index 0 to 29. \n\nI'll start by checking each nationality:\n- Row 0: Republic of the Congo \u2192 not French\n- Row 1: France \u2192 French\n- Row 2: France \u2192 French\n- Row 3: France \u2192 French\n- Row 4: France \u2192 French\n- Row 5: Brazil \u2192 not French\n- Row 6: France \u2192 French\n- Row 7: France \u2192 French\n- Row 8: France \u2192 French\n- Row 9: France \u2192 French\n- Row 10: Albania \u2192 not French\n- Row 11: France \u2192 French\n- Row 12: France \u2192 French\n- Row 13: France \u2192 French\n- Row 14: France \u2192 French\n- Row 15: Italy \u2192 not French\n- Row 16: France \u2192 French\n- Row 17: France \u2192 French\n- Row 18: France \u2192 French\n- Row 19: Republic of the Congo \u2192 not French\n- Row 20: France \u2192 French\n- Row 21: Brazil \u2192 not French\n- Row 22: France \u2192 French\n- Row 23: France \u2192 French\n- Row 24: France \u2192 French\n- Row 25: Albania \u2192 not French\n- Row 26: France \u2192 French\n- Row 27: France \u2192 French\n- Row 28: Italy \u2192 not French\n- Row 29: France \u2192 French\n\nNow, let's count the non-French nationalities. I'll list them:\n1. Republic of the Congo (Row 0)\n2. Brazil (Row 5)\n3. Albania (Row 10)\n4. Republic of the Congo (Row 19)\n5. Brazil (Row 21)\n6. Albania (Row 25)\n7. Italy (Row 15)\n8. Italy (Row 28)\n\nThat's a total of 8 players who are not French. \n\nThe claim says \"less than 10\", and since 8 is less than 10, the statement holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells were relevant to verify this. The column we focused on was Nationality, as that's where the information about each player's nationality is located. So, all rows from 0 to 29 in the Nationality column are relevant because they contribute to determining if the number of non-French players is less than 10.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if Bernard Mendy has the most appearances and scored the most goals for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find Bernard Mendy in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see his name in row 15, which is \"bernard moraly\". Wait, that's not right\u2014Mendy should be a different person. Oh, actually, looking further down, there's a row with \"bernard mendy\" as row 19. So he's in row index 19.\n\nNow, I need to check two main things: the number of appearances and the number of goals he scored for PSG. The columns relevant here would be \"appearances\" and \"goals\". \n\nLooking at row 19, under \"appearances\", it shows \"21\". That seems like a reasonable number, but I don't have data on how many others have appeared more than that. For instance, checking other players like Youssuf Mulumbu (row 28) has 22 appearances, which is higher than Mendy's 21. So already, Mendy doesn't have the most appearances.\n\nNext, for goals, row 19 shows \"0\". That means he scored zero goals for PSG. Comparing that to others, many players like Mario Mongelli (row 17) and Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9 (row 32) have higher goal counts. Even within the same club, if other players have more goals, Mendy doesn't lead in scoring.\n\nAlso, I should consider the \"position\" column for Mendy\u2014it says \"midfielder\". Often, midfielders might not be primary goal scorers, but even so, having zero goals is quite low compared to others who are forwards or attacking midfielders.\n\nSo putting it all together: Mendy has 21 appearances and 0 goals. There are other players with more appearances and more goals, especially those in forward positions. Therefore, the claim that Mendy has the most appearances and goals for PSG isn't accurate.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Bernard Mendy, I checked his total appearances and goals for Paris Saint-Germain. He has 21 appearances and 0 goals, which are not the highest compared to other players like Youssuf Mulumbu (22 appearances) and Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9 (95 goals). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "nobody have only 1 appearance on this team , though 2 have 2 appearance",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check the claim that \"nobody have only 1 appearance on this team , though 2 have 2 appearances.\" Hmm, let me look at the table provided. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about the number of times players appeared on the team. The first part says nobody has just one appearance. The second part mentions that two players have exactly two appearances.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: Player Name, Position, Nationality, and some other stats. The relevant column for this task is probably \"Number\" because it's likely showing how many times each player appeared or something similar.\n\nI need to check every player's number of appearances. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Franck M\u00e9relle: Number 1. That's one appearance.\n2. Roland Mitroaj: Number 68. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. But assuming the numbers are correct, someone with 1 appearance would contradict the claim if true.\n3. Mario Mongelli: Number 1. Another player with exactly one appearance.\n4. Monteiro: Number 9. Not relevant since it's more than one.\n5. Bernard Moraly: Number 21. More than one.\n6. Fabrice Moreau: Number 3. More than one.\n7. Thierry Morin: Number 174. Definitely more than two.\n8. Thiago Motta: Number 31. Also more than two.\n9. Jean-Michel Moutier: Number 38. Again, way over two.\n10. Franck M\u00e9relle: Wait, I think I saw that earlier. Oh, maybe it's a different player with the same name. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, Franck M\u00e9relle is listed as a goalkeeper with one appearance (Number 1). So that's another player with only one appearance.\n\nSo based on this, there are multiple players with exactly one appearance, not just none. Therefore, the claim that \"nobody have only 1 appearance\" is false because I see at least two players with Number 1 and possibly more.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the column isn't \"Number\" but another column? Looking back, the columns are: Player Name, Position, Nationality, then some numbers which might be appearances or something else. For example, one player has 68, another has 217, etc.\n\nAssuming that the last number is appearances, because in football, a \"number\" often refers to the jersey number, but sometimes it can refer to appearance counts. However, given the claim is about appearances, I think we should look at how many times each player was on the team, perhaps their caps or games played.\n\nBut without clear labels, it's a bit confusing. If the last column is appearances, then players with 1, 3, etc., are those who appeared once, three times, etc. So, if any player has 1 appearance, that contradicts the first part of the claim.\n\nI think I've found at least two players (maybe more) with one appearance, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows multiple players with exactly one appearance, contradicting the claim that nobody has only one appearance. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
