    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. Each row represents a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"david frost.\" So my first task is to find David Frost in the table. Scanning through the player column, I see several names: Paul Azinger, Nick Faldo, David Frost, etc. Yes, David Frost is there as one of the players.\n\nNext, the claim says he's from the United States. I need to check his country in the table. Looking at row 3 (since it's zero-indexed?), but wait, actually, let me count: the first player is Paul Azinger (row 0), then Nick Faldo (1), David Frost (2). So row index for David Frost is 2.\n\nIn that row, under the country column, it says \"south africa.\" So according to the table, David Frost is from South Africa, not the United States. That contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the information in the table shows David Frost is from South Africa, not the United States.\n</think>\n\nThe table indicates that David Frost's country is South Africa, contradicting the claim that he is from the United States. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
