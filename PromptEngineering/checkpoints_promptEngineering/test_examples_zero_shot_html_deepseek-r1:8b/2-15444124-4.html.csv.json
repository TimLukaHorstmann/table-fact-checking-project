    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"since gp / g did not play in 2004 , no goal be score that year.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions \"gp / g\" which refers to games played or game started, and it's specified that in 2004, gp/g did not play. The implication is that because the player didn't play in 2004, they also didn't score any goals that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns. The claim specifically refers to the year 2004 and the \"gp / g\" column. So, I should focus on the row for 2004 and the corresponding \"gp / g\" cell.\n\nIn the table, each row represents a different year. For 2004, the \"gp / g\" cell says \"did not play.\" This aligns with the claim's statement that gp/g did not play in 2004. \n\nNext, I should check if this non-play status affects the goals scored. The claim suggests that because the player didn't play, they couldn't have scored any goals that year. To verify this, I need to look at the \"goals\" column for 2004.\n\nLooking at the row for 2004, under the \"goals\" column, it also says \"did not play.\" This means that in 2004, the player didn't score any goals, which supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, since both \"gp / g\" and \"goals\" for 2004 are \"did not play,\" the claim is fully supported. \n\nSo, I should identify the relevant cells: row index 7 (since counting starts from 0) for the \"gp / g\" column and row index 7 for the \"goals\" column.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE, with the relevant cells being the 2004 row in both \"gp / g\" and \"goals.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gp / g\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be no assist in the year with a total of 2 point.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about a year where the total points are 2, and in that same year, there should be no assists. My task is to check if such a condition exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists each year from 1996 to 2005, along with various statistics like goals, assists, total points, etc. There's also a row for totals at the end, but that might not be relevant here since we're looking at individual years.\n\nI need to go through each row and check two things: if the total points for that year are exactly 2 and whether there were any assists in that year.\n\nLet me look at each year one by one:\n\n- 1996: Total points = 8. Not 2.\n- 1997: Total points = 3. Not 2.\n- 1998: Total points = 0. Close, but not 2.\n- 1999: Total points = 18. No.\n- 2000 and 2001: They didn't play, so assists are N/A, but total points are also N/A. So probably irrelevant here since the claim is about a year where they did play.\n- 2002: Total points = 2. Ah, this is relevant. Now I need to check if there were any assists that year.\n  Looking at the assists column for 2002: it's 0. So no assists in that year.\n\nSo the claim says that in a year with total points of 2, there are no assists. Here, 2002 has exactly 2 total points and 0 assists. That matches the condition. \n\nI should also check other years to make sure there aren't any other years that fit this condition, but from scanning through, none seem to match except 2002.\n\nWait, let me double-check: 2002 is the only year with exactly 2 total points, and in that year, assists are zero.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the gp / g in the year that have 1 assist be 6 / 0\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. GP stands for Games Played and GS stands for Games Started, right? So when it says \"gp / g in the year that have 1 assist,\" it's referring to the row where the number of assists is exactly 1. Then, according to the claim, those rows should have a gp / gs value of 6/0.\n\nNow, I need to check each year in the table and see if any of them meet this condition. The table has years from 1996 to 2005, plus totals at the end.\n\nLooking at the \"assists\" column: let's go through each row.\n\n1996: assists are 2 \u2192 doesn't have 1 assist.\n1997: assists are 1 \u2192 okay, this is a potential candidate.\nCheck GP/GS for 1997: it's 6/0. That matches the claim exactly. So this row satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but I should also check if any other years might fit. Let me go through all rows:\n\n1998: assists are 0 \u2192 no.\n1999: assists are 4 \u2192 no.\n2000: did not play \u2192 no data.\n2001: same as above.\n2002: assists are 0 \u2192 no.\n2003: did not play.\n2004: same.\n2005: assists are 0 \u2192 no.\nTotals row doesn't apply since it's totals across years, not per year.\n\nSo only the 1997 row has exactly 1 assist and its GP/GS is 6/0. That means the claim is true because there exists at least one year that fits the description.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I interpreted the columns correctly. The table shows \"gp / gs\" as separate from \"goals\". So for each row, when the assists are 1, does the \"gp / gs\" equal 6/0? Yes, in 1997 it's exactly that.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there is a year with the specified characteristics.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"assists\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gp / gs\"}]}",

Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the gp / g be mark as did not play in 2003 when the total point be mark as did not play as well.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things:\n1. For the year 2003, the \"gp / gs\" column should be marked as \"did not play.\"\n2. At the same time, the \"total points\" column for 2003 is also marked as \"did not play.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to examine the rows corresponding to 2003 and see what values are present in those columns.\n\nStarting with the year 2003:\n- The row for 2003 has \"did not play\" in all four data cells: gp / gs, goals, assists, and total points. This is under the year 2003.\n\nSo both \"gp / gs\" and \"total points\" are marked as \"did not play\" for 2003. That seems to align perfectly with the claim.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check if there's any other condition or if I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim uses \"when,\" which might imply that both conditions have to be true at the same time. In this case, since both are indeed \"did not play\" for 2003, it meets both parts of the claim.\n\nIs there anything else I should consider? Maybe checking other years or if there's a trick here. For example, is there any row after 2003 that might affect this, but the total points and gp/gs for 2003 are clearly stated as \"did not play.\" There's no conflicting information in the table that would contradict this.\n\nSo, I think both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks that for the year 2003, both \"gp / gs\" and \"total points\" are marked as \"did not play.\" The table confirms these entries. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"10 goal,\" which I think refers to a player scoring 10 goals in a particular year between 1996 and 2005. So I'll need to check each year from 1996 to 2005 and see if any player scored exactly 10 goals in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are \"year,\" \"goals,\" and maybe \"assists\" if needed, but the main focus is on \"goals.\" Each row represents a different year, and within each year, there's information about how many games played (gp) and goals scored (goals), along with assists and total points.\n\nI'll go through each year from 1996 to 2005:\n\n1. **1996**: The table shows 3 goals. That's not 10.\n2. **1997**: Only 1 goal, so no.\n3. **1998**: 0 goals, definitely not.\n4. **1999**: 7 goals, still less than 10.\n5. **2000**: Did not play, so no data here.\n6. **2001**: Also did not play.\n7. **2002**: 1 goal, which is way below.\n8. **2003**: Did not play.\n9. **2004**: Did not play.\n10. **2005**: Here, the goals are 4. Still not 10.\n\nWait, but I also notice there's a \"totals\" row at the end. Maybe that's a cumulative total? It shows 16 goals in total across all years from 1996 to 2005. But the claim is about scoring 10 goals in a single year within that range, so this total doesn't directly help.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any player scored exactly 10 goals in any of these years. From the table data provided, none of the years from 1996 to 2005 have a \"goals\" value of 10. The closest is 7 in 1999 and 4 in 2005, but neither reaches 10.\n\nSo, there's no evidence in the table that any player scored 10 goals in any year between 1996 and 2005.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be only 1 assist in the year 2002\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is specifically about the year 2002 and the number of assists. It's saying that in 2002, there was only 1 assist. So my main focus will be on finding the relevant data for the year 2002 and the assists column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has headers: year, gp / gs, goals, assists, total points. The body contains rows for each year from 1996 to 2005, along with a totals row. Each cell under these headers provides specific statistics.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to the year 2002. Scanning through the table, I see that the year 2002 is in the sixth row (index 6). Now, within this row, the columns are: gp / gs, goals, assists, total points.\n\nThe claim mentions \"assist\", so I need to look at the assists column for 2002. The cell under \"assists\" for 2002 is listed as 0. That's interesting because the claim says there should be only 1 assist, but according to the table, it's 0.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm miscounting rows. Let me recount: row 0 is 1996, row 1 is 1997, row 2 is 1998, row 3 is 1999, row 4 is 2000, row 5 is 2001, so row 6 should be 2002. That seems correct.\n\nSo in row 6 (2002), the assists column has a value of 0. The claim states there was only 1 assist. This doesn't match because 0 isn't equal to 1. Therefore, the claim is incorrect based on the table data provided.\n\nI should also consider whether any other cells might affect this conclusion. For example, if the \"gp / gs\" column had a different value that could influence assists somehow, but in this case, it's \"4 / 0\". However, \"assists\" are explicitly given as 0, so I don't think the \"gp / gs\" affects the count of assists directly. The assist count is its own separate number.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the totals row has a different number? Let me check that. The totals row is at the end, which is for years combined, and it shows 16 assists in total across all years. But since we're specifically looking at 2002, the relevant data is still 0.\n\nSo putting this together, the claim's assertion about 1 assist in 2002 isn't supported by the table data\u2014it actually shows 0. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"assists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the year with 18 point have 7 total assist.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions a year that has 18 points and asserts that this same year has 7 assists.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific year, along with statistics like goals, assists, and total points. The columns are 'year', 'gp / gs', 'goals', 'assists', and 'total points'.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the 'total points' is 18 because that's mentioned in the claim. \n\nStarting from 1996: total points are 8.\n1997: 3\n1998: 0\n1999: 18 \u2192 Here, total points are 18. So this year is relevant for the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the assists column for 1999: it's 4. The claim says it should have 7 assists. Since 4 \u2260 7, this doesn't match.\n\nI'll also check other rows to see if any other year has 18 points, but scanning through, only 1999 does. So there are no other years with 18 points to consider.\n\nSo the relevant cells for verifying the claim are the 'year' (row index 3) and both 'assists' (column name 'assists') because we're checking if that year's assists equal 7. Wait, actually, since the claim is about whether the year with 18 points has 7 assists, the relevant columns would be the one where total points are 18 and the assists column for that same row.\n\nTherefore, I need to mark both the 'year' (to identify which year it is) and the 'assists' column (to check the number of assists in that year). So the relevant cells include both row 3's 'year' and 'assists'.\n\nPutting this together, if another row had 18 points with 7 assists, it would support the claim.

Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the data.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions \"g in the year that have less than 1 assist be always 0.\" I think \"g\" here refers to goals, possibly shorthand for assists since \"a\" is often used for assists. So rephrasing, it says that in years where the number of assists is less than 1, the goals should be zero.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1996 to 2005 and includes the number of games played (gp) and games started (gs), along with goals, assists, and total points. The last row is the totals.\n\nI need to check for years where assists are less than 1 and see if goals are zero in those cases.\n\nLet's go through each year:\n\n1996: Assists = 2. Since 2 >= 1, not relevant.\n1997: Assists = 1. Again, 1 is not less than 1, so not relevant.\n1998: Assists = 0. Now, this is the first year where assists are less than 1 (specifically zero). According to the claim, goals should be zero here. Looking at 1998's goals, it's 0. So that matches.\n2002: Assists = 0 again. Goals for 2002 are 1. Wait, that's a problem because if assists are less than 1 (zero), but goals are 1, which is not zero. This contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, in 2002, the condition of assists <1 (zero) does not lead to goals being zero, as per the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut I should also check other years where assists might be less than 1 beyond those already listed. Looking at the rest:\n\n1999: Assists =4\n2000: Did not play, so maybe considered as zero? But it's unclear if \"did not play\" translates to zero or something else.\n2001: Same as above.\n2003-2005: Not relevant because they didn't play.\n\nSo 2002 is the main issue here. Also, in 2000 and 2001, since they didn't play, perhaps their goals and assists are considered zero by default. But the claim specifically refers to \"years that have less than 1 assist.\" If a player didn't play, does that mean they have zero assists? If so, then the claim would apply.\n\nBut in the context of sports statistics, if a player didn't play, their stats like goals and assists are typically recorded as zero. So for 2000 and 2001, assists would be zero, and so per the claim, goals should also be zero, which they are. But since 2002 is an actual case where assists are zero but goals are not, that's a counterexample.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim isn't always true because in 2002, despite having zero assists, goals were 1.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the gp / g in 2003 , when the number of total point be mark as did not play always have 1 goal.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is asserting. It seems like it's talking about a specific year, 2003, and how the statistics (goals against or goals for?) relate to points. The term \"gp / g\" might stand for Goals Against/For, but looking at the table columns, there's \"goals\" and \"assists\", but not \"points against\" or something similar. Wait, the table has a column called \"total points\". So maybe \"gp / g\" refers to \"goals\" in this context.\n\nWait, let me look at the table again. The columns are year, gp/gs (which probably stands for Games Played/Started), goals, assists, and total points. So \"gp / g\" could be a shorthand or specific term used here, perhaps meaning Goals Played or something else. But I need to clarify what it refers to.\n\nWait, in the claim, it's said that \"the gp / g in 2003\" when the number of total points is marked as did not play always have 1 goal. Hmm. So for the year 2003, if a player's total points are marked as \"did not play,\" then their goals should be 1.\n\nLooking at the table, for 2003, all entries under the 'total points' column say \"did not play\" except maybe one. Wait, no, in the table, let me check each row:\n\n- 1996: total points 8\n- 1997: 3\n- 1998: 0\n- 1999: 18\n- 2000: did not play\n- 2001: did not play\n- 2002: 2\n- 2003: did not play\n- 2004: did not play\n- 2005: 8\n- totals: 39\n\nSo in 2003, the total points are \"did not play.\" Now, what's the goals column for 2003? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the 2003 row: the 'goals' cell is \"did not play.\" So if I look at that row, both 'total points' and 'goals' are marked as did not play. But the claim says when the total points are marked as did not play, then the goals should be 1. However, in this case, for 2003, both are \"did not play,\" but the goal is also \"did not play,\" which isn't 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the claim again: \"the gp / g in 2003 , when the number of total point be mark as did not play always have 1 goal.\" So it's saying that for 2003, whenever a player's total points are marked as did not play, their goals are 1.\n\nBut looking at 2003, all cells under 'total points' say \"did not play\" and the corresponding 'goals' also say \"did not play,\" which doesn't equal 1. So this would mean that the claim is false because in 2003, when total points are did not play, goals are also did not play.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a specific player or context where only some players have 'total points' as did not play and their goals are 1. But looking at the table, all the rows for 2003 have both 'total points' and 'goals' as did not play, which doesn't fit the condition.\n\nSo I think the claim is asserting that in 2003, whenever a player's total points are marked as did not play, their goals should be exactly 1. But in reality, in 2003, all players with 'total points' as did not play also have 'goals' as did not play. Therefore, the condition isn't met for any player in 2003.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there are no instances where a player's total points are marked as did not play and their goals are exactly 1 in the year 2003.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because in 2003, when total points are marked as \"did not play,\" the corresponding goals are also \"did not play,\" not equal to 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"total points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
