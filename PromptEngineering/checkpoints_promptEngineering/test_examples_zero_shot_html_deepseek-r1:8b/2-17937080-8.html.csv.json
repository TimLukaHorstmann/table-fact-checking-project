    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237.\" So I should check each row in the table where the 'goals per match' column exceeds 1.237 and see if their ranks are exactly 11.0.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Lionel Messi has a goals per match of 1.217, which is less than 1.237.\n2. **Row 2**: Another Lionel Messi with 1.224, still below.\n3. **Row 3**: Cristiano Ronaldo with 1.091, nope.\n4. **Row 4**: Cristiano again at 1.000, not enough.\n5. **Row 5**: Both players have around 0.98 and 0.964; way below.\n6. **Row 7**: Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s has 1.237 exactly. Wait, the claim says more than 1.237, so equal isn't enough.\n7. **Row 8**: Ronaldo again with 0.964, no.\n8. **Row 9**: Messi at 0.887, nope.\n9. **Row 10**: Telmo Zarra at 1.278 which is above 1.237. So rank 10 has a higher value than the claimed threshold.\n10. **Row 11**: Di St\u00e9fano with exactly 1.000, not over.\n11. **Row 12**: Three entries here:\n    - Mariano Mart\u00edn: 1.355 (above 1.237)\n    - Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s: 1.077 (below)\n    - Hugo S\u00e1nchez: 0.933 (nope)\n    - Baltazar: 0.913\n12. **Row 13**: Hugo again lower.\n15. **Row 14**: Hugo with 0.759, no.\n16. **Row 15**: Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s at 1.000.\n\nWait, so looking for ranks where goals per match are over 1.237. From the table, the rows that have >1.237:\n\n- Row 10: Rank 10, goals 1.278\n- Row 12: Mariano Mart\u00edn, rank 12, goals 1.355\n\nSo there's more than one player with a higher goal per match than 1.237. Their ranks are 10 and 12, not just 11. Therefore, the claim that \"11.0 be the rank\" is incorrect because there are other ranks (10 and 12) that meet the criteria.\n\nI should check if any row has rank exactly 11.0 with goals per match >1.237. Looking through the table:\n\n- Rank 11: Di St\u00e9fano at 1.000, which isn't above 1.237.\n- Rank 12: As mentioned, two players but only one (Mariano) meets the criteria.\n\nSo no player at rank 11 has a goals per match over 1.237. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are other ranks involved and rank 11 doesn't meet the threshold.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells that support this conclusion. These would be the rows where goals per match >1.237, which are:\n\n- Row 10 (rank 10)\n- Row 12 (Mariano Mart\u00edn at rank 12)\n\nSo their row indices are 9 and 11 respectively because counting starts from 0.\n\nWait, in the JSON example, the first relevant cell is index 0, so in this case:\n\nRow 10 would be index 9, since it's the 10th row. Similarly, Row 12 is the 12th row, which is index 11.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include these two rows with their respective indices and column_name as \"goals per match\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have answer: \"FALSE\" and the relevant cells pointing to these two rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Lionel Messi is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. There are two main parts here: the rank and the goals scored.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all entries where the name is Lionel Messi. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 0: Lionel Messi, rank 1, season 2011/12, club Barcelona, goals 73, apps 60, goals per match 1.217.\n- Other rows mention Lionel Messi in different seasons and ranks.\n\nThe claim specifies rank 2 for the 2011/12 season. However, in the table, row 0 shows Lionel Messi with rank 1 during that same season. There's no entry where his rank is 2 for 2011/12. So the rank part of the claim doesn't hold true.\n\nAdditionally, even though he scored 73 goals in 2011/12, since the rank is incorrect, the entire claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Lionel Messi was ranked 2nd and scored 73 goals during the 2011/12 season. Checking the table:\n\n- **Rank**: The only entry for Lionel Messi in 2011/12 is rank 1 (row 0).\n- **Goals**: While he scored 73 goals, the incorrect rank makes the claim false.\n\nSince the rank doesn't match, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's about a specific rank (rank 11) and a specific statistic (goals per match being less than 1.237). \n\nLooking at the table, there's a column called \"rank\" and several columns related to players' performance, including \"goals per match.\" The task is to find the row where the rank is 11 and check the corresponding goals per match.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\n- The first few rows have ranks like 1, 2, 4, 5, etc. None are 11.\n- Continuing down, I reach row 11: \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\" with rank 11.\n- In that row, under \"goals per match,\" it says \"1.000.\"\n\nNow, the claim is whether the player on rank 11 has less than 1.237 goals per match. Since 1.000 is equal to 1.0, which is definitely less than 1.237, this should be true.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells. The relevant row is row_index 10 (since it's zero-indexed), and the column is \"goals per match.\"\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the goals per match for rank 11.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
