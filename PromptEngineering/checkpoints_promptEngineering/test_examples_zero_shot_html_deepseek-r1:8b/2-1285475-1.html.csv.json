    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the m47tu2d20 be built in 2004 and have a power of 90 kw (121hp) 4000.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Build year: 2004.\n2. Power output: 90 kW (121 hp).\n\nNext, I'll examine the table to find relevant cells that support or contradict these statements.\n\nStarting with the build year:\n- I look for the engine \"m47tu2d20\" in the 'year' column. Scanning through the rows, I see it appears at row index 5 (2004) and row index 6 (2005). So, the claim says it was built in 2004, which is true based on row index 5.\n\nNow for the power:\n- The claim mentions a power of 90 kW. In the 'power' column, under \"m47tu2d20,\" I see two entries: one at row 5 with 90 kw (121hp) and another at row 6 with 120 kw (161hp). So, there is an entry where it has 90 kw.\n\nWait a second, but the claim says \"have a power of 90 kw (121hp) 4000.\" In the table, both rows for m47tu2d20 have \"4000\" in the 'power' cell. This might refer to something else, like the number of units or other specs, not the actual power. But regardless, the key point is that there's a row where it has 90 kw.\n\nPutting it all together: The build year matches for 2004 and there is an entry with 90 kW. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"the m47d20 engine be made before 1999 and have a power rating of 100 kw (134hp) 4000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. The m47d20 engine was made before 1999.\n2. It has a power rating of 100 kw (134hp) at 4000 RPM.\n\nI'll start by looking for rows in the table where the engine is m47d20.\n\nLooking through the table, I see two entries for m47d20:\n\n- Row 0: Year 1998\n- Row 1: Year 2001\n\nSo, both engines are m47d20. Now, let's check if any of these were made before 1999. The first row is 1998, which is indeed before 1999. However, the second row is 2001, which is after 1999.\n\nNow, for the power rating: 100 kw (134hp) at 4000 RPM.\n\nChecking both m47d20 entries:\n\n- Row 0: Power is 100 kw (134hp), rpm 4000\n- Row 1: Power is 85 kw (114hp), rpm 4000\n\nSo, the first m47d20 in 1998 has exactly the power rating stated. The second one doesn't match the power, but it's after 1999.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the m47d20 engine be made before 1999 and have a power rating...\" So does that mean both engines? Or is it referring to any of them?\n\nThe wording is a bit ambiguous. If it refers to all m47d20 engines, then only the one from 1998 matches both conditions. The 2001 engine doesn't match because it's after 1999 and has lower power.\n\nBut if it's about at least one m47d20 engine meeting both criteria, then it's true for row 0.\n\nSo, in the table, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: engine is m47d20, displacement, power (100 kw), torque, year 1998.\n- Also, since the claim mentions \"be made before 1999,\" we need to check if any of them were before 1999. Since row 0 is 1998, it's relevant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because there exists at least one m47d20 engine that meets both conditions.\n\nRelevant cells are those in row 0 for all columns except maybe year if we don't need to check the specific year, but the user's instruction says to check each condition. So, all relevant columns are:\n\n- engine (m47d20)\n- displacement\n- power (100 kw)\n- torque\n- year\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"before 1999\" and \"4000.\" So for the power, it's specifically at 4000 RPM. The torque might not be necessary unless it's part of the check, but the claim doesn't mention torque.\n\nWait, let me reread the instructions: carefully check each condition in the claim against the table. So, the two conditions are:\n\n1. Made before 1999\n2. Power rating of 100 kw at 4000 RPM\n\nSo, for condition 1, we need to find any m47d20 engine with year <1999. That's row 0.\n\nFor condition 2, same row has power 100 kw at 4000.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 0, all columns except maybe torque unless it's needed for verification. But since the claim doesn't mention torque, perhaps only the first two rows (engine and year) and power are relevant. Or wait, the columns are engine, displacement, power, torque, year. The claim refers to make (so engine), power rating including both kw/hp and rpm, and whether it's before 1999.\n\nSo for each condition:\n\n- For \"made before 1999\": check engine column and year.\n- For \"power rating of 100 kw (134hp) at 4000 RPM\": check power column and rpm. Since the table has rpm as 4000 in both, but for m47d20, only row 0 matches.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: engine, displacement, power, torque, year\n- But since condition 1 is about being made before 1999, we need to check if any m47d20 has year <1999. That's only row 0. So all columns of row 0 except maybe torque.\n\nAlternatively, the claim might not require checking displacement or torque unless it's part of verifying something else, but the user's instruction says to check each condition. So perhaps for condition 1, we need engine and year; for condition 2, power and rpm.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For engine being m47d20: row 0 and 1\n- But only rows where year <1999: row 0\n- Power is 100 kw at 4000 RPM: row 0\n\nSo, in terms of columns, for condition 1, it's engine (m47d20) and year (1998). For condition 2, power (100kw) and rpm (4000).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 0: engine, displacement, power, torque, year\nBut wait, do I need to check all these? Or just engine and year for condition 1, and power and rpm for condition 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the specific columns that directly relate to each condition. So for condition 1, it's engine (m47d20) and year <1999. For condition 2, power is 100 kw at 4000 RPM.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Engine column: m47d20\n- Year column: 1998 (to check if before 1999)\n- Power column: 100 kw\n- RPM isn't explicitly a column in the table but is part of the power entry. Wait, looking back at the table, it lists \"Power (kW)/Torque (Nm)\" as one cell per row, so I think rpm isn't directly listed. So perhaps the claim refers to 4000 rpm, but since that's not a column, maybe only the power and year are relevant.\n\nWait, in the table, each row has:\n\n- Engine\n- Displacement (cc)\n- Power (kW)/Torque (Nm)\n- Year\n\nSo no separate RPM column. Therefore, when the claim mentions \"4000,\" it refers to the RPM associated with that power rating, which is part of the power/torque cell.\n\nTherefore, for condition 2, we need to check if any m47d20 engine has power 100 kw (134hp) as stated in the power column and that this occurs at 4000 RPM. Since the table doesn't list RPM separately, perhaps it's inferred from the power entry. So maybe only the power value is needed.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions \"at 4000.\" If we can confirm whether 100kw is delivered at 4000 RPM for m47d20, then the power column suffices. Alternatively, without RPM data, we can't directly check, but perhaps it's standard to assume that 100kw is at 4000.\n\nTherefore, to be thorough, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For condition 1: engine (m47d20) and year (1998)\n- For condition 2: power (100 kw)\n\nSo, in terms of columns, for each row where engine is m47d20, we check year <1999 and power =100kw.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 0: engine, displacement, power, torque, year\nBut only because it meets both conditions. However, since condition 1 requires checking all m47d20 engines (rows 0 and 1) to see if any were made before 1999, and condition 2 requires checking same for their power.\n\nSo in the JSON, I need to list the cells that support the claim. Since row 0 satisfies both conditions, its engine, displacement, power, torque, and year are relevant. Row 1 doesn't satisfy either condition fully (it's after 1999 and lower power). Therefore, only row 0 is relevant.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: all columns except maybe torque if it's not needed, but since the claim doesn't mention torque, perhaps just engine, displacement, power, year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the specific data points needed for each condition. For \"made before 1999,\" we need engine and year. For power rating, we need power and rpm (though rpm isn't a column). But as per the table, rpm isn't listed, so maybe just power is enough. However, without rpm, it's unclear if the power is at 4000.\n\nThis is tricky. Since the claim mentions \"at 4000,\" which isn't a column, but it's standard for engines to specify RPM with their power ratings. So perhaps the table assumes that 100kw is at 4000 RPM. Therefore, the relevant cells would be engine, displacement, power, torque (if needed), and year.\n\nBut since the user instruction says to check each condition against the table, which lists power as including both kW and Nm (torque). So for condition 2, we need to see if any m47d20 has power/torque =100/ X. But since the claim mentions \"at 4000,\" which is RPM, and it's not in the table, perhaps only the power is directly checked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's enough to check that power is 100kw for m47d20, regardless of RPM.\n\nI think I'll proceed with the safest assumption: for condition 1, engine (m47d20) and year <1999; for condition 2, power =100 kw. Therefore, in the table cells:\n\n- Engine: m47d20\n- Displacement: doesn't matter, as it's not part of the claim\n- Power: 100\n- Year: 1998\n\nBut since displacement isn't mentioned, maybe it's irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, to support both conditions, for row 0, engine, power, and year are relevant. Displacement and torque aren't needed.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"rows\": [\n    {\n      \"engine\": \"m47d20\",\n      \"displacement\": \"...\",\n      \"power\": \"100\",\n      \"torque\": \"...\",\n      \"year\": \"1998\"\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n\nBut since the claim doesn't mention displacement or torque, perhaps only engine, power, and year are needed.\n\nAlternatively, if we take into account that for condition 2, rpm is implied but not listed, perhaps it's enough to have power as 100. But without RPM data, maybe it's irrelevant.\n\nI think I'll stick with the columns that directly support the conditions: engine (to find m47d20), year (to confirm <1999), and power (to confirm 100kw). Therefore, in the cells, these are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe table analysis leads us to identify specific data points that support both claims. For \"made before 1999,\" we need the engine type and the year. For the power rating of 100 kW at 4000 RPM, we focus on the power value (assuming RPM is standard for that power). Here are the identified cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"rows\": [\n    {\n      \"engine\": \"m47d20\",\n      \"displacement\": \"...\",\n      \"power\": \"100\",\n      \"torque\": \"...\",\n      \"year\": \"1998\"\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n**Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant data points supporting the claims are:\n\n- **Engine**: m47d20\n- **Year**: 1998 (indicating it was made before 1999)\n- **Power**: 100 kW\n\nThese details correspond to the first row of the table, confirming both conditions.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim states: \"the earliest year with a power of 90 kw (121hp) 4000 be the year 2003.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant. The key elements here are 'power' and 'year'. So, I'll look at the 'power' column for entries equal to 90 kW (which is 121hp) and note their corresponding years.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first two rows have 100 kW and 85 kW, so not relevant.\n2. The third and fourth rows also have 100 kW, so skip.\n3. Fifth row: power is 85 kW, skip.\n6. Sixth row: power is 110 kW, skip.\n7. Seventh row: power is 90 kW, this might be relevant. The year here is 2004.\n8. Eighth row: same as above, but the torque range is different, but the power is still 90 kW. Year is 2005.\n9. Ninth row: power is 120 kW, so skip.\n\nSo, the rows with 90 kW are rows 7 and 8 (index 6 and 7 if we start counting from 0). \n\nNow, check their years:\n- Row 7 has year 2004.\n- Row 8 also has year 2005.\n\nThe claim says the earliest year is 2003. But looking at the table, the earliest occurrence of 90 kW is in row 7 with a year of 2004. There's no entry in 2003 for that power. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the earliest year with that power is 2004, not 2003.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are no entries in 2003 for a power of 90 kW.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"power\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the engine model power rating in 2001 is true based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the engine model power rating in 2001 be 100 kw (134hp) 4000\". So, the claim mentions three specific values: 100 kW (which is 134 horsepower), and it's referring to the year 2001. The term \"4000\" might be a bit confusing here, but I think it's likely referring to the displacement in liters or cubic inches. Looking at the table, I can see that the displacement column often has values like 2.0l with specific numbers in parentheses, which probably represent cubic centimeters and inch\u00b3.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any engine model where, in the year 2001, the power rating is exactly 100 kW (134hp). The columns relevant here are \"engine,\" \"displacement,\" \"power,\" \"torque,\" and \"year.\"\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n1. First row: Year is 1998. Not 2001.\n2. Second row: Year is 2001. Let's check the power column: It says 85 kW (114hp). That doesn't match 100 kW.\n3. Third row: Year is 1999.\n4. Fourth row: Also 1999.\n5. Fifth row: Year is 2003. Displacement changed to 2.0l with 1995cc, so that's a different displacement than the first few rows.\n6. Sixth row: Year is 2001 again. Power here is 110 kW (148hp), which is higher than what the claim states.\n7. Seventh row: Year is 2004.\n8. Eighth row: Year is 2005.\n\nSo, in the entire table, the only engine models with a power of exactly 100kW are:\n\n- First row: 1998\n- Third row: 1999\n- Fourth row: 1999\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, the second and sixth rows have different power ratings but the same displacement. Hmm, maybe I should note each occurrence where the engine has a power of 100kW in 2001.\n\nWait, no, the second row is for 2001 but with 85kW. The sixth row is also 2001 but with 110kW. So, there's no row where in 2001, the power is exactly 100kW.\n\nSo, does that mean the claim is false? Because according to the table, in 2001, the engine either had 85kW or 110kW, not 100kW. Therefore, the claim is not supported by any row in the table for the year 2001 and power rating of 100kW.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row's year and power:\n\nLooking again at row indices (assuming they start from 0):\n\nRow 0: Year 1998, Power 100kw\nRow 1: Year 2001, Power 85kw\nRow 2: Year 1999, Power 100kw\nRow 3: Year 1999, Power 85kw\nRow 4: Year 2003, Power 85kw\nRow 5: Year 2001, Power 110kw\nRow 6: Year 2004, Power 90kw\nRow 7: Year 2005, Power varies\n\nSo, in 2001 (rows 1 and 5), the power is either 85 or 110 kW. There's no row where in 2001, the engine has exactly 100kW.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no data supporting that in 2001, the engine model had a power rating of 100kW.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2001, an engine model had a power rating of 100 kW (134hp). After examining the table, it's evident that no row for 2001 lists 100 kW. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"power\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"power\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
