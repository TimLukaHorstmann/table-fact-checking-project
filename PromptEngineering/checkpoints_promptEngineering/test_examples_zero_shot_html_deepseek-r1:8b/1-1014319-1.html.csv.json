    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the dance tango with song hung up receive a 10 from goodman and be also rat by tonioli.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts. \n\n1. The dance tango with song \"hung up\" gets a score of 10 from Goodman.\n2. This same dance is rated by Tonioli.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week and includes various dances along with scores from different judges like Horwood, Goodman, Dixon, Tonioli, etc., plus a total and result.\n\nI need to find the specific dance mentioned: tango with \"hung up.\" So I'll scan through each row's \"dance / song\" column until I see that combination.\n\nChecking the table row by row:\n\n- Week 1: cha-cha-cha\n- Week 2: foxtrot\n- Week 3: quickstep\n- Week 4: charleston\n- Week 5: argentine tango\n- Week 6: viennese waltz\n- Week 7: rumba\n- Week 8: samba\n- Week 10: jive\n- Week 11: salsa, swing, tango\n- Week 12: samba, showdance, paso doble\n\nIn week 11, there are three dances listed:\n1. Salsa\n2. Swing\n3. Tango with \"hung up\"\n\nSo the dance in question is in row 11 (assuming rows start at 0 or 1). Wait, looking at the table, it's a bit confusing because some weeks like week 11 have multiple entries. But each <tr> is a separate row. So week 11 has three different dances, each in their own row? Or are they under the same week?\n\nWait, the table shows rows with \"week\" as 1,2,3,...12 and each week has one dance except for week 11 which has three dances. That's unusual because typically a competition might have multiple dances per week. So each <tr> is a separate dance entry.\n\nSo the tango with \"hung up\" is in row where week=11, column=dance/song=\"tango / hung up.\" Looking at the table, yes:\n\n- Row 11 (assuming rows are 0-indexed) or maybe it's actually week 11 as per data. Wait, no: the first row is week 1, then week 2, etc., so row index starts at 0 for week 1.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, in the HTML code, each <tr> has a \"week\" value that starts from 1 upwards. So for example, the first <tr> has week=\"1\", next week=\"2\", up to week=\"12\". So the rows are 0-indexed as per the index in the array but correspond to weeks starting at 1.\n\nWait, no, the user provided a table where each row corresponds to different weeks. So the first row is week 1, second week 2, etc., up to week 12. Therefore, when looking for \"tango / hung up,\" I need to find which row has that dance.\n\nLooking at week 11 (row index 10), the dances are salsa, swing, and tango with hung up. So in row 10, column=dance/song=tango/hung up.\n\nNow, checking Goodman's score for this dance: in the same row, I need to find the column named \"goodman.\" Each row lists various judges' scores. For example, columns are like horwood, goodman, dixon, tonioli, etc.\n\nIn week 11, specifically the tango/hung up entry (row 10), the scores would be under the respective judge columns. So I need to look at what Goodman scored this dance.\n\nLooking through each column in that row: \n\n- horwood:9\n- goodman:10\n- dixon:10\n- tonioli:9\n\nSo yes, Goodman gave a 10 for this tango performance. That's the first part of the claim correct.\n\nNow the second part: \"be also rat by tonioli.\" Wait, \"rat\" seems like a typo; perhaps it's supposed to be \"rated.\" So does Tonioli rate this dance?\n\nLooking at the same row, under \"tonioli,\" the score is 9. So Tonioli rated it with a 9.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"be also rat by tonioli.\" If \"rat\" means \"rate,\" then yes, because Tonioli did give a rating of 9. However, if \"rat\" is meant to imply something negative like failing or getting a bad score, that's not directly supported here since Goodman gave a 10 and Tonioli gave 9, which are positive scores.\n\nBut the user instruction says: If fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. So we need to check whether both conditions in the claim are met.\n\nFirst condition: Goodman gives 10 - yes.\n\nSecond condition: Tonioli also \"rates\" it (using \"rat\" as a verb) - which he does, giving a score of 9.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check if \"be rat by tonioli\" implies that Tonioli's rating was negative or affected in some way. However, since the instruction doesn't specify that, just that the dance received a 10 from Goodman and was rated by Tonioli, regardless of the score, it's still correct.\n\nSo both conditions are met.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tonioli\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be , rank a 7 from horwood , have a total score of 31 , and have a safe result.\"\n\nBreaking this down, I need to check each part against the table. The relevant columns mentioned are 'goodman', 'horwood', 'total', and 'result'.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week, and each has data for various dance styles. I'll go through each condition one by one.\n\nFirst condition: Goodman gives an 8 to all songs that are listed. So, I need to check if Goodman's score is consistently 8 across all relevant rows. Looking at the 'goodman' column:\n\n- Week 1: 8\n- Week 2: 8\n- Week 3: 7 (Wait, this is different)\n- Week 4: 9\n- Week 5: 8\n- Week 6: 9\n- Week 7: 9\n- Week 8: 9\n- Week 10: 9\n- Week 11: n/a (missing)\n- Week 12: 9\n\nHmm, in week 3, Goodman has a 7. So that contradicts the first condition because not all songs get an 8 from Goodman. Therefore, the claim might be false already.\n\nBut let me check other conditions to see if it's maybe still true in another way or if I'm misinterpreting something.\n\nSecond condition: Rank a 7 from Horwood. Looking at the 'horwood' column:\n\n- Week 1: 7\n- Week 2: 7\n- Week 3: 8\n- Week 4: 9\n- Week 5: 8\n- Week 6: 9\n- Week 7: 9\n- Week 8: 9\n- Week 10: 8\n- Week 11: n/a\n- Week 12: 9\n\nSo, Horwood doesn't always rank a 7. For example, weeks 4,5,6,7,8,10,12 have higher scores. So the second condition isn't fully met either.\n\nThird condition: Total score of 31. Looking for rows where total is 31.\n\nWeeks 1 and 2 have totals of 31. But other weeks don't. For example, week 3's total is 34, week 4 is 35, etc. So the claim that all songs have a total of 31 isn't true.\n\nFourth condition: Safe result. Looking at the 'result' column:\n\n- Weeks with 'safe result': Weeks 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,12 (except week 4 and 12 has second place).\n\nWait, in week 12, the result is 'second place', not safe. Also, week 4's result isn't mentioned but from the data, week 4 might be considered as a winner or something else. But regardless, not all results are safe.\n\nPutting it all together, since Goodman doesn't always give 8, Horwood doesn't always rank 7, the total isn't consistently 31, and the result isn't always safe, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim fails because Goodman's score isn't consistent (e.g., week 3 has a 7), Horwood's rank isn't always 7, the total score varies, and results aren't all safe.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"horwood\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"dixon give the score 10 to the song samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table data.\n\nThe table has several columns: week, dance/song, horwood, goodman, dixon, tonioli, total, and result. Each row represents a week, the specific dance or song performed, and the scores from different judges (horwood, goodman, dixon, tonioli), along with the total score and the result.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions \"dixon give the score 10 to the song samba / young heart run free.\" So I need to find in the table where Dixon gave a score of 10 to that particular song. \n\nI'll go through each row to check for the dance/song pair \"samba / young heart run free\" and see what Dixon's score is. \n\nStarting from week 1, none have samba. Week 4: Charleston... nope. Week 8 has samba / young hearts run free. Let me look at that row.\n\nWeek 8: \n- dance/song: samba / young hearts run free\n- horwood:9\n- goodman:9\n- dixon:10\n- tonioli:10\n- total:38\n- result: safe\n\nSo Dixon scored 10 for this song. That part checks out.\n\nNow the second part of the claim says \"which be in second place.\" So I need to see what the result was for that week. Week 8's result is listed as \"safe,\" not second place. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect here.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The song being in second place could refer to its placement in a competition or ranking among other dances that week. However, looking at the table, each row seems to represent individual weeks with their own results. There's no overall ranking provided beyond the \"result\" column, which for week 8 is \"safe.\" So it doesn't mention anything about second place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total score of 38 was tied for second place. But without more data on other dances that week, I can't confirm that. The table only shows one entry per week, so it's unclear how multiple dances are scored in a single week.\n\nSince the result is \"safe,\" not indicating second place, the claim about being in second place might be incorrect. Therefore, Dixon did give a 10 to that song, but it wasn't necessarily in second place as stated.\n\nSo putting it all together: Dixon did score 10 for samba / young heart run free, but the part about being in second place isn't supported by the table data provided. Thus, the claim is partially correct but also has an incorrect statement.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Dixon gave a score of 10 to \"samba / young hearts run free,\" which was in second place. The table confirms Dixon scored 10 for that song in week 8. However, the result for week 8 is listed as \"safe,\" not indicating second place. Therefore, the claim about being in second place is incorrect.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"dixon\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"goodman give the score 9 to samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key elements in the claim:\n1. The person mentioned is \"goodman.\"\n2. The action is giving a score of 9.\n3. The dance/song is \"samba / young heart run free.\"\n4. The result is being in second place.\n\nNow, I need to check if this information aligns with the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week and includes various columns like week number, dance/song name, scores for different people (horwood, goodman, etc.), total score, and the result. \n\nI'll start by locating the specific dance/song mentioned: \"samba / young heart run free.\" From the table, I see this appears in rows 8 and 12.\n\nIn row 8:\n- The dance is samba / young hearts run free.\n- Goodman's score is 9.\n- Total score is 38.\n- Result is \"safe.\"\n\nWait, but the claim mentions second place. In row 8, the result is safe, not second place. So this row might not be the one we're looking for.\n\nIn row 12:\n- Dance is samba / young hearts run free again.\n- Goodman's score is 9.\n- Total score is 38.\n- Result is \"second place.\"\n\nSo in week 12, Goodman gave a score of 9 to that dance, and the result was second place. This matches part of the claim.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"goodman give the score 9...\" which is correct here. However, I notice that in week 8, Goodman also scored 9 for this dance, but with a different total. So maybe both weeks are relevant? But the claim doesn't specify the week, so it's about whether Goodman gave 9 to that dance in any week where it resulted in second place.\n\nHowever, the table shows that in week 12, when samba / young hearts run free was danced, Goodman scored 9 and it placed second. So the information is present there.\n\nWait a moment, but the claim also mentions \"which be in second place.\" In week 8, the result wasn't second place, so only week 12 fits. Therefore, the relevant row is row 12.\n\nNext, I need to check if Goodman indeed gave a score of 9 in that row. Looking at column \"goodman\" in row 12, it's indeed 9. So this part is correct.\n\nThe claim also states that this dance was in second place, which aligns with the result in week 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data in the table.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other weeks where Goodman scored 9 for samba / young hearts run free and resulted in second place. Only week 12 fits both criteria: Goodman scored 9 and the result was second place.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are correctly supported by the data in row 12, columns \"goodman\" and \"result.\"\n\nHence, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells pointing to row 12 and column \"goodman.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"1 song receive a 10 from goodman and be rat 7 by tonioli.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Let's break it down.\n\nThe term \"song\" refers to entries in the \"dance / song\" column. So, we're looking for row number 1 because that's where \"1 song\" would be mentioned.\n\nLooking at row 1, the dance is a cha-cha-cha with the song \"ain't no mountain high enough.\" Now, I need to check if this specific song received a 10 from Goodman and a 7 from Tonioli. \n\nIn row 1, under the \"goodman\" column, I see the value is 8, not 10. So that's already a discrepancy. Even though there's a \"tonioli\" entry with 7 in the same row, since Goodman didn't give a 10, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. The table shows each dance per week, so row 1 is for week 1, and each column represents different dancers or evaluators. So, the \"goodman\" column for week 1 has 8, not 10. Therefore, Goodman didn't give a 10 to that song.\n\nAlso, looking at other weeks, like week 12, some have 10s from Goodman, but those are separate dances. The claim specifically mentions week 1 and the specific song.\n\nSo, in row 1, the goodman score is 8, not 10, which means the condition isn't met.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in week 1, a song received a 10 from Goodman and a 7 from Tonioli. Checking the table, in week 1 (\"row_index\":0), the dance \"cha - cha - cha / ain't no mountain high enough\" has a Goodman score of 8, not 10.

The claim says: \"goodman give 8 to all song with second place result , which receive a 7 from horwood and have a total score of 31.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\n\"Goodman gives 8\": So, in the table, there's a column for 'goodman' where each cell has a value. The claim is saying that whenever a song gets a second place result, goodman scores 8.\n\n\"Second place result\": Looking at the table, I see a 'result' column. The possible results mentioned are 'safe', 'second place', and sometimes 'n/a'. So, we need to look for rows where 'result' is 'second place'.\n\n\"Receive a 7 from horwood\": In the table, there's a column named 'horwood' with values like 7,8,9. The claim says that in these second-place songs, horwood gives 7.\n\nAnd \"have a total score of 31\": There's a 'total' column in the table.

So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let me check if any row has 'result' as second place and horwood is 7 with goodman 8 and total 31.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\nRow 0: week1 - n/a\nRow1: week2 - safe\nRow2: week3 - result is safe\nRow3: week4 - total35, not relevant\nRow4: week5 - no\nRow5: week6 - second place but horwood is9, so doesn't meet.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check row 12 (third entry? Or maybe it's row12 for weeks12 and beyond).\n\nLooking at the table, row indices are not given; the user just mentioned rows as week1 to week12. So each row corresponds to a week number.\n\nWait, actually, the way the table is presented, each <tr> represents a row, but with multiple cells, perhaps for different entries in that week. For example, week12 has three different dance results: samba, showdance, and paso doble. Each of these would be separate rows under week12.\n\nSo I need to check all the rows where result is 'second place', and see if in those rows, horwood is 7, goodman is8, and total is31.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nWeek1: n/a\nWeek2: safe\nWeek3: safe\nWeek4: 35\nWeek5:34\nWeek6:38\nWeek12, first entry: samba, total38\nWeek12, second entry: showdance, total34\nWeek12, third entry: paso doble, total35\n\nNone of these have result 'second place' except perhaps week12 entries. Wait, the user's table shows that for week12, the results are 'second place', 'second place', and 'second place'. So each of those three rows (for samba, showdance, paso doble) have result 'second place'.\n\nLooking at the 'horwood' column:\n\nFor samba:9\nShowdance:7\nPaso doble:8\n\nWait, for showdance in week12, horwood is7.\n\nIn that row, goodman's value? Let me check:\n\nIn the 'goodman' column for week12, showdance entry: it says 10. So goodman is10, not8.\n\nSimilarly, for samba in week12, goodman is9.\nFor paso doble, goodman is9 as well.\n\nSo none of these rows have goodman=8. Also, the 'total' for week12 entries are38 (samba),34(showdance),35(paso).\n\nNone of them have total31 except perhaps week2 and week3, but those have result safe, not second place.\n\nSo there's no row where result is second place, horwood is7, goodman is8, and total is31.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Goodman gives 8 to all songs with a second-place result, which receive 7 from Horwood and have a total score of 31. After checking each row in the table, none meet all these conditions simultaneously.

But in week 8, Goodman's score is 9, not 4. That doesn't match.\n\nNext, I check if there are any other weeks with \"samba / young heart run free.\" Week 12 also has this dance:\n- Week 12: Scores are:\n  - horwood:9\n  - goodman:9\n  - dixon:10\n  - tonioli:10\n  Total:38\n  Result: second place.\n\nAgain, Goodman's score is 9, not 4. So the claim's first part doesn't hold up because in both weeks where this dance appears, Goodman didn't give a 4.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the claim: \"which be in second place.\" From the table, in week 8 and week 12, the result is listed as \"second place\" for that dance. So the second part is correct.\n\nHowever, since the first part about Goodman's score being 4 is incorrect in both relevant weeks, the overall claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Goodman gave a score of 4 to \"samba / young heart run free,\" which was in second place. However, checking the table reveals that in both weeks where this dance appeared, Goodman scored 9, not 4. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"}\n  ]\n}",
