    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions an average being 0.1 for Deon Kruis. Looking at the table, I should locate Deon Kruis's row to find his batting statistics. \n\nIn the table, there are two rows labeled with names and a \"total batting\" row at the end. Scanning through the rows, I see \"deon kruis\" is one of them, specifically row index 9. In this row, the columns provided are: number of matches (12), number of balls faced (1), number of fours (1), total runs (3), highest score (3), average (n / a), and others like strike rate (75.00) and total fours (0). \n\nWait, I'm seeing that for Deon Kruis, the average is listed as \"n / a\", which probably stands for \"not applicable\" or \"not available.\" This suggests that his average isn't provided in the table. \n\nThe claim states the average should be 0.1. Since the table doesn't provide an average for Deon Kruis, there's no data to support this claim. The presence of \"n / a\" indicates missing information, which means we can't verify the claim as TRUE because there's no numerical value provided.\n\nTherefore, since his average isn't listed and is instead marked as not applicable, the claim doesn't hold true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not provide an average for Deon Kruis, as it shows \"n / a.\" This absence of data means the claim cannot be verified. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
