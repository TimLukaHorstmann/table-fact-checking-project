    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and HTML structure. The claim says, \"washington have a record of 41 - 36 and play at the verizon center 20173 people in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about their record, and the second part is about where they played and the attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. \n\nSo, to check the first part of the claim, I need to find the Washington team's record in the table. From the table data, the team 'washington' is involved in games 77, 78, and so on. Specifically, game 77 shows a record of 41 - 36. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, for the second part: they played at the Verizon Center with 20173 people attending. Looking through each row where the team is 'washington', in game 77, the location is 'verizon center' and attendance is 20173. So that checks out too.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the claim are supported by data from row 3 (index 3) for the Washington games. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"charlotte improve to 40 - 36 with a win of 97 - 92 in ot.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Charlotte improve to 40 - 36\" suggests that Charlotte's record after this game is 40 wins and 36 losses. The game result is a win against someone with a score of 97-92 in overtime.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists games from 75 to 82. Each row represents a different game with details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location, attendance, and record.\n\nI need to check if any row matches the claim. The key elements are:\n1. The game is against Charlotte.\n2. The result is a win (so 'w' in the score column).\n3. The score is 97-92 in overtime.\n4. The record after this game should be 40-36.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Game 75, April 1 vs Dallas, lost 96-98. Not Charlotte, so no.\nRow 1: Game 76, April 3 vs Charlotte, won 97-92 OT. This matches the game result. The record here is 40-36 after this win. So this seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should check if other rows might also fit or if there's conflicting info. But since the claim specifies \"improve to 40 - 36,\" it implies that before this game, their record was lower, and after, it's higher. Let me see:\n\nLooking at Row 1: Before Game 76, Charlotte's record would have been one less win. If they won this game, their record goes from maybe 39-36 to 40-36. That makes sense.\n\nOther games where Charlotte won are Row 6 (Game 82), but that's a different score and location. So the only relevant row is Row 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by Row 1, which has game number 76.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific game in Charlotte where they achieved a 40-36 record with a 97-92 win in OT. This corresponds exactly to Game 76 (Row 1) in the table. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"verizon center 20173 for the location and attendance when the record be 49 - 36%.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of the claim correspond to the data in the table. The claim mentions three things: the location (verizon center), the attendance (20173), and the record (49-36). So, I should look for these specific values in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details like date, team, score, etc. Each column seems to have specific headers, so I need to map the claim's components to the correct columns.\n\nStarting with \"verizon center.\" In the table, there's a 'location attendance' column. Scanning through the rows, I see that in row 3 (index 2), the location is listed as \"verizon center\" and the attendance is 20173. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking again, in row index 2, it says \"verizon center 20173.\" So the 'location attendance' column for that row would have \"verizon center 20173.\"\n\nNext, the claim mentions the record being 49-36%. The table has a 'record' column. I need to find if any row has a record of exactly 49-36. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 0: 39 - 36\nRow 1: 40 - 36\nRow 2: 41 - 36\nRow 3: 41 - 37\nRow 4: 41 - 38\nRow 5: 42 - 38\nRow 6: 42 - 39\nRow 7: 43 - 39\n\nI don't see a row with a record of 49-36. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again. The last few rows:\n\nRow 78 (index 7) is about game 82, which has a record of 43-39. There's no entry for 49-36. So the claim's assertion that the record is 49-36 doesn't match any row in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the record format. Could it be 49-36 as in wins and losses? The 'record' column seems to show the team's overall record after that game. For example, row 0 has a record of 39-36, which probably means 39 wins and 36 losses up to that point. But looking through all rows, none reach 49-36. The highest is 43-39 in row 7.\n\nSo the claim's part about the record being 49-36 is incorrect because there's no such entry in the table.\n\nPutting it together: the location and attendance do match one specific game (game 77), but the record doesn't exist in the table. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify each component:\n\n1. **Location**: \"verizon center\" is found in row 2 under 'location attendance'.\n2. **Attendance**: The number \"20173\" matches this row's attendance.\n3. **Record**: The table does not contain a game with a record of 49-36.\n\nSince the location and attendance match one specific game, but the record doesn't exist, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "when michael beade be the highest scorer , the score be w 97 - 92 (ot)",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"when michael beade be the highest scorer , the score be w 97 - 92 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that when Michael Beade is the highest scorer in a game, the team's score was a win with a specific score of 97-92 in overtime. So I need to check if there are any games in the table where Michael Beade scored the most points and the team won by that exact score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, high points, etc. I'll go through each row to find the relevant information.\n\nStarting from row 0: Game 75, Michael Beade isn't mentioned as a high scorer; Dwyane Wade is listed instead.\n\nRow 1: Game 76, Michael Beade isn't the highest scorer. It's Dwyane Wade again with 27 points.\n\nRow 2: Game 77, Michael Beade isn't here either. It's Dwyane Wade with 33 points.\n\nRow 3: Game 78, Michael Beade is not mentioned; it's Jamaal Magloire and others.\n\nRow 4: Game 79, Michael Beade is the highest scorer with 23 points, but the team lost (l 98-105 OT). So even though he scored the most, the score isn't a win as per the claim. \n\nRow 5: Game 80, Michael Beade isn't listed; Dwyane Wade has 55.\n\nRow 6: Game 81, Michael Beade is the highest scorer with 23 points, but again, the team lost (l 79-81 OT). So another instance where he's the top scorer but they lost, not a win.\n\nRow 7: Game 82, Michael Beade isn't mentioned; Dorell Wright and Mario Chalmers are listed as high rebounds and assists.\n\nSo in all the games, when Michael Beade is the highest scorer (in Game 79 and 81), his team didn't win with the score of W 97-92 OT. In both cases, they lost. Also, there's no game where the team won 97-92 OT when he was the top scorer.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any row has a score of w 97 - 92 (ot). Scanning through all the scores:\n\n- Game 75: l 96 - 98 (ot)\n- Game 76: w 97 - 92 (ot)\n- Game 77: w 118 - 104 (ot)\n- Game 78: l 87 - 93 (ot)\n- Game 79: l 98 - 105 (ot)\n- Game 80: w 122 - 105 (ot)\n- Game 81: l 79 - 81 (ot)\n- Game 82: w 102 - 96 (ot)\n\nOnly Game 76 has the exact score W 97-92 (OT). But in that game, the highest scorer was Dwyane Wade with 27 points. Michael Beade wasn't the highest scorer there. So even if the claim tried to associate the score with his scoring, it doesn't apply because he wasn't the top scorer in that game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no instance where Michael Beade was the highest scorer and the team won by 97-92 OT. In fact, when he was the highest scorer, they lost, and the only time they won 97-92 OT was without him being the top scorer.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high_points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
