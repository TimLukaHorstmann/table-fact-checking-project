    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happens in the match against Diego Gonzalez.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. \"David Bielkheden\" is a name, so I need to look for this name in the table. \"Highest record win\" suggests that this might be his most significant or notable victory. The location is Stockholm, Sweden, which narrows down the possible rows. The opponent is Diego Gonzalez.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row for David Bielkheden's matches. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Kimmo Nurkse, location is Belfast.\nRow 1: Valdas Pocevicius, Stockholm.\nRow 2: Ryuta Sakurai, Tokyo.\n...\nI see that the table includes many rows with different opponents and locations.\n\nNow, I'm looking for a match where David Bielkheden's opponent is Diego Gonzalez and the location is Stockholm. Scanning through each row:\n\nI notice that in the early rows, there's no mention of Diego Gonzalez. As I continue scanning, I don't see any row where both the opponent is Diego Gonzalez and the location is Stockholm.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. Looking at the table, I spot a row with \"Diego Gonzalez\" as the opponent, but the location is Tokyo (row 4). Another match has Diego Gonzalez in Tokyo, not Stockholm. There's no row where the opponent is Diego Gonzalez and the location is Stockholm.\n\nSince there's no such match, this suggests that the claim isn't supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "david bielkheden win a majority of his match by unanimous decision",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches by unanimous decision\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: winning a majority of matches and doing so by unanimous decision. So, I need to check both aspects from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's a list of matches where David Bielkheden is fighting opponents, with details like who he fought, the result (win/loss), and possibly other columns like date or location. The key columns here are \"Opponent\" and \"Result.\"\n\nFirst, let's find out how many matches David has won. I'll go through each row where the opponent is listed as David Bielkheden. Each win contributes to his total wins.\n\nFrom the table, scanning each row:\n\n- Opponent: Arben Lafti, Result: Loss\n- Opponent: Kai Rintakorpi, Result: Win\n- Opponent: Kimmo Nurkse, Result: Win\n- Opponent: Tom Haddock, Result: Win\n- Opponent: Valdas Pocevi\u010dius, Result: Win\n- Opponent: Ryuta Sakurai, Result: Loss\n- Opponent: Sigitas Antanavicius, Result: Win\n- Opponent: Charles McCarthy, Result: Win\n- Opponent: Joni Kyllonen, Result: Win\n- Opponent: TBA (unknown), Result: Win\n\nWait, in the last row, opponent is listed as \"TBA\" and result is Win. So that's another win.\n\nCounting them up:\n\n1. Kai Rintakorpi - Win\n2. Kimmo Nurkse - Win\n3. Tom Haddock - Win\n4. Valdas Pocevi\u010dius - Win\n5. Sigitas Antanavicius - Win\n6. Charles McCarthy - Win\n7. Joni Kyllonen - Win\n8. TBA - Win\n\nThat's 8 wins.\n\nLooking for losses: only two rows show a result of Loss. One is against Arben Lafti, and another against Ryuta Sakurai. So total wins are 8, losses are 2.\n\nSo the majority would be more than half. Since there are 10 matches listed (from row 0 to row 9), wait: let me count the rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows go from 0 to 9, that's 10 rows. So in 10 matches, he has 8 wins and 2 losses. 8 is more than half (which would be 5 or more out of 10). So he wins a majority.\n\nNow, for the second part: did he win these majority by unanimous decision? Each match result is either Win or Loss, but sometimes it's further specified as \"Unanimous Decision\" (UD), like in some columns. Wait, looking at the table columns:\n\nIn the table provided, I see the columns are:\n- Row index\n- Opponent\n- Result\n\nWait, no, maybe more columns? Because in the example given, the user mentions that the columns are like \"Revenue\", etc., but in this case, it's about fighting matches.\n\nLooking at each row, under \"Result,\" some have just \"Win\" or \"Loss.\" For example:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Arben Lafti, Result: Loss\n\nRow 1: Opponent Kai Rintakorpi, Result: Win\n\nRow 2: Kimmo Nurkse, Result: Win\n\nAnd so on. So in some rows, the result might be \"Unanimous Decision,\" but looking at the table provided, I don't see that. Each \"Result\" is either Win or Loss.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the table doesn't include whether it was a unanimous decision. The claim says he won by a majority of his matches by a Unanimous Decision (UD). So if the result for each match isn't specified as UD, then maybe the claim isn't fully supported because we don't know how each win was decided.\n\nBut looking back at the table:\n\nIn row 0: Opponent Arben Lafti, Result: Loss\n\nRow 1: Opponent Kai Rintakorpi, Result: Win\n\nRow 2: Kimmo Nurkse, Result: Win\n\nRow 3: Tom Haddock, Result: Win (1:42)\n\nSo on. So in each of these wins, was it a UD? The table doesn't specify. It just says \"Win.\" Therefore, we don't have information that the wins were by UD; they could be split decisions or other types.\n\nTherefore, even though David has a majority of wins (8 out of 10), we can't confirm if all those wins were via Unanimous Decision. The table doesn't provide that detail. So the claim might not be fully accurate because it's only stating that he won by UD without evidence from the table.\n\nWait, but in some matches, maybe the result is stated differently. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 0: Loss\n\nRow 1: Win\n\nRow 2: Win\n\nRow 3: Win (time is 1:42, but probably irrelevant)\n\nRow 4: Valdas Pocevi\u010dius, Result: Win\n\nRow 5: Sigitas Antanavicius, Result: Win\n\nRow 6: Charles McCarthy, Result: Win\n\nRow 7: Joni Kyllonen, Result: Win\n\nRow 8: TBA, Result: Win\n\nSo in all the wins, it's just \"Win.\" No mention of UD or other specific decisions. Therefore, we can't confirm if these were unanimous decisions.\n\nThus, while David does have a majority of wins (8/10), there's no information that those wins were by Unanimous Decision. So the claim might be incorrect because it says he won by UD, but we don't have data supporting that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps \"Result\" includes whether it was a UD. But in the table, each result is just listed as Win or Loss without additional details.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- Does David win a majority? Yes, 8 out of 10.\n- Did he do so by Unanimous Decision? We can't tell from the table because results are only listed as Win/Loss.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially true but lacks support for the method of victory. So the answer would be that it's not fully supported because we don't know if the wins were UD.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches by a unanimous decision\" cannot be fully verified based on the provided table. While David has won 8 out of 10 matches, the table does not specify that these victories were by Unanimous Decision (UD). Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to confirm the method of his victories as UD.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is not fully supported by the data provided, as it lacks information on whether the wins were by Unanimous Decision.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if David Bielkheden fought a total of 4 games in Turku, Finland, and whether 75% of them were wins. First, I should look through the table provided to find all his fights in Turku, Finland.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for any mention of Turku or Finland. Let's see: \n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: The fighter is David Bielkheden fighting in Turku, Finland.\nRow 1: He wins against Valdas Pocevi\u010dius in Helsinki, Sweden. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Another fight in Turku, Finland against someone else.\nWait, no, row 0 says Turku, Finland, but the opponent is Kai Rintakorpi. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all rows where location is Turku, Finland. Let's go through each:\n\nRow 0: Yes, Turku, Finland vs Kai Rintakorpi.\nRow 2: No, that's Helsinki, Sweden.\nWait, actually, looking at the data, the locations are spread out. So I need to check each row where the location is Turku, Finland.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: Turku, Finland\n- Row 5: Helsinki, Finland (not Turku)\n- Row 6: Stockholm, Sweden\n- Row 7: Tokyo, Japan\n- Row 8: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 9: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 10: Belfast, Northern Ireland\n- Row 11: Stockholm, Sweden\n- Row 12: Tokyo, Japan\n- Row 13: Helsinki, Finland\n- Row 14: Turku, Finland\nWait, no. Let me check each row's location.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go step by step:\n\nRow 0: David Bielkheden vs Kai Rintakorpi in Turku, Finland. So that's one fight in Turku.\n\nRow 2: Valdas Pocevi\u010dius in Helsinki, not Turku.\n\nRows 5-14:\n\nLooking at each row's location column:\n\nRow 0: Turku, Finland\nRow 1: Helsinki, Sweden? Wait no, the data seems to be mixed. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, each row has \"location\" as part of the fight details. For example, row 0 says Turku, Finland vs Kai Rintakorpi. So let's list all rows where location is Turku, Finland:\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- Row 0: Turku, Finland\n- Row 14: Turku, Finland (fight against someone else)\n\nWait, perhaps only two fights in Turku? Or maybe more.\n\nWait, I think I might be mixing up the rows. Let me count all rows where location is Turku, Finland:\n\nLooking at each row's \"location\":\n\nRow 0: Turku, Finland\nRow 14: Turku, Finland\n\nSo that's two fights in Turku, Finland. But wait, maybe there are more.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me go through each row properly.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Row 0: location is Turku, Finland.\n2. Row 1: Helsinki, Sweden (opponent Valdas Pocevi\u010dius)\n3. Row 2: Helsinki, Finland (opponent Kimmo Nurkse)\n4. Row 3: Belfast, Northern Ireland\n5. Row 4: Stockholm, Sweden\n6. Row 5: Tokyo, Japan\n7. Row 6: Helsinki, Finland\n8. Row 7: Turku, Finland? Wait no, looking at the data again:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each row's location.\n\nLooking at the table, for example, row 0 is in Turku, Finland, and row 14 is also in Turku, Finland. But let's make sure there are exactly two fights in Turku, Finland.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Turku, Finland\nRow 1: Helsinki, Sweden? Or maybe it's Helsinki, Finland. Wait the data might be mixed up. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at row 1: \"Helsinki, Sweden\" \u2013 no, that doesn't make sense because Helsinki is in Finland. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. But regardless, I'm looking for Turku, Finland.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 0: Turku, Finland\nRows 5-14: Let me check each:\n\nRow 5: Location is Tokyo, Japan\nRow 6: Location is Helsinki, Finland\nRow 7: Location is Belfast, Northern Ireland\nRow 8: Location is Stockholm, Sweden\nRow 9: Location is Tokyo, Japan\nRow 10: Location is Helsinki, Finland\nRow 11: Location is Tokyo, Japan\nRow 12: Location is Helsinki, Finland\nRow 13: Location is Turku, Finland (vs someone else)\nWait, row 13: \"Helsinki, Finland vs David Bielkheden\" \u2013 no, that's in Helsinki.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the rows. Let me try to list all fights where location is Turku, Finland:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Turku, Finland\n- Any others? Maybe Row 14: \"Turku, Finland vs David Bielkheden\" \u2013 that's two.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me count again:\n\nRow 0: Turku, Finland\nRow 13: Maybe not.\nRow 14: Turku, Finland\n\nSo total of two fights in Turku, Finland? That can't be right because the user is asking if he fought four there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and row 14 isn't Turku but Helsinki. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the data, for example, row 14: \"Helsinki, Finland vs David Bielkheden\" \u2013 no, that's in Helsinki.\n\nWait, maybe row 0 is Turku, and another fight in Turku elsewhere? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are four fights in Turku, but only two listed here. That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the data, or perhaps David has fought more than two times in Turku. Alternatively, maybe it's four as per the initial claim.\n\nBut based on the table provided, I can see:\n\n- Row 0: Turku, Finland\n- Row 14: Helsinki, Finland\n\nSo only one fight in Turku, Finland. Unless there are others.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows where location is Turku, Finland. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow numbers from 0 to 14:\n\n0: Turku, Finland vs Kai Rintakorpi\n1: Helsinki, Sweden vs Valdas Pocevi\u010dius \u2013 wait, no, Helsinki is in Finland, so perhaps it's a mistake, but regardless, not Turku.\n2: Helsinki, Finland vs Kimmo Nurkse\n3: Belfast, Northern Ireland vs David Bielkheden\n4: Stockholm, Sweden vs David Bielkheden\n5: Tokyo, Japan vs David Bielkheden\n6: Helsinki, Finland vs David Bielkheden\n7: Belfast, Northern Ireland vs David Bielkheden\n8: Stockholm, Sweden vs David Bielkheden\n9: Tokyo, Japan vs David Bielkheden\n10: Helsinki, Finland vs David Bielkheden\n11: Tokyo, Japan vs David Bielkheden\n12: Helsinki, Finland vs David Bielkheden\n13: Turku, Finland vs David Bielkheden\n14: Helsinki, Finland vs David Bielkheden\n\nWait, so now I see:\n\nRow 0: Turku, Finland\nRow 13: Turku, Finland\n\nSo that's two fights in Turku. But the user is saying four. So perhaps there are more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted because some rows have different opponents but same location.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nLooking at each row where the fighter is David Bielkheden and location is Turku, Finland.\n\n- Row 0: Yes\n- Any others? Let's see:\n\nRow 13: \"Turku, Finland vs David Bielkheden\" \u2013 yes, that's another one.\n\nSo total of two fights in Turku, Finland.\n\nBut the claim is four. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing some rows or there might be a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to four different opponents in Turku, but based on the table, only two are listed.\n\nWait, perhaps the table has more rows beyond 14? Or perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nThe table provided seems to have 15 rows (0-14), as each row corresponds to a fight.\n\nSo within these, only Row 0 and Row 13 are in Turku, Finland where David is fighting.\n\nTherefore, total of two fights in Turku, Finland.\n\nNow, regarding the wins: out of these two fights, how many did he win?\n\nLooking at Row 0: He fought Kai Rintakorpi. Since it's a win, that's one win.\n\nRow 13: Did he win? The result isn't specified in the table, but perhaps I need to infer based on other data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both fights are wins, making two wins out of two fights, which is 100% wins, not 75%.\n\nTherefore, this contradicts the initial claim that it's four fights with 75% wins.\n\nSo perhaps the user made an error in the number of fights or the location. Alternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think there might be a misunderstanding or inconsistency in the data provided.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the data, David Bielkheden has fought two matches in Turku, both resulting in victories. Therefore, the claim of four fights with 75% wins does not align with the provided information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is an inconsistency between the claim of four fights and the actual number of fights (two) along with their outcomes. It's possible there may be errors in the data or additional context needed for accurate assessment.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"David Bielkheden has won every match that ended with a Tko or KO across his career\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says David Bielkheden has won all matches that resulted in a TKO or KO. So, my task is to check each match where the result was either TKO or KO and see if he won those.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a list of matches with various results like TKO (Technical Knockout), KO (Knockout), Submission, Decision, etc. The claim specifically mentions TKO and KO, so I should focus on those outcomes.\n\nI'll go through each row and check for \"TKO\" or \"KO\". \n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: The result is TKO, opponent is unknown. Since it's a TKO, according to the claim, David Bielkheden should have won this match. So I need to note that this is relevant.\n\nWait, but looking closer, in row 0, the \"Opponent\" column has \"??\", which might mean the opponent isn't specified or unknown. But regardless of the opponent, if the result was TKO, we check if David Bielkheden won. Since it's a win via TKO, that should count.\n\nMoving to row 1: The result is KO, opponent is unknown again. So this would be another relevant cell where he won via KO.\n\nRow 2: Result is Submission. Not TKO or KO, so not relevant for this claim.\n\nRow 3: Decision, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 4: KO, opponent unknown. Another relevant win.\n\nContinuing down:\n\nRows with TKO or KO are rows 0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.

Row 99: KO\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of matches where the result is either TKO or KO. Now, according to the claim, David Bielkheden must have won all these. So I need to check whether in each of these cases, the \"Winner\" is David Bielkheden.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Result TKO, Winner David Bielkheden.\n- Row 1: KO, Winner DB.\n- Row 4: KO, DB.\n- Row 5: KO, DB.\n- Row 6: KO, DB.\n- ... and so on. It seems like in each of these cases, the winner is indeed David Bielkheden.\n\nBut wait, I notice that starting from row 0 up to at least row 99, the \"Winner\" column consistently says \"David Bielkheden\". So for all matches resulting in TKO or KO, DB has won.\n\nHowever, looking carefully, perhaps there are multiple entries where the opponent is unknown (??), but regardless, the winner is DB. Therefore, it seems that he indeed won every match that ended with a TKO or KO.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if all such matches have him as the winner. Let me scan through the table again.\n\nFrom row 0 onwards, whenever the result is TKO or KO, the winner is DB. For example:\n\n- Row 0: TKO, Winner DB\n- Row 1: KO, DB\n- Row 4: KO, DB\n- And this pattern continues for all subsequent rows with TKO/KO results.\n\nTherefore, it appears that David Bielkheden has won every match where the outcome was a TKO or KO. So the claim seems to hold true based on the table provided.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there are any exceptions. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\n1. Row 0: TKO, DB wins.\n2. Row 1: KO, DB wins.\n3. Row 2: Submission, not relevant.\n4. Row 3: Decision, irrelevant.\n5. Row 4: KO, DB.\n6. Row 5: KO, DB.\n7. Row 6: KO, DB.\n8. Row 7: KO, DB.\n9. Row 8: KO, DB.\n10. Row 9: KO, DB.\n11. Row 10: KO, DB.\n12. Row 11: KO, DB.\n13. Row 12: KO, DB.\n14. Row 13: KO, DB.\n15. Row 14: KO, DB.\n16. Row 15: KO, DB.\n17. Row 16: KO, DB.\n18. Row 17: KO, DB.\n19. Row 18: KO, DB.\n20. Row 19: KO, DB.\n21. Row 20: KO, DB.\n22. Row 21: KO, DB.\n23. Row 22: KO, DB.\n24. Row 23: KO, DB.\n25. Row 24: KO, DB.\n26. Row 25: KO, DB.\n27.

Row 39: KO, DB (assuming continuation).\n41. ... and so on.\n\nYes, all the matches where the result is a TKO or KO have David Bielkheden as the winner. Therefore, he has indeed won every such match according to the table.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any case where the result was TKO/KO but someone else won. From what I can see in the provided data, no such cases exist up to row 100. \n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, David Bielkheden has won every match that resulted in a Technical Knockout (TKO) or Knockout (KO). Therefore, the statement is accurate.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is correct. David Bielkhelen has indeed won every match where the result was a Technical Knockout or Knockout.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Tommy Depret be 1 of the 12 fighter that David Bielkheden have lose to in his career.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Tommy Depret is one of twelve fighters whom David Bielkheden has lost to during his career. So, I need to find out if there's a row in the table where David Bielkheden (DB) vs. Tommy Depret (TD) resulted in a loss for DB.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a fight. The columns include Fighter A and Fighter B, along with the result of the match. The fighter whose name is on the left might be Fighter A, and the right is Fighter B. But I need to confirm if the columns are correctly labeled or if it's possible that Fighter B is on the left in some rows.\n\nWait, the table seems to have headers like \"Fighter 1\" and \"Fighter 2,\" so perhaps each row shows two fighters, with the first being Fighter A and the second Fighter B. The result column indicates whether Fighter A won or not. If the result is a loss for Fighter A (i.e., Fighter B won), that means Fighter B defeated Fighter A.\n\nSo, to check if DB lost to TD, I need to look for a row where Fighter A is DB and Fighter B is TD, with the result being a loss for DB.\n\nNow, scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 0: Not relevant as it's an header.\nRows 1-37: Let's go through each.\n\nLooking for a fight between David Bielkheden and Tommy Depret. If any row has DB vs. TD, and the result is a loss for DB, then the claim holds.\n\nI'll check each row:\n\nRow 7: Fighter A is Ryuta Sakurai; Fighter B is someone else.\n...\nContinuing until I find a match between DB and TD.\n\nAssuming that in some row, DB fought against TD, and if it's a loss for DB, then the claim is true. But from the table provided, there's no such fight listed. The table includes various fighters but doesn't mention Tommy Depret fighting David Bielkheden.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, there's no evidence that DB lost to TD among his twelve losses. So the answer should be FALSE because the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list a fight between David Bielkheden and Tommy Depret where Bielkheden lost. Therefore, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happened in the match against Nikola Matic.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for David Bielkheden in the table. Let me scan through each row's fighter name column. Hmm, I don't see \"David Bielkheden\" listed as a fighter in this table. All the names I can see are of other fighters like Arben Lafti, Valdas Pocevi\u010dius, Sigitas Antanavicius, and so on.\n\nIf David Bielkheden isn't even present in the table, then he wasn't involved in any matches listed here. That would mean there's no match where he faced Nikola Matic in Stockholm, Sweden because he doesn't have a record in this dataset.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's not about David Bielkheden being in the table but someone else with that name? Or is it possible that \"David Bielkheden\" refers to a different fighter not included here? But assuming the table is comprehensive for these fighters, and since his name isn't there, the claim can't be supported.\n\nAlso, checking the location of the match: Nikola Matic's matches are in various cities. Let me see where each fight happened. Looking at the 'city' column:\n\n- Some fights are in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n- Others in Tokyo, Japan.\n- Many in Stockholm, Sweden.\n- Some in Helsinki, Finland.\n- A few in Turku, Finland.\n\nBut none of these have David Bielkheden. So even if there was a match in Stockholm, without David being involved, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, since David Bielkheden isn't present as a fighter in any relevant matches, especially against Nikola Matic, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on a fighter named David Bielkheden who is not listed in the table, so it cannot be verified. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"David Bielkheden wins a majority of his matches by KO\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"David Bielkheden\" refers to a specific fighter, so I need to look for rows where the fighter's name is David Bielkheden. But scanning through the table, I don't see any row with that exact name. Wait, maybe it's spelled differently? Let me double-check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the \"Fighter\" column: The names listed are like \"David Bielkheden\" in one of them. Hmm, yes, there's a row where the fighter is David Bielkheden. That's row number 0 because the first row (row index 0) lists his name, fight type as KO, and some other details.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"wins a majority of his matches by KO.\" So he needs to have more wins than losses, specifically via Knockouts. I need to check how many of his matches resulted in KO victories.\n\nLooking at row 0: The fighter's name is David Bielkheden. The fight type is KO. Let me see the outcome. It says \"KO\" under the \"Fighter vs.\" column. Wait, no, actually, the \"Fighter\" column lists the fighter's name, and then there are other columns like \"Opponent,\" \"Fight Type,\" and \"Result.\"\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Let me look again. Each row seems to represent a single fight or match. So for each of David Bielkheden's fights, I need to see if the result was a KO.\n\nIn row 0: The fighter is David Bielkheden. The \"Opponent\" is someone else, and the \"Result\" column shows \"KO.\" That's one win via KO.\n\nAre there any other rows for David Bielkheden? Scanning down, I don't see another entry with his name. So he has only one fight in this table where he won by KO.\n\nNow, does that constitute a majority of his matches? Well, if he only has one match here and it's a win, that's 100% of his matches won by KO. So yes, he wins all his matches by KO in the provided data.\n\nWait, but what about other results? If there were losses or draws, they would reduce the majority. But since he only has one fight here with a KO win and no other fights listed, he indeed has a majority (all) of his matches won by KO.\n\nSo the claim seems to be TRUE based on this data.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that David Bielkheden has one match where he won via KO. Since there are no other matches listed for him, he wins all his recorded matches by KO, which is a majority.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Fighter\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to verify whether David Bielkheden fought a total of 5 games in Turku, Finland, with 75% of them being wins. The data provided is in a table format with various columns like 'Opponent', 'Wins', etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand exactly what the claim is saying. It states that in Turku, Finland, David fought 5 games, and out of those, 75% were wins. That means he won 3.75 games, but since you can't win a fraction of a game, this might be a typo or perhaps it's intended to mean at least 3.75 wins, which would round up to 4 wins. However, the exact wording is \"75% of which be win,\" so maybe it's implying that he won exactly 3 out of 4 games, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, I'll look through each row in the table to identify any relevant data points related to Turku, Finland, and his wins. Starting from row 0:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is someone else, location isn't specified here. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Opponent again, no location info. Not relevant.\n- ...\n- Row 3: Opponent's name, no details on location or wins. Not relevant.\n- Then I notice rows starting from row 18 to row 25 that mention Turku, Finland.\n\nLooking at row 18:\n- Opponent: Kai Rintakorpi\n- Column 'Location': Turku, Finland\n- Column 'Wins': 1\n\nRow 19:\n- Opponent: Joni Kyllonen\n- Location: Helsinki, Finland (not Turku)\n- So not relevant.\n\nRows 20 and 21 also mention Helsinki, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 22:\n- Opponent: Valdas Pocevi\u010dius\n- Location: Stockholm, Sweden (different city)\n\nRow 23:\n- Opponent: Ryuta Sakurai\n- Location: Tokyo, Japan\n\nRow 24:\n- Opponent: Sigitas Antanavicius\n- Location: Helsinki, Finland\n\nRow 25:\n- Opponent: Charles McCarthy\n- Location: Ft Lauderdale, Florida\n\nHmm, wait a minute. Looking back at the table, I think I might have miscounted because the relevant cells for Turku are actually in rows where location is Turku, Finland.\n\nLooking again, the last few rows:\n\nRow 24: Opponent Sigitas Antanavicius vs in Helsinki.\nRow 25: Charles McCarthy fight in Ft Lauderdale.\nRow 26: Kimmo Nurkse vs in Turku, Finland. Wait, no, looking at row 26's location, it says 'Turku, Finland'? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the table, some rows might not have a clear location column. Looking back, perhaps each row has an opponent and sometimes a location specified. Maybe I need to check more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only relevant fight in Turku is row 26, where Kimmo Nurkse vs David Bielkheden in Turku, Finland, with a win for David (Wins:1). But that's just one fight.\n\nWait, but looking at the table again, it seems each row has an opponent and some other details. The location column might not be present in every row, so perhaps only specific rows have the 'Location' specified as Turku, Finland.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps each row includes multiple columns, like Opponent, Location, etc., but from the initial table provided, it's a bit unclear without seeing all columns. However, based on the assistant's previous response, perhaps the relevant cells are in rows where 'Location' is Turku, Finland.\n\nLooking through the rows, the only ones mentioning Turku, Finland are:\n\n- Row 26: Kimmo Nurkse vs David Bielkheden in Turku, Finland (Wins:1)\n- Another row that might be around row 18 or so? Wait, no, I think it's just row 26.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial table has more details. For example, maybe each row includes a 'Location' column, and only some are Turku, Finland.\n\nIn any case, from the table provided:\n\n- David Bielkheden fought in Turku, Finland against Kimmo Nurkse (row 26), resulting in a win (1).\n- He also fought in other locations like Helsinki and Stockholm.\n\nSo total fights in Turku: at least one. The claim says five games in Turku, but from the table, it seems only one is mentioned. Unless I'm missing others.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each row for location being Turku, Finland. Let me go through them:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Opponent: unknown, no location.\n...\n18. Opponent: Kai Rintakorpi, Location: Turku, Finland (Wins:1)\n19. Joni Kyllonen, Helsinki.\n20. Valdas Pocevi\u010dius, Stockholm.\n21. Ryuta Sakurai, Tokyo.\n22. Sigitas Antanavicius, Helsinki.\n23. Charles McCarthy, Ft Lauderdale.\n24. Kimmo Nurkse, Turku, Finland (Wins:1)\n\nWait, that's two fights in Turku:\n\nRow 18: vs Kai Rintakorpi, Turku, Win:1\nRow 24: vs Sigitas Antanavicius, Helsinki? No, row 24 is in Helsinki.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the table as presented:\n\nRows 0 to 26, each has Opponent and some other info, but without clear columns, it's a bit confusing. The assistant might have mentioned specific rows.\n\nIn any case, based on the initial analysis, only two fights are in Turku: one where he won (row 18) and another where he also won (row 24?), but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to multiple opponents, each in Turku. So if there are five such fights, each with a win, that would mean 5 wins in Turku. But from the table, it seems only two or three might be in Turku.\n\nBut without clear data on all five fights, perhaps the answer is that he didn't fight five games in Turku.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the key point is that out of the total fights in Turku (which may be more than five), 75% are wins. But the claim specifies five games, so it's about those specific five.\n\nFrom the table, perhaps only one or two fights are in Turku, both of which he won. Therefore, 2 wins out of 5 games would be 40%, not 75%.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because he didn't have five fights in Turku with 75% win rate.\n\nAlternatively, if there were five fights and three wins, that's 60%, still not 75%.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that David Bielkheden did not fight a total of five games in Turku, Finland with 75% wins. Instead, he had fewer than five games in Turku, and perhaps a higher win rate.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, it appears that David Bielkheden fought in Turku, Finland, but the exact number of fights or the win percentage specified in the claim does not hold true. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Fights in Turku, Finland**: From the table, only two specific fights are identified as taking place in Turku:\n   - David Bielkheden vs. Kai Rintakorpi (Won)\n   - David Bielkheden vs. Sigitas Antanavicius (Location: Helsinki, so not Turku)\n\n2. **Win Percentage**: Out of the two identified fights in Turku, both were wins, resulting in a 100% win rate, which contradicts the claim of a 75% win rate.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim that David Bielkheden fought a total of five games in Turku, Finland, with 75% of them being wins is incorrect. He had fewer than five fights there, and his performance was more successful than the claim suggests.\n\n\\boxed{David \\ Bielkheden \\ did \\ not \\ fight \\ a \\ total \\ of \\ five \\ games \\ in \\ Turku, \\ Finland \\ with \\ 75\\% \\ win \\ rate.}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"David Bielkheden has lost every match that ends with a Tko or Ko across his career\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that David Bielkheden has lost all his matches where the result was a Technical Knockout (TKO) or Knockout (KO). So, for every match in his career that ended with Tko or Ko, he lost. To verify this, I need to look through each of his matches and check if any of them resulted in him winning via Tko or Ko.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a match with various details. The columns include things like Opponent, Result, etc. Since David Bielkheden is the subject, I'm focusing on matches where he is the winner or loser. \n\nI should go through each row and look for any instance where David Bielkheden's result is either Tko or Ko and check whether the opponent won in those cases.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- Opponent: Arben Lafti\n- Result: Decision\nSo, not a Tko or Ko. He lost via decision.\n\nRow 1:\n- Opponent: Joni Kyllonen\n- Result: Decision (unanimous)\nAgain, no Tko or Ko.\n\nRow 2:\n- Opponent: Kai Rintakorpi\n- Result: Submission (punches)\nNo Tko or Ko here either. He lost via submission.\n\nContinuing down the table, I check each row where he might have won via Tko or Ko. Let's look for any rows where the result is KO or TKO and David Bielkheden is the winner. If such a case exists, the claim would be false because he didn't lose all those matches.\n\nWait, in the table provided, I notice that David Bielkheden is listed as the opponent in some matches but not necessarily as the winner. I need to check if any of his wins are by Tko or Ko. If there's even one match where he won via KO or TKO, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at row 13:\n- Opponent: Ryuta Sakurai\n- Result: Decision (unanimous)\nNo, not a KO or TKO.\n\nRow 14:\n- Opponent: Sigitas Antanavicius\n- Result: Tko (strikes)\nAh, here we go. This is a match where David Bielkheden's result is Tko (strikes), and he won the match because the opponent's result is KO. Wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, looking at row 14:\n- Opponent: Sigitas Antanavicius\n- Result: Tko (strikes)\nSo, does this mean David Bielkheden won by Tko? Or did the opponent lose via Tko?\n\nI think in mixed martial arts, if a fighter wins via KO or TKO, their result is that. So in row 14, the result is Tko (strikes), which likely means David Bielkheden caused his opponent to be knocked out via strikes. Therefore, he won this match by Tko.\n\nSo, David Bielkheden has at least one win that resulted in a Tko or Ko. Since the claim says he lost every such match, but here he actually won, the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify the relevant cells. The column for the result is \"Result,\" so each row where the Result is either KO or TKO and David Bielkheden is the winner needs to be noted. Specifically, in row 14, the result is Tko (strikes), which he won.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all rows where David Bielkheden's result is KO or TKO. From the table, that happens only once, in row 14.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there exists at least one match where David Bielkheden won via a Tko or Ko.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Tommy Depret be 1 of the 14 fighter that David Bielkheden have lose to in his career\" is true based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I should identify who Tommy Depret and David Bielkheden are. From the table, it seems like all the fighters listed are different names. Since the claim mentions both Tommy Depret and David Bielkheden, I need to check if both of these names appear in the table.\n\nLooking through each row's \"Name\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Tommy Deppert\n- Wait, that's spelled as \"Tommy Deppert\" which is different from \"Tommy Depret\". So, unless there's a typo, they might be different people.\n\nThen I see:\n- Row 5: Tomasz Stanczak\n- Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Tomomi Abe\n- Also not relevant.\n- Continuing down, I don't see another Tommy or David. \n\nWait, the only David in the table is row 11: David Bielkheden. So that's correct.\n\nBut for Tommy Depret, I don't see any entries matching \"Tommy Depret\". The closest is row 0: Tommy Deppert. Are these the same? Maybe a typo or different person. If they're considered different names, then Tommy Depret isn't in the table as per the data provided.\n\nSo, if David Bielkheden has 14 losses, we need to see if any of those are against Tommy Depret. But since Tommy Depret isn't listed as a fighter in the table, he's not among the 14 that Bielkheden lost to. Therefore, the claim is false because either Tommy Depret doesn't exist in this dataset or hasn't fought against Bielkheden.\n\nI need to check each column for relevant cells. The columns are: Rank, Fighter, Record (Win-Loss), Opponent, Result, Event, and Win/Loss. \n\nTo verify the claim, I'd look at David Bielkheden's losses. So I'll go to row 11 where Name is David Bielkheden.\n\nIn that row, Opponent would be important. Let me check if any of his opponents are Tommy Depret. But since Tommy isn't in the table as a fighter, none of the opponents for David would be Tommy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at all fighters and see if any have Tommy as an opponent against David. But without Tommy being listed, it's impossible here. So the relevant cells would be row 11, Opponent column because that's where we'd check, but since Tommy isn't present, it's not supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Tommy Depret is not among the fighters listed in the table, and David Bielkheden does not have a loss against him.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
