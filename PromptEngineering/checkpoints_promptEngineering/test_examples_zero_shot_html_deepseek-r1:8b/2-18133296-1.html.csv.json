    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"government 31 have the kadima party\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It refers to \"government 31\" and states that they are associated with the Kadima party. So, I need to find out which row in the table corresponds to government number 31 and check their party affiliation.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a government led by a minister. The columns include 'minister', 'party', etc. Specifically, the column I'm interested in is \"party\" because that's where the political party of each government is listed.\n\nNow, to find government 31, I need to look through the table's 'minister' or perhaps another column for a count that reaches 31. Wait, looking closely, the table might not have a separate 'government number' column, so perhaps the row index corresponds to the government number? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- The first row is for Government 1 (row index 0) with minister Tzipi Livni and party Kadima.\n- Then it goes up to Government 32 (row index 31), which is Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud.\n- Wait, no. Let me recount: starting from row 0 as Government 1, each subsequent row increments the government number. So, row 0 = Government 1, row 1 = Government 2, and so on.\n\nSo, to find Government 31, that would be row index 30 because 1 + 30 = 31? Wait, no. Because if row 0 is Government 1, then row n corresponds to Government n+1. So, Government 31 would be at row index 30, since 30 + 1 = 31.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n- Row 0: Government 1\n- Row 1: Government 2\n- ...\n- Row n: Government n+1\n\nSo, Government 31 is indeed in row 30. Now, looking at row 30, the minister is Tzipi Livni with the party Kadima.\n\nTherefore, Government 31 (row 30) does have the Kadima party as their affiliation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"government 31 start before 18 january 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: minister, party, governments, term start, and term end. The claim mentions \"government 31\" starting before a specific date.\n\nI should locate rows where the government number is 31. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 9 (index 8): Simon Peres, Labor Party, 25\n- Row 10: Ariel Sharon, Likud, 29\n- Row 11: Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud, 29\n- Row 12: Silvan Shalom, Likud, 30\n- Row 13: Tzipi Livni, Kadima, 31 \u2192 This is government 31.\n\nNext, I need to check the term start date for government 31. From row 13, the term start is \"18 January 2006\". The claim says that this government started before that same date. However, according to the table, government 31 started on 18 January 2006, not before it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me double-check: the claim is about government 31 starting before 18 January 2006. Government 31's term start is exactly on that date. So it didn't start before, but on the same day.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because government 31 started on 18 January 2006, not before.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because government 31 starts on 18 January 2006, not before it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"term start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
