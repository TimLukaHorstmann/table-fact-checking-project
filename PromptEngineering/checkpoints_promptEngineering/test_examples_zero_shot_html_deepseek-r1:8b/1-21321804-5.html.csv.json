That matches exactly. \n\nNext, checking if he attended Boston College.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that McGill should be the team picked at position 41. So, I need to check if there's a row where \"college\" is McGill and the pick number is 41.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has columns: pick, cfl team, player, position, college. The rows are numbered from 0 to 7 (since it starts at 36 and goes up by 6 each time). I need to focus on the \"college\" column to see which teams attended McGill.\n\nNow, going through each row:\n\nRow 0: pick=36, cfl team=ottawa renegades, player=marc parenteau, position=og, college=boston college. So, not McGill.\n\nRow 1: pick=37, cfl team=calgary stampeders, player=blake machan, position=sb, college=calgary. Not McGill.\n\nRow 2: pick=38, cfl team=hamilton tiger - cats, player=david kasouf, position=wr, college=holy cross. Nope.\n\nRow 3: pick=39, cfl team=toronto argonauts, player=derik fury, position=lb, college=mount allison. Not McGill.\n\nRow 4: pick=40, cfl team=saskatchewan roughriders, player=mike thomas, position=wr, college=regina. Still not.\n\nRow 5: pick=41, cfl team=bc lions, player=nicholas hoffman, position=fb, college=mcgill. Oh, here we go! This row has pick number 41 and the college is McGill.\n\nSo, that's exactly what the claim says. The team picked at 41 is McGill. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells in the table for verification. I need to check which columns are important here. The \"pick\" column is 41, and the \"college\" is McGill. So the relevant cells would be row 5 (since it's pick 41) and the college column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where McGill is listed as the college for pick number 41.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions both correctly. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Derik Fury is in row 3 (since it's zero-indexed, but wait: the first row is index 0, so row 3 would be the fourth entry). Looking at the table:\n\nRow 3 (4th row) has:\n- pick:39\n- cfl team: Toronto Argonauts\n- player: Derik Fury\n- position: lb\n- college: Mount Allison\n\nSo the relevant cells are the ones with 'cfl team' and 'player' columns for this row, as they directly support the claim.

Each row represents a different player with their corresponding details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"david kasouf play for holy cross college.\" So, my main goal is to find if David Kasouf is listed in the table and whether his college is Holy Cross.\n\nLooking at the players column, I'll scan each row to see if David Kasouf appears.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking against the given HTML table. The claim is: \"david kasouf , a wide reciever , be draft by the hamilton tiger - cat\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three things: the player's name (David Kasouf), his position (wide receiver), and the team that drafted him (Hamilton Tiger-Cats). My task is to find if this information is fully supported in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a pick number with details about the player. The columns are pick, CFL team, player, position, and college.\n\nI'll start by searching for David Kasouf in the 'player' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Row 36: Player is Marc Parenteau.\n2. Row 37: Blake Machan.\n3. Row 38: David Kasouf. Here he is!\n4. The rest are different players.\n\nSo, David Kasouf is in row 38. Now, I'll check the relevant columns for this row. \n\nThe 'player' column matches, so that's one relevant cell. Next, his position is listed as 'wr', which stands for wide receiver. So that's another relevant cell. The team is Hamilton Tiger-Cats, but looking at the 'cfl team' column in row 38, it says \"hamilton tiger - cats\". Wait, there's a space between 'tiger' and '-cats'. In the claim, it's written as \"hamilton tiger - cat\" without the second hyphen. Hmm, does that matter? The table has \"hamilton tiger - cats\", so maybe it's a typo in the claim. But I think for this task, exact string matching is required, so the team name in the table doesn't exactly match the claim.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The claim says \"hamilton tiger - cat\". The table has \"hamilton tiger - cats\". So there's a slight discrepancy in the number of hyphens. Does that mean it's not a perfect match? But maybe the team name is commonly referred to without the extra 's'. Alternatively, perhaps the hyphenation doesn't matter as much, but strictly speaking, they don't match exactly.\n\nWait, no, the table has \"hamilton tiger - cats\", which is two hyphens. The claim says \"tiger - cat\". So that's one hyphen and then \"-cat\" without another hyphen. Wait, actually, in the claim it's written as \"hamilton tiger - cat\", so maybe the team name in the table has an extra 's' or something else.\n\nWait, looking at row 38, the 'cfl team' is \"hamilton tiger - cats\". So that's two hyphens. The claim says \"hamilton tiger - cat\", which is one hyphen before \"-cat\". So the team names don't exactly match in terms of the number of hyphens and the ending.\n\nThis could be an issue because the exact string doesn't match. However, sometimes team names might have slight variations or spelling mistakes in different sources. But for this task, I think we need to take it literally. Since the claim has \"hamilton tiger - cat\" and the table shows \"hamilton tiger - cats\", they don't exactly match. Therefore, the team part of the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The main point is whether David Kasouf was drafted by Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a wide receiver. From the table, row 38 shows that David Kasouf is a wide receiver for Hamilton Tiger-Cats. So regardless of minor differences in team name formatting, the essential information matches.\n\nBut I'm not sure if exact string matching is required or if it's more about the content. The instructions say to check each condition against the table. So the claim has three parts: player, position, and team. \n\nPlayer: Check if David Kasouf is in the 'player' column. Yes, row 38.\nPosition: Check if his position is wide receiver. 'wr' matches.\nTeam: Check if the team is Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The table says \"hamilton tiger - cats\", which is a match except for an extra 's'. So maybe it's acceptable as the same team.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be row 38 for player and position.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table.
