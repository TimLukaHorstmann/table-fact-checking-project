    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about \"atletas kaunas having 10 wins and 15 goal cone time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has several columns: position, club, games played, wins, draws, loses, goals scored, goals conceded, and points. Each row represents a different club's performance.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"atletas kaunas\" having 10 wins and 15 goal cone time. Wait, the term \"goal cone time\" is a bit odd to me. It might be a typo or mistranslation. Perhaps it's supposed to be \"goals scored\" and \"goals conceded\"? Let me check the table for \"atletas kaunas.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows, each with different clubs. Scanning through them, I find that the first row has \"atletas kaunas.\" So, row index 0.\n\nNow, checking the relevant columns: wins and goals conceded. The claim says 10 wins and 15 goals conceded. \n\nLooking at row 0 for \"atletas kaunas\": \n- Wins are indeed 10.\n- Goals scored is 65, but the claim mentions goals conceded as 15. Wait, in the table, goals conceded for \"atletas kaunas\" is 15, yes.\n\nWait, no, hold on. In the table, the columns after games played and before points are \"goals scored\" and \"goals conceded.\" So, in row 0:\n- Goals scored: 65\n- Goals conceded: 15\n\nBut the claim says \"10 wins and 15 goal cone time.\" Hmm, maybe it's a typo. It probably should be goals conceded instead of \"cone time.\" If that's the case, then the claim is accurate because they have 10 wins and 15 goals conceded.\n\nAlternatively, if \"goal cone time\" refers to something else entirely, like a specific statistic I'm not familiar with, then maybe it's incorrect. But considering the context, it's more likely a typo for goals conceded or scored.\n\nSince the table shows 10 wins and 15 goals conceded for \"atletas kaunas,\" if the claim is stating that correctly, then it should be TRUE. Therefore, I'll conclude that the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"atletas kaunas\" has 10 wins and 15 goals conceded. Checking row 0 in the table confirms this: 10 wins and 15 goals conceded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals conceded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"highest number of game play be 14\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means. It seems to say that in the table, there's a row where the number of games played is the highest and it equals 14.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has a \"games played\" column. The values are all 14 except for one team which might have a different number? Wait, no, upon checking, every row shows 14 in the \"games played\" column. So if the claim is that the highest number of games played is 14, then it's correct because all teams have played 14 games.\n\nWait, but the word \"highest\" implies that there is a maximum value, which in this case is 14 since no team has more than that. Therefore, the statement is TRUE because each team has indeed played 14 games, and that's the highest number mentioned here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Perhaps it refers to \"goals scored\" or maybe something else related, but given the context, I'll assume they meant \"goals scored.\"\n\nThe claim also says that the club with the least goals scored should be in the highest position (top rank). So, I need to check each club's number of goals scored and see if the one with the lowest number is ranked first.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Atletas Kaunas: 65 goals\n2.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"mituva jurbarkas only cone time an average of 1 goal per game play\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"mituva jurbarkas,\" which I can see is one of the teams in the table. Specifically, looking at the table, it's in row 7. The claim talks about an average of 1 goal per game play. So I need to check if this team's goals scored relate to that.\n\nLooking at the 'goals scored' column for mituva jurbarkas, which is in column_name \"goals scored\" and row_index 7 (since rows are numbered starting from 0 or 1? Wait, in the table, the first row is position 1, so probably row indices start at 1. So row 7 is indeed mituva jurbarkas.)\n\nFrom the table, mituva jurbarkas has played 14 games (games played column). Their goals scored are 12. To find the average goals per game, I would divide total goals by number of games. So 12 divided by 14 equals approximately 0.857 goals per game.\n\nThe claim states an average of exactly 1 goal per game. Since 0.857 is less than 1, this doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding \"cone time.\" Does that refer to something else? In football terminology, \"conceicao\" might be a typo for \"conceded,\" meaning goals allowed. But in the claim, it's about goals scored. So focusing on goals scored: 12 over 14 games is around 0.86, not 1.\n\nThus, the average is not 1 goal per game; it's lower. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals scored\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"atletas kaunas have the most draw of any club\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Atletas Kaunas has the highest number of draws compared to all other clubs in the table. To verify this, I need to look at the 'draws' column for each team and see if Atletas Kaunas indeed has the maximum value there.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different club with various statistics. The relevant columns here are \"position,\" \"club,\" \"games played,\" \"wins,\" \"draws,\" \"loses,\" etc., but since the claim is about draws, I'll focus on the \"draws\" column specifically.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check the number of draws:\n\n1. **Atletas Kaunas**: According to the first row, they have 3 draws.\n2. **Saving\u0117 Kai\u0161iadorys**: Second row shows 4 draws.\n3. **Sveikata Kybartai**: Third row has 5 draws.\n4. **Lietava - 2 Jonava**: Fourth row shows 1 draw.\n5. **\u0160e\u0161up\u0117 Vilkavi\u0161kis**: Fifth row lists 8 draws.\n6. **\u0160ilas Kazl\u0173 R\u016bda**: Sixth row mentions 0 draws.\n7. **Mituva Jurbarkas**: Seventh row has 2 draws.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Atletas Kaunas only has 3 draws, while other clubs like \u0160e\u0161up\u0117 Vilkavi\u0161kis have significantly more, up to 8 draws. Therefore, the claim that Atletas Kaunas has the most draws is incorrect. \n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for this analysis. The 'draws' column seems crucial here because it directly compares each team's draw count. So the relevant cells would be all the entries under the \"draws\" column across each row.\n\nIn summary, since Atletas Kaunas does not have the highest number of draws among the clubs listed, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"draws\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
