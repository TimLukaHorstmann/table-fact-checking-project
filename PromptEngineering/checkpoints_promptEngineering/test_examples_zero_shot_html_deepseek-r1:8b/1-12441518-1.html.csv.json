    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the character of kevin lucas appear in all season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has five columns: character, portrayed by, main cast seasons, recurring cast seasons, and of episodes. There are six rows, each representing a different character.\n\nThe claim is about Kevin Lucas appearing in all seasons. So, I should focus on the 'main cast seasons' and 'recurring cast seasons' columns for Kevin. \n\nLooking at the row for Kevin Lucas (row index 2), under 'main cast seasons', it's listed as \"seasons 1 - 2\". That means he was part of the main cast in seasons 1 and 2, but not beyond that. However, the claim says he appears in all seasons, which would imply being present in season 3 and onwards if applicable.\n\nAdditionally, under 'recurring cast seasons', it's also \"seasons 1 - 2\". This suggests Kevin is a recurring character only up to season 2. If the show has more than two seasons, his absence from later seasons would contradict the claim.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't specify if there are more than two seasons. However, since the main cast column for other characters like Nick, Joe, and others also stops at season 2, it's possible that the series only has two seasons. In that case, Kevin does appear in all seasons available (1 and 2), so maybe the claim is correct.\n\nBut the term \"all seasons\" could be ambiguous. If the series has more than two seasons, then Kevin doesn't appear beyond season 2, making the claim false. However, based on the table alone, it's unclear how many total seasons there are. The main cast and recurring cast columns only go up to season 2 for everyone.\n\nI think the safest approach is to check both 'main cast seasons' and 'recurring cast seasons' for Kevin since those directly indicate his involvement in each season. Since both columns say \"seasons 1 - 2\", it implies he's only in the first two seasons, which might not cover all possible seasons if there are more.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Kevin Lucas appears in all seasons isn't fully supported by the table because it doesn't confirm his presence beyond season 2. So, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"main cast seasons\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The key part here is to verify if Nick Lucas is indeed a single character as per the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different character. The first column is \"character,\" which lists names like \"nick lucas,\" \"joe lucas,\" etc. So, for this claim, I need to focus on the rows where the character is \"nick lucas.\"\n\nIn the table, there's only one occurrence of \"nick lucas\" in the first row (row_index 0). The columns relevant here are \"portrayed by\" and \"of episodes.\" However, since the claim is about being a single character, the key column to check is the first column where the character is listed as \"nick lucas.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the cell in row 0 under the \"character\" column because it explicitly states that Nick Lucas is one character. The other columns provide additional information but aren't necessary for verifying if he's a single character.\n\nTherefore, since the table confirms that there's only one entry for Nick Lucas, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"character\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me carefully check each condition against the table.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, I see that there's a row for Stella Malone. Her details are: character name \"Stella Malone\", portrayed by Chelsea Kane, main cast seasons \"seasons 1 - 2\", recurring cast seasons \"appears in all seasons\", and number of episodes \"34\".\n\nThe claim is specifically about her appearing in season 1 and 2. So I need to verify if she's in these seasons as per the table.\n\nIn the 'main cast seasons' column, it says \"seasons 1 - 2\". That means she was part of the main cast during seasons 1 and 2, which directly supports the claim. Even though she also appears in all seasons as a recurring character, the main cast information is more relevant for this specific claim.\n\nTherefore, since her main casting includes seasons 1-2, the claim holds true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Stella Malone be a character in season 1 and 2,\" we look at the 'main cast seasons' column for her row.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that \"nick lucas\" is a character who appears in both Season 1 and Season 2. The table provided lists various characters with details about their portrayals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different character. In the first few rows, there are three Lucas brothers: Nick, Joe, and Kevin, each portrayed by actors named after Jonas. Their main cast seasons are listed as \"seasons 1 - 2,\" which suggests they're in both Season 1 and Season 2.\n\nI need to find if \"nick lucas\" is a character in the table. Yes, there's a row for him. Now, I'll check his season information. The column named \"main cast seasons\" says \"seasons 1 - 2,\" which means he was indeed part of both seasons as a main character.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"recurring cast seasons\" cell, it says \"appears in all seasons.\" Since Season 1 and Season 2 are included in that statement, this further confirms his presence in both.\n\nSo, based on the table, \"nick lucas\" is part of the main cast in Seasons 1 and 2. There's no information suggesting he isn't in those seasons, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the relevant cells in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"kevin jonas appear in season 1 and 2\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. The answer should be a JSON object with either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\" as the value and a list of relevant cells that support this conclusion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Kevin Jonas appears in both season 1 and season 2. So, my goal is to check if there's any information in the table that confirms this.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several columns: character, portrayed by, main cast seasons, recurring cast seasons, and of episodes. Each row represents a different character with their respective details.\n\nTo verify the claim, I should focus on the 'character' column for Kevin Jonas and then check his season information in both 'main cast seasons' and 'recurring cast seasons' columns. Wait, but I notice that the 'portrayed by' column lists names like \"kevin jonas\", which matches the claim's subject.\n\nNow, looking at the relevant rows for Kevin Lucas: Wait a second, the character is listed as \"kevin lucas\" and his portrayed by is \"kevin jonas\". That might be a typo because the name in the claim is \"Kevin Jonas,\" but here it's spelled as \"Lucas.\" Hmm, that could be confusing.\n\nBut perhaps it's just a matter of naming conventions. Maybe Kevin Lucas is portrayed by Kevin Jonas, so they're referring to the same person. So, even though the character is listed as Kevin Lucas, the actor is Kevin Jonas, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking the seasons: The main cast season for Kevin Lucas is \"seasons 1 - 2\", and recurring is also \"appears in all seasons\". Since both main and recurring mention seasons 1-2, that implies he appears in both. The 'of episodes' column has 34, but that's just a number, not relevant to the claim about seasons.\n\nSo, based on this, Kevin Jonas (the portrayed by name) is present for Kevin Lucas, appearing in seasons 1 and 2 as part of both main and recurring cast. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that \"kevin jonas\" is indeed the correct portrayal for season 1 and 2. The table shows that the main cast seasons are 1-2, which aligns with the claim. So, yes, the information supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"kevin jonas appear in season 1 and 2,\" we need to check if Kevin Jonas is listed as appearing in both seasons.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where the 'character' is associated with Kevin Jonas. In this case, the row has 'character': \"kevin lucas\" and 'portrayed by': \"kevin jonas.\"\n\n2. **Check Season Information**: The main cast season column states \"seasons 1 - 2,\" confirming that Kevin Lucas (portrayed by Kevin Jonas) appears in both seasons.\n\n3. **Recurring Cast Seasons**: It also mentions \"appears in all seasons,\" further supporting the claim about seasons 1 and 2.\n\nBased on this, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"main cast seasons\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The rows list different characters with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"nick lucas,\" so I need to check if that character appears in all seasons. Looking through the table, the first row is about nick lucas. The columns relevant here would be the ones indicating the seasons he's in and how many episodes he appears in.\n\nIn the main cast seasons column, it says \"seasons 1 - 2,\" which suggests he only appeared in the first two seasons. That already raises a red flag because if he didn't appear in all seasons, then the claim might be false. But let me check further to confirm.\n\nThe recurring cast seasons for nick lucas also says \"appears in all seasons.\" Hmm, that seems contradictory because earlier it said only 1-2. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check each column.\n\nLooking back at the table, under \"main cast seasons,\" nick lucas is listed as \"seasons 1 - 2,\" while \"recurring cast seasons\" says he appears in all seasons. That seems inconsistent. If he's in the main cast for only two seasons but considered recurring in all, maybe there's a miscalculation or misunderstanding.\n\nBut regardless of the discrepancy between main and recurring, the key point is that the main cast column indicates he was only in 1-2 seasons. So, if the claim is about appearing in all seasons, that's not accurate based on this information.\n\nAlso, looking at the \"of episodes\" column, it shows 34 episodes for nick lucas, which aligns with him being a main character through two seasons. However, since he isn't in all seasons (assuming the series has more than two), the claim is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are where his name is listed because those are the only ones that could possibly support or refute the claim.

Nick Lucas appears in 34 episodes.\n2. Joe Lucas also appears in 34 episodes.\n3. Kevin Lucas appears in 34 episodes as well.\n4. Stella Malone appears in 34 episodes.\n5. Macy Misa appears in 30 episodes.\n\nWait, so all of them except Macy Misa have 34 episodes. But wait, the claim is about Kevin appearing in the fewest.

Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because Kevin doesn't have the fewest; someone else does.\n\nWait, no. Let me make sure I'm not misunderstanding. The claim says Kevin appears in the fewest. But if he's appearing in more than others, or if others are appearing less, that would affect it. Wait, no, in this case, all except Macy have 34, and Kevin is included in those with 34.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Kevin having the fewest.

So, the claim says, \"there be 5 member of the jonas family.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in the table. The table has several columns: character, portrayed by, main cast seasons, recurring cast seasons, and number of episodes. Each row represents a different character.\n\nLooking at the characters listed, I see names like Nick Lucas, Joe Lucas, Kevin Lucas, Stella Malone, and Macy Misa. These all seem to be part of the Lucas family, but the claim is about the Jonas family. Hmm, that's interesting because none of these characters are named Jonas; they're all Lucases.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could \"Jonas\" refer to the portrayed actors instead? Let me check the \"portrayed by\" column. The actors listed are Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, Kevin Jonas, Chelsea Kane, and Nicole Anderson. These names do include Jonases\u2014specifically, Nick, Joe, and Kevin Jonas.\n\nSo the claim is about five members of the Jonas family, which would correspond to the three main Jonas characters (Nick, Joe, Kevin) plus maybe others? But in the table, only three are listed under \"character\" as Jonas family members. Stella Malone and Macy Misa don't have \"Jonas\" in their names, so they're probably not part of the Jonas family.\n\nWait, but the claim says five members. If only three are present (Nick, Joe, Kevin), that's only three, not five. Unless I'm missing something. Let me count again: Nick, Joe, Kevin\u2014that's three. The other two characters mentioned don't seem to be part of the Jonas family based on their names.\n\nSo, if the table shows three members of the Jonas family and the claim states there are five, then the claim is false because there aren't five Jonas family members listed here. Alternatively, maybe the term \"Jonas family\" refers to the actors, but even then, only three are present, not five.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Maybe the \"character\" column includes both Lucas and Jonas? But no, the Lucas names are separate from the Jonas actors. So if the claim is about five members of the Jonas family, and only three are present in the table, then the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nBut wait again\u2014looking at the table, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Nick Lucas - portrayed by Nick Jonas\n2. Joe Lucas - portrayed by Joe Jonas\n3. Kevin Lucas - portrayed by Kevin Jonas\n4. Stella Malone - portrayed by Chelsea Kane\n5. Macy Misa - portrayed by Nicole Anderson\n\nSo, only three characters are explicitly part of the Jonas family based on their \"portrayed by\" names. Therefore, the table doesn't show five Jonas family members; it shows three.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the term \"Jonas family\" is being used differently here. Maybe it's referring to the actors' family members, but that would be a stretch. Typically, in acting contexts, when you say someone is portrayed by a member of the Jonas family, they're referring to the actors themselves, not their biological family members.\n\nSo, if the claim is about five Jonas family members, and only three are present (Nick, Joe, Kevin), then it's false because there aren't five. Alternatively, maybe the table includes more, but upon checking, no\u2014only three \"character\" entries correspond to Jonas actors.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are five members of the Jonas family isn't supported by the table provided.

It has columns: character, portrayed by, main cast seasons, recurring cast seasons, and of episodes. The rows list different characters along with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"nick jonas.\" Wait, but looking at the table, the first column lists 'character' as names like \"nick lucas,\" not \"nick jonas.\" Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check each row:\n\n- The first row has \"nick lucas\" portrayed by \"nick jonas.\"\n- The second is \"joe lucas\" with \"joe jonas.\"\n- Third: \"kevin lucas\" and \"kevin jonas.\"\n- Fourth: \"stella malone\" and \"chelsea kane.\"\n- Fifth: \"macy misa\" and \"nicole anderson.\"\n\nSo, the claim mentions \"nick jonas,\" but in the table, there's no row with \"nick jonas\" as the character. Instead, it's always \"nick lucas.\" That might mean the claim is incorrect because the actual character is \"nick lucas,\" not \"nick jonas.\" So maybe the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check if the table has any row where the character is \"nick jonas.\" Scanning through each row again: nope, it's consistently \"nick lucas\" and others. So the claim refers to a name that doesn't even appear in the table. That would mean the statement isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about \"nick jonas,\" who might be the portrayed character. But looking at the 'portrayed by' column: for each main cast member, it's their respective names. So if the claim is that \"nick jonas\" appears in the fewest episodes, but in reality, each of the main characters (nick lucas, joe, kevin) appear 34 times, while recurring characters like chelsea kane and nicole anderson have fewer or more?\n\nWait, no\u2014the table shows for 'stella malone' and 'macy misa' that their recurring cast appears in all seasons. But the main cast season column is filled by the three Lucases and one Malone (stella) with 34 episodes each.\n\nBut the claim is about \"nick jonas,\" who isn't a character in the table. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the data given, there's no such character as \"nick jonas.\" Therefore, the claim can't be TRUE because the person in question doesn't exist in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Perhaps the 'portrayed by' column is what matters. So looking at the main cast seasons and recurring cast seasons for each character:\n\n- Nick Lucas (played by Nick Jonas) appears in all 2 seasons as a main cast member, so 34 episodes.\n- Similarly for Joe and Kevin.\n- Stella Malone appears in all seasons but has her own 34 episodes.\n- Macy Misa appears in seasons 1-2 as main cast but also appears in all seasons as recurring? Wait, no. The 'recurring cast seasons' column says \"appears in all seasons,\" which might mean they're part of the recurring cast across all seasons.\n\nBut wait, looking at each row:\n\nFor Nick Lucas: main cast in 1-2 (34 episodes), recurring in all seasons (but the number isn't specified for recurring? Or is it that they're recurring but their count is 34 as well?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: the 'main cast seasons' and 'recurring cast seasons' are separate. So for each character, their main cast participation is in certain seasons, and their recurring participation spans all seasons.\n\nBut the number of episodes per character is given by the 'of episodes' column. For Nick Lucas (character), it's 34. Same for Joe, Kevin, Stella Malone (30?), wait no: looking at the table:\n\n- Nick Lucas: main cast 1-2, recurring all, episodes 34\n- Joe Lucas: same as above\n- Kevin Lucas: same\n- Stella Malone: main cast 1-2, recurring all, episodes 34\n- Macy Misa: main cast 1-2, recurring all, episodes 30.\n\nSo the number of episodes per character is either 34 or 30. The claim says \"nick jonas\" appears in the fewest number of episodes, which would mean 30 if that's the case. But since there is no such character as \"nick jonas,\" perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim meant to refer to \"nicole anderson\" as Macy Misa, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that in the table, the 'character' column doesn't have a row for \"nick jonas.\" Therefore, it's impossible to determine how many episodes he appeared in because he isn't listed. Hence, the claim can't be supported as TRUE.\n\nSo, the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we must check if the relevant data supports it. The table shows that \"nick lucas\" is portrayed by \"nick jonas,\" but there's no row for \"nick jonas.\" Since he doesn't exist in the table, the claim can't be verified.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Characters**: The table lists several characters with their details.\n2. **Check Claimed Character**: The claim refers to \"nick jonas,\" which isn't present as a character in any row.\n3. **Data Absence**: Since \"nick jonas\" isn't listed, there's no data to support or refute the claim.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"nick lucas only appear in the first season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the table has several columns: character, portrayed by, main cast seasons, recurring cast seasons, and of episodes. Each row represents a different character with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about \"nick lucas.\" So I should look for the row where the character is nick lucas. Let's see, looking at the first few rows:\n\n1. The first row has \"nick lucas\" as the character, portrayed by \"nick jonas.\"\n2. The second row is \"joe lucas,\" so that's a different person.\n3. Third row is \"kevin lucas,\" another different character.\n4. Fourth row is \"stella malone,\" not relevant here.\n5. Fifth row is \"macy misa,\" also not the one we're looking at.\n\nSo, focusing on the first row: nick lucas appears in seasons 1-2 as a main cast and recurring cast. The number of episodes he's in is 34.\n\nNow, the claim says that nick lucas only appears in the first season. But according to the table, he appears in both seasons 1 and 2. That means the claim isn't entirely accurate because he also appears in season 2.\n\nI need to check which columns are relevant. The main cast seasons and recurring cast seasons indicate that he's present in multiple seasons, not just one. So the main point is the number of seasons he's in.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because nick lucas isn't only in the first season; he's in the first two.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"nick lucas only appear in the first season\" is true, we analyze the relevant columns for \"nick lucas.\"\n\n- **Character**: The row for \"nick lucas\" is identified as row index 0.\n- **Main Cast Seasons**: This column shows that \"nick lucas\" appears in seasons 1 - 2.\n- **Recurring Cast Seasons**: Similarly, this also indicates he appears across all seasons.\n\nSince \"nick lucas\" is present in both season 1 and season 2, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"main cast seasons\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is true or false. The table provides information on various characters in a show, including details like who portrays them, which seasons they're main cast, if they recur across all seasons, and how many episodes they appear in.\n\nThe specific claim here is: \"kevin jonas be the only 1 that do not appear in all season.\" Hmm, okay. Let me parse this out. First off, I need to check the table provided to see if Kevin Jonas indeed does not appear in all seasons as per the claim, and whether he's the sole character with this distinction.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns: character, portrayed by, main cast seasons, recurring cast seasons, of episodes. The rows list different characters, each with their respective details.\n\nFocusing on Kevin Lucas first since the claim mentions \"kevin jonas.\" From the table, under the row for Kevin Lucas:\n\n- Character: kevin lucas\n- Portrayed by: kevin jonas\n- Main cast seasons: seasons 1 - 2\n- Recurring cast seasons: appears in all seasons\n- Of episodes: 34\n\nWait a minute. The \"recurring cast seasons\" column says he appears in all seasons. So according to the table, Kevin Lucas does appear in all seasons, which contradicts the claim that he doesn't appear in all seasons.\n\nNow, checking the other characters to see if any of them don't appear in all seasons. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Nick Lucas: Recurring cast seasons - appears in all seasons.\n2. Joe Lucas: Same as above.\n3. Stella Malone: Also appears in all seasons.\n4. Macy Misa: Recurring cast seasons - appears in all seasons, but note her \"of episodes\" is 30 instead of 34.\n\nSo, all main characters except Kevin Lucas (and others) are marked as appearing in all seasons. But wait, looking back at the table, for example, Joe Lucas also appears in all seasons. So actually, all main cast characters here appear in all seasons.\n\nWait, the claim says \"kevin jonas be the only 1 that do not appear in all season.\" But according to the table, Kevin does appear in all seasons as he's marked in recurring cast seasons. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Kevin does appear in all seasons, and none of the other main characters don't either.\n\nHold on, perhaps I misread something. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Nick Lucas: appears in all seasons\n- Joe Lucas: same\n- Kevin Lucas: same\n- Stella Malone: same\n- Macy Misa: same\n\nSo actually, all these characters appear in all seasons according to the table.\n\nBut then, how does this affect the claim? The claim says that Kevin Jonas is the only one who doesn't appear in all seasons. However, from the table, he does appear in all seasons because \"recurring cast seasons\" says he appears in all. Therefore, the claim is false because Kevin does appear in all seasons, making the statement incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"appear.\" Does \"appears in all seasons\" mean they are part of every season as a main or recurring character? Let me look at each row again:\n\n- Nick: appears in all seasons\n- Joe: same\n- Kevin: same\n- Stella: same\n- Macy: same\n\nSo, the claim is that Kevin Jonas doesn't appear in all seasons, but according to the table, he does. Therefore, the claim is false because Kevin actually appears in all seasons.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"appear\" is being misused here. If a character appears as part of the main cast or recurring, it's about their presence across seasons, not their portrayal. So, since Kevin Lucas is marked as appearing in all seasons, he does appear in every season, so the claim that he doesn't is false.\n\nTherefore, the overall conclusion is that the claim is false because Kevin Jonas (portrayed by kevin jonas) does appear in all seasons according to the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"kevin jonas be the only 1 that do not appear in all season.\" However, upon examining the table, it's clear that kevin lucas (portrayed by kevin jonas) does appear in all seasons. Since the claim incorrectly asserts that he doesn't, it is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are the ones containing \"recurring cast seasons\" for each row, as they indicate whether a character appears across all seasons.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
