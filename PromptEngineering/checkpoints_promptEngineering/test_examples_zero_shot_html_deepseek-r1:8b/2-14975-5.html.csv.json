    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's stating. The claim mentions two main things: 90 games played in a series and that it's related to the \"sawhorse dollar trophy\". \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different matchup between teams, along with some details like the name of the trophy, the first time they met, number of games played, and their series record. The column names are \"teams\", \"name\", \"trophy\", \"first met\", \"games played\", and \"series record\".\n\nThe claim is specifically about 90 games being played for a series related to the sawhorse dollar trophy. So I need to find a row where both conditions are met: the number of games played is 90, and the trophy is called \"sawhorse dollar\". \n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. **Columbia - Cornell**: Trophy is \"empire cup\", not \"sawhorse dollar\". Games played are 98.\n2. **Cornell - Penn**: Trophy is \"trustee's cup\", games played 118. Not matching.\n3. **Dartmouth - Princeton**: Trophy is \"sawhorse dollar\" and games played are 90. This matches both conditions in the claim.\n4. **Harvard - Yale**: Trophy is none, so no match.\n5. **Princeton - Yale**: Trophy is none, games played 134. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo the relevant row is the third one (index 2) under \"games played\" and \"trophy\". Therefore, the claim is TRUE, supported by the data in those cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table where Dartmouth - Princeton have a trophy called \"sawhorse dollar\" with 90 games played.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"trophy\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"more than 100 games be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about a series that has the sawhorse dollar trophy and whether more than 100 games were played in that series. So I need to find which row corresponds to the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy and check the number of games played there.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different series between two teams, along with details like the trophy name, first meeting year, games played, and series record. The column in question here is \"series record,\" but actually, it's the count of games played that matters for this claim.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the trophy is named \"sawhorse dollar.\" Scanning the table:\n\n1. Empire State Bowl: 35-60-3\n2. Trustee's Cup: 45-68-5\n3. Sawhorse Dollar: 43-43-4\n4. The Game: None (Harvard-Yale)\n5. None: Princeton-Yale\n\nSo, the third row has \"sawhorse dollar\" as the trophy name. Now, in that same row, under \"games played,\" it says 90 games.\n\nThe claim states more than 100 games were played for that series. However, 90 is less than 100. Therefore, the number of games doesn't meet the claim's criteria.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. The third row has \"sawhorse dollar\" as the trophy, and 90 games. Yes, that's correct. So it's indeed 90, which is less than 100. \n\nSo the claim is FALSE because there aren't more than 100 games for that series.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim about the number of games played in a series with the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy, we identified the relevant row and verified the game count.\n\nThe relevant cells are the one where the trophy is \"sawhorse dollar,\" specifically row 2 (0-indexed) under the \"games played\" column. The count there is 90, which is less than 100.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
