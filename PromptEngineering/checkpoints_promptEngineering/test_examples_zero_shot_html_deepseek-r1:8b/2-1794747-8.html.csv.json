    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me read the claim again: \"Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award for best actress in a musical category in 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Imelda Staunton won any award in 2013. Looking at the table, there are several rows for 2013 under different categories. The nominees include her for \"best actress in a musical,\" and it says she won.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that support this claim. So, I'll look for the row where the nominee is Imelda Staunton and the category is \"best actress in a musical\" in 2013. \n\nIn the table, there's a row with year 2013, award ceremony as Laurence Olivier Award, category best actress in a musical, nominee Imelda Staunton, and result won. So that row supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is the one at row index 3, column \"result.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data where Imelda Staunton won the best actress category in 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012\" is true based on the given HTML table. First, I'll go through each step systematically.\n\nThe claim mentions Imelda Staunton being a nominee in 2012. So, my focus should be on finding any entries in the table that match this criteria. \n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. The years listed are from 2012 to 2013, so I'll check each row for 2012 specifically.\n\nStarting with 2012, there's only one row:\n- Year: 2012\n- Award Ceremony: evening standard award\n- Category: best musical\n- Nominee: best musical\n- Result: won\n\nI notice that the \"nominee\" cell is filled with \"best musical,\" not Imelda Staunton. So, in this case, there's no row where she is listed as a nominee in 2012.\n\nNext, I'll check other years just to be thorough. In 2013, there are multiple rows:\n- For categories like best actor and best actress in a musical, the nominees are Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton respectively. So, in 2013, she won those awards.\n- There are also some nominated categories where different people are listed.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions 2012. Since there's no entry for her as a nominee in 2012, the claim doesn't hold true based on the table provided.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any rows or misreading the data. Each row is checked individually, and none of them have Imelda Staunton as a nominee for 2012. The closest match is in 2013 for different categories, but that's outside the scope of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no evidence in the table supporting it.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"Imelda Staunton be the nominee in 2012,\" we need to check each row corresponding to 2012. The only relevant row for 2012 shows that the nominee was \"best musical.\" There is no entry where Imelda Staunton is listed as a nominee for 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
