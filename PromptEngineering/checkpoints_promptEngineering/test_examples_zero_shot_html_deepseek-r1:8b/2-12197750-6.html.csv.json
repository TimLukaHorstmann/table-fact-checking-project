    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant for verification. The claim is: \"At 476, the highest roll belongs to Dannevirke High School.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the column named \"Roll\" in the table to find where the number 476 appears. Scanning through each row's Roll column:\n\n- Row 0: 141\n- Row 1: 103\n- Row 2: 176\n- Row 3: 259\n- Row 4: 13\n- Row 5: 59\n- Row 6: 113\n- Row 7: 143\n- Row 8: 64\n- Row 9: 330\n- Row 10: 73\n- Row 11: 47\n- Row 12: 64\n- Row 13: 143\n- Row 14: 176\n- Row 15: 103\n- Row 16: 259\n- Row 17: 113\n- Row 18: 13\n- Row 19: 59\n- Row 20: 173? Wait, no, looking back, row 8 is Weber School with Roll 64, and so on. Actually, the highest number in the Roll column seems to be 476.\n\nWait, but I'm going through each row's Roll value. Let me list them all out:\n\nLooking at the table, the Roll column has values like:\n\n- Weber School: 64\n- Woodville School: 143\n- St Joseph's: 103\n- Tararua College: 330\n- Totara College: 47\n- T K K M o Tamaki Nui a Ru a:73\n- St Anthony's:141\n- St Joseph's again:103\n- Dannevirke High School:476\n- Others like Pahiatua, Papatawa, etc., have lower rolls.\n\nSo, the highest Roll number is 476, which belongs to Dannevirke High School. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for verification. The key data point is that in the Row where Dannevirke High School is listed (probably row index 9 as per the table provided), the Roll column has 476.\n\nLooking at the structure, each row represents a school with various attributes. So, the relevant columns are \"School Name\" and \"Roll.\"\n\nTherefore, I need to check the cell in row_index where Dannevirke High School is located and the Roll column for that same row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"School Name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"only 4 of the schools in Manawatu go up to Year 13.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"Only 4\" implies that there are exactly four schools listed under Manawatu that have Year 13. So my task is to look through the table and identify which schools are located in Manawatu and whether they offer up to Year 13.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a school with various details, including their location and the years they operate. The first step is to determine which of these schools are in Manawatu. From the column names, it seems like the relevant information might be under \"District\" or perhaps another column, but based on the example JSON given, I think we're focusing on the row_index and column_name.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure, each row has a number of columns: School Name, Year 1 to 13 (but it's just listed as numbers), District, Type, etc. So perhaps \"District\" is the key here. Let me check if there's a \"District\" column or something similar.\n\nHmm, in the provided table, I can see columns like \"District\", \"Type\", and others. So for each school, I need to check the value under \"District\" to see if it's Manawatu. But looking at the first few rows:\n\n- Row 0: Weber School, District: Weber\n- Row 1: Woodville School, District: Woodville\n- Etc.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding which column indicates the location. Alternatively, perhaps \"District\" refers to a larger area, and Manawatu is within it or a separate entity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the schools are categorized by their type, such as state, integrated, etc., but I don't think that's relevant here. The key is to find out which schools offer up to Year 13 and whether they're located in Manawatu.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"Type\" column includes \"Manawatu,\" or maybe the location is indicated differently. But looking at the table, it seems like each row has a \"District\" column, but the values are things like Weber, Woodville, Pahiatua, etc. So I'm not sure if any of these districts are Manawatu.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"Manawatu\" refers to a region encompassing several districts, so any school whose district is within the Manawatu region would count. But without knowing which specific districts fall under Manawatu, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim specifies that only 4 schools in Manawatu go up to Year 13. So perhaps \"Manawatu\" refers to a specific district or area. Looking at the table, let's see which schools have a type of \"state integrated\" because sometimes those might be part of the Manawatu region.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- St Joseph's School: State Integrated\n- Tararua College: State\n- TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Ruwa: State\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning: State Integrated\n\nWait, but that doesn't necessarily link them to Manawatu. I need to see if any of these schools are in the Manawatu district.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Manawatu\" refers to a specific type or category, such as a region with several schools offering Year 13. Let me look for schools that have a range up to Year 13 and their types.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Tararua College: Years 9-13\n- TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Ruwa: 1-13\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning: 1-13\n\nSo these three offer Year 13. Additionally, Weber School has a column with \"Year 7,\" but does it go up to Year 13? No, only Year 7.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 4\" schools in Manawatu go up to Year 13. So if there are more than four, then the claim is false.\n\nFrom my initial scan, I see at least three: Tararua College, TKKM, and Totara. Wait, that's three, but maybe there's a fourth?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- St Joseph's School: Type is state integrated, but does it go up to Year 13? Let me check the year column. It says Year 5, so no.\n- Pahiatua School: Goes up to Year 8, so no.\n- Woodville School: Up to Year 8.\n- Papatawa School: Only up to Year 8.\n- Pongaroa School: Year 8.\n- So maybe only Tararua College, TKKM, and Totara go up to Year 13.\n\nWait, that's three schools. But the claim says \"only four,\" so if there are three, then the claim is false because it's not exactly four. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing one.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- St Joseph's: Doesn't.\n- Weber: No.\n- Woodville: No.\n- Pahiatua: No.\n- Tararua: Yes.\n- TKKM: Yes.\n- Totara: Yes.\n- Are there any others? Let me check the Type column for state integrated.\n\nWait, Totara is State Integrated and goes up to Year 13. TKKM is also State and goes up to 13. Tararua is State and goes from 9-13.\n\nSo that's three schools. Therefore, the claim says only four go up to Year 13 in Manawatu, but I've found at least three. So if there are exactly three, then the claim is false because it states \"only four.\" But perhaps I'm missing one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some other schools also offer Year 13 that I didn't notice. Let me check each row for Year 13:\n\n- Row 0: Weber School - up to Year 7\n- Row 1: Woodville School - up to Year 8\n- Row 2: Pahiatua School - up to Year 8\n- Row 3: St Joseph's School - up to Year 5\n- Row 4: Tararua College - 9-13 (so includes Year 13)\n- Row 5: TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Ruwa - 1-13 (includes 13)\n- Row 6: Totara College of Accelerated Learning - 1-13 (includes 13)\n- Row 7: Papatawa School - up to Year 8\n- Row 8: Pongaroa School - up to Year 8\n- Row 9: Other schools?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me count all the schools:\n\nThe table seems to have more than ten rows, but looking at the initial data provided, it's likely a subset. However, based on what I can see:\n\n- Tararua College (Row 4)\n- TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Ruwa (Row 5)\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning (Row 6)\n\nThat's three schools offering up to Year 13. Therefore, the claim stating that only four do so is incorrect because there are at least three. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only four schools in Manawatu offer education up to Year 13. Upon reviewing the table, it's evident that Tararua College, TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Ruwa, and Totara College of Accelerated Learning all provide education through Year 13, totaling three schools. Since this is less than four, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because there are fewer than four schools in Manawatu offering education up to Year 13.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Both schools that cover Year 1 to 13 be located in the Dannevirke area.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each row in the table to see which schools offer Years 1 to 13 and are located in Dannevirke.\n\nLooking at the 'Year Range' column, I see most schools have a range from 1-8 or similar. Only a few, like Tararua College, Taranaki International College, Totara College of Accelerated Learning, and Weber School offer up to Year 13.\n\nNow, for each of these schools, I need to check their 'Location' column. \n\nStarting with Tararua College (row index 8), it's located in Pahiatua. That's not Dannevirke, so this doesn't support the claim.\n\nNext, Taranaki International College (row index 9) is in Dannevirke. So this one does support the claim.\n\nTotara College of Accelerated Learning (row index 10) is also in Dannevirke, supporting the claim.\n\nWeber School (row index 12) is located in Weber, which isn't Dannevirke, so it doesn't help.\n\nSo there are two schools covering Year 1-13 that are in Dannevirke: Taranaki International College and Totara College of Accelerated Learning. The claim says \"both,\" but actually only one is in Dannevirke besides another, which I think might be a mistake because the count seems off.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Tararua College is in Pahiatua, so that's not Dannevirke. Taranaki International College (row 9) and Totara College (row 10) are both in Dannevirke. So actually, there are two schools in Dannevirke covering Year 1-13, which might make the claim true because it uses \"both\" even if they're not the only ones.\n\nSo considering that, the relevant cells would be for these two schools: their location and year range.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Taranaki International College and Totara College of Accelerated Learning being in Dannevirke.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"St Anthony's be 1 of only 3 state integrate school\" is true based on the given table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to assert that there are only three state-integrated schools, and St Anthony's is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes. The columns relevant here would be \"School Name\" to identify the school, \"Type\" to determine if it's integrated, and maybe others like \"Row Index\" for tracking which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to check how many state-integrated schools there are in total. So I'll go through each row and note down the ones where the \"Type\" column mentions \"state integrated.\"\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. **St Anthony's School**: Type is \"state integrated.\" That's one.\n2. **St Joseph's School**: Also \"state integrated.\" Now two.\n3. **Tararua College**: Just says \"state,\" so not integrated.\n4. **TKKM O Tamaki Nui A Rua**: \"state\" again, not integrated.\n5. **Totara College of Accelerated Learning**: \"state integrated.\" That's three.\n\nWait, that's only three schools identified as state-integrated so far. Let me keep checking to ensure I haven't missed any.\n\nGoing through the rest:\n\n- **St Joseph's School** is another one, making it two.\n- Then **Totara College** makes it three.\n- **Tararua College** is not integrated, it's just \"state.\"\n- The others like Weber School and Woodville School are also just \"state.\"\n\nSo from the table provided, there are exactly three state-integrated schools: St Anthony's, St Joseph's, and Totara College. \n\nThe claim says that St Anthony's is one of only three. Since there are indeed three, the statement seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be those where \"Type\" is \"state integrated.\" Specifically, the rows for St Anthony's (row 15) and St Joseph's (row 17), as well as Totara College (row 25). But wait, according to the table, St Anthony's is row index 14? Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the table structure, each row has a number before it. For example, the first school is row 0: Weber School, then 1: Woodville, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided JSON example, they have \"row_index\" starting from 0.

Wait no, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me list each school with their actual row index based on the table provided:\n\nLooking at the table structure in the user's message, it starts from Weber School as row 0 and goes up to Totara College as row 26 (since there are 27 rows including the header). So I need to find which schools have \"state integrated\" as their type.\n\nGoing through each school:\n\n- **St Anthony's School**: Row 4. Type: state integrated.\n- **St Joseph's School**: Row 5? Wait, let me check again. The user provided a table where each row has the details. Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all schools and their types:\n\nLooking at the detailed table, after the header (row -1?), the first school is Weber School, type: state.\n\nThen Woodville School: state.\n\nPongaroa: state.\n\nRuahine: state.\n\nSt Anthony's: state integrated.\n\nSt Joseph's: state integrated.\n\nTararua College: state.\n\nTKKM O Tamaki Nui A Rua: state.\n\nTotara College of Accelerated Learning: state integrated.\n\nPapatawa School: state.\n\nPahiatua School: state.\n\nWait, that might be a misinterpretation. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the user's table, it's structured as:\n\n1. Weber School\n2. Woodville School\n3. Pongaroa School\n4. Ruahine School\n5. St Anthony's School\n6. St Joseph's School\n7. Tararua College\n8. TKKM O Tamaki Nui A Rua\n9. Totara College of Accelerated Learning\n10. Papatawa School\n11. Pahiatua School\n\nWait, that might not be accurate because in the original table provided by the user, there are more rows. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table as given by the user (I think it's a list starting from Weber School and ending with Totara College), I need to count each row:\n\nEach entry starts with the number 1. to 27., so perhaps rows are numbered from 0 to 26.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to go through each school and note their type:\n\n- Weber School: Type: state\n- Woodville School: state\n- Pongaroa School: state\n- Ruahine School: state\n- St Anthony's School: state integrated\n- St Joseph's School: state integrated\n- Tararua College: state\n- TKKM O Tamaki Nui A Rua: state\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning: state integrated\n- Papatawa School: state\n- Pahiatua School: state\n\nWait, that seems to only list 12 schools. But the original table has more. Perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for all entries where \"Type\" is \"state integrated.\"\n\nFrom the user's table:\n\nLooking at each school:\n\n1. Weber School - Type: state\n2. Woodville School - state\n3. Pongaroa School - state\n4. Ruahine School - state\n5. St Anthony's School - state integrated (Yes, 1)\n6.

Papatawa School - state\n11. Pahiatua School - state\n\nSo from this, the three state-integrated schools are St Anthony's, St Joseph's, and Totara College.\n\nThus, the claim is accurate: there are exactly three, with St Anthony's being one of them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"St Anthony's be 1 of only 3 state integrate school\" is based on the provided table.

So, my task is to check how many schools are listed under the \"Norsewood\" area in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes, including their location.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"only 4 of the school in manawatu go up to year 8\" is true based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the table lists various schools and their details. Each row represents a different school with several columns: School Name, Year Level (I assume this is the highest level they offer), Gender (though I'm not sure if that's relevant here), and some other categories like Integrated or not.\n\nThe claim says only 4 schools in Manawatu go up to Year 8. So, my first thought is to look for all schools listed as being in Manawatu and check how many of them have Year Level as 8 or below because if they go up to Year 8, that's the maximum.\n\nWait, but looking at the table provided, I don't see a specific column indicating the location of each school. Hmm, so maybe \"Manawatu\" refers to schools in certain regions or perhaps the schools are categorized by their names or locations? The table doesn't have a 'Location' column, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"Manawatu\" refers to a region where these schools are located, and I need to filter the table based on that. But since there's no explicit location data in the columns provided, maybe the claim is based on some assumption or implicit information not given here.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the Year Level column indicates the highest year they go up to. So if a school has Year Level as 8, it means students can go up to that level. The claim says only 4 schools in Manawatu have their highest year as 8 or lower.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row's Year Level and see how many of them are 8 or below, specifically for those in Manawatu. But without knowing which rows correspond to Manawatu, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the schools named with \"Manawatu\" in their name? Let me check: I don't see any school names that include \"Manawatu.\" So maybe the term is referring to all schools listed without a specific location. That doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Manawatu\" refers to a region where these schools are located, but since there's no explicit location data, I can't filter the table based on that. This makes it difficult because I don't know which rows to consider as being in Manawatu.\n\nWait, maybe the term is a misnomer or perhaps it's a test to see if I realize the lack of information. Since the table doesn't specify any location for each school, how can I verify the claim? It seems like there's insufficient data because without knowing which schools are in Manawatu, I can't count the number that go up to Year 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"Manawatu\" is a typo or misinterpretation. Let me think: If it's about all schools going up to Year 8, but the table has some schools with higher year levels, like 9-13, then only those with Year Level \u22648 would satisfy the claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nI can see that many schools have Year Level as 1-8. For example, Weber School goes up to Year 8 (Year Level: 7). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the cutoff or if it's higher. Let me check a few rows:\n\n- St Anthony's School: 6\n- St Joseph's School:5\n- Tararua College:4\n- TOTARA College:3\n- Papatawa School:7\n- Woodville School:3\n- Ponagaroa School:6\n- Ruahine School:6\n- Pahiatua School:3\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning:3\n\nWait, so these schools go up to Year 8. How many are there? Let me count:\n\n1. Weber School - 7 (goes up to Year 7 or 8?)\n2. Woodville School - 3\n3. Papatawa School -7\n4. Ponagaroa School -6\n5. Ruahine School -6\n6. Pahiatua School -3\n7. St Anthony's -6\n8. St Joseph's -5\n9. Tararua College -4\n10. TOTARA College -3\n\nWait, that's 10 schools, but only some of them have Year Level \u22648. Wait, actually, all of these go up to at least Year 3 or 4, which is way below Year 8. So maybe the claim is incorrect because there are more than 4 schools in Manawatu (if any) that go up to Year 8.\n\nBut again, without knowing which schools are in Manawatu, it's impossible to verify. The table doesn't specify locations, so I can't determine how many are in Manawatu.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"Manawatu\" refers to a specific region or area in New Zealand where these schools are located. If that's the case, and if there are only 4 such schools, then the claim would hold. But without knowing which schools are in Manawatu, I can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is a trick because the table doesn't have enough information, making the claim either false or based on incorrect data.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe \"Manawatu\" refers to all the schools listed, regardless of location. So if only 4 of them go up to Year 8, but from my earlier count, there are more than 4 (like Weber, Woodville, etc.), so that would make the claim false.\n\nBut I'm not sure because I don't know where \"Manawatu\" refers. Without knowing which schools are in Manawatu, it's impossible to verify the exact number of schools going up to Year 8. Therefore, the data provided is insufficient to confirm or deny the claim accurately.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"only 4 of the school in Manawatu go up to year 8\" cannot be verified with the given information because the table does not specify which schools are located in Manawatu. Without knowing the specific locations of each school, it's impossible to determine how many attend up to Year 8. Therefore, the claim remains unconfirmed due to insufficient data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim cannot be confirmed as the necessary location information for each school is missing from the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"At 576, the highest roll belongs to Dannevirke High School.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The number mentioned is 576. In the table provided, it seems like each row corresponds to a school with their respective rolls listed in the \"Roll\" column. So, I need to check if Dannevirke High School has a roll of exactly 576 and whether this is the highest among all schools.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and note down the school name and its roll number.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Ruahine School: Roll = 176\n2. St Anthony's School: 141\n3. St Joseph's School: 103\n4. Weber School: 64\n5. Pongaroa School: 59\n6. Papatawa School: 13\n7. Pahiatua School: 259\n8. Totara College of Accelerated Learning: 47\n9. Tararua College: 330\n10. T.K.K.M. O Tamaki Nui A Ru'a: 73\n11. Dannevirke High School: 576\n12. Woodville School: 143\n\nNow, looking for the highest roll number. The numbers go up to 576, which is indeed Dannevirke High School's roll. Let me check if any other school has a higher number than this. From the list above, all others are lower than 576. So, it seems that Dannevirke High School does have the highest roll of 576.\n\nI should also make sure I'm looking at the correct column. The claim refers to \"roll,\" which corresponds to the \"Roll\" column in the table. Each relevant cell should be identified by their row index and column name as per the instructions.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row where Dannevirke High School is located: Let's count starting from 0.\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\nRow 11 is Dannevirke High School with Roll 576. So row_index is 11, and the column is \"Roll.\"\n\nTherefore, I need to include this cell in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because Dannevirke High School has a roll of 576, which is the highest among all listed schools.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Roll\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that St Anthony's is the sole state integrated school. So, my task is to check all the schools in the table and see if any others also qualify as \"state integrate\" or \"state integrated.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one. First, I need to identify which column indicates whether a school is state integrated. Scanning the columns: there's \"state\" and \"state integrated.\" It seems like \"state integrated\" is another category.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- The first few rows have schools with \"state\" listed under their type. For example, Weber School has \"state,\" while St Joseph's has \"state integrated.\"\n- As I go down, I notice that some schools are labeled as \"state integrated.\" Specifically, there are two such entries: St Anthony's and St Joseph's.\n- Then, towards the bottom, there are a couple of schools listed with \"state integrated\" in their type. So, St Anthony's is one, but there's at least another one, St Joseph's.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the relevant rows might be:\n\nRow 18: St Anthony 's school has \"state integrated.\"\nRow 20: St Joseph 's school also has \"state integrated.\"\n\nSo both are listed as state integrated. Therefore, there are at least two schools with that designation, which means the claim that St Anthony's is the only one is false.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any others. Let me check all the rows:\n\nLooking through each row's \"state integrated\" column. \n\n- St Anthony 's: Yes\n- St Joseph 's: Yes\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning: state integrated\nWait, no, looking back at the table, maybe I misread some entries. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nRow 18: St Anthony's is \"state integrated.\"\nRow 20: St Joseph's is \"state integrated.\"\nTotara College (row 24) says \"state integrated\" as well? Or was that a typo?\n\nWait, Totara College's row says \"state integrated\"? Let me check:\n\nIn the table, Totara College of Accelerated Learning has \"state integrated.\" So that's another one. Wait no, Totara is under \"state integrated,\" yes.\n\nBut wait, in the table provided by the user, let me recount.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- St Anthony 's school (row 18): state integrated\n- St Joseph 's school (row 20): state integrated\n- Totara College (row 24): state integrated\n\nSo that's three schools.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to check if the claim \"both schools that cover year 1 to 13 be located in the pahiatua area\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that all schools offering education from Year 1 to Year 13 are situated within the Pahiatua area. So, my task is to go through each school in the table and see if they fall into this category.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes like name, years offered, location, type of school, and some additional info. I need to focus on schools that provide education from Year 1 to Year 13 because those are the ones covered by the claim.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows have schools covering Years 1-13. From the table:\n\n- Tararua College: Offers Years 9-13.\n- TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Rua: Covers Years 1-13.\n- Totara College of Accelerated Learning: Provides education from Year 1 to Year 13.\n\nWait, so only three schools in total offer education up to Year 13. Now, I need to check where these are located.\n\nTararua College is located in Pahiatua, according to the location column.\n\nTKKM o Tamaki Nui a Rua is also situated in Pahiatua.\n\nTotara College of Accelerated Learning is listed as being in Dannervik, which is different from Pahiatua. So here's a discrepancy. The claim says both schools (implying all such schools) should be in Pahiatua, but Totara is not there.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other schools offering Years 1-13 that might also not be in Pahiatua. From the table, only these three do: Tararua College, TKKM, and Totara. Since two of them are in Pahiatua but one isn't, the claim is not fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because not all relevant schools are located in Pahiatua.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to verify that all schools covering Years 1-13 are located in Pahiatua. \n\nFrom the table:\n- **Tararua College**: Located in Pahiatua (Year 9-13).\n- **TKKM o Tamaki Nui a Rua**: Located in Pahiatua (Years 1-13).\n- **Totara College of Accelerated Learning**: Located in Dannenvik, not Pahiatua (Years 1-13).\n\nSince Totara College is not in Pahiatua, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the problem. The table lists various schools and their details, including location areas. My goal is to verify if exactly five schools are listed under the \"Norsewood\" area in the table provided.\n\nI remember that the claim specifically mentions \"norsewood area,\" so I need to check each school's location column for this term. The relevant column here seems to be \"Area/School Location.\" That's where I'll focus my search.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table and note down which schools are located in Norsewood. Starting from row 0: \"pongaroa\" doesn't match. Row 1 is \"weber,\" nope. Row 2 is \"ruahine,\" not Norsewood. Row 3 is \"st anthony 's school\"\u2014no. Row 4, \"st joseph 's school\"\u2014no. Row 5: \"tararua college,\" location is \"pahiatua.\" Not matching.\n\nContinuing on, row 6 is \"tkkm o tamaki nui a rua\" with area \"dannevirke.\" Nope. Row 7: \"totara college of accelerated learning\" is also in \"dannevirke.\" Still no match. Row 8: \"weber school\" is in Weber, so not Norsewood. Row 9: \"woodville school\"\u2014nope.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are exactly five schools under the Norsewood area. Looking through each row again, I realize that none of them have \"Norsewood\" as their location. Wait, maybe I missed something.

No, actually, when I look at the table provided, the columns are Area/School Location and others, but upon reviewing each row, none have \"Norsewood\" as their location.
