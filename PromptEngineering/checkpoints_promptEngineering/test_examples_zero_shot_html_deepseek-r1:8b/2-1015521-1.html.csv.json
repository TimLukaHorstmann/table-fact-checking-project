    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be currently 12 t - 260 eu aircraft in service\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and the columns: aircraft, origin, type, versions, in service. The claim mentions a specific version of an aircraft, so I should focus on the \"aircraft\" column to find any that match \"t - 260 eu\".\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Cessna A-37 Dragonfly \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 1: FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1 \u2013 no.\nRow 2: Lockheed C-130 Hercules \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante \u2013 no.\nRow 4: Beechcraft Twin Bonanza \u2013 not matching.\nRow 5: Casa C-212 Aviso \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 6: Embraer EMB 120 Bras\u00edlia \u2013 no.\nRow 7: Cessna 206 Stationair \u2013 no.\nRow 8: Beechcraft B58 Baron \u2013 no.\nRow 9: British Aerospace 125 \u2013 not matching.\nRow 10: Aermacchi SF260 \u2013 this seems to match because the aircraft is \"Aermacchi sf260\" and the version is \"t - 260 eu\". \nWait, but looking at row 10, the \"versions\" column has \"t - 260 eu\". So that's a match.\nRow 11: Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer \u2013 not matching.\nRow 12: Cessna T-41 Mescalero \u2013 nope.\nRow 13: Aerospatiale AS 365 Dauphin \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 14: Bell 212 Twin Huey \u2013 no.\nRow 15: Bell UH-1 Iroquois \u2013 not matching.\n\nSo only row 10 has the aircraft type \"Aermacchi sf260\" with version \"t - 260 eu\". The \"in service\" column for this row says \"12\".\n\nNow, the claim is about having 12 t-260 eu in service. Looking at row 10, it does mention \"t - 260 eu\" and has a count of 12. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows that might have \"t - 260 eu\". Let me scan again quickly. No, only row 10 matches both the aircraft type and version specified in the claim.\n\nSo, based on this, the relevant cell is row_index 10 and column_name \"versions\", because that's where the \"t - 260 eu\" is mentioned, which matches the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I identified the relevant row and column where \"t - 260 eu\" is listed as the version with 12 in service.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"versions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 3 C - 95 aircraft of Brazilian origin currently in service\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there are exactly three C-95 aircraft from Brazil that are currently in service. So my task is to check if the table supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different aircraft with various attributes: origin, type, versions, and whether they're in service. The relevant columns for this claim would be the ones that specify the aircraft's type, origin, and current service status.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find any mention of C-95 and Brazil as the origin. Let me go row by row:\n\n1. The first row is about the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, origin United States. Not relevant.\n2. Next is FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1n, origin Argentina. Also not relevant.\n3. Lockheed C-130 Hercules from the US. No match.\n4. Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante from Brazil. The type is transport/utility, and versions are C-95. Wait, that's interesting because C-95 is part of their version list. So I should note this row for further checking.\n\nLooking at column \"versions,\" the Embraer Bandeirante has \"c - 95\" listed. Since Brazil is the origin, this might be a candidate for the claim.\n\nContinuing through the rest of the rows:\n\n5. Beechcraft Twin Bonanza from the US.\n6. Casa C-212 Aviocar from Spain.\n7. Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia from Brazil. Type is transport, but no C-95 listed in versions.\n8. Cessna 206 Stationair from the US.\n9. Beechcraft B58 Baron from the US.\n10. British Aerospace 125 from the UK.\n11. Aermacchi SF260 from Italy.\n12. Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer from Switzerland.\n13. Cessna T-41 Mescalero from the US.\n14. Aerospatiale AS 365 Dauphin from France.\n15. Bell 212 Twin Huey from the US.\n16. Bell UH-1 Iroquois from the US.\n\nSo, only one row seems relevant: the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante. Let me check its service status. The \"in service\" column shows 3. So it's currently in service with 3 instances (as noted in the parenthesis: 3). Wait, but the claim says there are 3 C-95s from Brazil in service.\n\nIn the table, for this row, the versions include \"c - 95.\" However, I'm a bit confused because sometimes model names can be similar or have different designations. The Embraer Bandeirante's version is listed as \"c - 95,\" which might correspond to the C-95 model.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't explicitly list the type column for this row. Let me check: under the \"type\" column, it says \"transport / utility.\" So does that align with the claim? The claim refers to \"C-95\" specifically, but perhaps in the context of the table, the versions include C-95, so that could be considered as part of their service.\n\nNow, considering that there is exactly one row where the origin is Brazil and the versions include C-95, and the service count is 3. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should ensure that the \"C-95\" in this context refers to the same model as the claim. Since the claim specifies \"C-95,\" which might be a specific variant or model number. In the table, it's listed under \"versions,\" so perhaps each instance of C-95 is considered an aircraft.\n\nTherefore, since there's one row with origin Brazil, versions including C-95, and in service status showing 3, that seems to support the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other rows have C-95 from Brazil. Scanning again, only the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante has a version of C-95 and is from Brazil with 3 in service. So no other entries match both origin and aircraft type specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one relevant row in the table, where the origin is Brazilian, the versions include C-95, and it's currently in service with 3 instances. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"versions\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"origin\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"With 2 in service by the US, the Beechcraft represent the B58 model aircraft.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: aircraft, origin, type, versions, and in service. My goal is to find any cells that might support or contradict the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Beechcraft\" and specifically the \"B58 model.\" So I need to locate the row where the aircraft is Beechcraft B58 and see what the \"in service\" column says for that row.\n\nLooking through each row, I spot a row where the aircraft is \"beechcraft b58 baron.\" The origin is United States, type is trainer / liaison, versions are B - 58, and in service is 2. This seems to match the claim's mention of 2 in service by the US.\n\nI should check if there's any other Beechcraft model that might confuse the matter, but skimming through the rest, I don't see another B58 except for this one. The other Beechcrafts are Twin Bonanza and Baron, which have different models (D50 and B - 58 respectively), but they aren't the same as B58.\n\nSo the relevant cell is the one with \"Beechcraft b58 baron\" in row 8 (since it's zero-indexed, that would be row_index 8) under the column \"aircraft.\" This directly supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data for the Beechcraft B58 Baron aircraft with 2 in service by the US.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 3 C - 95 Brazilian aircraft currently in service\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"C-95 Brazilian aircraft.\" So, I'm looking for any rows in the table where the aircraft model is C-95 and the origin is Brazil.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check for these specific values. \n\nStarting from the top:\n1. The first row has a Cessna A-37 Dragonfly from the United States.\n2. The second row is an FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1 from Argentina.\n3. Third row: Lockheed C-130 Hercules from the US.\n4. Fourth row: Embraer Emb 110 Bandairente from Brazil. Hmm, but the type is transport/utility and the versions column says \"C - 95.\" Wait, that's important.\n5. Next, Beechcraft Twin Bonanza from the US.\n6. Casa C-212 Aviso from Spain.\n7. Embraer EMB 120 Bras\u00edlia from Brazil. Its version is EMB 120.\n8. Cessna 206 Stationair from the US.\n9. Beechcraft B58 Baron from the US.\n10. British Aerospace 125 from the UK.\n11. Aermacchi SF260 from Italy.\n12. Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer from Switzerland.\n13. Cessna T-41 Mescalero from the US.\n14. Aerospatiale AS 365 Dauphin from France.\n15. Bell 212 from the US.\n16. Bell UH-1 Iroquois from the US.\n\nWait, so only two rows have Brazil as origin: row 4 (Emb 110 Bandairente) and row 6 (Casa C-212). But in row 4, the versions column is \"C - 95,\" which seems to match the claim. However, looking at the \"in service\" column for that row, it says 3.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is in row 4, column \"versions,\" and \"in service.\" Because the claim is about C-95 Brazilian aircraft currently in service, we need to see if there are exactly three in service. According to the table, yes, it's 3.\n\nNow, I should check all other rows with Brazil as origin to ensure no others match C-95. The other Brazilian row is row 6: Casa C-212 Aviso, which has versions \"C - 212 - 200,\" so that doesn't match C-95.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant cells are row 4, columns versions and in service.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks for C-95 aircraft from Brazil. In the table, only one such aircraft exists with 3 in service.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"versions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"in service\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"Bell Uh-1 Iroquois be the version of B-58 aircraft model originate in the United State which have 2 in service.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check against the table.\n\n1. **Aircraft Type**: The claim mentions \"Bell Uh-1 Iroquois.\" So I need to look for this exact entry in the table's 'aircraft' column.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n- The first row is Cessna A-37 Dragonfly.\n- Second: FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1.\n- Third: Lockheed C-130 Hercules.\n- Fourth: Embraer Emb 110 Bandeirante.\n- Fifth: Beechcraft Twin Bonanza.\n- Sixth: Casa C-212 Aviocar.\n- Seventh: Embraer Emb 120 Brasilia.\n- Eighth: Cessna 206 Stationair.\n- Ninth: Beechcraft B58 Baron.\n- Tenth: British Aerospace 125.\n- Eleventh: Aermacchi SF260.\n- Twelfth: Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer.\n- Thirteenth: Cessna T-41 Mescalero.\n- Fourteenth: Aerospatiale AS 365 Dauphin.\n- Fifteenth: Bell 212 Twin Huey.\n- Sixteenth: Bell Uh-1 Iroquois.\n\nYes, the 16th row lists \"Bell uh - 1 iroquois\" as the aircraft. So that's a match for the first part of the claim.\n\n2. **Version**: The claim refers to \"B-58 aircraft model.\" But looking at the table, in the 'aircraft' column, I see \"Beechcraft B58 Baron\" on row 9 and \"Bell uh - 1 iroquois\" on row 16. Wait, the claim says \"version of B-58,\" but in the table, the only relevant model is Beechcraft's B58 Baron. However, the Bell Uh-1 Iroquois is a different aircraft altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion here. The claim might be mixing up models. The B58 Baron is a Beechcraft model, not Bell. So the claim says that the Bell Uh-1 is a version of the B58, which isn't correct because they're different manufacturers and models.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The table lists \"Beechcraft b58 baron\" as one of the aircrafts, but it's separate from the Bell Uh-1 Iroquois. So the claim is incorrect in stating that Bell Uh-1 is a version of B58.\n\n3. **Origin**: The claim says the aircraft originates in the United States. Looking at the table, all entries for \"Bell uh - 1 iroquois\" are under 'origin' as \"united states.\" So that's correct.\n\n4. **In Service**: The claim mentions \"have 2 in service.\" Checking the table cell for \"Bell uh - 1 iroquois,\" it says \"2\" (with a note \"(13 delivered)\"). Wait, no: row 16 shows \"in service\" as \"13.\" Hmm, but the claim says 2. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, I need to check again. The table has two Bell entries:\n- Row 15: Bell 212 Twin Huey with 4 in service.\n- Row 16: Bell Uh-1 Iroquois with 13 in service.\n\nThe claim refers to the Uh-1 Iroquois having 2 in service, but according to the table, it's 13. That contradicts the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The user wrote the claim as \"have 2 in service,\" so looking at the table for Bell Uh-1, it's row 16 with in_service: 13. So that doesn't match.\n\nSo there are two issues here:\n- The Bell Uh-1 is not a version of B58; it's a different model.\n- The number of in service units for Uh-1 is 13, not 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two incorrect parts.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the columns:\n\nThe relevant columns are:\n- aircraft\n- origin\n- in_service\n\nSo for \"Bell uh - 1 iroquois\" (row 16), origin is correct as United States, but in_service is 13, not 2.\n\nAlso, it's not a version of B58; the B58 Baron is another Beechcraft model. Therefore, the claim incorrectly states that Bell Uh-1 is a version of B58 and that it has only 2 in service when it actually has 13.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect on both points: origin (which is correct) but also the version part and in_service count.\n\nWait, no: the claim says \"originate in the United State,\" which is correct. But the other parts are wrong. So overall, since some aspects of the claim are correct but others are not, does that make the entire claim false?\n\nYes, because the claim makes two incorrect statements about the Bell Uh-1 Iroquois: it incorrectly states that it's a version of B58 and that only 2 are in service when actually 13 are. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"origin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"in_service\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"origin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"in_service\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's about Brazil having both transport/utility and attack type aircraft in their inventory.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an aircraft with its details, including origin, which for some rows is Brazil. My task is to check if there are Brazilian aircraft that fall into both categories: transport/utility and attack.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row where the origin is Brazil.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells in the process.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"there be 12 t - 260 eu aircraft currently in service that originate from switzerland.\" So, we're looking for 12 planes of type \"t - 260 eu\" from Switzerland that are in service.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: aircraft, origin, type, versions, and in service. The relevant data points here are the 'aircraft' name, the 'origin', the 'type', and the number of 'in service'.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to find any that match all three criteria specified by the claim.\n\n1. **Aircraft Type**: The type must be \"t - 260 eu\".\n2. **Origin**: It should come from Switzerland.\n3. **In Service Count**: There should be exactly 12 in service.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, origin USA, type attack/fighter, versions A-37b, in service 12 (16 delivered). Doesn't match the type or origin.\n  \n- **Row 1**: FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1ngano, origin Argentina, type attack, version A-58. Not matching.\n\n- **Row 2**: Lockheed C-130 Hercules, USA origin, transport/utility, C-130b, in service 2. Not matching.\n\n- **Row 3**: Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, Brazil, transport/utility, C-95, in service 3. No match.\n\n- **Row 4**: Beechcraft Twin Bonanza, USA, transport/utility, D50, in service 1. Doesn't fit.\n\n- **Row 5**: Casa C-212 Aviocar, Spain, transport, C-212-200, in service 2. Not matching.\n\n- **Row 6**: Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, Brazil, transport, EMB 120, in service 1. Doesn't fit.\n\n- **Row 7**: Cessna 206 Stationair, USA, utility/liaison, U206H, in service 10. Not matching.\n\n- **Row 8**: Beechcraft B58 Baron, USA, trainer/liaison, B-58, in service 2. Doesn't fit.\n\n- **Row 9**: British Aerospace 125, UK, VIP transport, 700A/600A, in service 2. Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 10**: Aermacchi SF260, Italy, trainer, T-260 EU, in service 12 (from Italy). The origin is Italy, not Switzerland, so no match.\n\n- **Row 11**: Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer, Switzerland, trainer, -92. Type doesn't match \"t - 260 eu\", though it's from Switzerland, but the type is different.\n\n- **Row 12**: Cessna T-41 Mescalero, USA, trainer, T-41D, in service 7. Doesn't fit.\n\n- **Row 13**: Aerospatiale AS 365 Dauphin, France, liaison/transport, AS 365, in service 1. Not matching.\n\n- **Row 14**: Bell 212 Twin Huey, USA, transport/utility, Bell 212, in service 4. Doesn't fit.\n\n- **Row 15**: Bell UH-1 Iroquois, USA, transport/utility, uh-1h, in service 13. Not relevant.\n\nNow, looking through all the rows, none of them have an aircraft type \"t - 260 eu\" that's from Switzerland. There is a row (row 10) where Aermacchi SF260 with T-260 EU is listed, but it's from Italy, not Switzerland. So no match there.\n\nTherefore, the claim made is FALSE because there are no 12 t-260 eu aircraft from Switzerland in service according to the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are 12 \"t - 260 eu\" aircraft from Switzerland in service. After examining each row, none meet all three criteria: type, origin, and in-service count.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the aircraft bell 212 twin huey be a trainer type",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the aircraft bell 212 twin huey be a trainer type\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two things: the aircraft in question is the Bell 212 Twin Huey, and its type is a trainer. So, I need to check if there's an entry in the table for the Bell 212 that categorizes it as a trainer.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows, each representing different aircraft with their details. I'll start by searching for \"Bell 212\" because that's the specific aircraft mentioned in the claim.\n\nSkimming through the 'aircraft' column: the rows have entries like Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, FMA IA-58 Pucar\u00e1, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, Beechcraft Twin Bonanza, Casa C-212 Aviocar, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, Cessna 206 Stationair, Beechcraft B58 Baron, British Aerospace 125, Aermacchi SF260, Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer, Cessna T-41 Mescalero, Aerospatiale AS 365 Dauphin, Bell 212 Twin Huey, and Bell UH-1 Iroquois.\n\nFound two entries for Bell: the Bell 212 Twin Huey and the Bell UH-1 Iroquois. Let me check both.\n\nStarting with the Bell 212 Twin Huey row:\n- Aircraft: Bell 212 Twin Huey\n- Origin: United States\n- Type: Transport / Utility\n- Versions: Bell 212\n- In Service: 4\n\nSo, the type for this aircraft is listed as \"Transport / Utility.\" Now, looking at the claim again, it says that the Bell 212 Twin Huey is a trainer type. But according to the table, its primary type is Transport/Utility, not Trainer.\n\nNext, checking the Bell UH-1 Iroquois row:\n- Aircraft: Bell uh - 1 iroquois\n- Origin: United States\n- Type: transport / utility\n- Versions: uh - 1h\n- In Service: 13\n\nThis one is also Transport/Utility. So, both Bell models in the table are categorized under Transport/Utility, not Trainer.\n\nNow, looking back at the claim: it's specifically about the Bell 212 Twin Huey being a trainer type. Since the table shows its type as Transport/Utility, this doesn't align with the claim that it's a trainer. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other columns might affect this conclusion. The 'versions' column for the Bell 212 lists \"bell 212,\" but that doesn't change the type classification. So, there are no relevant cells beyond what I've checked to support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
