    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"October 27, 1963 be the date of the game against Houston Oiler\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row represents a different week with details about the game played that week.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two things: the date (October 27, 1963) and the opponent (Houston Oiler). I need to check if there's a game on October 27 against Houston Oiler in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n- Week 1 through Week 12 cover September and early October. Week 13 is December 15, and Week 14 is December 22. So, Weeks 13 and 14 are in December, which is after October 27.\n\nWait, but I should check all the rows to see if any match the date and opponent specified.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: September 8 vs Buffalo Bills \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 2: September 14 vs Boston Patriots \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: September 29 vs Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 no.\nRow 4: October 6 vs Denver Broncos \u2013 not the opponent and date is early October.\nRow 5: October 13 vs New York Jets \u2013 not Houston Oiler.\nRow 6: October 20 vs Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 nope.\nRow 7: October 27 vs Oakland Raiders \u2013 opponent is Raiders, not Oilers. Date matches but opponent doesn't.\nRow 8: November 2 vs New York Jets \u2013 wrong date and opponent.\nRow 9: November 10 vs Boston Patriots \u2013 no match.\nRow 10: November 17 vs Buffalo Bills \u2013 nope.\nRow 11: December 1 vs Houston Oil ers (Notice it's spelled \"Oil ers\" here). Wait, the claim says \"Houston Oiler\". Is that a typo? Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at row 11, the opponent is listed as \"houston oilers\", which I think is actually \"Houston Oilers\". So if the claim says \"Houston Oiler,\" maybe it's a typo, but perhaps they meant \"Oilers.\" But in any case, let's see the date for row 11: December 1. That doesn't match October 27.\n\nRow 12: December 8 vs Oakland Raiders \u2013 nope.\nRow 13: December 15 vs Houston Oil ers (again, same as before). Date is December 15, which isn't October 27.\nRow 14: December 22 vs Denver Broncos \u2013 not relevant.\n\nSo looking through all the rows, none of them have both the date October 27 and opponent Houston Oiler. The closest is row 7 where the opponent is Oakland Raiders on October 27, but that's not Houston Oilers.\n\nWait, I also noticed that in some rows, like row 11, it says \"houston oilers\" with a typo as \"Oil ers.\" Maybe the correct term is \"Oilers,\" so perhaps the claim has a typo. But regardless, the opponent in the table doesn't list any game against Houston Oilers on October 27.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the weeks, week 7 is October 27 against Oakland Raiders, which is row 7 of the table. So that's not the same as the claim.\n\nTherefore, there's no game on October 27 against Houston Oiler in the provided table. The closest is a different opponent and date. So the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"October 27, 1963 be the date of the game against Houston Oiler\" is true, I analyzed each row of the table for matching both the date and opponent.\n\n1. **Date Check**: October 27, 1963 was not found in any row.\n2. **Opponent Check**: None of the games on October 27 were against Houston Oilers; instead, the game that week was against Oakland Raiders.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there's no such game in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
