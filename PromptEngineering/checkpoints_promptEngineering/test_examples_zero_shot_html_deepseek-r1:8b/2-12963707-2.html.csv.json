    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"mikhail mamistov have a perfection percentage of 77.96\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: rank, name, nationality, score, and perfection. Each row represents a different person with their respective statistics.\n\nThe claim mentions \"mikhail mamistov,\" so my first task is to find the row corresponding to this name in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see:\n\n1. svetlana kapanina\n2. viktor chmal\n3. mikhail mamistov\n4. elena klimovich\n5. oleg shpolyanskiy\n6. castor fantoba\n7. fran\u00e3\u00a7ois le vot\n8. svetlana fedorenko\n9. pierre marmy\n\nSo, \"mikhail mamistov\" is in row 3.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'perfection' percentage for this person. Looking at column 'perfection' in row 3, it says 77.96%. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nWait a second, the claim has the number as 77.96, and the table also shows 77.96% for mikhail mamistov. There's no discrepancy here. The rank is 3, which isn't directly mentioned in the claim, but the name and perfection percentage are what's being checked.\n\nI don't see any other relevant columns that pertain to this claim. So, the relevant cells would be row 3 (index 2 if starting from 0) for column 'perfection'.\n\nTherefore, since the data fully supports the claim, the answer should be \"TRUE\" with the relevant cell pointing to the 'perfection' column in row 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"perfection\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"svetlana fedorenko be rank 8\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: rank, name, nationality, score, and perfection. Each row represents a different person with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Svetlana Fedorenko being ranked 8. So, my first thought is to locate her in the table. I'll go through each row's 'name' column to find her. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 1: Svetlana Kapanina\n- Row 2: Viktor Chmal\n- Row 3: Mikhail Mamistov\n- Row 4: Elena Kl\u00edmovich\n- Row 5: Oleg Shpolyanskiy\n- Row 6: Castor Fantoba\n- Row 7: Fran\u00e7ois Le Vot\n- Row 8: Svetlana Fedorenko\n- Row 9: Pierre Marmy\n\nYes, she's in row 8. Now, I need to check the 'rank' column for that row. The rank is '8'. So, her rank is indeed 8.\n\nAdditionally, I should verify if there are any other columns related to this claim. The claim only mentions the rank, so I don't need to look into nationality or score unless it's part of verifying her identity, but in this case, the key information is the rank.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the 'rank' column for row 8 and possibly the 'name' column if needed to confirm her identity. However, since the claim is about her rank, the primary relevant cell is the 'rank' column of row 8.\n\nI think that's all I need. Svetlana Fedorenko is indeed ranked 8 in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"svetlana fedorenko be rank 8,\" we first locate her entry in the table by searching for her name in the 'name' column. She appears in row 8. We then check the 'rank' column for that row, which is '8'. This confirms the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"mikhail mamistov have a perfection percentage of 75.58\".\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find Mikhail Mamistov. Scanning each row's 'name' column:\n\n1. Svetlana Kapanina - not him.\n2. Viktor Chmal - nope.\n3. Mikhail Mamistov - yes, this is our guy.\n\nNow, focusing on his data: he's ranked 3rd, nationality Russian, score 9'355, and perfection 77.96%. \n\nThe claim mentions a perfection percentage of 75.58. I check if this number appears anywhere for Mikhail. His perfection is listed as 77.96%, which doesn't match 75.58%.\n\nSo, the claim isn't supported by the table data. Therefore, it's false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"perfection\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"pierre marmy have a perfection percentage of 73.24\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row where the name \"pierre marmy\" appears. Scanning each row:\n\n1. The first few rows are for svetlana kapanina, viktor chmal, etc., but none match.\n2. Moving down, row 6 has castor fantoba, which isn't Pierre.\n3. Row 7 is fran\u00e3\u00a7ois le vot, not Pierre either.\n4. Then I see row 9: the name is pierre marmy.\n\nSo, Pierre Marmy is in row index 9 of the table. Now, checking his perfection score. The column for perfection is the fifth one, labeled \"perfection\".\n\nLooking at row 9, the fifth cell is \"73.24%\". This matches exactly with the claim's percentage.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. There are no discrepancies or missing information that would cause the claim to be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"perfection\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "svetlana fedorenko rank greater than 8",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"svetlana fedorenko rank greater than 8\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the name mentioned in the claim is \"svetlana fedorenko.\" Looking at the table, I see a few entries with this name. The first row where her name appears is row index 7 (since indexing starts from 0, but looking at the HTML, it seems rows are numbered starting from 1 as per the 'rank' column). Wait, in the table provided, each row has a rank like 1,2,3... So for \"svetlana fedorenko,\" her rank is listed as 8.\n\nThe claim says her rank is greater than 8. But looking at the data, her rank is exactly 8. So comparing 8 to \"greater than 8\" would mean it's false because 8 is not greater than itself.\n\nNow, I need to find which cells are relevant for this check. The 'rank' column is important here because that's where the numerical value is. So the relevant cell would be the one in the row where her name appears and the 'rank' column.\n\nLooking at the table, \"svetlana fedorenko\" is in row 7 (assuming rows are numbered from 1 to 9 based on rank). Wait, actually, looking back, the HTML shows the first row as rank 1, so each subsequent tr increases by one. So row 0 would be rank 1, but in the table's context, it's more natural to consider row indices starting at 1. However, for the purpose of this task, I think we need to map the rows based on their position in the HTML.\n\nWait, no, the user didn't specify whether row_index starts at 0 or 1. In programming, often it starts at 0, but in tables, sometimes they start at 1. The example provided by the user had the first row as index 0, so I think we should follow that. So \"svetlana fedorenko\" is in row 7 (since the 8th tr, which is 0-indexed, would be 7). Wait, let me count:\n\nLooking at the tbody, each tr is a row. The first tr after thead is rank 1 (row index 0), then rank 2 (index 1), and so on up to rank 9 as the last tr (index 8). So \"svetlana fedorenko\" is in the 7th position from 0, which would be row index 7.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- The 'rank' column for her, which is 8.\n- Her name cell to identify which row's rank we're checking.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"svetlana fedorenko\" specifically. So I need to find all cells related to her and the rank. That means finding the row where both her name and rank are present. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. The 'rank' cell for \"svetlana fedorenko\", which is 8.\n2. Her name cell in that same row.\n\nSo I should extract both these pieces of information to verify the claim.\n\nBut since the claim states her rank is greater than 8 and it's exactly 8, the answer would be false.\n\nNow, regarding the JSON structure, I need to list the relevant cells as per their column names. The 'rank' column is where the numerical value is, and the 'name' column identifies which person we're checking.\n\nSo the relevant_cells array will have two entries: one for 'rank' in row 7, and another for 'name' in row 7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"svetlana fedorenko\" has a rank greater than 8. Looking at the table, her rank is exactly 8, which does not satisfy the condition of being greater than 8.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
