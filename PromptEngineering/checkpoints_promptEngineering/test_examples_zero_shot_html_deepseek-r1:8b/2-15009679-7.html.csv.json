    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"cruzeiro do less well in the recopa sudamericana 1993 than s\u00e3o paulo do\". \n\nFirst, I should figure out which parts of this claim are relevant to the data in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: Cruzeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. It talks about their performance in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993. So, I need to look at the row for Cruzeiro and see how they did in that specific competition compared to S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nLooking at the table, each team's row has several columns related to different tournaments. The relevant column here is \"recopa sudamericana 1993\". \n\nSo, I should identify the cells related to Cruzeiro in this column and compare it to S\u00e3o Paulo's performance in the same tournament.\n\nFrom the table:\n- For Cruzeiro (row index 4), under recopa sudamericana 1993, it says \"runner - up\".\n- For S\u00e3o Paulo (row index 7), under recopa sudamericana 1993, it also says \"champions\".\n\nNow, the claim is that Cruzeiro did less well than S\u00e3o Paulo in this tournament. So, if \"less well\" implies a worse performance, I need to see which result is better. Typically, being a champion is better than being a runner-up.\n\nTherefore, S\u00e3o Paulo performed better (champions) compared to Cruzeiro (runner-up). This means that Cruzeiro did less well than S\u00e3o Paulo in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993, making the claim TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Cruzeiro's performance in recopa sudamericana 1993.\n- S\u00e3o Paulo's performance in the same tournament.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as Cruzeiro was a runner-up and S\u00e3o Paulo was champions in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"flamengo do not reach the final of any tournament\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Flamengo did not reach the final in any tournament listed in the table for 1993. So, my job is to check all relevant tournaments and see if Flamengo made it to the finals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team, and each column corresponds to a different tournament. The columns are: Copa Libertadores 1993, Supercopa Sudamericana 1993, Copa Conmebol 1993, Recopa Sudamericana 1993, and Intercontinental Cup 1993.\n\nSince the claim is about reaching the final, I need to identify which of these tournaments have a final or a playoff structure where reaching that stage would mean making it to the final. For example, in some tournaments, reaching the semifinals might not be considered reaching the final, but in others, like Copa Libertadores, the final is the last stage.\n\nI'll go through each relevant column and see what Flamengo's performance was in 1993.\n\nStarting with the first column, Copa Libertadores 1993: Looking at the row for Flamengo, it says they reached the quarterfinals. So, that means they didn't make it past the quarters, so definitely not the final.\n\nNext is Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Again, checking Flamengo's entry here, it says \"runner - up.\" Runner-up implies they lost in the final, which means they did reach the final of this tournament. That directly contradicts the claim that they didn't reach the final of any tournament.\n\nEven if I check the other columns for completeness:\n\nCopa Conmebol 1993: Flamengo did not qualify.\nRecopa Sudamericana 1993: Not applicable as they didn't qualify.\nIntercontinental Cup 1993: Not applicable either.\n\nSo, in the Supercopa Sudamericana, Flamengo reached the final (lost as runner-up). That's sufficient to say the claim is false because they did reach at least one final in the given tournaments.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells. The relevant columns are \"supercopa sudamericana 1993\" and \"copa libertadores 1993.\" Wait, no\u2014since the claim is about reaching any final, only the Supercopa Sudamericana is relevant here because that's where they reached the final.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the Copa Libertadores 1993 column shows Flamengo reached the quarterfinals, which isn't a final. The Supercopa Sudamericana shows runner-up, which is effectively losing in the final. So, only the Supercopa Sudamericana is relevant.\n\nTherefore, I need to mark both the row for Flamengo and the specific column as relevant cells because that's where their final appearance is noted.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Flamengo reached the final (runner-up) of the Supercopa Sudamericana 1993.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"supercopa sudamericana 1993\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim says: \"santos did not qualify for as many tournament as cruzeiro do.\" So, I should check how many tournaments both Santos and Cruzeiro qualified for.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns in the table. The columns related to qualification are 'copa libertadores 1993', 'supercopa sudamericana 1993', 'copa conmebol 1993', 'recopa sudamericana 1993', and 'intercontinental cup 1993'. Each of these represents a different tournament.\n\nLooking at Cruzeiro's row, I see their qualifications:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: did not qualify\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: quarterfinals (so they qualified)\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: did not qualify\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: runner-up (qualified)\n- Intercontinental Cup 1993: n/a, which I think means they didn't participate.\n\nSo Cruzeiro qualified for 2 tournaments in 1993: Supercopa Sudamericana and Recopa Sudamericana.\n\nNow, checking Santos:\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: did not qualify\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: round of 16 (so they qualified)\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: did not qualify\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: n/a\n- Intercontinental Cup 1993: n/a\n\nSantos qualified for only 1 tournament in 1993, which is the Supercopa Sudamericana.\n\nThe claim says Santos didn't qualify for as many tournaments as Cruzeiro.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various Brazilian football teams and their performances in different competitions during 1993. The relevant columns for this claim are \"intercontinental cup 1993.\" So I need to check which teams participated in that particular competition.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: intercontinental cup status is 'n / a' (not applicable). So they didn't play.\n- Botafogo: same as above, 'n / a'. No participation.\n- Bragantino: Also 'n / a'.\n- Cruzeiro: 'n / a'.\n- Flamengo: 'n / a'.\n- Fluminense: 'n / a'.\n- Gr\u00eamio: 'n / a'.\n- Internacional: They have 'group stage,' which means they participated and reached the group stage. So this is one team that played.\n- Santos: 'n / a', so no.\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 'champions.' Wait, champions of what? The column header is \"intercontinental cup 1993.\" So if their status there is 'champions,' does that mean they participated and won it? Or did they only win another competition?\n- Vasco: Again, 'n / a', so no participation.\n\nWait, but S\u00e3o Paulo has the intercontinental cup status as 'champions.' That suggests they won the competition. But does winning mean they played in it? I think yes because to win, you have to be in the competition and reach the final. So if they are champions, that implies they participated and won. So that's another team.\n\nSo far, we've identified two teams: Internacional (group stage) and S\u00e3o Paulo (champions). Both participated, meaning at least two teams played in the intercontinental cup 1993.\n\nThat means the claim \"only 1 team play in the intercontinental cup\" is false because there were at least two teams involved.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if only one team played in the Intercontinental Cup, I examined the table's \"intercontinental cup 1993\" column. Both Internacional and S\u00e3o Paulo participated, with the latter winning.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's about Cruzeiro being champions over S\u00e3o Paulo in the Recopa Sudamericana of 1993. So, I need to check if Cruzeiro won that tournament and if they were indeed the champions against S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team, and there are several columns related to different tournaments. The relevant column here is \"recopa sudamericana 1993\". So, I should focus on this column for both Cruzeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nLet me find their rows in the table. For Cruzeiro, the row is near the middle of the table, maybe around row index 8 or so (but actually looking at the given data, it's row 7). In that row, under \"recopa sudamericana 1993\", the entry is \"runner - up\". So, Cruzeiro didn't win the Recopa Sudamericana; they lost.\n\nNow, checking S\u00e3o Paulo's row. It's near the bottom, maybe around row index 9 or 10 (but in the provided data, it's row 10). In that same column, \"recopa sudamericana 1993\", the entry is \"champions\". So, S\u00e3o Paulo won the Recopa Sudamericana.\n\nThe claim says Cruzeiro was the champion over S\u00e3o Paulo. But according to the table, Cruzeiro only reached the runner-up position, while S\u00e3o Paulo was the actual champion. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\". The relevant cells are the rows for both Cruzeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo in the \"recopa sudamericana 1993\" column because they directly show who won each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Cruzeiro was a runner-up, not the champion, in the Recopa Sudamericana 1993, while S\u00e3o Paulo won that tournament.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"8 teams fail to qualify for the Copa Libertadores\" is true based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that eight teams did not qualify for the Copa Libertadores in 1993. Looking at the table, the Copa Libertadores 1993 column seems relevant here. My first step is to identify which cells in this column indicate that a team did not qualify.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: Did not qualify.\n2. Botafogo: Did not qualify.\n3. Bragantino: Did not qualify.\n4. Cruzeiro: Did not qualify.\n5. Flamengo: Did not qualify.\n6. Fluminense: Did not qualify.\n7. Gr\u00eamio: Did not qualify.\n8. Internacional: Group stage. Wait, \"group stage\" might mean they qualified but didn't make it further, so this isn't a failure to qualify. They actually participated, just didn't advance past the group stage.\n\nSo, up until Internacional, that's 7 teams that did not qualify. Then we have:\n\n9. Santos: Did not qualify.\n10. S\u00e3o Paulo: Champions. So they qualified and won, so they did qualify.\n11. Vasco: Did not qualify.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 8 teams failing to qualify. From the list above, excluding Internacional and S\u00e3o Paulo, that's 11 teams who didn't qualify. But the Copa Libertadores typically has more teams participating, so maybe not all of these 11 are considered \"failures\" in the sense of not qualifying at all.\n\nBut wait, the table shows that for each team, whether they qualified or not is indicated. So, if a team didn't make it to the knockout stage, like group stage exit, some might still consider them as having not qualified for the competition's main stages.\n\nHowever, the Copa Libertadores has a structure where teams are grouped into groups, and only the top teams advance. So, being in the group stage but not advancing isn't exactly \"failing to qualify\"; they did qualify but didn't proceed further. So, perhaps only those marked as \"did not qualify\" truly failed to make it.\n\nLet me count how many teams have \"did not qualify\" in the Copa Libertadores 1993 column:\n\n1. Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro\n2. Botafogo\n3. Bragantino\n4. Cruzeiro\n5. Flamengo\n6. Fluminense\n7. Gr\u00eamio\n8. Internacional (Wait, no, Internacional's status is \"group stage,\" not \"did not qualify.\")\n9. Santos\n10. Vasco\n\nWait, that's 10 teams marked as \"did not qualify.\" So the claim says 8 teams failed. Therefore, based on the table, more than 8 teams did not qualify for Copa Libertadores 1993.\n\nBut I might be misunderstanding the structure. Maybe some of these teams didn't qualify at all, meaning they weren't invited or couldn't participate. For example, if a team is marked as \"did not qualify,\" it could mean they weren't in the tournament, whereas \"group stage\" means they were but didn't advance.\n\nSo, let's count only those that say \"did not qualify\":\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: 1\n- Botafogo: 2\n- Bragantino: 3\n- Cruzeiro: 4\n- Flamengo: 5\n- Fluminense: 6\n- Gr\u00eamio: 7\n- Internacional: Not \"did not qualify,\" so not counted.\n- Santos: 8\n- Vasco: 9\n\nWait, that's 9 teams. So the table shows that 9 teams did not qualify for Copa Libertadores in 1993. Therefore, the claim of 8 teams failing to qualify is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\n1. Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro\n2. Botafogo\n3. Bragantino\n4. Cruzeiro\n5. Flamengo\n6. Fluminense\n7. Gr\u00eamio\n8. Santos\n9. Vasco\n\nYes, that's 9 teams. So the claim is FALSE because it states 8 teams failed, but actually, there were more than 8.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"8 team fail to qualify for the Copa Libertadores\" is true, we analyze the relevant cells in the table.\n\n- **Relevant Column**: Copa Libertadores 1993\n- **Teams with 'did not qualify'**: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, Botafogo, Bragantino, Cruzeiro, Flamengo, Fluminense, Gr\u00eamio, Santos, Vasco (9 teams)\n\nSince there are 9 teams that did not qualify, the claim of 8 teams is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 0,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 4,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 6,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 7,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 8,\n        \"column_name\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"\n    }\n]\n```",

For each competition, the table shows where the team got eliminated or their status in that year's tournament.\n\nSo first, I'll look for the row where the team is \"flamengo.\" Scanning through, I see it's at row index 5 (since rows start from 0). Now, let's check each column under flamengo:\n\n1. Copa Libertadores 1993: The status says \"quarterfinals.\" So they didn't reach the final.\n2. Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: They were \"runner - up,\" which is also not the final.\n3. Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify, so no participation.\n4. Recopa Sudamericana 1993: N/A, meaning they didn't participate or reached some stage but it's unclear.\n5. Intercontinental Cup 1993: N/A as well.\n\nFrom this, in each of the tournaments where flamengo participated (Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana), they only made it to the quarterfinals or runner-up, not the final. They didn't participate in some others. So the claim that they reached the final in every tournament is false because there are multiple tournaments where they did not reach the final.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if all relevant columns are considered. The claim says \"every tournament,\" so does it mean all possible tournaments listed? Let's see: Copa Libertadores, Supercopa Sudamericana, Copa Conmebol, Recopa Sudamericana, and Intercontinental Cup. Flamengo didn't make it to the final in any of these except possibly the Recopa Sudamericana where it's N/A, which I think means they didn't reach that stage.\n\nSo yes, the claim is definitely false because there are multiple tournaments where flamengo did not reach the final.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"copa libertadores 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"supercopa sudamericana 1993\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim made about the table is true or false and then identify the relevant cells used in verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"santos and cruzeiro qualify for the same number of tournament.\" So, we're looking at how many tournaments each of these two teams qualified for across different competitions.\n\nLooking at the table provided, which lists various Brazilian football tournaments for 1993, I should focus on the rows corresponding to Santos and Cruzeiro. \n\nLet's start with Cruzeiro. Scanning through the 'team' column, I find Cruzeiro in row number 4. The columns relevant here are \"copa libertadores 1993,\" \"supercopa sudamericana 1993,\" \"copa conmebol 1993,\" and \"recopa sudamericana 1993.\" From the table:\n\n- Copa Libertadores: Did not qualify\n- Supercopa Sudamericana: Quarterfinals (which I assume counts as qualifying)\n- Copa Conmebol: Did not qualify\n- Recopa Sudamericana: Runner-up\n\nSo, Cruzeiro qualified for the Supercopa Sudamericana and came up as runner-up in the Recopa. That's two qualifications.\n\nNow, Santos is listed in row 7. Checking each column:\n\n- Copa Libertadores: Did not qualify\n- Supercopa Sudamericana: Round of 16 (so they qualified)\n- Copa Conmebol: Did not qualify\n- Recopa Sudamericana: N/A\n- Intercontinental Cup: N/A\n\nSo, Santos only qualified for the Supercopa Sudamericana. That's one qualification.\n\nComparing both teams, Cruzeiro qualified twice (Supercopa and runner-up in Recopa), while Santos only qualified once (Supercopa). Therefore, their number of qualifications isn't the same. \n\nBut wait, I need to clarify: does \"did not qualify\" mean they didn't participate? So for each tournament, if they either qualified or did not qualify. In Cruzeiro's case:\n\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify \u2192 no\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Quarterfinals \u2192 yes (qualified)\n- Copa Conmebol 1993: Did not qualify \u2192 no\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993: Runner-up \u2192 yes\n\nThat's two qualifications. Santos:\n\n- Copa Libertadores 1993: Did not qualify \u2192 no\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: Round of 16 \u2192 yes (qualified)\n- Others: Did not qualify or N/A, so only one qualification.\n\nSo the claim that both qualified for the same number is false. \n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: For Cruzeiro, check each tournament's result for qualification. For Santos, same thing. So in the table, the columns are:\n\n- Copa Libertadores 1993\n- Supercopa Sudamericana 1993\n- Copa Conmebol 1993\n- Recopa Sudamericana 1993\n\nThese four columns need to be checked for both teams.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Cruzeiro:\n- Row index:4 (Cruzeiro)\n   - All four columns mentioned above.\nFor Santos:\n- Row index:7 (Santos)\n   - Again, all four columns.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include each of these rows and their respective tournament columns. However, since we're only supposed to list the cells that directly contribute to verifying the claim, I think we need to list all the cells where either team qualified or didn't in each relevant column.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, for each team, check how many times they qualified across the tournaments listed. So, for Cruzeiro, looking at each of their entries: Copa Libertadores 1993 (did not qualify), Supercopa Sudamericana 1993 (qualified), Copa Conmebol 1993 (did not qualify), Recopa Sudamericana 1993 (runner-up \u2192 qualified). That's two.\n\nFor Santos, Copa Libertadores 1993 (did not qualify), Supercopa Sudamericana 1993 (qualified), others either did not or N/A. So only one.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be all the cells in their respective rows for those four columns to verify this.\n\nSo, the JSON should include all these cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Santos qualified for one tournament while Cruzeiro qualified for two tournaments. The relevant cells are the specific entries confirming their qualification status across the listed competitions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"claim\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"Santos qualified for 1 tournament, while Cruzeiro qualified for 2 tournaments.\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"team\": \"Cruzeiro\", \"tournament\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"team\": \"Cruzeiro\", \"tournament\": \"Supercopa Sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"team\": \"Cruzeiro\", \"tournament\": \"Copa Conmebol 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"team\": \"Cruzeiro\", \"tournament\": \"Recopa Sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"team\": \"Santos\", \"tournament\": \"Copa Libertadores 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"team\": \"Santos\", \"tournament\": \"Supercopa Sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"team\": \"Santos\", \"tournament\": \"Copa Conmebol 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"team\": \"Santos\", \"tournament\": \"Recopa Sudamericana 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"4 teams play in the intercontinental cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions four teams playing in the Intercontinental Cup. Looking at the table, there are several columns related to different competitions: Copa Libertadores 1993, Super Copa Sudamericana 1993, Copa Conmebol 1993, Recopa Sudamericana 1993, and Intercontinental Cup 1993.\n\nThe relevant column here is \"intercontinental cup 1993\". So I need to check which teams participated in this competition. \n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: Did not qualify\n- Botafogo: Did not qualify\n- Bragantino: Did not qualify\n- Cruzeiro: Did not qualify\n- Flamengo: Did not qualify\n- Fluminense: Did not qualify\n- Gr\u00eamio: Did not qualify\n- Internacional: Group stage (so they played)\n- Santos: Did not qualify\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: Champions (they played)\n- Vasco: Did not qualify\n\nFrom this, the teams that played in the Intercontinental Cup 1993 are Internacional and S\u00e3o Paulo. That's two teams.\n\nThe claim says \"4 teams play\", but according to the table, only two teams participated. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states four teams when there were only two.\n\nI should verify if I missed any other teams that qualified. Scanning through each team again, none others have entries beyond \"did not qualify\" or \"n / a\". So, indeed, only two teams played in that year's Intercontinental Cup.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because it inaccurately states four teams when only two participated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that four teams played in the 1993 Intercontinental Cup. However, according to the table, only two teams (Internacional and S\u00e3o Paulo) qualified for the competition. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"intercontinental cup 1993\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
