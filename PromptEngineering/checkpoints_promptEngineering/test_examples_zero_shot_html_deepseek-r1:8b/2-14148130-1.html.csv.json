    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 9 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\" Hmm, breaking that down, it seems like there are two conditions. \n\nFirst condition: There should be 9 points on two separate occasions. That probably means in two different rows of the table, the 'points' column has a value of 9.\n\nSecond condition: The point difference should be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21. Wait, but looking at the table, I see that each row has a 'points difference' column. Let me check those values.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'points difference' column has entries like \"41 - 07\", \"26 - 16\", etc. For instance, in the third row, it's \"30 - 15\" and in another row, \"26 - 21\". So these two differences match exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nNow, I need to verify if there are two rows where 'points' is 9. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: points =14 \u2192 Not 9.\n2. Second row: points=10\u2192 No.\n3. Third row: points=9 \u2192 Yes, one occurrence.\n4. Fourth row: points=9\u2192 Another yes.\n5. Fifth row: points=7\u2192 No.\n6. Sixth row: points=4\u2192 No.\n7. Seventh row: points=3\u2192 No.\n8. Eighth row: points=0\u2192 No.\n\nSo, there are two rows (third and fourth) where the 'points' column is 9. That satisfies the first part of the claim.\n\nFor the second part, the point differences mentioned in the claim are \"30 -15\" and \"26 -21\". Looking at the table:\n\n- The third row has \"30 -15\".\n- The fourth row has \"26 -21\".\n\nThese exactly match the required differences. So both conditions are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each condition refers to specific rows and columns.\n\nFor the two points of 9: those are in row indices 2 and 3 (since indexing starts at 0). The column is 'points'.\n\nFor the point differences: \"30 -15\" is in row index 2, column 'points difference'. Similarly, \"26 -21\" is in row index 3, same column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 2, points\n- Row 3, points\n- Row 2, points difference\n- Row 3, points difference\n\nWait, but each row has one 'points' and one 'points difference'. So for each of the two rows (indices 2 and 3), both columns are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should list four cells: two for the 9 points and two for their differences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this means. The first part talks about the number of games being 7. Looking at the table, under the 'games' column, every row has 7 as the value. So that part seems to check out.\n\nNext, the second part is a bit trickier. It mentions \"on 4 occasion be there draw.\" I think this means there should only be four draws across all games. Let me look at the 'drawn' column in the table. Each cell here shows the number of draws for each game. \n\nNow, let's list out how many times a game was drawn:\n- Row 0: 0\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 1\n- Row 3: 1\n- Row 4: 1\n- Row 5: 0\n- Row 6: 1\n\nAdding these up: 0+0+1+1+1+0+1 = 4. So there are indeed four draws in total, which matches the claim's condition of \"on 4 occasion be there draw.\"\n\nThe last part says \"never more than 1 game drawn.\" This means that no single row should have a drawn count higher than 1. Looking back at the 'drawn' column: all entries are either 0 or 1. None go up to 2 or more, so this condition is also satisfied.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Each row's 'drawn' cell is either 0 or 1, which means no game had more than one draw. So both parts of the claim regarding draws are correct.\n\nTherefore, all conditions in the claim are met by the table data. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which cells are relevant. The columns that are relevant here are 'drawn' and maybe 'games.' Since the claim talks about the number of games (which is 7) and the number of draws (4), these two columns are definitely involved.\n\nLooking at each row, all rows have 7 games, so every row's 'games' cell is relevant. But since the claim specifically refers to the total number of games being 7, maybe only one cell from 'games' column is needed, perhaps row 0 or any row since they all have 7.\n\nBut actually, the claim says \"only 7 game in all the game,\" so it's about the count. So maybe just confirming that each game has 7 entries isn't necessary; instead, it's about the total number of games being 7, which is true across all rows. But since every row shows 7 games, perhaps any of them can be used as a reference.\n\nBut the user didn't specify to pick specific cells beyond what's needed. Since the claim refers to both the total games and draws, I need to select the relevant columns. So 'games' column is always 7, so each cell in that column is relevant. Similarly, the 'drawn' column has varying values, but since we're checking for totals across all rows, perhaps it's the entire column.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should list specific cells. Since the claim is about the total number of games (7) and the total number of draws (4), maybe I should look at each row's 'drawn' cell because that's where the 1s are adding up.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"never more than 1 game drawn,\" so any row with a drawn value greater than 1 would violate it. Since all drawn values are 0 or 1, every row's 'drawn' column is relevant to check that no row has more than 1 draw. But since they don't, perhaps each cell isn't necessary, but the total across all rows matters.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider each 'drawn' cell because it contributes to the total. So the cells in the 'drawn' column where the value is 1 are important for the count of 4 draws. But since we're checking that there's exactly four draws across all games, perhaps every row's 'drawn' cell is relevant.\n\nWait, but in the table, not all rows have a drawn value; only some have 0 or 1. So to confirm the total number of draws is 4, I need to check each row's 'drawn' cell because that's where the data is stored. Therefore, every row's 'drawn' column is relevant.\n\nSo in terms of the JSON response, the relevant cells are all the rows for the 'drawn' column and perhaps the 'games' column as well since it's part of the claim about 7 games.\n\nBut wait, the first part of the claim is that there are only 7 games. Since every row has 7 in the 'games' column, so any of those cells could be used to verify that part. So maybe I should include one cell from 'games' and all cells from 'drawn.'\n\nAlternatively, since the 'games' column consistently shows 7, perhaps it's sufficient to note that each row has 7 games as relevant because they all confirm the total count.\n\nBut according to the example given, in their JSON response, they included two specific cells. So maybe I should include one cell from 'drawn' where the value is 1 (to show a draw) and perhaps one from 'games.'\n\nWait, no, the claim is about the number of games being 7 and the number of draws being 4. So to check that there are exactly four draws across all games, I need to sum the 'drawn' column, which gives 4. Therefore, each cell in the 'drawn' column is relevant because they contribute to the total count.\n\nBut maybe it's more efficient to just include cells where the value is non-zero, but since the instruction doesn't specify that, perhaps all are needed. But the example only includes two specific cells, so maybe I can be selective.\n\nWait, looking back at the claim: \"never more than 1 game drawn.\" So any row with a 'drawn' value greater than 1 would violate it. Since none do, each cell in 'drawn' is still relevant because they all comply. But perhaps only rows where 'drawn' is 1 need to be included.\n\nI think the key here is that the user wants to check two things: total games are 7 and total draws are 4, with no single game having more than one draw.\n\nSo for the games part, since every row has 7, any of those cells can be considered. So maybe just pick one cell from 'games' column.\n\nFor the draws part, we need to check that across all rows, there are exactly four draws (i.e., four times where the value is 1). Therefore, each cell in the 'drawn' column contributes to this total. Hence, every row's 'drawn' cell is relevant because they add up to 4.\n\nWait, but if I include every cell from 'drawn', that would be all eight rows (assuming the table has more than four games). So perhaps it's better to just note that in the data, the sum of 'drawn' across all rows is 4. But according to the user's instructions, they need specific cells.\n\nSo perhaps I can select two cells: one from 'drawn' where it's 1 (to show a draw) and one from 'games' to confirm the total number of games.\n\nBut in reality, since each row represents a game, maybe each row is a separate game. Therefore, each row has both 'games' and 'drawn.' So perhaps all cells are relevant because they contribute to both counts.\n\nHowever, since the claim talks about the total across all games, it's about aggregating data. So each cell in 'drawn' contributes to that sum, so each is relevant. Similarly, each cell in 'games' confirms that each game has 7 entries, but perhaps only one is needed as they are all same.\n\nBut the user's example included two specific cells: a row from games and a row from drawn with value 1.\n\nIn our case, to satisfy both parts of the claim (total games and total draws), we can include:\n\n- All 'drawn' cells because each contributes to the count.\n- One 'games' cell, since all are same.\n\nBut including all 'drawn' cells might be tedious if there are many. Alternatively, maybe just note that in the data, each row's drawn is 0 or 1 and the total across all rows is 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps include two specific cells: one from games (any) and one from drawn where it's 1.\n\nI think the example provided by the user included two cells, so maybe we can follow that. So for our case:\n\n- Include a cell from 'games' column (e.g., row 0).\n- Include a cell from 'drawn' column where value is 1 (e.g., row 2).\n\nThus, in JSON:\n\n[\n  {\"column\": \"games\", \"row\": 0},\n  {\"column\": \"drawn\", \"row\": 2}\n]\n\nBut perhaps to be more precise, the user's example included two specific cells: one from 'games' and one from 'drawn' with value 1.\n\nSo, in our case:\n\n- To confirm that each game has 7 games, any row's 'games' cell is relevant. So include row 0.\n- To confirm that exactly four draws occurred across all games, include cells where 'drawn' is 1 (rows 2,4,6,8 if there are eight rows). But since the user wants specific cells, perhaps pick two of them.\n\nBut maybe it's better to just select one cell from each column. Alternatively, as the user's example includes two specific cells, let's do the same.\n\nSo in our response:\n\n- One cell from 'games' (row 0)\n- One cell from 'drawn' where value is 1 (say row 2)\n\nTherefore, the JSON would include these two cells.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying that the table meets two criteria: there are exactly seven games and only four draws, with no game having more than one draw. \n\nTo confirm this:\n- Check each row for the 'games' column to ensure they all have a value of 7.\n- Sum the 'drawn' column across all rows to ensure it totals 4.\n- Ensure that no single row's 'drawn' value exceeds 1.\n\nThe relevant cells are those in the 'games' and 'drawn' columns. Specifically:\n- A cell from the 'games' column (e.g., row 0) to confirm the game count.\n- Cells where 'drawn' is 1, as these indicate draws.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"column\": \"games\", \"row\": 0 },\n  { \"column\": \"drawn\", \"row\": 2 }\n]\n```\n\nThis selection ensures we check both the total number of games and the exact number of draws, while also confirming that no single game had more than one draw.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 0 and lost game be 7.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's a conditional statement where when the points column (probably points for the team) is 0, then both the drawn games and lost games columns should also be 0 and 7 respectively.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with data on games played, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. The claim is about checking rows where the points are zero to see if the corresponding drawn and lost games align.\n\nSo I'll go through each row in the table and check two things: whether the points column is 0 and then verify the drawn and lost columns for that row.\n\nRow 0: Points is 14, so it doesn't apply.\nRow 1: Points are 10, no.\nRow 2: Points are 9, no.\nRow 3: Points are 9, no.\nRow 4: Points are 7, no.\nRow 5: Points are 4, no.\nRow 6: Points are 3, no.\nRow 7: Points are 0. So this row is relevant. Now check drawn and lost columns: drawn is 0 and lost is 7. That matches the claim.\n\nSo only row 7 meets the condition. Therefore, there is at least one instance where when points are 0, both drawn and lost games align with 0 and 7 respectively. The claim doesn't state whether it's always true or if it just sometimes happens. Since in this case it does happen once, the claim isn't universally false. But I need to check if all instances (if any) where points are zero satisfy the condition.\n\nSince only row 7 has points as 0 and meets both drawn=0 and lost=7, that's sufficient for the claim to be true in this context. Even though other rows might not meet the condition, as long as there is at least one row that does, the claim isn't entirely false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"there be no draw more than 1 and no loss more than 7.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the 'drawn' column in the table. Each row shows the number of drawn games for that category. I'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 0 draws\n- Row 1: 0 draws\n- Row 2: 1 draw\n- Row 3: 1 draw\n- Row 4: 1 draw\n- Row 5: 0 draws\n- Row 6: 1 draw\n- Row 7: 0 draws\n\nSo, the maximum number of draws in any row is 1. That part seems to hold because there are no rows with more than 1 draw. So that condition checks out.\n\nNext, looking at the 'lost' column:\n\n- Row 0: 0 losses\n- Row 1: 2 losses\n- Row 2: 2 losses\n- Row 3: 2 losses\n- Row 4: 3 losses\n- Row 5: 5 losses\n- Row 6: 5 losses\n- Row 7: 7 losses\n\nThe maximum number of losses in any row is 7. The claim says no loss more than 7, which is correct because the highest is exactly 7. So that condition also holds.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure there are no entries where draws exceed 1 or losses exceed 7. From the data, draws never go above 1, and losses never exceed 7. So both conditions are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when there be 14 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 7.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part of the claim means. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nThe claim mentions two scenarios:\n\n1. When a team has 14 points and a points difference of 41 - 07, the game is 7.\n2. When another team has 10 points and a points difference of 26 - 16, with the same game number (game of 7).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different set of data: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points.\n\nI need to check each condition in the claim against the table. Let's start with the first part.\n\nFor the first scenario:\n- Points: 14\n- Points difference: 41 - 07 (which is 34)\n\nSo I'm looking for a row where the \"points\" column is 14 and the \"points difference\" is 34. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 0: points 14, difference 41-07=34. So yes, this matches.\n\nNow, check what \"game\" it refers to. The claim says \"the game be 7.\" So I need to see if the \"games\" column for this row is 7. In row 0, games are 7, so that's correct.\n\nSo the first part of the claim seems to hold true.\n\nNow, moving on to the second scenario:\n- Points: 10\n- Points difference: 26 - 16 (which is 10)\n\nLooking for a row where \"points\" is 10 and points difference is 10. Let me scan the table:\n\nRow 0: points 14, diff 34 \u2013 no.\nRow 1: points 10, diff 26-16=10. So yes, this matches.\n\nNow check if the \"games\" column here is 7. In row 1, games are indeed 7.\n\nSo both scenarios in the claim are satisfied by rows 0 and 1 of the table.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that these rows are correctly identified. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 0: points 14, diff 41-07=34, games 7 \u2013 matches.\nRow 1: points 10, diff 26-16=10, games 7 \u2013 matches.\n\nSo both conditions in the claim are met by the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells. The claim refers to two specific cells:\n\nFrom row 0 (points=14), columns \"points\" and \"points difference.\" So rows 0 and 1 each have these relevant columns.\n\nSo in terms of cell indices:\n\nRow 0: points is column index 4, points difference is column index 3.\nRow 1: points is column index 4, points difference is column index 3.\n\nBut when mapping to the claim's conditions, we're focusing on those specific rows and their relevant columns. Therefore, in the JSON response, the relevant_cells should list these two rows with their respective column names.\n\nWait, but looking back at the instruction: each cell in relevant_cells is an object with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\" (string). So for row 0, the points difference is column 3 (\"points difference\") and points is column 4. But the claim refers to both these columns in the two rows.\n\nWait no, actually, each condition in the claim refers to two cells: one in the points column and another in the points difference column of a specific row. So for each row that matches the condition (row 0 and row 1), we need to include both their \"points\" and \"points difference\" columns as relevant.\n\nWait no, the claim is about the presence of these values together in a single game. So for row 0, it's points=14 and points diff=34. For row 1, points=10 and points diff=10. But wait, looking back:\n\nIn row 0: games=7, points=14, points difference=34.\n\nIn row 1: games=7, points=10, points difference=26-16=10.\n\nBut in the table, each row is a separate game? Or is it per team?\n\nWait, no. The \"games\" column likely represents the number of games played, not the game number. Wait, maybe \"game\" refers to a single match. So for example, if there are 7 games, then this could be referring to 7 different matches.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row has the same \"games\" value (7), which might indicate that these are separate data points for each game. Or perhaps it's an issue with the way the table is structured. Wait, in reality, a football match would have one result: win, lose, draw, etc., but here each row seems to represent a different scenario, possibly across multiple matches or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that for each of these conditions, there exists a row where both the points and points difference match, along with the games being 7.\n\nSo for the first condition: 14 points, 41-07 diff, games=7 \u2013 yes, in row 0.\nSecond condition: 10 points, 26-16 diff, games=7 \u2013 yes, in row 1.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met, so the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, about relevant cells: for each of these rows (0 and 1), we need to include the \"points difference\" and \"points\" columns. Wait, but in the JSON example given, each relevant cell is a column, not two per row. So maybe for each row that meets a condition, we need to list both columns that are part of that condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the relevant cells are the specific cells that satisfy the claim's conditions. Since each condition refers to points and points difference in the same row, for each such row (0 and 1), their \"points\" and \"points difference\" columns are relevant.\n\nSo in total, four cells: rows 0 and 1, both columns 3 and 4.\n\nBut let me think again. The claim says that for a game (with games=7), there exists a team with 14 points and 34 point difference, and another team with 10 points and 10 point difference. So in row 0, the team has 14 points and a 34-point difference; in row 1, another team has 10 points and a 10-point difference.\n\nTherefore, each of these rows contributes to satisfying the claim's conditions.\n\nSo for the JSON response, relevant_cells would be:\n\n- For row 0: columns \"points\" (index 4) and \"points difference\" (index 3).\n- For row 1: same columns.\n\nBut wait, in the instruction, it says each cell is an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" So for each relevant column in these rows, we need to list them as separate objects.\n\nSo that would be:\n\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points difference\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points difference\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n]\n\nWait, but that seems like four entries. Alternatively, maybe just the columns in each relevant row.\n\nBut looking back at the example given by the user: they showed a JSON array with two objects, presumably for two cells. But I'm not entirely sure about how many cells to include.\n\nIn this case, since both points and points difference are involved in each condition, we need to list both columns for each relevant row. So yes, four entries.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the points column is sufficient? Or perhaps it's intended that each cell refers to a single value that meets the condition. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, each condition requires two pieces of information: the points and the points difference. Therefore, in order to verify both parts of the condition, we need to refer to both columns in the relevant rows.\n\nTherefore, for row 0, both \"points\" and \"points difference\" are relevant because they meet part of the claim. Similarly for row 1.\n\nThus, the JSON should include all four cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying specific data points in a table that satisfy certain conditions. After analyzing the table, it's clear that two rows meet the conditions set by the claim:\n\n1. **First Condition (14 Points and 34-Point Difference):** Found in Row 0, this includes both the \"points\" and \"points difference\" columns.\n2. **Second Condition (10 Points and 10-Point Difference):** Found in Row 1, this also includes both the \"points\" and \"points difference\" columns.\n\nEach of these rows contributes to satisfying the claim, confirming its validity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"claim_status\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points difference\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points difference\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down what's being asked here.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing at first glance. Let me parse it out.\n\nFirst part: \"only 7 games in all the game.\" Looking at the table, under the 'games' column, each row has the number 7. So, the total number of games listed is 8 rows (since the count starts from row index 0). Wait, no, the first row is 7 games, and all other rows also have 7 games. So that part seems to check out because there are multiple games, but each game has some data, so perhaps the claim refers to total games as in how many matches or something else? I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe the first part is just stating that there are only 7 games, but looking at the table, it's actually showing 8 games (since row indices go from 0 to 7). So perhaps the claim is incorrect here because there are more than 7 games. But I need to check carefully.\n\nSecond part: \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\" So, this seems to say that there should be exactly 4 draws across all games, and in any single game, the number of draws doesn't exceed 2? Or maybe it's about the total number of drawn games being 4, but wait, looking at the table.\n\nLet me look at the 'drawn' column. Each row has either 0 or 1 as the value. So, let me count how many times 'drawn' is 1 across all rows.\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 1\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 1\nRow 7: 0\n\nSo, the total number of drawn games is 4. That matches the \"on 4 occasion be there draw\" part. Now, about the second condition: \"never more than 2 game draw.\" So in each game, the number of draws shouldn't exceed 2? But wait, each row represents a single game, right? Because 'games' column is 7 for each row, indicating it's one game per row.\n\nWait, no. Each row is a separate game, so perhaps the claim is that in all games (rows), the number of draws doesn't exceed 2? But looking at the 'drawn' column: for each row, the value is either 0 or 1. So, the maximum drawn per game is 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, this condition is satisfied because none of the games have more than 2 draws (in fact, they all have 0 or 1).\n\nBut wait, going back to the first part: \"only 7 game in all the game.\" The table shows 8 rows, each with 'games' as 7. So if the claim is stating that there are only 7 games, but in reality, there's data for 8 games, then this would make the entire claim FALSE because it's incorrect.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"all the game\" refers to something else, like all matches or something, and the count is correct as 7 games per row, so total games being 8? Or maybe each 'game' in the table represents a single instance, so there are 8 games listed, but the claim says only 7. That would make it incorrect.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to rephrase the claim: It's saying that across all games, there are exactly 7 games (maybe implying one game with multiple aspects), and in 4 of those instances, there was a draw, never more than 2 draws per game. But the table has 8 rows, each representing a separate game. So if the claim says only 7 games, but there are 8, that's false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"all the game\" is a mistranslation or misphrasing, and it's intended to mean that in all of the games (each row), certain conditions hold. Let me look at each part again.\n\nFirst condition: Only 7 games in total. But the table has 8 rows, each with 'games' as 7. So if the claim is stating that there are only 7 games, but the table shows 8, then this is false because it's incorrect to say there are only 7 when there are more.\n\nSecond condition: On 4 occasions (rows) where there was a draw, and in each game, the number of draws doesn't exceed 2. As established, each row has either 0 or 1 drawn, so this part is true because none have more than 2 draws.\n\nSo, since the first part of the claim is false, the overall claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me count the number of games again. Each row has 'games' as 7, and there are 8 rows. So that's 8 games in total. The claim says \"only 7 game,\" which would be incorrect because it's actually 8. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows 8 games (rows), each with 7 as the number of games. However, the claim states only 7 games, which is incorrect. Additionally, there are exactly 4 draws across the games, and no game has more than 1 draw. But since the first part of the claim is false, the entire statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. Let me first understand what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 10 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down:\n1. There should be two occasions (rows) where the points are 10.\n2. The point differences should be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to check for these conditions.\n\nLooking at the 'points' column first:\n- Row 0: 14\n- Row 1: 10\n- Row 2: 9\n- Row 3: 9\n- Row 4: 7\n- Row 5: 4\n- Row 6: 3\n- Row 7: 0\n\nSo, the points are 10 only in row 1. That's one occasion, but the claim says two occasions. So this is a problem because we only have one instance where points are 10.\n\nNext, checking the 'points difference' column:\nThe claim mentions two specific differences: 30 -15 and 26-21.\n\nLooking at the 'points difference' column:\n- Row 0: 41-07=34\n- Row 1: 26-16=10\n- Row 2: 30-15=15\n- Row 3: 26-21=5\n- Row 4: 17-23=-6 (but the table shows \"17 - 23\", which is -6, but maybe written as negative)\nWait, in the table, it's written as \"17 - 23\" and points are 7. So the difference is -6 or -23+17= -6.\n\nBut wait, in row 2, points difference is 30-15=15, and in row 3, it's 26-21=5.\n\nThe claim mentions two differences: 30 -15 (which equals 15) and 26 -21 (equals 5). So these should correspond to the relevant rows.\n\nLooking at the table, 30-15 appears in row 2. The points for row 2 are 9, not 10. So even though the difference is correct, the points don't match what's required.\n\nSimilarly, 26-21 is in row 3. Points there are 9 again, not 10. So neither of these rows have 10 points.\n\nRow 1 has a point difference of 26-16=10, but that doesn't match either of the differences in the claim. The claim wants 30-15 and 26-21 as differences, which aren't both present.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- The claim requires two rows with 10 points. Only row 1 has 10 points.\n- The point differences mentioned (30 -15 and 26-21) are found in rows 2 and 3, but those rows don't have 10 points.\nTherefore, the conditions of the claim aren't met because there's only one row with 10 points, and the differences don't align with that.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down what the claim says.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"when there be 10 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6.\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it. It seems like there are two conditions here.\n\nCondition 1: When points = 10 and points difference is 41 - 07 (which equals 34), the number of games should be 7.\nCondition 2: When points = 10 and points difference is 26 - 16 (which equals 10), the game count should be 6.\n\nSo I need to look through the table for rows where either condition is met and check if the game count matches accordingly.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different scenario with games, drawn, lost, points difference, and total points. The key columns are 'points' and 'points difference'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Points: 14\n- Points Difference: 41 - 07 = 34\nGames:7\n\nDoes this fit Condition 1? Let's see: Points is 14, not 10. So no.\n\nCondition 2: Points is 14, so no again.\n\nRow 1:\n- Points:10\n- Points Difference:26 -16=10\nGames:6\n\nWait, the claim says that when points are 10 and difference is 26-16 (which is 10), the game should be 6. But in Row 1, games are 7.\n\nSo Condition 2 isn't met because the game count is 7 instead of 6. That's a problem.\n\nRow 2:\nPoints:9\nDiff:30 -15=15\nGames:7\n\nNo, points aren't 10 or 14 here.\n\nRow3:\nPoints:9\nDiff:26-21=5\nGames:7\n\nSame as above.\n\nRow4:\nPoints:7\nDiff:17-23=-6\nGames:7\n\nNot relevant.\n\nRow5:\nPoints:4\nDiff:19-28=-9\nGames:7\n\nNope.\n\nRow6:\nPoints:3\nDiff:20-28=-8\nGames:7\n\nNo.\n\nRow7:\nPoints:0\nDiff:05 -46= -41\nGames:7\n\nNot relevant.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me check each row again for points equal to 10 or 14.\n\nOnly Row1 has Points:10 and Diff:26-16=10, but the game count is 6. But in the table, it's showing 6 games with 7 columns? Wait no, looking at the HTML code, each row has td elements. Let me recount:\n\nEach row in the tbody has 5 <td> elements: games, drawn, lost, points difference, points.\n\nSo for Row1:\ngames=7, drawn=0, lost=2, diff=26-16, points=10.\n\nSo according to the claim's Condition2, when points are 10 and diff is 26-16 (which is 10), games should be 6. But in this row, games are 7. So that doesn't match.\n\nNow, looking for a row where Points=14, which is another part of the claim. Only Row0 has Points=14, with Diff=34 (41-07). The claim's Condition1 says when points=10 and diff=34, games should be7. But in Row0, Points are 14, not 10. So that condition isn't met.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"when there be 10 point and a point difference of 41 -07...\". So points should be 10, diff=34, games=7.\n\nIn Row0, points are14, so not matching that condition. But in Condition1, when points are10, which is only Row1, but the diff isn't34 there. Wait, Row1's diff is10, not34.\n\nSo no row satisfies both Conditions. Therefore, the claim is false because either of the conditions aren't met in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n]}",

The claim says: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It seems like the claim is stating that when the points column is 0, there are 3 drawn games and 5 lost games.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: games, drawn, lost, points difference, points. The row indices start from 0 up to 7. I'll go through each row where the 'points' column has a value of 0 and check the corresponding 'drawn' and 'lost' columns.\n\nLet's look at each row:\n\n- Row 0: points is 14 (not 0)\n- Row 1: points is 10 (not 0)\n- Row 2: points is 9 (not 0)\n- Row 3: points is 9 (not 0)\n- Row 4: points is 7 (not 0)\n- Row 5: points is 4 (not 0)\n- Row 6: points is 3 (not 0)\n- Row 7: points is 0. Now, check 'drawn' and 'lost'. For row 7, drawn is 0 and lost is 7.\n\nWait, the claim says when points are 0, there should be 3 drawn and 5 lost games.

The claim says: \"there be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7.\" So, I have to check each part of this claim against the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. No draw (drawn) more than 3. That means all drawn cells should be 0, 1, or 2.\n2. No loss (lost) more than 7. So all lost cells should be less than or equal to 7.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and check these two conditions.\n\nStarting with the 'drawn' column:\n\nI'll list out the drawn values for each row:\n- Row 0: 0\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 1\n- Row 3: 1\n- Row 4: 1\n- Row 5: 0\n- Row 6: 1\n- Row 7: 0\n\nAll drawn values are either 0 or 1, which is definitely no more than 3. So the first part of the claim holds true.\n\nNow for the 'lost' column:\n\nListing out the lost values:\n- Row 0: 0\n- Row 1: 2\n- Row 2: 2\n- Row 3: 2\n- Row 4: 3\n- Row 5: 5\n- Row 6: 5\n- Row 7: 7\n\nWait, row 7 has a lost value of 7. The claim says \"no loss more than 7.\" So does 7 count as not exceeding? Yes, because it's stated as \"more than 7\" or exactly 7. If the claim was \"no loss more than 6,\" then 7 would be problematic, but since it's \"no loss more than 7,\" 7 is acceptable. However, I need to check if any row exceeds 3? No, because 7 is for a single game, not multiple.\n\nWait no, the claim says \"no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7.\" So in the lost column, all values should be <=3 or <=7? Wait, maybe I misinterpret. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe claim is: \"there be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7.\"\n\nSo for draws, each drawn count should not exceed 3, which they don't. For losses, each loss count shouldn't exceed 7. Looking at the lost column:\n\nRow 0: 0 \u22647 \u2192 ok\nRow1:2 \u22647\u2192ok\nRow2:2\u22647\u2192ok\nRow3:2\u22647\u2192ok\nRow4:3\u22647\u2192ok\nRow5:5\u22647\u2192ok\nRow6:5\u22647\u2192ok\nRow7:7\u22647\u2192ok\n\nSo none of the lost values exceed 7. Therefore, both conditions are met.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I misread the claim. It says \"no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7.\" So each individual game's drawn and lost counts must not be over those numbers.
