    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"wheel arrangement 4 - 4 - 0 have 4207 construction\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two specific attributes: \"wheel arrangement 4 - 4 - 0\" and a construction number of 4207. So, I need to check if there are any rows in the table where both these conditions hold true.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: builder, construct-ion no (probably a typo for 'construction no'), date ordered, wheel arrangement, s cylinder, engine weight, and tc&stl no (1883-84). The claim focuses on \"wheel arrangement 4 - 4 - 0\" and \"construction no\" of 4207.\n\nNow, I'll scan through each row to find where the construction number is 4207 and the wheel arrangement is exactly \"4 - 4 - 0\".\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Builder: Baldwin\n- Construction no: 4207\n- Wheel arrangement: 4 - 4 - 0\n\nThis matches both conditions in the claim. So, this row is relevant.\n\nI'll check if there are any other rows with construction no 4207 and wheel arrangement 4-4-0. Scanning through the rest of the table:\n\nRows for Baldwin:\n- The first row has 4207 and 4-4-0.\n- The second row is Baldwin but construction no 4292, so not matching.\n\nOther builders: Porter, Mason, Brooks. Their construction numbers don't include 4207 in any other rows. Specifically, checking each:\n\nPorter's construction no starts at 401, goes up but doesn't reach 4207.\nMason has 645 and 581, neither is 4207.\nBrooks has several entries: 610, 659, 937, 941. None of these are 4207.\n\nSo, only the first row meets both conditions in the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nNow, considering whether there might be any other relevant cells beyond the one that matches. The claim specifies \"wheel arrangement\" and \"construct-ion no (construction no)\". So, each of these columns needs to be checked for their respective values in the same row.\n\nHence, the only relevant cell is where construction no is 4207 and wheel arrangement is 4-4-0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"construct - tion no\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"wheel arrange - ment\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"brook build the order with 56 tc&stl in november 1881.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse this claim. It mentions \"brook\" as the builder, so I should look for rows where the builder is Brooks. The claim also specifies \"order,\" which likely refers to a specific row in the table. The key figures mentioned are \"56 tc&stl\" and \"november 1881.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: builder, construct-ion no, date ordered, wheel arrangement, s cylinder, engine weight, and tc&stl no (1883-84). \n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the builder is Brooks. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 5: Brooks, order 610, November 1881, 2-6-0, 14in, -, 56\n- Row 6: Brooks, order 659, February 1882, 2-6-0, 14in, -, 77\n- Row 7: Brooks, order 937, June 1883, 2-6-0, 15in, -, 96\n- Row 8: Brooks, order 941, July 1883, 2-6-0, 15in, -, 97\n\nSo four rows for Brooks. Now, the claim mentions November 1881 and 56 tc&stl. Looking at row 5: date ordered is November 1881 and the tc&stl no is 56. That seems to match.\n\nWait, but in the table, the \"tc&amp;stl no (1883-84)\" column has values like 2,4,96,54,55,56,77,96,97. So row 5's value is 56. The claim says \"56 tc&stl,\" which corresponds to this.\n\nSo, does the claim say that Brooks built an order with 56 tc&stl in November 1881? Yes, row 5 matches that exactly.\n\nBut let me double-check other rows to ensure there isn't another matching. Row 6 is February 1882, so date doesn't match. Row 7 and 8 are June and July 1883, which don't fit November. So only row 5 matches all criteria: Brooks built an order with 56 tc&stl in November 1881.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are in row 5 (index 5) for the \"tc&amp;stl no (1883-84)\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from a specific row in the table where the builder is Brooks, the order number corresponds to November 1881, and the tc&stl number is 56.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tc&amp;stl no (1883-84)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim says: \"there be 2 construction (4207 & 4292) that have the wheel arrangement of 4 - 4 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's saying there are exactly two entries in the 'construction' column with numbers 4207 and 4292, and each of these has a specific wheel arrangement of \"4-4-0\". \n\nLooking at the table, the columns are: builder, construct - tion no, date ordered, wheel arrange - ment, s cylinder, engine weight, tc&amp;stl no (1883 - 84). So I need to focus on the 'construct - tion no' and 'wheel arrange - ment' columns.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the 'construct - tion no' is either 4207 or 4292, and then check their corresponding wheel arrangements. \n\nStarting with row 0: construct no 4207, builder baldwin, wheel arrangement 4-4-0. That matches the claim for one construction.\n\nNext, looking for 4292 in construct no column. Scanning down, I see row 1 has 4292, also built by Baldwin, and again the wheel arrangement is 4-4-0. So that's another match.\n\nSo both 4207 and 4292 have the 4-4-0 wheel arrangement. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: I need to list each occurrence where either construct no is 4207 or 4292 and check their wheel arrangements.\n\nFor 4207 (row 0), the 'wheel arrange - ment' column has \"4 - 4 - 0\", which matches. So row_index 0, column_name 'wheel arrange - ment'.\n\nFor 4292 (row 1), same thing: 'wheel arrange - ment' is \"4 - 4 - 0\". So row_index 1, column_name 'wheel arrange - ment'.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"construction\" which refers to each row's construct no. So perhaps I should include both rows where construct no is 4207 and 4292. Also, since the claim refers to two constructions by Baldwin, those are specific.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 0: construct no 4207, wheel arrangement column.\n\nRow 1: construct no 4292, wheel arrangement column.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two entries in the 'construct - tion no' column (4207 and 4292), both having the 'wheel arrange - ment' of \"4 - 4 - 0\".

I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. The main points seem to be:\n\n1. The builder is \"brook\".\n2. The order was built in November 1881.\n3. The value of \"tc&stl no (1883 - 84)\" is more than 54.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different builder and their orders with various details. My task is to find rows where the builder is \"brook\" and check if any of those have an order date in November 1881 and a \"tc&stl no (1883 - 84)\" value over 54.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Builder is baldwin, so not relevant.\n- Row 1: Also baldwin. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Builder is porter. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: Mason. Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Another mason. Not relevant.\n- Row 5: Brooks. Date is November 1881. That fits the builder and date part.\n  - \"tc&stl no...\" here is 56, which is more than 54. So this row meets two conditions.\n- Row 6: Also brooks but in February 1882. Doesn't match the date.\n- Row 7: Brooks with order June 1883. Date doesn't match.\n- Row 8: July 1883. Not November.\n\nSo, only row 5 (index 5) matches both the builder and the date.

The claim says: \"there be only 2 construction (610 & 659) that have the wheel arrangement of 2 - 6 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to understand its structure. The columns are builder, construct - tion no, date ordered, wheel arrange - ment, s cylinder, engine weight, and tc&amp;stl no (1883 - 84). \n\nThe claim is specifically about construction numbers 610 and 659 having a wheel arrangement of \"2 - 6 - 0.\" So I need to find rows where the construct number is either 610 or 659 and check if their wheel arrangements match that.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The first builder is Baldwin with construct numbers 4207, 4292. Their wheel arrangements are 4-4-0 and 4-4-0 respectively. Not relevant.\n- Next, Porter has construct number 401, wheel arrangement 2-4-0. Not matching 2-6-0.\n- Mason has construct numbers 645 and 581. Both have different wheel arrangements: 2-6-6 t and 0-4-4 t. So no match here either.\n- Brooks is the builder with multiple entries. I need to check which ones:\n\nLooking at Brooks' rows:\n1. Construct 610, date November 1881, wheel arrangement 2-6-0. That's one construction number (610) matching the criteria.\n2. Construct 659, February 1882, wheel arrangement 2-6-0. That's another match.\n3. Then construct numbers 937 and 941 also for Brooks, but their wheel arrangements are still 2-6-0.\n\nWait, so Brooks has four entries: 610, 659, 937, 941. All of them have the wheel arrangement 2-6-0. So that means there are actually more than two constructions (specifically four) with this arrangement. \n\nTherefore, the claim says only two (610 and 659) but in reality, Brooks has more. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need all rows where construct number is 610 or 659 and check the wheel arrangement column. For each of these, their row indices are:\n\n- Construct 610: row index 4 (since rows start from 0? Wait, looking at the table, the first Brooks entry is 610 as row 6 if starting count from 1, but in programming terms, it's better to consider rows as 0-indexed. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the HTML table:\n\nRows are as follows:\n1. Baldwin\n2. Baldwin\n3. Porter\n4. Mason (645)\n5. Mason (581)\n6. Brooks (610)\n7. Brooks (659)\n8. Brooks (937)\n9. Brooks (941)\n\nSo if rows are 0-indexed, construct 610 is row 6 and 659 is row 7.\n\nWait no, the <tbody> has nine <tr> elements:\n\n- Row 0: Baldwin\n- Row 1: Baldwin\n- Row 2: Porter\n- Row 3: Mason (645)\n- Row 4: Mason (581)\n- Row 5: Brooks (610)\n- Row 6: Brooks (659)\n- Row 7: Brooks (937)\n- Row 8: Brooks (941)\n\nSo construct numbers 610 and 659 are in rows 5 and 6. Each of these rows has a \"wheel arrange - ment\" column, which for both is \"2 - 6 - 0\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are those two rows where the construct number is 610 or 659 and their wheel arrangement matches.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe claim says only two constructions (610 & 659) have the specified wheel arrangement. However, Brooks has multiple entries with that arrangement, so the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells are the ones for construct numbers 610 and 659, checking their wheel arrangements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wheel arrange - ment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wheel arrange - ment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table:\n\nThere are two rows for mason:\n1. Row with row_index 4: March 1881, s cylinder 13in, etc., tc&stl no 54.\n2. Row with row_index 5: Spring 1881, s cylinder 12in, tc&stl no 55.\n\nWait, the claim says \"November 1881\". None of the mason entries are in November 1881. The closest is March and Spring, which don't match. So there's a problem here\u2014maybe the claim is referring to an incorrect date.\n\nNext, checking the tc&stl no (1883-84) column for mason:\n- Row 4: 54\n- Row 5: 55\n\nThe claim says \"more than 54\", so 55 would satisfy that. However, the order was placed in March and Spring 1881, not November 1881 as claimed.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where builder is mason, specifically rows 4 and 5 for tc&stl no because they have values over 54, but since the date doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but if I'm looking at the table, row indices start from 0. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the first row after the headers is row 1: baldwin, then rows increase by 8 each time? Wait no, the rows are in the tbody as separate tr elements. So row 0 is index 0, but looking at the table:\n\nThe first tr after thead is row 0 (baldwin), next is row 1, and so on up to row 9.\n\nSo for mason, the two entries are row 4 and row 5?\n\nWait, let me count properly. The tbody has 8 rows? No, looking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: baldwin\n- Row 1: baldwin\n- Row 2: porter\n- Row 3: mason (645)\n- Row 4: mason (581)\n- Row 5: brooks (610)\n- Row 6: brooks (659)\n- Row 7: brooks (937)\n- Row 8: brooks (941)\n\nWait, no, the table has 9 rows in tbody? Wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the HTML code, the tbody has 9 tr elements, each with a row. So row indices are from 0 to 8.\n\nSo mason is at row 3 and row 4.\n\nRow 3: March 1881, tc&stl no 54\nRow 4: Spring 1881, tc&stl no 55\n\nSo the claim says November 1881. Neither of these entries are in November 1881. Therefore, there's a mismatch in dates. So even though their tc&stl numbers exceed 54, the order date doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the mason orders didn't occur in November 1881.

Looking at the table, there are two rows for Porter: row 3 (index 2) with order number 401, date November 1880, and tc&stl no 96; another row isn't listed as Porter, so only row index 2 is relevant.\n\nNext, \"build the order on november 1881\". The date in the table for Porter's entry is November 1880 (row 2, column 'date ordered'). So that doesn't match November 1881. Wait, but maybe I should check other builders? No, the claim specifically mentions Porter, so only Porter's entries are relevant.\n\nNow, \"of less than 54 tc&stl\". Looking at the 'tc&amp;stl no (1883 - 84)' column for Porter's row, it's 96. 96 is way more than 54, so that doesn't fit either. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread the claim.
