    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be 10.6 million viewers for episode part four that have a run time of 24:57.\" So, breaking it down, we're looking for two specific pieces of information in the table related to episode \"part four\".\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode with details like broadcast date, runtime, viewers, and archive type. The columns are episode, broadcast date, run time, viewers (in millions), and archive.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's an episode named \"part four\" that has 10.6 million viewers and a runtime of exactly 24:57.\n\nLet me look at each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Episode is \"part one\", viewers 8.7, runtime 24:15.\n2. **Row 1**: Episode \"part two\", viewers 7.0, runtime 24:10.\n3. **Row 2**: Episode \"part three\", viewers 6.6, runtime 23:30.\n4. **Row 3**: Episode \"part four\", viewers 10.6, runtime 24:57.\n\nSo, row index 3 corresponds to \"part four\". The runtime is indeed 24:57 and the viewers are 10.6 million. Therefore, all the claims in the statement are supported by this row.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The claim says \"there be 10.6 million viewers for episode part four that have a run time of 24:57.\" So both conditions must be met. In the table, yes, both are present in row 3.\n\nI think that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones in row index 3 for \"viewers (in millions)\" and \"run time\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
