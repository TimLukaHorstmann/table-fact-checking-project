    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"player gil morgan represent the united state tie for 7th place with -2 to par.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check each condition against the table.\n\n1. **Player Identification**: The claim mentions \"gil morgan.\" Looking at the table, I need to find the row where the player is gil morgan. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a row with \"gil morgan\" in the second column (player) and the country is united states. So, that's relevant.\n\n2. **Place**: The claim says \"tie for 7th place.\" In the table, each row has a 'place' value. Checking for gil morgan's row, the place is marked as t7, which stands for tied for 7th. That matches the claim.\n\n3. **To Par**: The claim mentions \"-2 to par.\" Looking at gil morgan's row in the 'to par' column, it says -2. So that part also checks out.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies between the claim and the table data for gil morgan. All relevant cells match what's stated.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about gil morgan, I identified the relevant cells by checking each condition against the table. The player's name, place, and to par all match the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
