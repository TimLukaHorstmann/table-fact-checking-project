The claim says: \"the record mph (km/h) speed at Coniston Water was set by Malcolm Campbell as pilot.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for cells related to Coniston Water and see if Malcolm Campbell was involved in setting a speed record there. I'll go through each row where \"Coniston Water\" appears.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- In row 23, column \"Location\": Coniston Water.\n- The \"Pilot\" column here is Donald Campbell, not Malcolm.\n- So this isn't relevant to Malcolm's record.\n\nNext, looking for Malcolm Campbell:\n- Row 3: \"Pilot\" is Malcolm, but location is something else, so not Coniston Water.\n- Further down, rows related to Bluebird K series have \"Pilot\" as Donald Campbell, which is different.\n\nI don't see any entries where both \"Coniston Water\" and \"Malcolm Campbell\" are present. All Coniston Water entries with speed records are associated with Donald Campbell, not Malcolm. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"On 31 December 1964, Donald Campbell pilot a Bluebird K7 at Lake Dumbleyung.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check each part of the claim against the table. Starting with the date, I look for any entries where the date is 31 December 1964. Scanning through the rows, I see that row 32 has \"26 june 1950\" and row 33 has \"7 july 1952.\" Then, moving further down, I find row 34: \"23 july 1955,\" row 35: \"16 november 1955,\" and so on. Hmm, the date \"31 december 1964\" isn't immediately obvious in the initial glance. \n\nWait, let me go through each row carefully. Row 37 is \"19 september 1956,\" row 38 is \"7 november 1957,\" row 39 is \"10 november 1958,\" and row 40 is \"14 may 1959.\" Then, row 41: \"31 december 1964\" appears here. So that's the date we're looking for.\n\nNext, I check if Donald Campbell was piloting a Bluebird K7 on that date. Looking at row 41, the pilot column says \"donald campbell,\" and the plane is listed as \"bluebird k7.\" That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNow, verifying the location, Lake Dumbleyung, I look for any entries with that name. Scanning through the table, I see row 42: \"lake dumbleyung\" on 31 December 1964. So all three aspects\u2014date, pilot, and location\u2014are correctly aligned in one of the rows.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 41,\n      \"column_name\": \"Pilot\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 41,\n      \"column_name\": \"Plane\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 41,\n      \"column_name\": \"Location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Their locations include \"ullswater,\" \"lake mead,\" \"coniston water,\" and \"lake dumbleyung.\" I don't see any entry with \"lake guntersville.\"\n\nFinally, checking the last few rows: row 31 is about \"hustler\" at \"lake guntersville,\" but the pilot there is \"lee taylor,\" not Donald Campbell.\n\nSo, there's no row where Donald Campbell is listed as the pilot at lake guntersville.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table. The claim states: \"On 14 May 1959, Donald Campbell was the pilot of Bluebird K7 at Lake Mead.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the date is 14 May 1959. Scanning through each row in the table, I don't see a direct match for that exact date. However, I do notice that there are entries for Donald Campbell and Bluebird K7 on different dates around that period.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's an entry where both the pilot is Donald Campbell and the plane is Bluebird K7 on 14 May 1959. Looking through each relevant row: \n\n- Row with row_index 13 has Donald Campbell as the pilot of Bluebird K7 on 31 December 1964 at Lake Dumbleyung.\n- There's another entry for Bluebird K7 on 19 September 1956 and 7 November 1957, but those are before and after May 1959.\n\nI don't see a specific row that matches the exact date of 14 May 1959 with both Donald Campbell as the pilot and Bluebird K7. However, there's another Bluebird K7 entry on 14 May 1959 at Lake Dumbleyung, but the pilot isn't specified, so it might not be Donald.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that row is for Lake Dumbleyung with a different date. The closest is row_index 13, which is 31 December 1964. So there's no exact match for 14 May 1959 in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not fully supported because there's no exact entry matching the date, pilot, and location specified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Bluebird K7\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
