    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nThe claim is: \"On date 2004 - 07 - 02, the venue be idrottsparken and djurg\u00e5rden scorer be sj\u00f6lund and johansson.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided to see if there's an entry that matches the date specified in the claim. The table has several rows, each with a 'date' column. Scanning through the dates:\n\n- 2004 - 05 - 05\n- 2004 - 05 - 21\n- 2004 - 07 - 02\n- 2004 - 07 - 14\n- 2004 - 10 - 20\n- 2004 - 11 - 06\n\nI see a row with date \"2004 - 07 - 02\". That's the date we're interested in, so I'll focus on that row.\n\nNext, let's check the 'venue' for this date. In the relevant row, the venue is listed as \"idrottsparken\". The claim states the venue should be idrottsparken, which matches exactly. So that condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, looking at the 'opponents' column. The table shows \"gif sundsvall\" as the opponent for this date. The claim doesn't mention the opponents, so I don't need to verify this part unless it's relevant, but since the claim only mentions venue and scorers, maybe it's not necessary.\n\nMoving on to the 'djurg\u00e5rden scorers' column. The claim specifies that the scorers should be \"sj\u00f6lund and johansson\". In the table, for the date 2004 - 07 - 02, the djurg\u00e5rden scorers are listed as \"arneng , makondele , den ouden\". Wait a minute, that doesn't match. The claim says sj\u00f6lund and johansson, but the table shows different names.\n\nHold on, I need to double-check if I read that correctly. Let me look again: for the date 2004 - 07 - 02, under 'djurg\u00e5rden scorers', it's \"arneng , makondele , den ouden\". So that doesn't include sj\u00f6lund or johansson.\n\nWait, but in another row, maybe? No, because we're specifically looking at the date mentioned in the claim. So the scorers for that exact date don't match what the claim says. That's a discrepancy.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misread the table. Let me count the rows again to ensure I'm on the right row. The first three rows after the header are 05-05, then 05-21, which is May and July? Wait, no: 2004 - 07 - 02 is mid-July, so it's correct.\n\nSo the scorers in the table for that date are arneng, makondele, den ouden. The claim says sj\u00f6lund and johansson, which aren't present here. Therefore, the scorer information doesn't match, meaning the claim is incorrect regarding that aspect.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if there's another row with the same date. Let me scan through all rows:\n\n- No, only one row has 2004 - 07 - 02.\n\nSo, the venue matches, but the scorers don't. Therefore, the claim is partially correct about the venue but incorrect about the scorers. Since the scorer information is part of the claim and it's wrong, the overall claim must be false.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, let me clarify: The claim says that on that date, two things must be true: venue and scorers. If either condition isn't met, the claim is false. So even though the venue is correct, if the scorers are wrong, the entire statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's a possibility of another row with the same date but different data. But in the table provided, each date appears once. Therefore, there's no other data point for 2004 - 07 - 02.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Venue matches: True\n- Scorers don't match: False\n\nSince one part is false, the overall claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider whether the scorers are listed correctly. Let me look again at the cell for 'djurg\u00e5rden scorers' in that row. It says \"arneng , makondele , den ouden\". So three players scored, none of whom are sj\u00f6lund or johansson as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the scorer part is incorrect, making the entire claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on a specific date, two conditions must be met: venue and scorers. The table confirms the venue correctly but shows different scorers. Since one condition isn't satisfied, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"djurg\u00e5rden scorers\"}\n  ]\n}",
