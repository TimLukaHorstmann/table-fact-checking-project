    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"It may come as a surprise, but Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the table are relevant to this claim. Looking at the table, I see that it lists several universities with their respective rankings in 2013 from three different sources: wur, arwu, and qs.\n\nDartmouth College is in row index 0, and the University of T\u00fcbingen is in row index 6. The columns for rankings are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". \n\nI need to compare Dartmouth's rankings against T\u00fcbingen's. Let's look at each ranking:\n\n1. For the wur column, Dartmouth is ranked 126th, while T\u00fcbingen is ranked 201-225th. Since 126 is less than 201, Dartmouth ranks higher here.\n\n2. For arwu, Dartmouth is in 151-200th place, and T\u00fcbingen is in 151-200th as well. They have the same rank in this category.\n\n3. For qs, Dartmouth is ranked 113th, and T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Again, 113 is less than 144, so Dartmouth ranks higher here.\n\nSince at least one ranking (wur) shows Dartmouth higher than T\u00fcbingen, the claim holds true in that context. However, I'm not sure if the other rankings are considered when determining overall rank. But according to the instructions, it's enough for the claim to be fully supported by any relevant ranking where Dartmouth is higher.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the wur and qs columns for both universities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it's late date of establishment.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It states that the University of Western Australia (UWA) performs better overall compared to Durham University, even though UWA was established later. So, the key points are comparing their overall performance and considering their establishment dates.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with various attributes like country, year established, and their world rankings from three different sources: wur, arwu, and qs for 2013.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find the relevant cells that compare UWA and Durham University. \n\nUWA is located in Australia, established in 1911. From the table, UWA's ranks are:\n- wur: 168th\n- arwu: 91st\n- qs: 134th\n\nDurham University is in the UK, established in 1832. Its ranks are:\n- wur: 80th\n- arwu: 201 - 300th\n- qs: 90th\n\nThe claim suggests that UWA does better than Durham overall despite being established later. So, I need to compare their rankings across all three indices.\n\nLet's compare each ranking:\n\n1. **wur (world rank by wur):**\n   - UWA: 168th\n   - Durham: 80th\n   UWA is ranked lower in wur than Durham.\n\n2. **aruw (world rank by arwu):**\n   - UWA: 91st\n   - Durham: 201-300th\n   Here, UWA ranks higher since it's within the top 100, while Durham is between 201-300.\n\n3. **qs (world rank by qs):**\n   - UWA: 134th\n   - Durham: 90th\n   Again, UWA is ranked lower than Durham.\n\nLooking at these rankings, it seems that in two out of three metrics, UWA is doing better or equal, but in one metric (wur), Durham is higher. The claim states that overall UWA does better despite being established later. \n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"overall performance,\" so perhaps we should consider all rankings together. If UWA is better in two and worse in one, it might not be considered overall better. However, the exact interpretation could vary. Additionally, the establishment date is 1911 for UWA versus 1832 for Durham, which is about 28 years later.\n\nHowever, the table shows that as of 2013, UWA has higher ranks in arwu and qs compared to Durham, but lower in wur. The claim says \"do better overall,\" so perhaps considering all three metrics together. Since two are better and one is worse, it's debatable whether this constitutes \"overall\" better performance.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to determine if the claim is fully supported by the table. The relevant cells for comparison would be their world ranks from each source and their establishment year.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- For UWA: row index 6 (since it's the last one), columns 'world rank by wur', 'world rank by arwu', 'world rank by qs'.\n- For Durham University: row index 1, same columns.\n\nTherefore, I'll need to include these cells in the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that UWA performs better overall than Durham despite a later establishment. The table shows UWA has higher ranks in two metrics (aruw and qs) and lower in one (wur). Since overall performance is subjective but supported by two positive rankings, the claim could be considered true based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by wur\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a university's ranking is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, and then identify which cells in the table are relevant for verifying that claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim thoroughly. The claim says: \"Overall, Durham University has the best rank, i.e., 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" \n\nBreaking this down, the key points are:\n1. **Subject**: Durham University\n2. **Ranking**: 80th position\n3. **Category**: World rank by - wur, 2013\n\nNext, I should look at the table provided to see if there's a matching entry that fits these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with its respective details. The columns relevant here are:\n- Members (though this refers to the university name, not directly related to rankings)\n- Country\n- Year established\n- World rank by - wur, 2013\n- World rank by arwu, 2013\n- World rank by qs, 2013\n\nSince we're focusing on \"world rank by - wur\", I should look at the corresponding column. In the table, under \"world rank by - wur , 2013,\" each entry corresponds to a university's ranking in that specific category.\n\nNow, let's examine Durham University's row:\n- Members: durham university\n- Country: uk\n- Year established: 1832\n- World rank by - wur, 2013: 80th\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim. The university is ranked 80th in the world by - wur in 2013.\n\nTo ensure there's no confusion, I should also check if any other row might have a higher or same ranking, but since the claim specifies \"best rank,\" we only need to confirm that Durham University holds that specific rank. There's no indication that another university has a better (i.e., higher) rank than 80th in this category.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Durham University's ranking is true, we'll check the relevant cells in the table.\n\nThe claim states that Durham University is ranked 80th in the \"world rank by - wur, 2013\" category. In the table, under this specific column, the entry for Durham University matches exactly with this claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by - wur , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Queen University of Canada's performance compared to Dartmouth College in three categories is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" Wait, that seems a bit off. Maybe it's saying that Queen University didn't perform as well as Dartmouth College across all three categories mentioned in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different university with various details. The relevant columns for comparison would be the ones that rank these universities: \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". \n\nWait, the table's headers are:\n- members\n- country\n- year established\n- world rank by the - wur , 2013\n- world rank by arwu , 2013\n- world rank by qs , 2013\n\nI think there might be a typo in the claim. It says \"queen university of canada,\" which I believe should be \"Queen University\" and it's likely referring to \"Queens University.\" Also, in the table, Queens University is present, not Queen University. So maybe that's a mistake.\n\nBut assuming the claim refers to Queens University as Queen University, let me proceed.\n\nSo, I need to check if Queens University did not do as well as Dartmouth College in all three ranking categories: WUR (world university rank), ARWU, and QS.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Dartmouth College is row 0.\n- Queens University is row 2.\n\nFor each category:\n1. WUR: Dartmouth is ranked 126th, while Queens is 226-250th. So Queens is lower than Dartmouth in this category.\n2. ARWU: Dartmouth is 151-200th, Queens is also 201-300th. Here, both are on the cusp but Queens seems to be in a higher range (201-300) compared to Dart's 151-200? Wait, no, 151-200 is better than 201-300. So Queens is lower than Dartmouth here.\n3. QS: Dartmouth is 113th, Queens is 189th. Again, Queens is lower.\n\nSo in all three categories, Queens University ranks lower than Dartmouth College. That means the claim that \"Queen University of Canada have not do as well as Dartmouth College in all 3 category\" would be true because they indeed performed worse across all three rankings.\n\nHowever, I should also check if the user meant to refer to Queens University correctly. The table has \"Queens University\" spelled as such, but the claim says \"Queen University.\" That might be a typo, so maybe it's about Queens instead of Queen. If that's the case, then yes, Queens did not perform as well in all three categories compared to Dartmouth.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be TRUE because Queens University's rankings are lower than Dartmouth's in all three metrics mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim says: \"give how it have have a great headstart , university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have not do as well as the other university , overall.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what's being claimed. It seems like the user is talking about universities having a good start or not doing well compared to others. Specifically, they mention \"university of t\u00fcbingen, germany\" not doing as well as the other universities.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to focus on the rows related to University of T\u00fcbingen and compare their performance metrics with others. The relevant columns for comparison would likely be their world ranks in 2013 according to the three different rankings: wur, arwu, and qs.\n\nFrom the table:\n- University of T\u00fcbingen is in row index 5.\n- Their rankings are: wur (201 - 225th), arwu (151 - 200th), and qs (144th).\n\nNow, I need to compare these with other universities. For example, looking at Durham University (row 1), their wur rank is 80th, which is much higher than T\u00fcbingen's 201-225. Similarly, arwu for Durham is 90th, higher than T\u00fcbingen's 151-200, and qs rank is 113th, which is better than T\u00fcbingen's 144th. So in all three rankings, T\u00fcbingen is ranked lower than Durham.\n\nComparing to Queens University (row 2), their wur is 201-300, same as T\u00fcbingen. arwu for Queens is 201-300, again matching T\u00fcbingen's range. qs rank for Queens is 189th, which is worse than T\u00fcbingen's 144th.\n\nFor University of Otago (row 3), wur is 226-250, same as T\u00fcbingen, but arwu is also 201-300, matching again, and qs is 155th, which is better than T\u00fcbingen's 144th.\n\nUniversity of Western Australia (row 6) has a wur rank of 168th, which is higher than T\u00fcbingen's 201-225. arwu is 91st, much higher, and qs is 134th, also better.\n\nSo in all three rankings, T\u00fcbingen's ranks are lower or equal to other universities listed. This suggests that the claim that T\u00fcbingen hasn't done as well as others is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells would be the ones for University of T\u00fcbingen (row 5) and comparing their columns with others. So, I'll include row_index=5 for each column where T\u00fcbingen's rank is lower than others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "dartmouth college have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Dartmouth College have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns in the table are relevant. Dartmouth College is in row 0, and the University of T\u00fcbingen is in row 5. The columns that matter for ranking are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" and \"world rank by arwu , 2013,\" and \"world rank by qs , 2013.\" However, since the claim only mentions overall rankings without specifying which one, I think the primary focus is on the first two columns, as QS ranks are also part of the data but might not be the main point here.\n\nLooking at Dartmouth's rankings: \n- In the \"world rank by the - wur\" column, Dartmouth is ranked 126th.\n- In \"world rank by arwu,\" they are between 151-200th, which is lower than 90th for T\u00fcbingen in the same column.\n\nFor the University of T\u00fcbingen:\n- They have a higher \"world rank by the - wur\" at 201-225th compared to Dartmouth's 126th. But wait, actually, 201-225th is numerically lower than 126th? No, because 126 is before 200. So in terms of numerical value, 126 is better (higher) than 201. Wait, but the claim says \"have never rank higher,\" so we need to see if Dartmouth's rank is ever higher.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. In ranking, lower numbers are better. So if Dartmouth is ranked 126th and T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th, then Dartmouth is higher (better) than T\u00fcbingen because 126 is less than 200. But looking at the specific columns:\n\nFor \"world rank by the - wur,\" Dartmouth is 126th, T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th. So Dartmouth's position here is better (higher) than T\u00fcbingen.\n\nBut in \"world rank by arwu,\" Dartmouth is 151-200th and T\u00fcbingen is 90th. Wait, that can't be right because the table shows T\u00fcbingen as 144th in QS. Let me check again:\n\nWait, no. The table's columns are:\n1. world rank by the - wur (T\u00fcbingen: 201-225)\n2. world rank by arwu (T\u00fcbingen: 144th, Dartmouth: 151-200)\n3. world rank by qs (T\u00fcbingen: 144th, Dartmouth:113th)\n\nSo for \"world rank by the - wur,\" T\u00fcbingen is in 201-225, which is worse than Dartmouth's 126.\n\nBut in \"arwu\" ranking, T\u00fcbingen is 90th, while Dartmouth is 151-200. So Dartmouth's arwu ranking is worse (lower) than T\u00fcbingen's.\n\nWait, but the claim says Dartmouth have never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. So we need to see if in any of these rankings Dartmouth is higher (i.e., has a lower numerical value). \n\nIn \"world rank by the - wur,\" Dartmouth is 126, which is better than T\u00fcbingen's 201-225. In \"arwu,\" Dartmouth is 151-200 vs. T\u00fcbingen's 90. So in arwu, T\u00fcbingen is higher (better). \n\nBut the claim says Dartmouth have never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. That would mean that across all rankings provided, Dartmouth is not higher than T\u00fcbingen. However, in \"world rank by the - wur,\" Dartmouth is higher (126th) compared to T\u00fcbingen's 201-225. So according to this ranking, Dartmouth has ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering all rankings together. If we look at the best possible rank for Dartmouth against T\u00fcbingen across all three columns:\n\nIn \"world rank by - wur,\" Dartmouth is 126 vs. T\u00fcbingen's 201-225: so Dartmouth higher.\n\nIn \"arwu,\" Dartmouth is 151-200 vs. T\u00fcbingen's 90: T\u00fcbingen higher.\n\nIn QS, Dartmouth is 113 vs. T\u00fcbingen's 144: Dartmouth higher.\n\nSo in two of the three rankings, Dartmouth ranks higher (126 and 113) compared to T\u00fcbingen (201-225 and 144). Therefore, based on these, Dartmouth has indeed ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen in some categories. So the claim is false because Dartmouth has ranked higher in at least one ranking.\n\nWait, but maybe the key here is that the claim says \"have never rank higher,\" implying across all rankings, Dartmouth's highest rank isn't better than T\u00fcbingen's best. But since in \"world rank by - wur\" Dartmouth is 126 and T\u00fcbingen is around 200+, Dartmouth is higher. Therefore, the claim is false because there exists a ranking where Dartmouth is higher than T\u00fcbingen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The relevant cells are for both institutions in the three ranking columns. So in row 0 and row 5, all three columns should be checked.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n- Row 0 (Dartmouth): \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" (126th)\n- Row 0: \"world rank by arwu , 2013\" (151-200th)\n- Row 0: \"world rank by qs , 2013\" (113th)\n- Row 5 (T\u00fcbingen): same columns.\n\nThe claim is whether Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. So we need to compare their rankings across these three columns.\n\nIn \"world rank by the - wur,\" Dartmouth is 126, T\u00fcbingen 201-225. So Dartmouth is higher here.\n\nIn \"arwu,\" T\u00fcbingen is 90, Dartmouth 151-200: T\u00fcbingen higher.\n\nIn QS, Dartmouth 113, T\u00fcbingen 144: Dartmouth higher.\n\nSo overall, in two out of three rankings, Dartmouth is higher. Therefore, the claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen is false because in some rankings, it's true.\n\nBut maybe the way to interpret \"have never rank higher\" is whether Dartmouth's best ranking across all metrics is not better than T\u00fcbingen's best. If Dartmouth's highest rank (say, 113 in QS) is higher than T\u00fcbingen's highest rank (90 in arwu), then Dartmouth has ranked higher.\n\nWait, no: the claim is that \"Dartmouth have never rank higher than T\u00fcbingen.\" So for all relevant rankings, Dartmouth's position is not better than T\u00fcbingen's. But since in at least one ranking (world rank by - wur and QS), Dartmouth is higher, this makes the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"rank higher\" refers to overall global ranking, but it's unclear.\n\nIn any case, based on the data provided, in some rankings, Dartmouth is higher than T\u00fcbingen. Therefore, the claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen is incorrect. So the answer would be that the statement is false because Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen in some metrics.\n\nBut to stick strictly to the question: am I tasked with determining whether the statement is true or not? Yes. Based on the data, since Dartmouth has a better (higher) rank than T\u00fcbingen in at least one metric, the statement that Dartmouth has never ranked higher is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that \"Dartmouth have never rank higher than T\u00fcbingen\" is **false**.\n\n- **Relevant Comparison:**\n  - In the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" category, Dartmouth (126th) ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen (201-225th).\n  - In the \"world rank by qs , 2013\" category, Dartmouth (113th) ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen (144th).\n\nSince Dartmouth performs better in at least two of the three ranking metrics compared to T\u00fcbingen, the claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because Dartmouth has ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen in some rankings.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about the University of Western Australia (UWA) is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"university of western australia do better in all ranking than durham university despite its late date of establishment.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. There are two main points here:\n\n1. UWA does better in all rankings compared to Durham University.\n2. Despite UWA being established later, it still outperforms Durham.\n\nI'll need to verify both points using the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different university with their respective details. The columns of interest are \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\", \"world rank by arwu , 2013\", and \"world rank by qs , 2013\". These seem to be the rankings for each university in three different ranking systems: WUR, ARWU, and QS.\n\nFirst, let's identify where UWA and Durham are in the table. \n\n- UWA is in row index 6 (since counting starts at 0, but wait, looking again, actually, the rows start from 0. Let me check:\n\nRow 0: Dartmouth College\nRow 1: Durham University\nRow 2: Queens University\nRow 3: University of Otago\nRow 4: University of T\u00fcbingen\nRow 5: University of Western Australia\n\nWait, that's not correct. The user provided the table with rows as follows:\n\nFirst row after <thead> is row index 0:\n- Row 0: Dartmouth College\n- Row 1: Durham University\n- Row 2: Queens University\n- Row 3: University of Otago\n- Row 4: University of T\u00fcbingen\n- Row 5: University of Western Australia\n\nSo, UWA is at row index 5. And Durham University is at row index 1.\n\nNow, checking the rankings for both:\n\nFor UWA (row 5):\n- WUR rank: 168th\n- ARWU rank: 91st\n- QS rank: 134th\n\nFor Durham University (row 1):\n- WUR rank: 80th\n- ARWU rank: 201 - 300th\n- QS rank: 90th\n\nWait, I think I need to parse the data correctly. Let me check each column's values again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 5 for UWA:\n- members: university of western australia\n- country: australia\n- year established: 1911\n- world rank by wur (2013): 168th\n- world rank by arwu (2013): 91st\n- world rank by qs (2013): 134th\n\nRow 1 for Durham:\n- members: durham university\n- country: uk\n- year established: 1832\n- world rank by wur (2013): 80th\n- world rank by arwu (2013): 201 - 300th\n- world rank by qs (2013): 90th\n\nSo, comparing their rankings:\n\n1. WUR:\n   - UWA: 168th\n   - Durham: 80th\n   So, in WUR, Durham is ranked higher than UWA.\n\n2. ARWU:\n   - UWA: 91st\n   - Durham: 201-300th (which is a lower rank)\n   Wait, but the scale here matters. If Durham is ranked 201-300, that's worse than being in the top 100. So UWA's 91st is better.\n\n3. QS:\n   - UWA: 134th\n   - Durham: 90th\n   Again, Durham ranks higher (90th) than UWA's 134th.\n\nSo, looking at all three rankings:\n\n- WUR: Durham > UWA\n- ARWU: UWA > Durham\n- QS: Durham > UWA\n\nTherefore, in two out of the three rankings, UWA does not do better than Durham. The claim states that UWA does better in \"all ranking\" than Durham, which is incorrect because WUR and QS have higher ranks for Durham.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the second part of the claim about establishment date: UWA was established in 1911, while Durham in 1832. So UWA was indeed established later, but that's not relevant to their rankings.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the University of Western Australia outperforms Durham University in all rankings despite being established later. However, analyzing the data shows that in WUR and QS rankings, Durham performs better than UWA. Only in ARWU does UWA rank higher. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about Durham University is true based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Durham University have the second - best rank, ie, 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" \n\nI should check each part of this claim against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with several columns. The relevant columns for this claim would likely be \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" since the claim mentions the world rank by WUR (which stands for World University Rankings). \n\nNext, I need to locate Durham University in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find that Durham University is indeed one of the institutions listed.\n\nNow, checking the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" column for Durham University. According to the table, their rank in this category is 80th. The claim says they are second best with a rank of 80th. Wait, \"second-best\" typically implies that someone else is first. But looking at the data, I don't see any other university ranked higher than 80th in WUR for 2013. However, the table only lists six universities, so it's possible that other universities not listed might have better ranks. Without knowing all universities, we can't definitively say they are second best. Therefore, the claim might be misleading or incorrect because there isn't enough information to confirm it as true.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that no other columns affect this conclusion. The \"year established\" and other rankings like ARWU and QS don't influence WUR, so they aren't relevant here.\n\nConsidering all this, the claim's statement might be false because we can't confirm it as second best without knowing about other universities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"queen university of canada have done better than dartmouth college in all 3 categories.\" Hmm, first thing I notice is that \"queen university\" might be a typo. Looking at the table, there's a row for \"queens university\" with the country as Canada and established year 1841. So it's probably Queens University, not Queen.\n\nNow, I need to check each category mentioned in the claim against the relevant cells in the table. The categories are world rank by wur, arwu, and qs, all from 2013. \n\nLooking at Dartmouth College (row index 0), its rankings are: 126th for wur, 151-200th for arwu, and 113th for qs. Queens University is in row index 2. For Queens, the rankings are 226-250th for wur, 201-300th for arwu, and 189th for qs.\n\nWait, but the claim says Queens did better than Dartmouth in all three categories. Let's compare each category:\n\n1. **wur**: Dartmouth is ranked 126th, Queens is 226-250th. Since 226-250 is higher numerically (i.e., a worse rank) than 126th, Queens did not do better here.\n\n2. **aruw**: Dartmouth is in the 151-200 range, and Queens is also 201-300. So both are on the lower side, but Queens' ranking starts at 201, which is numerically higher (worse) than Dartmouth's upper limit of 200. Wait, no, because 201-300 is a worse rank than 151-200? Actually, yes. Because in rankings, lower numbers mean better performance. So if Dartmouth is 151-200 and Queens is 201-300, Queens did not do better here either.\n\n3. **qs**: Dartmouth is 113th, Queens is 189th. Again, 113 is better than 189, so Dartmouth does better in QS rank.\n\nSo in all three categories, Dartmouth College outperforms Queens University. Therefore, the claim that Queens did better in all three categories is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim states that \"university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have rank the worst in every single ranking.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells in the table are relevant. The university in question is \"university of t\u00fcbingen\" and the country is \"germany.\" So, I'll look for their row in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row where the first cell is \"university of t\u00fcbingen\" and the second is \"germany.\" That's the fifth row (row_index 4).\n\nNow, let's examine each ranking. The columns are: world rank by the - wur, arwu, and qs, all from 2013.\n\nFor each ranking:\n- WUR: The cell says \"201 - 225th,\" which places them in the middle of their category.\n- ARWU: They're ranked between \"151 - 200th.\"\n- QS: They have the rank \"144th.\"\n\nNone of these rankings are the worst. The worst would typically be ranks like 1st, 10th, or close to bottom, but here they're in mid-range positions across all three rankings.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because university of t\u00fcbingen doesn't have the worst rank in any single ranking.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because \"university of t\u00fcbingen , germany\" does not hold the worst rank in every ranking column. \n\nRelevant cells checked:\n- row_index 4, columns: world rank by the - wur, arwu, qs\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
