    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"anka sk be the oldest club in turkish ice hockey\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It's stating that \"anka sk\" is the oldest club in Turkish ice hockey. So, to verify this, I need to look at how old each club is as listed in the 'founded' column.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six clubs:\n\n1. Ba\u015fkent Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131 - founded in 2004\n2. BB Ankara spor - founded in 1978\n3. Istanbul Paten - founded in 1987\n4. Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t - founded in 2000\n5. Polis Akademisi - founded in 1996\n6. Anka SK - founded in 1954\n\nNow, I'll list them with their founding years:\n\n- Anka SK: 1954\n- Polis Akademi: 1996\n- BB Ankara spor: 1978\n- Istanbul Paten: 1987\n- Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t: 2000\n- Ba\u015fkent Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131: 2004\n\nAmong these, Anka SK has the earliest founding year of 1954. The next oldest is Polis Akademi in 1996, followed by BB Ankara spor in 1978, Istanbul Paten in 1987, Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t in 2000, and Ba\u015fkent Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131 in 2004.\n\nSince Anka SK's founding year is the earliest, the claim that \"anka sk be the oldest club in turkish ice hockey\" appears to be TRUE based on the data provided. However, I should check if there are any other clubs not listed in the table that might be older. But since the table doesn't mention them, I can only consider the information given.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are where \"anka sk\" is located.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"2 clubs from the Turkish ice hockey super league didn't play at bel - pa arena.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and the data it contains. The table has columns for club name, home town, arena, founded year, and rank. There are six rows of data.\n\nThe claim mentions two clubs that didn't play at the \"bel - pa\" arena. So, my task is to find out which clubs are playing elsewhere besides \"bel - pa.\" \n\nI'll go through each row and check the arena column:\n\n1. The first club is \"ba\u015fkent y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131,\" playing at \"bel - pa.\"\n2. The second club is \"bb ankaraspor,\" also at \"bel - pa.\"\n3. The third club is \"istanbul paten\" at \"galleria.\"\n4. The fourth club is \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\" at \"kocaeli.\"\n5. The fifth club is \"polis akademisi\" at \"bel - pa.\"\n6. The sixth club is \"anka sk\" at \"bel - pa.\"\n\nNow, I need to count how many clubs are NOT playing at \"bel - pa.\" Looking at each row:\n\n- Istanbul paten: not at bel - pa \u2192 1\n- Kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t: not at bel - pa \u2192 2\n\nThe other four clubs are at bel - pa. So, there are only two clubs that didn't play there.\n\nThe claim states that \"2 clubs\" didn't play at bel - pa, which matches the data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells for verification.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"ankara be the home town of 4 of the club from the turkish ice hockey super league.\" So, the claim is saying that Ankara is the home town for four clubs in the Turkish Ice Hockey Super League.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists several clubs with their home towns. My task is to check how many clubs have \"ankara\" as their home town.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. The first row is \"ba\u015fkent y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131\" with a home town of Ankara.\n2. The second row is \"bb ankaraspor,\" also with Ankara as the home town.\n3. The third row is \"istanbul paten\" from Istanbul, so that's not Ankara.\n4. The fourth row is \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\" from Izmit, not Ankara.\n5. The fifth row is \"polis akademisi,\" again from Ankara.\n6. The sixth row is \"anka sk\" with Ankara as the home town.\n\nSo, counting these up: rows 1, 2, 5, and 6 are all from Ankara. That makes four clubs. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because there are indeed four clubs with Ankara as their home town.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other clubs from Ankara. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: Ankara\n- Row 1: Ankara\n- Row 2: Istanbul\n- Row 3: Izmit\n- Row 4: Ankara\n- Row 5: Ankara\n\nYes, four instances where the home town is Ankara.\n\nNow, considering the instructions on relevant cells. The columns we need are \"home town\" because that's what the claim refers to. So, for each row where \"home town\" is Ankara, I should note their indices and column name.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- Row 0: home town is Ankara\n- Row 1: same\n- Row 4: same\n- Row 5: same\n\nTherefore, these are the cells that confirm the claim.

The claim is: \"istanbul paten be rank 3 spot after kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t club.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that Istanbul Paten has a rank of 3rd and comes after Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t in the ranking. So, I need to check if Istanbul Paten's rank is indeed 3rd and whether it's positioned after Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different club with various attributes like home town, arena, founded year, and rank. The clubs listed are:\n\n1. Ba\u015fkent Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131\n2. BB Ankaraspor\n3. Istanbul Paten\n4. Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t\n5. Polis Akademisi\n6. Anka SK\n\nEach row has a \"rank\" column, which indicates their position. For instance:\n\n- Istanbul Paten is ranked 4th.\n- Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t is ranked 1st.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether Istanbul Paten's rank is 3rd. From the table, it's clearly stated as \"4th\" in the rank column. That already contradicts the claim because it says \"rank 3 spot.\" So this part of the claim is false.\n\nAdditionally, even if the rank were correct, the term \"after\" might imply that Istanbul Paten comes after Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t in the ranking order. Since Kocaeli has a higher rank (1st), it would logically come before Istanbul Paten (4th). So the claim's second part is also incorrect.\n\nNow, to support this answer with relevant cells from the table. The relevant columns are \"rank\" because that's directly related to both parts of the claim. For Istanbul Paten, we look at row index 2 (since it's the third row after the header), and for Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t, it's row index 3.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 2, column \"rank\" (Istanbul Paten's rank is 4th)\n- Row 3, column \"rank\" (Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t's rank is 1st)\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Istanbul Paten doesn't have a rank of 3rd and isn't after Kocaeli in the ranking.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"bb ankaraspor have the last rank in the turkish ice hockey super league.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It lists various clubs with their details like club name, home town, arena, founded year, and rank. The relevant column here is the \"rank\" column because it directly relates to the claim about their position in the league.\n\nLooking through the table, I can see each row corresponds to a different club. The claim specifically mentions \"bb ankaraspor,\" so I need to find the row where the club name is \"bb ankaraspor.\" \n\nSearching the table, the second row (row index 1) has the club name as \"bb ankaraspor.\" In that row, the \"rank\" column says \"6th.\" The claim states that they have the last rank. Now, I need to figure out what the last rank corresponds to in this context.\n\nIn many leagues, lower numerical ranks mean higher positions (like 1st is first place), so higher numbers would be worse positions. If \"last rank\" refers to the lowest position, then 6th might not be the absolute last unless there are only six teams. However, the table doesn't specify how many teams are in the league. Without knowing the total number of teams, I can't confirm whether 6th is the last possible rank.\n\nAlternatively, if \"last rank\" implies being in the lowest position among all teams, but if there's a team ranked lower than 6th, like maybe 7th, then bb ankaraspor wouldn't be last. But since the table only shows up to 5th place (with ranks from 1st to 6th), it's unclear without additional information.\n\nSo, based on the given data, I can't definitively determine that bb ankaraspor is last in the league because their rank of 6th might not be the absolute last. There's no way to confirm this solely from the table provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about \"polis akademisi\" being founded in 1954 and therefore being the oldest club in Turkish ice hockey is true or false. Let me start by looking at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should locate where \"polis akademisi\" is in the table. Scanning through each row's first column: b\u00e1s kent y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131, bb ankaraspor, istanbul paten, kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t, polis akademisi, and ank\u0131 sk. There it is in the fifth row (row_index 5? Wait, no, rows start at index 0. So first row is index 0: b\u00e1s kent..., second is index 1: bb ankaraspor, third index2: istanbul..., fourth index3: kocaeli..., fifth index4: polis akademisi, sixth index5: ank\u0131 sk.\n\nSo \"polis akademisi\" is in row 4 (index 4) of the table. Now I need to check two things: its founding year and whether it's the oldest.\n\nLooking at the columns, the relevant ones for this claim are 'founded' and possibly 'rank', but the claim only mentions the founding year. So the key column here is \"founded\".\n\nIn row 4 (polis akademisi), the founded value is 1996. Wait, that's different from what the claim says. The claim states it was founded in 1954, but according to the table, it's 1996. That means there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the row indices. Let me double-check: the first row after thead is row 0, which is index 0, then each subsequent row increments by one. So:\n\nRow 0: b\u00e1s kent y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131\nRow1: bb ankaraspor\nRow2: istanbul paten\nRow3: kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\nRow4: polis akademisi\nRow5: ank\u0131 sk\n\nYes, so row4 is indeed polis akademisi with founded 1996.\n\nSo the claim says \"polis akademisi was founded in 1954...\" but according to the table, it's 1996. That makes the first part of the claim incorrect. Therefore, the entire statement is false because the founding year doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, even if we consider other clubs for being the oldest, since \"polis akademisi\" isn't the one with the earliest founded date, the second part about it being the oldest club in Turkish ice hockey would also be wrong.\n\nSo putting this together, the claim is false. Now I need to find which cells are relevant. The 'founded' column for row4 (polis akademisi) is key because that's where the incorrect information is.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. The table has several columns: club, home town, arena, founded, and rank. The claim mentions \"every club from the turkish ice hockey super league,\" so my focus should be on verifying if all clubs in that league are listed in the table and whether they have played at the Bel - Pa Arena.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Club is \"ba\u015fkent y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131\" with arena \"bel - pa\". So this club has played there.\n2. **Row 1**: Club is \"bb ankaraspor\" with arena \"bel - pa\". Another one playing there.\n3. **Row 2**: Club is \"istanbul paten\" with arena \"galleria\". This one doesn't play at Bel - Pa.\n4. **Row 3**: Club is \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\" with arena \"kocaeli\". Not at Bel - Pa.\n5. **Row 4**: Club is \"polis akademisi\" with arena \"bel - pa\". So they do play there.\n6. **Row 5**: Club is \"anka sk\" with arena \"bel - pa\". They also play there.\n\nNow, the claim says that every club from the Turkish Ice Hockey Super League has played at Bel - Pa. From the table, some clubs like Istanbul Paten and Kocaeli BB Ka\u011f\u0131t do not have their arena as Bel - Pa. This suggests that those particular clubs might not have played there.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider whether all clubs in the Turkish league are represented in this table. The table lists six clubs, but I don't know if these represent all the teams in the league or just a subset. If there are other clubs not listed here, their arenas are unknown based on this data.\n\nFurthermore, while some clubs (like Baskent Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar\u0131, BB Ankaraspor, Polis Akademisi, and ANKA SK) have played at Bel - Pa, others haven't, so the claim that every club has done so isn't supported by the table provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim is FALSE because not all listed clubs have played at Bel - Pa Arena.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"arena\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"arena\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"arena\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"arena\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"bb ankaraspor be in second rank in the turkish ice hockey super league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the information provided.\n\nThe claim mentions \"bb ankaraspor,\" so I need to look for that exact name in the table. Looking at the 'club' column, there's a row with \"bb ankaraspor.\" That's in row index 1. \n\nNext, the claim says they're in second rank. In the table, each club has a 'rank' associated with it. For \"bb ankaraspor,\" their rank is listed as \"6th.\" So that's not second; it's sixth. \n\nWait, but I should check if there might be another interpretation. Maybe the claim refers to the league standings elsewhere, but based solely on the table provided, only the 'rank' column exists, and \"bb ankaraspor\" is 6th. There's no indication that their rank has changed since the data was collected or that this is a recent update.\n\nSo, since \"bb ankaraspor\" is ranked 6th, not second, the claim isn't accurate based on the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
