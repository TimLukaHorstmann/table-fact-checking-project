    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"43243 live birth have a migration of -14873\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that there's a specific number of live births and a corresponding migration. So I should check each row for a live births value matching 43,243 and see what the migration figure is in that same row.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row's live births column:\n\n- Row 0: 49,291\n- Row 1: 47,464\n- Row 2: 45,559\n- Row 3: 44,843\n- Row 4: 46,370\n- Row 5: 43,243 \u2192 This matches the live births number in the claim.\n- Row 6: 43,385\n- Row 7: 43,112\n- Row 8: 42,782\n- Row 9: 40,508\n- Row 10: 39,673\n- Row 11: 39,348\n\nSo in row 5, live births are 43,243. Now I need to check the migration for that same row.\n\nLooking at the 'migration' column in row 5, it says -15,000. The claim states a migration of -14,873, which doesn't match because -15,000 is not equal to -14,873. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Row 11 has live births as 39,348, but the claim is about 43,243, so row 5 is correct.\n\nIn row 5, migration is -15,000, which doesn't match the claim's -14,873. Therefore, the numbers don't align.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"live births\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"migration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
