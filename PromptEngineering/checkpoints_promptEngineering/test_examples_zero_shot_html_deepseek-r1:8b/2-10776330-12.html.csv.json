    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mcg be the venue when the crowd be more than 29000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to be making two points: one about the venue being McGraw (mcg), and another about the crowd size exceeding 29,000. So both conditions need to be checked against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The columns relevant here are \"venue\" and \"crowd\".\n\nThe claim is making two specific statements:\n1. The venue was mcg.\n2. The crowd size for that game was more than 29,000.\n\nSo I need to check each row in the table to see if any match both of these conditions.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Venue is western oval. Crowd is 16648. Neither condition met.\n\nRow 1: Venue is windy hill. Crowd is 12800. No match.\n\nRow 2: Venue is victoria park. Crowd is 20700. Not mcg, so no.\n\nRow 3: Venue is princes park. Crowd is 14636. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4: Venue is lake oval. Crowd is 13860. Nope.\n\nRow 5: Venue is mcg. Crowd is 29947. Ah, this matches both conditions! The venue is mcg and the crowd is over 29,000.\n\nWait, let me double-check that row. Yes, row index starts at 0, so row 5 would be the sixth entry. It shows melbourne as the home team, fitzroy as away, mcg venue, 29947 crowd. That's exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo, since there is at least one row where both conditions are met, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to identify which cells correspond to the claim. The venue is in the \"venue\" column and crowd in \"crowd\". So for row 5, these two columns are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks that there's a match where mcg was the venue and the crowd exceeded 29,000. The table has such an entry in row 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that every match in the table occurred on July 8th, 1961. So I need to check each row to see if all games have this date.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows. Each row represents a different match between teams with their scores and venue details. The 'date' column is of particular interest here.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Date is \"8 july 1961\" \u2013 matches the claim.\nRow 1: Same date \u2013 matches.\nRow 2: Also same date \u2013 matches.\nRow 3: Again, same date \u2013 matches.\nRow 4: Same date \u2013 matches.\nRow 5: Same date as well \u2013 matches.\n\nSince all six rows have the date \"8 july 1961\", the claim that all matches were held on this date is TRUE. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to say that in a game where north melbourne was the away team, the crowd size was the smallest among all games listed. So, my goal is to check if there's any row where 'north melbourne' is the away team and has the least crowd number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, etc. I'll go through each row to see if it matches the claim.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Home team: footscray\n- Away team: richmond\nNot north melbourne, so skip.\n\nSecond row:\n- Home team: essendon\n- Away team: north melbourne\nThis is a match where north melbourne is the away team. I need to note this row and check its crowd number.\nCrowd: 12800\n\nThird row:\n- Home team: collingwood\n- Away team: geelong\nNot relevant.\n\nFourth row:\n- Home team: carlton\n- Away team: st kilda\nNo match for north melbourne.\n\nFifth row:\n- Home team: south melbourne\n- Away team: hawthorn\nNot applicable.\n\nSixth row:\n- Home team: melbourne\n- Away team: fitzroy\nAgain, not north melbourne.\n\nSo the only relevant row is the second one where north melbourne is the away team.

The key elements are:\n\n1. Away team score is 6.8 (44).\n2. Melbourne is playing a home game.\n3. The venue is McG.\n\nNow, looking at the table, it's structured with columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI need to check if there's any row where the away team scored 6.8 (44), Melbourne is playing as the home team, and the venue is McG.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\n1. First row: Home team is Footscray, away is Richmond. Not Melbourne.\n2. Second row: Home is Essendon, away North Melbourne. No Melbourne as home.\n3. Third row: Home is Collingwood, away Geelong. Not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Home is Carlton, away St Kilda. Nope.\n5. Fifth row: Home is South Melbourne, away Hawthorn. Not Melbourne as home.\n6.

The away team's score is 6.8 (44), which matches the first part of the claim. The venue is listed as McG, which matches the third point.

I need to check if any row in the table has exactly this score for the home team. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: Home team is footscray with 6.6 (42). Not matching.\n2. Second row: Home team is essendon with 9.9 (63). This matches the claimed score.\n3. Third row: Collingwood scored 5.11, so no.\n4. Carlton has 9.8, not 9.9.\n5. South Melbourne has 7.7, nope.\n6.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mcg be the venue where the crowd be under 20000\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that McG (I think that's Melbourne Cricket Ground) is the venue where the crowd was under 20,000. So I need to check if there's a row in the table where the venue is \"mcg\" and the crowd number is less than 20,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, venue, and crowd. The venue column has various venues, and the crowd column has numbers. I need to find the rows where the venue is \"mcg\".\n\nScrolling through the rows:\n\n1. First row: venue is \"western oval\" \u2013 not mcg.\n2. Second row: venue is \"windy hill\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Third row: venue is \"victoria park\" \u2013 still not.\n4. Fourth row: venue is \"princes park\" \u2013 no.\n5. Fifth row: venue is \"lake oval\" \u2013 no.\n6. Sixth row: venue is \"mcg\" \u2013 yes, this is the one.\n\nNow, for that row (row index 6), check the crowd number. The crowd is listed as 29947. That's way over 20,000. So the claim says the crowd was under 20k, but here it's almost 30k.\n\nWait, did I count the rows correctly? Let me double-check the row indices. The first data row is index 0 or does it start at 1? Looking back, in the example provided, the relevant_cells started with row_index 0, which corresponds to the first data row. So in this case, the mcg row is the sixth one, but depending on how they are indexed.\n\nAssuming that the rows are zero-indexed as per standard practice, so:\n\n- The first row after the header is index 0.\n- Then it goes up to index 5 for the last data row before mcg at index 6? Wait no, in the table, there's only six data rows. Let me count: the first data row is the one with footscray as home team, that would be row 0 (index 0). Then each subsequent row increments by 1. So the last row is index 5.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table, there are six <tr> elements in the tbody. So the first data row is index 0, second index 1, up to fifth index 5. Wait, but in the JSON example, relevant_cells included row indices starting from 0, so each row after the header counts as one.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user's instruction says \"row_index\" is an integer, which suggests that it's zero-based. So the first data row is index 0, second is 1, etc., up to index 5 for the last row in the table.\n\nIn that case, the mcg row is at index 5 (since there are six data rows: indices 0 to 5). Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: footscray\n- Row 1: essendon\n- Row 2: collingwood\n- Row 3: carlton\n- Row 4: south melbourne\n- Row 5: melbourne\n\nWait, no. Wait, the last data row is \"melbourne\" vs fitzroy at mcg with 29947 crowd. So that's index 5.\n\nTherefore, in the table:\n\n- The venue for row 5 (index 5) is \"mcg\".\n- The crowd is 29947, which is above 20,000.\n\nSo the claim says the crowd was under 20k at mcg, but the actual crowd was almost 30k. So the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, I need to provide a JSON object with answer as \"FALSE\" and relevant_cells pointing to the row where venue is mcg, which is row index 5.\n\nWait, no: in the table, the last row before the header? No, wait the HTML shows that each <tr> is a data row. So in the tbody, there are six <tr> elements, meaning rows 0 through 5. The melbourne vs fitzroy game is the sixth one, so index 5.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include that row (index 5) and the column \"crowd\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that at McG (Melbourne Cricket Ground), the crowd was under 20,000. Checking the table, the McG venue corresponds to the last data row with a crowd of 29,947, which is above 20,000. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table and identify relevant cells.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It seems like it's saying that all matches are held on different days. But looking at the table, I see that some matches might be on the same day. So, I need to verify if this is true or false.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column in the table, every row has \"8 july 1961\" as the date. That means all the matches listed here took place on the same day. Therefore, the claim that all matches are held on different days is incorrect because they're all on the same day.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which cells are relevant to verify this. The 'date' column is directly related to the claim since it shows when each match occurred. So, every row's date is important here.\n\nI'll list out all the rows and their respective dates:\n\n- Row 0: 8 July 1961\n- Row 1: 8 July 1961\n- Row 2: 8 July 1961\n- Row 3: 8 July 1961\n- Row 4: 8 July 1961\n- Row 5: 8 July 1961\n\nEach of these rows has the same date, which is the key point.

The claim is: \"north melbourne be the home team where the attendance be lowest.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into its components. It's saying two things:\n1. North Melbourne is the home team.\n2. Their attendance was the lowest among all teams.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd size, and date. Since all matches are on 8 July 1961, the date doesn't affect the comparison.\n\nTo verify the first part of the claim, I need to check if North Melbourne is listed as a home team in any row. Scanning through each row's \"home team\" column: footscray, essendon, collingwood, carlton, south melbourne, and melbourne. I don't see North Melbourne here. So the first part of the claim is false because North Melbourne isn't a home team in this table.\n\nHowever, since the first part is false, even if the second part about attendance being lowest were true, the overall claim would still be false.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the home team score be 6.8 (44) , when melbourne play in mcg\". So, this statement has two main parts. The first part refers to a specific home team score of 6.8 (44). The second part specifies that the game is played at the venue called \"mcg\" when Melbourne is the home team.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's an HTML table with headers: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different match, probably on the same day since all the dates are \"8 july 1961\".\n\nNow, I need to find if there's a row where:\n1. The home team is Melbourne.\n2. The home team scored 6.8 (44).\n3. The venue is McG.\n\nSo, starting with the first condition: checking which rows have Melbourne as the home team. Scanning through each row:\n- Row 0: footscray (no)\n- Row 1: essendon (no)\n- Row 2: collingwood (no)\n- Row 3: carlton (no)\n- Row 4: south melbourne (no)\n- Row 5: melbourne (yes)\n\nSo, only row 5 has Melbourne as the home team.\n\nNext, check the home team score for that row. The \"home team score\" column in row 5 is \"6.8 (44)\". That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nThen, checking the venue. The venue for row 5 is listed as \"mcg\". So that's a match for the second part of the claim.\n\nPutting it all together: In row 5, when Melbourne plays at McG, their score was indeed 6.8 (44). All conditions are met, so the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other rows or columns that might affect this conclusion. Each row is a separate game, and since all have the same date, they're likely on the same day. There's only one Melbourne match, so no confusion there.\n\nAlso, checking if the score format \"6.8 (44)\" matches exactly. The table uses \"6.8 (44)\", which aligns perfectly with the claim. No typos or discrepancies noticed.\n\nSo, all relevant cells are found in row 5, specifically the home team and venue columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the away team score be 9.9 (63) , when north melbourne play away at windy hill.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions two specific things: the away team's score and the venue where the game took place.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns relevant here are \"away team,\" \"home team,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" and \"date.\" \n\nThe first part of the claim is about the away team's score being 9.9 (63). I need to find in the table if any row has an away team with that score when playing at windy hill.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row: home team is footscray, away team is richmond, score is 4.9 (33), venue is western oval.\n2. Second row: home team essendon, away team north melbourne, score 3.10 (28), venue windy hill.\n   - Here, the away team is north melbourne, and the score is 3.10 (28). That's not 9.9 (63).\n3. Third row: collingwood vs geelong at victoria park. Doesn't match.\n4. Fourth row: carlton vs st kilda at princes park. No match.\n5. Fifth row: south melbourne vs hawthorn at lake oval. Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: melbourne vs fitzroy at mcg. Doesn't apply.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. The second row has the away team as north melbourne and venue windy hill. Their score is 3.10 (28). So that's not matching 9.9 (63).\n\nBut then, looking back, maybe I should check if any row has an away team named north melbourne with a score of 9.9 (63) at windy hill.\n\nWait, the second row: home team is essendon, away is north melbourne, score 3.10 (28), venue windy hill. So that's not matching.\n\nIs there another row where north melbourne is the away team? Let me check again.\n\nNo, in this table, each game is between two teams. The second row is the only one where north melbourne is the away team at windy hill, but their score is 3.10 (28), not 9.9 (63).\n\nSo there's no match where the away team is north melbourne with a score of 9.9 (63) at windy hill.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row.\n\nLooking at the claim again: when north melbourne plays away at windy hill, their score should be 9.9 (63). So in the table, find rows where the away team is north melbourne and venue is windy hill. The second row fits that but has a different score. No other rows have both those conditions.\n\nTherefore, there's no such match in the table supporting the claim. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]}",
