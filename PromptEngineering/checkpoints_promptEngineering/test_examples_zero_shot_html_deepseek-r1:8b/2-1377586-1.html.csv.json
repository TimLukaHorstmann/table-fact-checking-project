    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"jason gillespie have the highest score out of all the player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns: player, team, score, versus, and year. The rows contain data about different players with their corresponding scores.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"jason gillespie\" having the highest score among all players in the table. So, my first step is to locate Jason Gillespie's entry in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has a player named \"nasim - ul - ghani.\"\n2. The second row is \"tony mann.\"\n3. The third row is \"syed kirmani.\"\n4. The fourth and fifth rows are \"mark boucher.\"\n5. The sixth row is \"jason gillespie.\"\n\nSo, Jason Gillespie is in the sixth row (row_index 6). Now, I need to check his score against all other players' scores to see if it's the highest.\n\nJason Gillespie's score is 201 not out. Let me list all the scores:\n\n- nasim - ul - ghani: 101\n- tony mann: 105\n- syed kirmani: 101 not out\n- mark boucher (first occurrence): 125\n- mark boucher (second occurrence): 108\n- jason gillespie: 201 not out\n\nComparing these, the highest score is indeed Jason Gillespie's 201 not out. None of the other players have a higher score than this.\n\nNow, I need to determine which cells are relevant. The claim refers to \"jason gillespie\" and whether his score is the highest. Therefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The cell containing Jason Gillespie's name (player column) in row 6.\n2. The cell containing his score (score column) in row 6.\n\nThese two cells are essential because they directly provide the information needed to verify the claim.\n\nI should make sure that I'm only including cells that are necessary and directly related. Since the claim is about the highest score, we're focusing on the score column for Jason Gillespie, as well as his name to confirm it's him.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with \"answer\" as \"TRUE\" since the claim holds based on the table data, and include the relevant cells as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the task step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"syed kirmani and nasim - ul - ghani have the same score.\" My goal is to verify this by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has columns for player, team, score, versus, and year. The players mentioned in the claim are Syed Kirmani and Nasim-ul-Ghani.\n\nI'll start by locating each of these players in the table. \n\nFor Syed Kirmani:\n- Scanning through each row, I find him in the third row (row_index 2).\n- His score is listed as \"101 not out.\"\n\nFor Nasim-ul-Ghani:\n- He's in the first row (row_index 0).\n- His score is 101.\n\nNow, comparing their scores: Syed Kirmani scored 101 not out, while Nasim-ul-Ghani scored 101. At first glance, they both have \"101\" as part of their scores. However, I notice that Syed's score includes the term \"not out,\" which might indicate a different context or method of recording the score, but numerically, both are 101.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify whether it considers \"101 not out\" equivalent to 101. Since the numerical value is the same, even if one has additional information, I should consider them equal for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, both players have scores that are numerically the same (101), which supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"syed kirmani and nasim - ul - ghani have the same score,\" we need to check their respective score cells in the table. \n\n1. **Locate Syed Kirmani's row**: Found in row 2, where his score is \"101 not out.\"\n2. **Locate Nasim-ul-Ghani's row**: Found in row 0, where his score is 101.\n\nBoth scores are numerically equal (101), so the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2 player in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from australia\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two players who are part of the nightwatchman role in cricket and that both of them are from Australia. So, I need to look for players listed as \"nightwatchman\" (cricket) and see if any two of them are from Australia.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice it has a column named \"player,\" \"team,\" \"score,\" \"versus,\" and \"year.\" There's no direct mention of a role like \"nightwatchman,\" so I might need to infer based on the context. In cricket, a nightwatchman is often a batsman who comes in late and stays at the crease to face the remaining overs of the innings.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if any player's team is Australia. \n\n- Row 0: Player from Pakistan, so not relevant.\n- Row 1: Tony Mann is from Australia. That's one player.\n- Row 2: Syed Kirmani is from India, so no.\n- Row 3: Mark Boucher from South Africa, nope.\n- Row 4: Another Mark Boucher, same as above.\n- Row 5: Jason Gillespie from Australia. That's the second.\n\nSo, I found two players from Australia: Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie. Now, do these players have a role associated with being nightwatchmen? The term \"nightwatchman\" isn't explicitly stated in the table, but based on typical cricket terminology, any batsman who comes in late to face remaining overs could be considered a nightwatchman.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct as there are two players from Australia who might fit the role of nightwatchmen. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the rows for Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman (cricket)\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions \"England play 2 times in the nightwatchman (cricket).\" The word \"nightwatchman\" refers to a cricket term, typically used for a player who comes in late to bat and usually plays as a substitute or to fill in for other batsmen. So, the claim is suggesting that England has had two players named Nightwatchman who played in the same year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a player with their details: name, team, score, versus, and year. The team column has \"england\" as one of the entries, so I should focus on rows where the team is England.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Player is nasim - ul - ghani, team pakistan, score 101 vs england in 1962.\n2. Second row: Tony Mann, Australia, 105 vs India in 1977.\n3. Third row: Syed Kirmani, India, 101 not out vs Australia in 1979.\n4. Fourth row: Mark Boucher, South Africa, 125 vs Zimbabwe in 1999.\n5. Fifth row: Mark Boucher again, same team, score 108 vs England in 1999.\n6. Sixth row: Jason Gillespie, Australia, 201 not out vs Bangladesh in 2006.\n\nNow, looking for the term \"nightwatchman\" in any of these rows. I don't see any player name that includes \"nightwatchman.\" The players are all real names or have unique identifiers like nasim - ul - ghani, which doesn't seem to be a Nightwatchman. \n\nThe claim says \"england play 2 time,\" but without specific names of players, it's unclear which two players they're referring to. Since the term \"nightwatchman\" isn't present in any player name or score, I don't see evidence supporting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about England playing twice with a nightwatchman in cricket is true, we need to check if there are two players named \"nightwatchman\" from England in the table. \n\n1. **Identify Rows for England**: Only rows where the team is England are relevant. From the table, only one row matches this condition:\n   - Row 5: Mark Boucher, South Africa, score 108 vs England in 1999.\n\n2. **Check for \"nightwatchman\" Term**: There's no player named \"nightwatchman\" in any row. The term doesn't appear in the score or anywhere else.\n\nSince there's only one player from England and no mention of a nightwatchman, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Jason Gillespie's score being more than double that of Nasim ul Ghani is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: player, team, score, versus, and year. The rows contain data about different players, their teams, scores, the opponents they played against, and the year of the match.\n\nThe claim is specifically comparing Jason Gillespie's score to Nasim ul Ghani's score. So I need to find these two players in the table and extract their respective scores.\n\nStarting with Nasim ul Ghani: scanning through the rows, I see that he is listed in the first row. His score is 101. \n\nNext, looking for Jason Gillespie, he is in the sixth row. His score is 201 not out.\n\nNow, the claim says Jason's score is more than double of Nasim's. To check this, I'll perform the calculation: 2 * 101 equals 202. Since Jason scored 201, which is just one less than double, it doesn't meet the condition of being strictly more than double (i.e., greater than 202). \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because 201 is not more than double 101.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we compare Jason Gillespie's score to Nasim ul Ghani's score. Jason scored 201, while Nasim scored 101. Since 2 * 101 = 202 and 201 < 202, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for all instances of \"mark boucher\" and \"tony mann\" in the table. \n\nLooking at the 'player' column:\n- The first row has \"nasim - ul - ghani\".\n- The second row is \"tony mann\".\n- The third is \"syed kirmani\".\n- The fourth is \"mark boucher\".\n- The fifth is another \"mark boucher\".\n- The sixth is \"jason gillespie\".\n\nSo, \"mark boucher\" appears twice and \"tony mann\" once. \n\nNow, I need to check their scores. For each occurrence of \"mark boucher\", I look at the 'score' column. \n- First \"mark boucher\": score is 125.\n- Second \"mark boucher\": score is 108.\n\nFor \"tony mann\", the score is 105.\n\nThe claim says that Mark Boucher's scores are higher than Tony Mann's. Let's compare each of Mark Boucher's scores with Tony Mann's.\n\nFirst, 125 vs 105: 125 is higher.\nSecond, 108 vs 105: 108 is also higher.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify which Mark Boucher or if it refers to both instances. However, in the table, there are two separate entries for Mark Boucher, each with their own scores. But the claim seems to be a general statement that \"Mark Boucher\" has a higher score than \"Tony Mann\". \n\nLooking at Tony Mann's score of 105, does it mean that any of Mark Boucher's scores (125 and 108) are higher? Yes, both are higher. So the claim holds true.\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row is a separate entry, so if there are multiple Mark Bouchers, do we need to consider all relevant cells?\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- The first Mark Boucher's score (row 3, column \"score\")\n- The second Mark Boucher's score (row 4, column \"score\")\n\nAnd for Tony Mann, it's row 1, column \"score\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include these three.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two players from Pakistan involved in the nightwatchman role in cricket. The term \"nightwatchman\" typically refers to a cricketer who acts as a substitute fielder, often used to save a team's higher-order players for later stages of the match.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table provided. Each row represents a player with their respective details: name, team, score, versus, and year. My focus is on identifying any players from Pakistan in the nightwatchman role.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row has a player named \"nasim - ul - ghani\" playing for Pakistan against England in 1962. There's no mention of their role here.\n2. The second row is about \"tony mann\" from Australia, not Pakistan.\n3. The third row is \"syed kirmani\" playing for India, so that's not relevant.\n4. The fourth and fifth rows are both about \"mark boucher,\" but he's from South Africa, not Pakistan.\n5.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The table has five columns: player, team, score, versus, and year. Each row represents a different player with their corresponding stats.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: syed kirmani and nasim - ul - ghani. My first task is to locate these two in the table. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- Player: nasim - ul - ghani\n- Team: pakistan\n- Score: 101\n\nSecond row:\n- Player: tony mann\n- Doesn't match, so I can skip.\n\nThird row:\n- Player: syed kirmani\n- Score: 101 not out\n\nFourth and fifth rows are mark boucher, which aren't relevant here.\n\nSixth row:\n- Player: jason gillespie\n- Not the ones in question.\n\nSo, both players are found in rows 1 (nasim) and 3 (syed). Now, I need to check their scores.\n\nNasim's score is 101. Syed kirmani's score is \"101 not out\". Hmm, at first glance, these seem equal because they both have 101. However, the notation \"not out\" might be important. In cricket, a \"not out\" status means the player didn't get out but still scored. So, their scores are both 101, but syed's is a \"not out\", while nasim's is just 101.\n\nThe claim says they tie for the highest score. If we consider the raw numerical value, yes, both have 101. But does the notation affect this? In some contexts, a higher score with not out might be considered better, but in terms of points or actual runs scored, it's still 101. So, numerically, they are equal.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other players who scored higher than these two. Let me look at all the scores:\n\n- nasim: 101\n- syed: 101 not out (which is 101)\n- tony mann: 105\n- mark boucher: 125 and 108\n- jason gillespie: 201 not out\n\nOh, wait a minute. Jason Gillespie scored 201 not out, which is higher than both nasim and syed's scores of 101. That means syed and nasim didn't tie for the highest score; Gillespie has a higher score.\n\nSo, the claim is false because there's another player with a higher score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Jason Gillespie scored a higher score than both Syed Kirmani and Nasim - ul - Ghani. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Players in Claim**: The players are Syed Kirmani and Nasim - ul - Ghani.\n2. **Locate Their Scores**:\n   - Nasim's score is 101.\n   - Syed's score is 101 not out, which equals 101.\n3. **Check for Higher Scores**: Jason Gillespie scored 201 not out, which is higher than both.\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there's a higher score, the claim that they tie for the highest is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Sixth row: jason gillespie, not Mark Boucher.\n\nSo, there are two entries for Mark Boucher: scores of 125 and 108. To check if he has the highest score, I need to compare these against other players' scores in the table.\n\nLooking at all the scores:\n\n- nasim - ul - ghani: 101\n- tony mann: 105\n- syed kirmani: 101 not out (I'll treat this as 101)\n- mark boucher: 125 and 108\n- jason gillespie: 201 not out\n\nNow, the highest score in the table is Jason Gillespie with 201. Mark Boucher's highest score here is 125, which is less than 201.\n\nAdditionally, checking other players' scores:\n\n- Tony Mann has 105.\n- Syed Kirmani and Nasim have 101 each.\n\nSo Mark Boucher's scores (125 and 108) are lower than the maximum in the table. Therefore, he doesn't have the highest score overall.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if he is the highest among those playing for South Africa, his team? The claim doesn't specify, so I think it refers to the overall highest.\n\nIn any case, Jason Gillespie's 201 is higher than Mark Boucher's 125. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"mark boucher have the highest score\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table:\n\n1. Identify rows where Player is \"mark boucher\":\n   - Row index 4: score = 125\n   - Row index 5: score = 108\n\n2. Compare these scores with all other players:\n   - Highest score in the table is Jason Gillespie's 201.\n\nSince Mark Boucher's highest score (125) is less than the maximum (201), the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
