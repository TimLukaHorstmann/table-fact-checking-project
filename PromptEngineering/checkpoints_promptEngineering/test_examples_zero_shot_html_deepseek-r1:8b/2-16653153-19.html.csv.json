    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the game at the north shore event centre be play on december 4\" is true or false based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a game that happened at the North Shore Event Centre on December 4th. So I should look for a row in the table where both the venue is \"North Shore Events Centre\" and the date is December 4th.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Date is 3 december, venue is Win Entertainment Centre \u2013 not matching.\nRow 1: Date is 4 december, venue is North Shore Events Centre. That seems to match both the date and venue in the claim.\nRow 2: Date is 5 december, venue is Cairns Convention Centre \u2013 no match.\nRow 3: Date is 6 december, venue is Distinctive Homes Dome \u2013 no match.\nRow 4: Date is 6 december, venue is Townsville Entertainment Centre \u2013 no match.\nRow 5: Date is 6 december, venue is Hisense Arena \u2013 no match.\nRow 6: Date is 7 december, venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre \u2013 no match.\n\nSo the only row that matches both the date (December 4) and the venue (North Shore Events Centre) is row 1. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a game at that location on that date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"On December 4, a game be play at the north shore event centre.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find any relevant information. The table has columns like date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report.\n\nI notice that in the claim, the date mentioned is December 4th. So I should check if there's a row with \"4 december\" as the date. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: 3 december\n- Row 1: 4 december\n- Row 2: 5 december\n- And so on.\n\nYes, row index 1 has the date 4 december. So that's a relevant cell because it matches the claim's date.\n\nNext, the venue mentioned in the claim is \"north shore event centre.\" Looking at the 'venue' column for each row:\n\n- Row 0: win entertainment centre\n- Row 1: north shore events centre\n- Row 2: cairns convention centre\n- And so on.\n\nRow index 1 has \"north shore events centre\" as the venue. That matches exactly with the claim's venue name except for a slight difference in spelling\u2014the claim says \"event centre\" and the table has \"events centre.\" Wait, no, the table actually shows \"north shore events centre,\" which is one word before center? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at row 1: venue is \"north shore events centre.\" The claim says \"north shore event centre.\" There's a discrepancy here. The claim uses two words for the venue: \"event\" and \"centre,\" whereas the table has \"events\" and \"centre.\" So it's plural in the table but singular in the claim.\n\nHmm, that might be an issue. If the claim is saying \"north shore event centre\" (with a single 'event'), while the table shows \"north shore events centre\" (plural 'events'), they don't exactly match. So does this mean the venue doesn't match?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nIn row 1 of the table: <td>north shore events centre</td>. So it's plural, two words: \"north shore events\" and then \"centre.\" The claim is \"north shore event centre\"\u2014singular in both parts. So the venue names don't exactly match because the number of words is different.\n\nThat would mean that even though the date matches, the venue doesn't exactly match, so the claim isn't fully supported. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe \"north shore event centre\" is a misspelling and they meant \"north shore events centre.\" Or perhaps the claim's wording is slightly off.\n\nBut in any case, the exact wording matters for this task. The table has \"north shore events centre,\" so if the claim says \"north shore event centre,\" it doesn't match exactly. Therefore, the venue in the claim isn't correct as per the table.\n\nSo even though the date matches, the venue doesn't. So the claim is not fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure there are no other relevant cells beyond date and venue. Let me check: The claim mentions a game being played on December 4 at that venue. Looking for any row that matches both date and venue exactly.\n\nOnly row index 1 has both date as 4 december and venue as north shore events centre. But the venue in the table is \"north shore events centre,\" which doesn't match the claim's \"north shore event centre.\" So even if the date is correct, the venue isn't.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the venue doesn't exactly match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions a game on December 4 at \"north shore event centre,\" but the table lists the venue as \"north shore events centre.\" The discrepancy in the number of words makes the venues differ. Since the exact details don't match, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"On December 4, a game be play at the distinctive home dome event center.\" I notice some spelling mistakes in \"be play\" but I'll proceed with the correction in mind as it might not affect the truthfulness of the claim. The key points here are the date (December 4), the location (distinctive home dome event center), and that a game was played there.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists games from December 3 to December 7. So, I need to check if there's a game on December 4. The rows in the tbody are numbered starting from 0, so row index 1 corresponds to December 4.\n\nIn that row (index 1), let's examine each cell:\n\n- **date**: 4 december \u2013 this matches.\n- **home team**: new zealand breakers\n- **score**: 88 - 104\n- **away team**: townsville crocodiles\n- **venue**: north shore events centre\n\nWait, the venue in that row is \"north shore events centre,\" not \"distinctive home dome event center.\" That's a discrepancy. So the location doesn't match the claim.\n\nTherefore, the game was indeed played on December 4, but it took place at a different venue. The claim mentions the wrong location. So the statement is incorrect because it specifies the wrong venue for that date.\n\nBut I should check if there are multiple games on the same day to see if any of them match both the date and venue. Looking back, only row index 1 (December 4) has the correct date. The venues for other rows don't mention \"distinctive home dome event center.\"\n\nWait, actually, another thought: maybe \"distinctive homes dome\" is a different venue than \"north shore events centre.\" So even if the same team plays elsewhere on that day, it's not at the specified venue.\n\nTherefore, since the game on December 4 was held at north shore events centre, not the distinctive home dome event center, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states a game occurred on December 4 at a specific venue. The table shows such a game indeed happened that day but at a different location. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"the match play on december 4 record a score of 102 - 94 with north shore event centre as its venue.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table. Let's break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. **Date**: December 4.\n2. **Score**: 102 - 94.\n3. **Venue**: North Shore Event Centre.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a match on December 4 with that score and at that venue in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists matches from December 3rd to December 7th. I'll go through each row to find the one that matches the claim.\n\nStarting from December 4: The second row (row_index 1) has:\n- Date: 4 december\n- Home team: New Zealand Breakers\n- Score: 88 - 104\n- Away team: Townsville Crocodiles\n- Venue: North Shore Events Centre\n\nWait, the score here is 88 - 104, not 102 - 94. So that doesn't match.\n\nNext, checking other rows for December 4: The only row on the 4th is row_index 1, and it doesn't have the correct score or all the details matching the claim. \n\nSo, there's no match on December 4 with a score of 102 - 94 at North Shore Event Centre. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the table. The row for December 4 is indeed row 1, and the score is 88-104, not 102-94. So the claim's score doesn't match any entry on that date.\n\nAlso, the venue in the claim is \"north shore event centre,\" but in the table, it's spelled as \"north shore events centre.\" The claim has a slight difference in spelling: one has \"event\" and the other \"events.\" Is that significant?\n\nLooking at the column for venue, I see that the correct venue name in the table is \"north shore events centre.\" The claim uses \"north shore event centre,\" which might be a typo. So even if there was a match on December 4 with the right score, the venue name doesn't exactly match.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's just a variation in spelling that I should consider as correct. Maybe both forms are acceptable or variations exist. However, the table has \"north shore events centre,\" so the claim's version is slightly different. That might be another point against the claim being TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the venue name is consistent, and the discrepancy is just a typo in the claim. But regardless of that, the primary issue is that the score doesn't match any December 4 match in the table.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states there's a match on December 4 with a 102-94 score at North Shore Event Centre. The table shows a match on December 4 but with a different score (88-104) and possibly a slightly different venue name. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table data.\n\nI think that makes the answer FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not have a matching entry in the table for December 4 with the specified score and venue. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
