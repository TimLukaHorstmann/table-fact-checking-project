    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"in stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and understand what information it's providing. The table seems to list various bridges with details such as their names, dates (when they were removed), locations, counties, and types of bridges. Each row represents a different bridge.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Stanley\" specifically, so my task is to find any bridge in the table that's associated with Stanley and check if its type matches \"concrete deck girder.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about a bridge named \"west antelope bridge,\" but it's located in Flora, not Stanley.\n2. Next, there's \"west park bridge\" in Valley City\u2014still not Stanley.\n3. Then, the \"westgaard bridge\" is in Voltaire, which isn't Stanley either.\n4. Moving on, I see bridges like \"sorlie memorial,\" \"porter elliott,\" etc., but none of these are in Stanley.\n5. The last few rows mention bridges that were removed, such as the Blanchard Bridge and Goose River Bridge, both in different locations.\n\nWait a second, I'm noticing that not all rows have the same details. Some have \"removed\" notes next to the date. For example, the Blanchard Bridge was removed in 2009, but it's still listed with its original information first. Same goes for the Goose River and Liberty Memorial bridges.\n\nBut going through each row meticulously, I realize that none of them mention Stanley. Most of the entries are in places like Grand Forks, Valley City, Portland, etc., but not Stanley. That makes me think there might be no bridge associated with Stanley in this table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps one of these bridges is in Stanley under a different name or location? Let me double-check each row's location.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Blanchard Bridge: Blanchard, Traill\n- Goose River Bridge: Hillsboro, Traill\n- Liberty Memorial Bridge: Bismarck, Burleigh\n- Porter Elliott Bridge: Hillsboro, Traill\n- Portland Park Bridge: Removed, but was in Portland, Traill\n- Rainbow Arch Bridge: Valley City, Barnes\n\nStill, none of these are Stanley. So if there's no bridge with \"Stanley\" as its location, then the claim must be false because it refers to a place that doesn't have such a bridge in this dataset.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there is no bridge in Stanley listed, so the claim can't be verified. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true: \"in colton's cross the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge.\" First, I need to understand what exactly is being claimed here. It seems like it's saying that there's a specific type of bridge in Colton's Cross, and the bridge in question is a Pratt through truss bridge.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I should check each relevant cell to see if this claim holds true. Let me go through each row step by step.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: The column names are City or Town, Bridge Name, Status, and Type. For Colton's Cross, I need to find the bridge associated with it. But wait, looking at the table, most of the bridges have specific city names like \"Valley City,\" \"Grand Forks,\" etc., but I don't see a row where the city is \"Colton's Cross.\" Maybe it's not explicitly listed. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check each row again. The first column under 'City or Town' is either something like \"Cooperstown\" or \"Voltaire,\" which are actual cities in North Dakota, but \"Colton's Cross\" isn't among them. So perhaps the bridge isn't directly listed as being in Colton's Cross.\n\nBut then I notice that some bridges have status updates, like \"removed 2009 - 3 - 25.\" For example, the Blanchard Bridge is listed with a removal date, and so are others. The original claim mentions a specific type of bridge: Pratt through truss. So maybe the relevant part isn't about the location but about the type.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"in colton's cross the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge.\" So it's stating two things: 1) there is a bridge in Colton's Cross, and 2) that bridge is a Pratt through truss type.\n\nSince I don't see any row explicitly mentioning Colton's Cross as the city or town where the bridge is located, maybe the first part of the claim is false. But perhaps the user intended to refer to a different bridge in the vicinity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Colton's Cross\" refers to the area between two cities, so I should look for any bridges near that area. However, without specific information about that, it's hard to say. \n\nLooking at the 'Status' column, some bridges are marked as removed, which indicates they're no longer in use. For example, the Portland Park Bridge was removed in 2004, and the Liberty Memorial Bridge in 2009. The Blanchard Bridge and Goose River Bridge were also removed. So, if \"Colton's Cross\" is a location where such a bridge existed but has been removed, that might affect the claim.\n\nThe 'Type' column mentions various truss types like Pratt through truss, Parker through truss, etc. For instance, the Viking Bridge in Portland is a Pratt through truss. The Sorlie Memorial Bridge is also a Pratt through truss.\n\nBut without a specific bridge listed for Colton's Cross, it's difficult to confirm. However, if we consider that \"Colton's Cross\" refers to an area where such bridges exist, then looking at the types might support the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The table doesn't have any row explicitly mentioning Colton's Cross, so perhaps the first part of the claim is false because there's no bridge listed for that location. Therefore, the overall claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in Colton's Cross, there is a bridge known as a Pratt through truss bridge. However, upon reviewing the table, no bridge is explicitly listed under the \"City or Town\" column that mentions Colton's Cross. Some bridges have been removed, but none are associated with Colton's Cross. Therefore, the claim lacks support from the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"cooperstown have a pratt through truss type bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Cooperstown.\" Looking at the table, Cooperstown is one of the locations listed in the 'Location' column. Specifically, it's associated with the Romness Bridge and the Blanchard Bridge, both built in 1997 but removed later. But since the claim doesn't mention removal, I should focus on whether a pratt through truss bridge exists there.\n\nNext, \"pratt through truss type bridge\" refers to a specific type of truss bridge designed by Pratt, which is a through truss, meaning the structure passes through the trusses. In the table, under 'Bridge Type,' several entries mention 'Pratt Through Truss.' For example, the Romness Bridge and the West Park Bridge both have this type.\n\nLooking at Cooperstown's bridges in the table: There are two entries. The first is the Romness Bridge, built in 1997 with a Pratt Through Truss. The second is the Blanchard Bridge, also built in 1997 but removed in 2009. Since the claim doesn't mention the removal, I should consider the existence during its service life.\n\nSo, Cooperstown does have at least one Pratt Through Truss bridge, specifically the Romness Bridge. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as Cooperstown has a Pratt Through Truss type bridge in its history.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"Location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"Bridge Type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that there's a bridge named \"nesheim bridge\" located in \"mcville.\" So my task is to check if such an entry exists in the given table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different bridge with various details. The columns are: 1) Name of the Bridge, 2) Status/Notes, 3) Location (City), and 4) Bridge Type.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match both the bridge name \"nesheim bridge\" and the location \"mcville.\"\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Name: nesheim bridge\n- Status: removed 2009 - 3 - 25\n- Location: Blanchard\n- Bridge Type: pratt through truss\n\nThis isn't in McVille, so it's not a match.\n\nNext rows don't have \"nesheim bridge\" listed by name. Most of the bridges are named like \"sorlie memorial bridge,\" \"viking bridge,\" etc., but none mention \"nesheim.\"\n\nLooking at the 'Location' column, only some bridges are in McVille. For example, the \"ostrom memorial bridge\" is in Minot, and others vary. But there's no row where both the name is \"nesheim bridge\" and location is \"mcville.\"\n\nI also notice that some bridges have been removed or replaced, like the Blanchard Bridge, Liberty Memorial Bridge, etc., but none of these are the Nesheim Bridge in McVille.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, there's no entry in the table that matches both the name and location specified in the claim.

The claim is: \"Cooper town be famous for the Blanchard Bridge.\" I need to verify if this statement holds true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the column names in the table to identify which columns are relevant. The columns include \"Town/City\" and \"Bridge Name,\" among others. Since the claim mentions \"Cooper town\" and \"Blanchard Bridge,\" these two columns are definitely important.\n\nNext, I need to find Cooperstown in the \"Town/City\" column. Scanning through the rows, I see that Cooperstown is listed under the \"Town/City\" column at row index 14. Now, checking what bridge is associated with this town: the \"Bridge Name\" for row 14 is \"Romness Bridge.\" Wait, that's not the Blanchard Bridge.\n\nSo, the claim says Cooperstown is famous for the Blanchard Bridge, but according to the table, they're actually known for the Romness Bridge. Therefore, the statement isn't accurate.\n\nI should double-check if there's any mention of Blanchard Bridge in Cooperstown. Looking at row 16, the Blanchard Bridge is listed, but its town is Blanchard, not Cooperstown.

The user has provided a table with various bridges and their details, along with a claim about the Goose River Bridge in Mcville. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim again: \"mcville have goose river bridge which be currently under construction due to structural issue.\" So, the key points here are that the bridge is located in Mcville and is under construction because of a structural problem.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any relevant information about the Goose River Bridge in Mcville. Let's go through each row carefully.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- The first few rows list bridges like Viking Bridge, West Park Bridge, etc., but none mention Mcville or Goose River.\n- As we go further down, the rows start mentioning Mcville. For example, the West Antelope Bridge is in Mcville, but it's a different bridge.\n- Then there are several entries for removed bridges: Blanchard Bridge, Goose River Bridge, Liberty Memorial Bridge, Porter Elliott Bridge, and Portland Park Bridge.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the grace city bridge be a concrete deck girder bridge in stanley\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully examining each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two specific things about the Grace City Bridge: its type and location. The claim states it's a concrete deck girder bridge located in Stanley.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find the row where \"Grace City Bridge\" is mentioned. Scanning through the rows, I see that the 12th row (index 11) is about the Grace City Bridge. Let me check each column for this row.\n\nThe columns relevant here are likely the ones indicating the type of bridge and its location. The 'Type' column shows \"pratt through truss\" and the 'Location' column lists \"cooperstown\". Wait, that's not matching the claim. The claim says it should be a concrete deck girder in Stanley.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh no, row 11 is actually for the Grace City Bridge. According to the table, its type is \"pratt through truss\" and location is \"cooperstown\". That doesn't align with the claim at all. The claim says it's in Stanley, but the table shows Cooperstown.\n\nHold on, perhaps I confused rows. Let me count again: rows are numbered starting from 0. So row 11 would be the Grace City Bridge, right? Yes, that's correct. But according to the data, it's located in Cooperstown, not Stanley. Therefore, the location part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait another thought: maybe there's a different row for Stanley. Let me check if any other bridge is in Stanley. Scanning through, I see the West Antelope Bridge is in Flora and the Sorlie Memorial Bridge is in Grand Forks. Wait, actually, looking at row 1 (Sorlie Memorial Bridge), location is \"grand forks\". There's no row explicitly mentioning Stanley as a location except perhaps the Grace City Bridge? No, that's Cooperstown.\n\nSo, since the Grace City Bridge isn't in Stanley but in Cooperstown, and it's not a concrete deck girder but a pratt through truss bridge, both parts of the claim are incorrect.

The claim has two main parts: the bridge's type and its location.\n\n1. **Bridge Type**: The claim states that \"Colton's Crossing Bridge\" is a \"pratt through truss.\" Looking at the table, I need to find if this specific bridge is listed as a pratt through truss. \n\n   Scanning through each row, I notice that there are several bridges with similar names but different types. For example, the \"Viking Bridge\" and others are also pratt through trusses, but I'm specifically looking for \"Colton's Crossing Bridge.\" As I go through each row, it seems like this bridge isn't explicitly mentioned in the table. The closest match might be a bridge named \"Blanchard Bridge,\" \"Goose River Bridge,\" etc., but they aren't \"Colton's Crossing.\"\n\n2. **Location**: The claim mentions \"Adam County.\" Checking the table columns for location data, I see that most bridges have locations like \"Grand Forks,\" \"Bismarck,\" \"Valley City,\" etc. There's no mention of Adam County in any of these entries. It might be a typo or a misstatement because Adam County isn't listed as a location in the provided table.\n\nNext, I'll consider if there's any possibility that the bridge exists but was removed. Some bridges in the table have notes indicating removal dates. For instance, \"Blanchard Bridge\" and others were removed in 2009. However, without specific information about when \"Colton's Crossing Bridge\" was built or removed, it's unclear.\n\nAlso, the term \"pratt through truss\" is mentioned several times in the table for various bridges. Since the exact bridge name isn't found, this part of the claim might not hold true based on the given data.\n\nAdditionally, the location being Adam County doesn't align with any entries in the table. All bridges are located in cities and counties within North Dakota, but Adam County isn't listed as a location for any bridge.\n\nConsidering all these points, there's no evidence in the table to support either part of the claim.

The claim says: \"the westgaard bridge be a pratt pony through truss bridge in traill county.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break this down into parts. There are two main aspects here: the type of bridge and its location.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different bridge. Each row has columns like \"Bridge Name,\" \"Date removed,\" \"City/Town,\" and \"Type.\" So, I should look for the row where the bridge name is Westgaard Bridge.\n\nScrolling through the table, I see that the 16th row (assuming rows start at index 0) is about the Westgaard Bridge. The city/town listed is Voltaire, which is in Traill County according to the \"City/Town\" column. So, the location part checks out because it's indeed in Traill County.\n\nNow, for the type of bridge. The \"Type\" column says \"pratt pony through truss.\" That matches exactly what the claim states. There's no indication that this information has been removed or altered after its initial entry, so I can assume it's still accurate unless there's a note in the Date removed column.\n\nLooking at the Date removed column for the Westgaard Bridge, it says \"1997 - 02 - 27.\" That means it was built around February 1997 and hasn't been removed yet. So, the current status is that it's still standing as a pratt pony through truss bridge in Traill County.\n\nI should also check if there are any notes or additional information that might affect this claim. The table doesn't show any removal dates conflicting with the Westgaard Bridge's info, so everything seems consistent.\n\nPutting it all together, both the type of bridge and its location align perfectly with the claim.
