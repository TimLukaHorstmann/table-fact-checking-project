    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"Before week 6, attendance at San Diego Charger games totaled 13000.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the table. The key points are:\n\n1. Before Week 6 (so weeks 1 through 5).\n2. Attendance at San Diego Charger games.\n3. Total attendance of 13,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week and includes the opponent and attendance. To verify the claim, I need to check the attendance figures for all San Diego Charger games before Week 6.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is New York Titans; this isn't the Chargers.\n- Week 2: Dallas Texans; not Chargers.\n- Week 3: San Diego Chargers. Attendance is 13,000.\n- Week 4: Denver Broncos; nope.\n- Week 5: Denver Broncos again.\n\nWait, only Week 3 is a game against the Chargers before Week 6, and the attendance there is 13,000. So, the total attendance before Week 6 would be just this one game.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"attendance at San Diego Charger games\" before Week 6. So in Weeks 1-5, only Week 3 is a Charger game with 13,000 attendees. There are no other Charger games in that period. Therefore, the total attendance for all Charger games before Week 6 is exactly 13,000.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because there's one game before Week 6 where the Chargers played, and the attendance was 13,000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table as the relevant cell confirms the attendance figure. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
