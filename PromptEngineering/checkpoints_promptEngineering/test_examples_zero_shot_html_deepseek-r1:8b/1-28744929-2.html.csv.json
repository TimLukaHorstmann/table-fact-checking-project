    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"ralph friedgen coach for 10 year at maryland\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions Ralph Friedgen coaching for 10 years at Maryland. So, I need to find if there's a row in the table that matches these details exactly.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different team with their head coach, years at school, overall record, and so on. The relevant columns here are \"head coach,\" \"years at school,\" and possibly \"team.\" \n\nI'll start by searching for Ralph Friedgen in the \"head coach\" column. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Boston College: Frank Spaziani\n- Clemson: Dabo Swinney\n- Duke: David Cutcliffe\n- Florida State: Jimbo Fisher\n- Georgia Tech: Paul Johnson\n- Maryland: Ralph Friedgen\n- Miami: Randy Shannon\n- North Carolina: Butch Davis\n- NC State: Tom O'Brien\n- Virginia: Mike London\n- Virginia Tech: Frank Beamer\n\nYes, there's a row for Maryland where the head coach is Ralph Friedgen. Now, checking the \"years at school\" column for this row. The value is 10, which matches the claim of him coaching for 10 years.\n\nSo, both the head coach and years at school columns confirm the claim. There are no conflicting information in other columns that would negate this, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms that Ralph Friedgen was indeed the head coach at Maryland for 10 years. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years at school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"miami have a 11 - 13 atlantic cost conference record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions Miami's record in the Atlantic Cost Conference (ACC). The term \"Atlantic Cost Conference\" might be a typo; perhaps it's supposed to be \"Atlantic Coast Conference.\" Looking at the table, under the \"acc record\" column for each team, I can find their ACC records.\n\nNext, I'll locate Miami in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a row for \"miami.\" Let me check which one it is. Yes, it's the 7th row from the top, where the team name is spelled as \"miami.\"\n\nNow, looking at the columns relevant to the claim: The main focus is on the ACC record. In the table, each row has several columns, including \"acc record.\" So for Miami, I need to find the value in that column.\n\nLooking at the specific row for Miami, the columns are as follows:\n- team: miami\n- head coach: randy shannon\n- years at school: 4\n- overall record: 21 - 17\n- record at school: 21 - 17\n- acc record: 11 - 13\n\nSo, the ACC record for Miami is listed as \"11 - 13.\" That matches exactly with the claim. Therefore, the claim is stating that Miami has an ACC record of 11 - 13, which is directly supported by the table.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other relevant cells. The claim specifically mentions \"atlantic cost conference,\" and in the table, it's spelled as \"acc.\" So, the term might be slightly different, but \"acc\" stands for Atlantic Coast Conference, so that part is correct.\n\nAlso, the claim refers to Miami's record, so I need to make sure it's looking at their ACC performance. The relevant cell here is the \"acc record\" column for the miami row.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The table shows that Miami has an ACC record of 11 - 13. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"acc record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"frank beamer coach his team to a 229 - 115 - 4 record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions Frank Beamer as the coach and a specific overall record: 229 - 115 - 4. So, my task is to find out if there's any row in the table where the 'head coach' is Frank Beamer and the 'overall record' matches that exact number.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see each row corresponds to a different team with their respective details. Scanning through the 'head coach' column, I notice that the last row has \"frank beamer\" listed as the head coach for Virginia Tech. So, this is the relevant row: row index 9.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'overall record' for this row. According to the table, Virginia Tech's overall record is listed as \"229 - 115 - 4\". This matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied. Frank Beamer is indeed the head coach of Virginia Tech, and his team has an overall record of 229 - 115 - 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"tom o'brien who have 3 year at school of nc state have a record of 16 - 21 with acc record 11 - 13.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find Tom O'Brien in the 'head coach' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Boston College: Frank Spaziani\n2. Clemson: Dabo Swinney\n3. Duke: David Cutcliffe\n4. Florida State: Jimbo Fisher\n5. Georgia Tech: Paul Johnson\n6. Maryland: Ralph Friedgen\n7. Miami: Randy Shannon\n8. North Carolina: Butch Davis\n9. NC State: Tom O'Brien\n10. Virginia: Mike London\n11. Virginia Tech: Frank Beamer\n\nGot it, Tom O'Brien is at row index 9 (since it's zero-indexed). Now, the claim mentions three years at school for NC State. Looking at the 'years at school' column, it says 4 for NC State, so that doesn't match the \"3 year\" part. Wait, maybe I made a mistake\u2014no, in the table, under NC State, the 'years at school' is 4. So the claim might be incorrect here.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The claim says Tom O'Brien has 3 years at school, but in the table, it's 4. So that's a discrepancy. However, maybe I should check other parts as well.\n\nNext, the overall record is mentioned as 16-21. Looking at NC State's row, the 'overall record' is 91-66, which doesn't match 16-21. That seems way off. Maybe the claim is referring to something else, like a specific season or period, but based on the table alone, it's not matching.\n\nThen there's the ACC record part: 11-13. Checking NC State's 'acc record', it's listed as 9-15. So that doesn't match either. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the years at school. Let me check again. The row for NC State says 'years at school' is 4. So if the claim says 3 years, that's wrong.\n\nPutting it all together: the team is NC State, the coach is Tom O'Brien. The table shows 4 years, not 3; overall record is 91-66, not 16-21; ACC record is 9-15, not 11-13. So the claim has several inaccuracies.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years at school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"acc record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Randy Shannon of Maryland team who have ACC record of 12-4 have 1 year at school.\" So, I need to check if this statement holds true when cross-referencing with the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there's a row for the University of Miami. Wait, no, actually, the claim mentions Maryland, so I should focus on the Maryland row. Hmm, but in the table, the team listed under \"maryland\" has a head coach named Ralph Friedgen with 10 years. The coach's name is different from Randy Shannon, who is associated with the Miami entry.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So, the claim mentions Randy Shannon as the head coach of Maryland, but according to the table, the current head coach for Maryland is Ralph Friedgen. Therefore, the first part of the claim might be false because it's attributing the coaching position to someone else instead of the correct person.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. The table lists each team with their respective coaches. For the University of Miami, the head coach is Randy Shannon, with 4 years at the school. His ACC record is 11-13.\n\nThe claim states that \"Randy Shannon of Maryland\" has an ACC record of 12-4 and only one year at the school. But in reality, Randy Shannon isn't coaching Maryland; he's coaching Miami. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the ACC records: Georgia Tech has a 12-4 ACC record under Paul Johnson, but that's for their ACC record, not overall or any other category. The claim might be trying to say that Randy Shannon's ACC record is 12-4, but according to the table, his ACC record as coach of Miami is 11-13.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim incorrectly attributes both the team and the ACC record to Randy Shannon when he's actually at a different school. Also, the years at school don't match; in the claim, it's one year, but in reality, he has four years at Miami. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"acc record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years at school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim says: \"butch davis be the coach of miami when they have a acc record of 11 - 13 with 3 year at school.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. \n\n1. **Coach's Name**: Butch Davis.\n2. **Team**: Miami.\n3. **ACC Record**: 11-13.\n4. **Years at School**: 3.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for \"miami.\" There is a row for Miami with head coach Randy Shannon and 4 years at school. So, the current coach is not Butch Davis but Randy Shannon. That already contradicts part of the claim because the coach's name doesn't match.\n\nNext, checking the ACC record for Miami. The table shows their ACC record as 11-13, which matches the claim. However, since the head coach listed is Randy Shannon and not Butch Davis, this might mean that the relevant cells involve checking if there's any row where Butch Davis is the coach of Miami with an ACC record of 11-13 and 3 years at school.\n\nWait, but in the table, there's no row for Butch Davis coaching Miami. The only time Butch Davis is listed is as the coach of North Carolina with 4 years at school and an ACC record of 11-13. So, the claim seems to mix up the team and the coach.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be where the claim's conditions don't match. For example, if the claim states Butch Davis is coaching Miami but he isn't, then we need to check those specific cells.\n\nI think I should list all cells that relate to the claim directly. So, any row where team is Miami and head coach is Butch Davis, and ACC record is 11-13 with 3 years at school. Since there's no such row, but the table does have another entry for North Carolina with same ACC record and 4 years, maybe that's relevant? Or perhaps just check the cells for Miami.\n\nWait, the claim says \"butch davis be the coach of miami when they have a acc record of 11 - 13 with 3 year at school.\" So, the table shows Miami has ACC 11-13 but coached by Randy Shannon, not Butch Davis. The years at school for Miami is 4, not 3.\n\nSo, the claim's conditions are not met in any row. Therefore, it's FALSE. \n\nTo find relevant cells, I need to check each column that could support or contradict the claim. So, columns like team, head coach, ACC record, and years at school for Miami and for Butch Davis as a coach elsewhere.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For Miami: team is miami, columns are head coach (Randy Shannon), years at school (4), and acc record (11-13).\n- For Butch Davis: team is north carolina, columns are head coach (Butch Davis), years at school (4), and acc record (11-13).\n\nSo, the relevant cells include these four cells from two different rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Butch Davis is the coach of Miami with an ACC record of 11-13 after 3 years. However, the table shows Randy Shannon as Miami's coach with a 4-year tenure and an ACC record of 11-13. Since Butch Davis is not associated with Miami in the given data, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"head coach\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"years at school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"acc record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"head coach\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"years at school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"acc record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The claim is: \"Frank Beamer headcoach of NC State have overall record of 71 - 38 with 4 year in school.\" I need to check if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Frank Beamer is and what the claim says about him. Looking at the table, I see that there's a row for \"virginia tech\" where the head coach is Frank Beamer. That means he's not the head coach of NC State, but of Virginia Tech. So that already raises a red flag because the claim says he's coaching NC State.\n\nNext, looking at the columns in the table: team, head coach, years at school, overall record, record at school, and acc record. The claim mentions \"overall record\" which would correspond to the \"overall record\" column. It also refers to \"4 year in school,\" which should be the \"years at school\" column.\n\nBut wait, the claim says Frank Beamer is the head coach of NC State. According to the table, NC State's head coach is Tom O'Brien, not Frank Beamer. So that part is incorrect. Therefore, the overall record mentioned (71 - 38) doesn't even pertain to him because he's coaching a different team.\n\nAdditionally, looking at Virginia Tech's row, Frank Beamer has been there for 24 years with an overall record of 229 - 115 - 4, which is much higher than the claim's numbers. The claim's overall record (71 - 38) and years in school (4) don't match his actual stats.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is incorrect because Frank Beamer isn't coaching NC State, and the statistics cited don't align with his actual performance as a head coach at Virginia Tech. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify the accuracy of each part of the statement against the provided table.\n\n1. **Head Coach Verification**: The claim states that Frank Beamer is the head coach of NC State. However, according to the table, the head coach of NC State is Tom O'Brien. This discrepancy immediately suggests a potential inaccuracy.\n2. **Overall Record Check**: If we were to assume the rest of the claim's details are correct, we would check the overall record for Frank Beamer as the head coach of NC State. However, since he isn't the head coach there, this step is unnecessary.\n3. **Years at School and Record at School**: The table shows that Frank Beamer has been the head coach at Virginia Tech for 24 years with an overall record of 229 - 115 - 4. This does not align with the claim's numbers (71 - 38 over 4 years).\n\nSince the initial assertion about Frank Beamer's role as NC State's head coach is incorrect, and his actual stats don't match those mentioned in the claim, it can be concluded that the entire statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
