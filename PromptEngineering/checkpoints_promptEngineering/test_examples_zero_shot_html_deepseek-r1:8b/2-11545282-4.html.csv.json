    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"the jazz have 2 players with the last name dawkins but their time on the team do not overlap.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find all players with the last name Dawkins. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 0: Adrian Dantley \u2013 no, last name is Dantley.\nRow 1: Brad Davis \u2013 nope.\nRow 2: Darryl Dawkins \u2013 yes! His last name is Dawkins.\nRow 3: Paul Dawkins \u2013 another Dawkins.\nRow 4: Greg Deane \u2013 no.\nRow 5: James Donaldson \u2013 no.\nRow 6: John Drew \u2013 no.\nRow 7: John Duren \u2013 no.\n\nSo, there are two players with the last name Dawkins: Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins. That part checks out. Now I need to check if their time on the team does not overlap.\n\nLooking at their \"years for jazz\" column:\n\nDarryl Dawkins is in row 2. His years are 1987 - 88.\nPaul Dawkins is in row 3. His years are 1979 - 80.\n\nLet me convert these to actual years to see if they overlap. \n\nFor Darryl: From 1987 to 1988.\nFor Paul: From 1979 to 1980.\n\nSo, Paul was on the team from 1979-1980, and Darryl from 87-88. There's a gap between 1980 and 1987, so their time doesn't overlap at all. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz 7 years before Darryl Dawkins.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns seem to be 'player', 'nationality', 'position', 'years for jazz', and 'school / club team'. Since both Paul and Darryl are listed in the 'player' column, their rows can be identified.\n\nLooking specifically at Paul Dawkins, his row is the fourth one (row_index: 3) where it's mentioned he played from 1979 to 1980. That's a span of two years. Now, Darryl Dawkins is listed as the third row (row_index: 2), playing from 1987 to 1988. \n\nWait, that can't be right because Paul played earlier than Darryl. But the claim says Paul was with Jazz before Darryl, which aligns with their positions in the table. However, I need to check how many years each spent with Jazz.\n\nPaul's years are 1979-80, so two years. Darryl's years are 1987-88, also two years. The claim states Paul played for seven years before Darryl, which doesn't match because both played for the same number of years.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It seems to suggest that Adrian Dantley was on the team throughout the entire period that Brad Davis was on the team. So, I need to check if both players were part of the same team during all their years mentioned in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details like name, nationality, position, years for jazz, and school/club team. I'll focus on two main columns: the player's name, their years, and their school or club team.\n\nStarting with Adrian Dantley (row 0), his years are from 1979 to 1986. Brad Davis is in row 1, also from 1979 to 1980. So, both were active during overlapping periods. Now, I need to check if they attended the same school or team.\n\nAdrian Dantley's school is listed as \"notre dame\", while Brad Davis went to \"maryland\". Since their schools are different, they were on different teams. Therefore, Adrian wasn't on the same team as Brad during his entire time.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if both were part of the same NBA team or another context. However, based on the table, it seems each player is associated with a specific school or club, which likely refers to their drafting team or early career team. Since they went to different schools, they weren't on the same team during Brad's time there.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported because Adrian wasn't on the same team as Brad during the overlapping years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"james donaldson have 2 stint on the jazz 's roster\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate James Donaldson in the table to check his details. Scanning through the table's 'player' column, I see a few players with the last name \"donaldson.\" The first one is actually \"john drew,\" not James. Then there's \"james donaldson\" listed as the seventh row (since we start counting from 0, that would be row index 6).\n\nNow, looking at James Donaldson's row, I need to check all relevant columns. The claim mentions two stints on the Jazz roster, so I'm interested in his years with the team. The 'years for jazz' column shows \"1993 , 1994 - 95.\" Wait, there's a comma before 1994, which might indicate that he played in 1993 as a separate stint and then from 1994 to 1995 as another. That would make it two distinct periods: one in 1993 and the other from 1994 to 1995.\n\nSo, each of these periods counts as a separate 'stint' on the Jazz roster. Therefore, there are indeed two stints mentioned here. There's no information suggesting more than these two, so this supports the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other columns might be relevant. Nationality is \"united states,\" which matches typical NBA players, but it doesn't affect the claim. Position is \"center,\" which is a standard position, and school/club team is \"washington state,\" which isn't related to the Jazz stints.\n\nTherefore, based on the 'years for jazz' column showing two separate periods, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the jazz have at least 3 guard that be on the team 1979 - 80.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key points are:\n1. The team referred to is \"the jazz.\" Looking at the table, it seems all players listed are part of the Jazz team because they're associated with positions like guard, forward, etc., which are typical for basketball teams named Jazz.\n2. They need to have at least 3 guards during the years 1979-80.\n\nSo I'll start by looking through each row in the table to find players who were on the Jazz team during the 1979-80 season and identify their positions, especially if they're guards.\n\nLet's go through each player one by one:\n\n1. **Adrian Dantley**: His years are listed as 1979 - 86. So he was definitely on the team in 1979-80. His position is guard-forward, which counts as a guard.\n2. **Brad Davis**: Years are 1979-80, and his position is guard. That's one guard.\n3. **Darryl Dawkins**: His years are 1987-88, so he wasn't on the team in 79-80.\n4. **Paul Dawkins**: Same as Brad, years 79-80, position guard. That's another guard.\n5. **Greg Deane**: Years 79-80, position guard. That's a third guard.\n\nNow, counting these:\n- Adrian Dantley (1)\n- Brad Davis (2)\n- Paul Dawkins (3)\n\nThat makes three guards on the Jazz team in 1979-80. The claim says \"at least 3,\" so three meets that condition.\n\nLooking at other rows to ensure no more guards from 79-80:\n- John Drew is from 82-85, so after.\n- John Duren is from 80-82, which includes part of 80 but not all of 79-80. His position is guard, but his years start in 1980, so he wasn't there the entire season.\n\nSo only three guards fit: Adrian Dantley, Brad Davis, and Greg Deane? Wait, no\u2014wait, I think I missed Greg Deane. Let me recount:\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the rows are:\n\n- Row 0: Adrian Dantley (guard-forward)\n- Row1: Brad Davis (guard)\n- Row2: Darryl Dawkins (center) \u2013 not guard\n- Row3: Paul Dawkins (guard)\n- Row4: Greg Deane (guard)\n- Then others are after.\n\nSo rows 0,1,3,4 have guards in 79-80. But wait, row4 is Greg Deane with years 79-80, so that's four guards? Wait, no\u2014wait, let me check the table again.\n\nWait, the table has:\n\nRow 0: Adrian Dantley (1979 -86) \u2013 guard-forward\nRow1: Brad Davis (79-80) \u2013 guard\nRow3: Paul Dawkins (79-80) \u2013 guard\nRow4: Greg Deane (79-80) \u2013 guard\n\nSo that's four guards, but the claim says \"at least 3.\" So four is more than three, so it still holds.\n\nWait, but the table shows:\n\nLooking at the HTML, rows are numbered from 0 to 7. Each row has a player name, nationality, position, years, and school.\n\nFor 1979-80 season:\n\nAdrian Dantley (row0) \u2013 guard-forward\nBrad Davis (row1) \u2013 guard\nPaul Dawkins (row3) \u2013 guard\nGreg Deane (row4) \u2013 guard\n\nThat's four guards. So the claim is that there are at least three, which is definitely true because there are four.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes players might have different years listed as ranges, but in this table, each player has their own range.\n\nSo yes, four guards: Adrian Dantley (also can be considered a guard), Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, Greg Deane. That makes four, which is more than three.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are at least three guards on the Jazz team during 79-80.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each player's position and years to see if they were guards on the Jazz team during the 1979-80 season.

Let's list them out:\n\n1. Adrian Dantley - guard-forward, years 79-86\n2. Brad Davis - guard, 79-80\n3. Darryl Dawkins - center, 87-88\n4. Paul Dawkins - guard, 79-80\n5.

So maybe I missed another one? Let's check again.\n\nLooking through all the rows, only Paul Dawkins has \"Dawkins\" as last name and is a guard. There's no other player named Dawkins who is a guard in the table. Maybe I misread something?\n\nWait, maybe I overlooked Darryl Dawkins. No, he's a center, so not relevant for this claim about guards.\n\nWait, another thought: the claim says \"last name dawkins\", which might mean last names ending with \"dawkins\". But in the table, only Paul and Darryl have Dawkins as their last name. So only Paul qualifies as guard, but the claim says two players. Hmm, maybe I'm missing someone.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another player with a last name that ends with Dawkins? Let me check each row again:\n\n- Row 0: Adrian Dantley\n- Row1: Brad Davis\n- Row2: Darryl Dawkins\n- Row3: Paul Dawkins\n- Row4: Greg Deane\n- Row5: James Donaldson\n- Row6: John Drew\n- Row7: John Duren\n\nNo, only Paul and Darryl have \"Dawkins\" as their last name. So only Paul is a guard. Therefore, there's only one player matching the criteria of being a guard with last name Dawkins.\n\nBut the claim says two players. That would make the claim false because there's only one such player.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each player's position again.\n\nLooking at row 3: Paul Dawkins is guard, years 79-80.\n\nRow4: Greg Deane is guard, not a Dawkins.\n\nRows 0,1,2: Not guards or Dawkins.\n\nRows5 and6: Centers, so no.\n\nRow7: John Duren is guard but his last name isn't Dawkins.\n\nSo yes, only Paul Dawkins fits both being a guard and having the last name Dawkins. Therefore, there's only one player, not two as claimed. So the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check for any other players with last names ending with Dawkins. For example, maybe someone like \"Dawkinson\" or something, but in this table, only Darryl and Paul have Dawkins.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"darryl dawkins play for the jazz 7 year before paul dawkins\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim and identify what it's saying. It mentions two players: Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins. The claim is about their tenure with the Jazz team and the duration between when they played for the Jazz.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant information for both players. Let's start with Darryl Dawkins. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 2 (index 2): Name is Darryl Dawkins.\n- His years for Jazz are listed as \"1987 - 88\". Wait, that seems a bit short, only two years.\n\nNow, Paul Dawkins: \n\n- Looking at the rows, I see Paul Dawkins in row 3 (index 3).\n- His years for Jazz are also \"1979 - 80\", which is two years as well.\n\nWait, the claim says Darryl played for the Jazz seven years before Paul. But according to the table, both played for two years each around 1980s. That doesn't add up because if they played in the same years or overlapping ones, the difference wouldn't be seven years.\n\nLet me check again: \n\nDarryl's years are 1987-88, so he was with Jazz from '87 to '88. Paul's years are 1979-80, so he was there from '79 to '80. The time between when they played for Jazz would be the difference in their years.\n\nCalculating the difference: Paul left in 1980, and Darryl joined in 1987. So that's a gap of 7 years (1980 to 1987). However, the claim says \"before paul dawkins,\" which might mean that Darryl was there before Paul. But actually, Darryl came after Paul had already left.\n\nWait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. The claim is: \"darryl dawkins play for the jazz 7 year before paul dawkins.\" So it's saying Darryl played for Jazz seven years before Paul did.\n\nLooking at their years:\n\n- Paul was with Jazz from 1979-80.\n- Darryl was with Jazz from 1987-88.\n\nSo the time between Paul leaving and Darryl joining is from 1980 to 1987, which is exactly 7 years. Therefore, when Darryl joined, it was seven years after Paul had left. So in that sense, Darryl joined seven years before Paul's tenure with Jazz.\n\nWait, but the way the claim is phrased: \"darryl dawkins play for the jazz 7 year before paul dawkins.\" It could be interpreted as Darryl was playing seven years before Paul started. But in reality, Darryl joined after Paul had already left by a few years.\n\nWait no, let me clarify:\n\nPaul's years are 1979-80, so he played two seasons with Jazz.\n\nDarryl's years are 1987-88, which is seven years after Paul's last season (1980). So Darryl joined in '87, which is seven years after Paul left in '80. Therefore, when Darryl was playing, it was indeed seven years after Paul had already played for Jazz.\n\nSo the claim is stating that Darryl played for Jazz seven years before Paul, but according to the table, it's actually that Darryl joined seven years after Paul left. So the timing doesn't align as the claim suggests.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe claim says Darryl played for Jazz for seven years before Paul did. So it implies that when Paul started with Jazz, Darryl had already been playing there for seven years.\n\nBut according to the table, Paul was with Jazz in 1979-80 and Darryl in 1987-88. The difference between their tenures is 1987 - 1980 = 7 years. So when Darryl joined, it was exactly seven years after Paul had left. Therefore, during Paul's tenure, Darryl wasn't there yet; he came later.\n\nSo the claim might be incorrect because the time gap is not that Darryl was playing for Jazz before Paul by seven years, but rather that there was a seven-year gap between Paul leaving and Darryl joining.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again: the claim is \"darryl dawkins play for the jazz 7 year before paul dawkins.\" So it's saying that during Paul's time with Jazz, Darryl was there for seven years before him.\n\nBut according to the table, Paul played from '79-'80 and Darryl from '87-'88. That means when Paul was playing (1980), Darryl wasn't yet there. He joined in 1987, which is after Paul had left. So the claim's wording suggests a temporal relationship where Darryl was with Jazz before Paul by seven years, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"before.\" If it means before in terms of playing for Jazz, then Darryl was not there before Paul; he came after. So the claim is incorrect because Darryl joined after Paul left, not before.\n\nSo to sum up:\n\n- Paul played with Jazz from 1979-80.\n- Darryl played with Jazz from 1987-88.\n- The difference in their tenures is seven years after Paul's time.\n- Therefore, the claim that Darryl played for Jazz seven years before Paul is FALSE because Darryl came after Paul, not before.\n\nWait, but the exact wording is: \"darryl dawkins play for the jazz 7 year before paul dawkins.\" So it's saying that when Paul was playing, Darryl had already been playing there for seven years. But in reality, Darryl started after Paul left by seven years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Darryl wasn't playing before Paul; he came after.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"darryl dawkins play for the jazz 7 year before paul dawkins\" is **false**. According to the provided information, Darryl played with the Jazz team from 1987 to 1988, while Paul was with them from 1979 to 1980. The seven-year gap between their tenures occurred after Paul had already left the team, not before. Therefore, Darryl did not play for the Jazz team seven years before Paul; instead, he joined seven years after Paul's tenure ended.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because Darryl played for the Jazz team after Paul had left, not before.",

So perhaps he was with the Jazz in 1993 and then again from 1994 to 1995. That would make two stints: one in '93 and another '94-'95. Each of these stints is a separate period.\n\nIf each of those is considered a single stint, then there are two stints. The total years would be 1 (from '93) plus 2 (from '94-'95), totaling 3 years. But the claim says he has 5 years in total, which doesn't align with this count.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think: from 1994 to 1995 is two years. If the first stint was just 1993 (one year) and the second was '94-'95 (two years), that's three years total, not five. So either there's a mistake in my calculation or in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is considering each season he played as a separate year. So if he played in 1993, 1994, and 1995, that would be three years. But the claim says two stints adding up to five years, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait another possibility: maybe the table has an error or typo. The entry for James Donaldson is listed as \"1993 , 1994 - 95.\" Maybe it's supposed to be two separate periods: 1993-94 and 1995-96? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because according to the table, he only played three years with the Jazz. So the claim stating he has two stints totaling five years is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that James Donaldson had two stints on the Jazz roster, totaling five years. Checking the table, his \"years for jazz\" are listed as 1993 and 1994-95, which sum to three years (1 + 2). This doesn't match the claim's total of five years.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Locate James Donaldson in the table:** Found in row 3.\n2. **Extract his \"years for jazz\":** The entry is \"1993 , 1994 - 95.\"\n3. **Analyze the duration:**\n   - 1993: 1 year\n   - 1994-1995: 2 years\n   - Total: 3 years\n4. **Compare with the claim:** Claim states two stints totaling five years, which doesn't align.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Adrian Dantley and Brad Davis is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"Adrian Dantley be on the team the entire time that Brad Davis be also on the team, as well as surpass Davis by 4 additional years.\" So, I need to check two main things: first, whether both Adrian Dantley and Brad Davis were on the team at the same time for the entire duration of their tenures, and second, whether Dantley's time with the team was four years longer than Davis's.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify the relevant rows. The player names mentioned are Adrian Dantley and Brad Davis. I'll find their respective data in the table.\n\nStarting with Adrian Dantley: his row is the first one (row_index 0). His details are:\n- Player: Adrian Dantley\n- Nationality: United States\n- Position: Guard - Forward\n- Years: 1979 - 86\n- School: Notre Dame\n\nBrad Davis's row is the second one (row_index 1):\n- Player: Brad Davis\n- Nationality: United States\n- Position: Guard\n- Years: 1979 - 80\n- School: Maryland\n\nNow, checking if both were on the team at the same time. The claim says \"the entire time\" that Brad is there, Adrian is also there. So I need to see if their years overlap completely.\n\nAdrian's tenure starts in 1979 and ends in 1986. Brad's tenure starts in 1979 as well but ends in 1980. So, from 1979 to 1980, both were on the team. However, Adrian stayed until 1986, so after Brad left in 1980, Adrian was still there alone.\n\nThis means that during the entire time Brad was on the team (from 1979 to 1980), Adrian was also present. But once Brad left, Adrian remained. So, does this satisfy the claim's condition? The claim says \"the entire time that Brad is on the team,\" which would be from 1979 to 1980. Since Adrian was there during all those years, that part seems okay.\n\nNext, checking if Adrian surpassed Brad by four additional years. Let's calculate their tenure lengths. \n\nAdrian: 1979 - 86 = 7 years (assuming the end year is inclusive)\nBrad: 1979 - 80 = 2 years\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 7 minus 2 is 5, not 4. Maybe I should count each year separately. From 1979 to 1986 for Adrian: that's 8 years (including both start and end). For Brad, from 1979 to 1980: 2 years.\n\nSo, 8 - 2 = 6 years difference. Hmm, the claim says four additional years, so this doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I should subtract the overlapping years. But no, because the claim is about Adrian being on the team during Brad's time and having a longer tenure overall.\n\nWait another approach: If both started in 1979, then their service times are as follows:\n\nAdrian: 1979-1986 \u2192 let's say 7 years (including 1979 and 1986)\nBrad: 1979-1980 \u2192 2 years\n\nSo the difference is 5 years. But the claim says four additional years. That would mean Adrian stayed four years after Brad. From Brad's end in 1980, Adrian stayed until 1986, which is a span of 6 years (1980 to 1986 inclusive). So maybe that counts as six years. But the claim says four, so perhaps this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation is based on the total time each was on the team without overlap. But I'm not sure if that's how it's intended. Maybe the claim meant that Adrian's tenure is four years longer than Brad's overall duration, regardless of overlap.\n\nIf we count their service periods:\n\nBrad: 2 years\nAdrian: 7 years\nDifference: 5 years\n\nBut the claim says four additional years, which doesn't match. So this part seems incorrect.\n\nPutting it together, while Adrian and Brad were on the team at overlapping times (1979-1980), the difference in their tenures is five years, not four. Therefore, the second part of the claim isn't accurate.\n\nSo the overall claim is FALSE because the number of additional years doesn't match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim fails both conditions: Adrian Dantley and Brad Davis were on the team together during Brad's tenure, but Adrian did not spend four additional years beyond Brad; their tenure difference was five years instead. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the jazz have at least 3 guard that be on the team during 1979 - 80 , 1 be james donaldson.\" So, the claim is making two main points. One, there were at least three guards on the Jazz team during the 1979-80 season. Two, one of those guards was James Donaldson.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists various basketball players along with their nationality, position, years for jazz, and school or club team. My task is to check if the claim holds true based on this data.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking if there were at least three guards during 1979-80. I'll need to look through each row where the \"years for jazz\" include 1979-80 and see who played as guards.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n1. Adrian Dantley is a guard listed with years 1979-86, so he was on the team in 1979-80.\n2. Brad Davis is a guard with years 1979-80.\n3. Paul Dawkins is also a guard during 1979-80.\n4. Greg Deane is another guard during 1979-80.\n\nThat's four guards: Adrian Dantley, Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, and Greg Deane. So that part of the claim is definitely true because there were more than three guards on the team during that season.\n\nNext, checking if James Donaldson was one of those guards. Looking at James Donaldson's row in the table, his position is listed as center, not guard. His years are 1993 and 1994-95. So he wasn't a guard during 1979-80; he played later in his career.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 be james donaldson.\" Hmm, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. It could mean that one of the guards was James Donaldson, but according to the table, he wasn't a guard at all, let alone during 1979-80.\n\nSo, the second part of the claim is incorrect because James Donaldson wasn't a guard for the Jazz in 1979-80. He played as a center later on, but not during that specific season and position-wise, he wasn't a guard.\n\nPutting it all together: The first part about having at least three guards is correct, but the second part about James Donaldson being one of them is wrong. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE because it makes an incorrect statement about James Donaldson being a guard during that time.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"guard\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"guard\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"guard\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n]}",
