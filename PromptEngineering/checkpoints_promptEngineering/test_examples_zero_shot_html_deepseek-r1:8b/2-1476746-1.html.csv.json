    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"la ronde be directed by roger vadim\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two names: \"la ronde\" and \"roger vadim\". So I need to check if these are related in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of films with various details like year, English title, original title, country, and director. The task is to find cells that support or refute the claim.\n\nI'll search for \"la ronde\" first. Scanning through each row's 'English Title' column, I see a row where the English title is \"la ronde\". That's in row 4 (assuming rows start at index 0). Now, looking at the director column for that row, it says \"Roger Vadim\". So this seems to directly support the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple entries. Let me check further. The original title is another column, but since the claim is about the director, I should focus on the 'Director' column. Scanning through all directors, only row 4 has Roger Vadim, and that's for \"la ronde\". So no other rows have \"Roger Vadim\" or \"la ronde\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row index 4, checking both the English title and director columns to confirm the connection between them. That makes the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"English Title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"Director\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"roger vadim direct la ronde in 1966\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Roger Vadim.\" From my knowledge, Roger Vadim was a French director known for films like \"La Ronde,\" which I think is \"Circle of Love.\" So, the claim seems to state that he directed \"La Ronde\" in 1966. That sounds plausible, but I should verify it against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: year, english title, original title, and director. Each row represents a different film and its details.\n\nI need to find rows where the director is Roger Vadim and the film is \"La Ronde\" or \"Circle of Love,\" released in 1966. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from the top, I see directors like Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Federico Fellini, and others, but none with Roger Vadim yet. As I scroll down, I come across a row where the English title is \"La Ronde,\" which translates to \"Circle of Love.\" The original title matches as well, so that's likely the same film.\n\nChecking the year column for that row, it says 1966. Now, looking at the director's name: yes, it's Roger Vadim. So this row directly supports the claim. \n\nAre there any other relevant cells? Well, only this one seems to match all the criteria mentioned in the claim. So I don't need to include any others.\n\nSince the table confirms that Roger Vadim directed \"La Ronde\" in 1966, the claim is fully supported and should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Roger Vadim directed \"La Ronde\" (also known as \"Circle of Love\") in the year 1966. This directly supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"director\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
