    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"Neil Labute be nominate for best play in 2009.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key elements of the claim. The person being nominated is Neil Labute, and the award category is best play. The year is 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various awards, nominees, categories, years, and results. Each row represents a separate nomination or win. \n\nI'll start by checking if there's any row in 2009 where Neil Labute was nominated for Best Play. So, I'll look through each row with year 2009.\n\nThe first row: 2009, Tony Award, Best Play, Neil Labute, Nominated. Here, the nominee is Neil Labute, category is best play, and result is nominated. That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, I should check all rows for 2009 to ensure there are no other relevant entries that might affect this. The next two rows also have 2009 as the year but different nominees (Thomas Sadoski and Marin Ireland) and categories, so they don't apply here.\n\nThen, looking at other award ceremonies in 2009: Drama Desk Award and Theatre World Award. Those rows don't mention Neil Labute or Best Play, so they can be ignored for this specific claim.\n\nSo the only relevant row is the first one where Neil Labute was indeed nominated for Best Play in 2009. There's no information that contradicts this, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms that Neil Labute was nominated for Best Play at the Tony Awards in 2009. No conflicting data found.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"thomas sadoski be nominate for best performance by a lead actor in a play in 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the table structure. There are multiple rows and columns like year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result.\n\nI know that Thomas Sadoski was nominated for some awards in 2009. So I need to check if he was specifically nominated for \"best performance by a lead actor in a play.\"\n\nLooking at the table, let me scan through each row:\n\n1. The first three rows are about Tony Awards. The second row has Thomas Sadoski as the nominee for \"best performance by a leading actor in a play\" and it's marked as 'nominated'. That seems relevant.\n\n2. Next, there's another Drama Desk Award with Thomas Sadoski for \"outstanding actor in a play,\" which is also a nomination.\n\n3. Then, there's an outstanding director, but that's not relevant here.\n\n4. Finally, the Theatre World Award where Marin Ireland won, which isn't about Thomas.\n\nSo, the key cell is row 1 (since it starts at 0), column \"result\" for the second row. Wait, no\u2014row indices start at 0, so the first data row is index 0, then 1, etc. So in the table, the first data row after the headers is row 0.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nThe table has a header row (index -1 if we consider 0-based) and then seven data rows starting from index 0 to 6.\n\nLooking at row 0: Thomas Sadoski is in the 'nominee' column for \"best performance by a leading actor in a play,\" result is 'nominated'.\n\nSo, that directly supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE and the relevant cells are where year is 2009, award ceremony is Tony Award, category is best performance by a lead actor in a play, and nominee is Thomas Sadoski.\n\nWait, but the claim is about being \"nominated,\" which matches. So yes, it's true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"reason to be pretty be nominate for best play more than 1 time.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that there's a reason or justification why someone should be nominated for \"best play\" more than once. Maybe implying that multiple people were nominated in the same category?\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the columns are: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. The relevant part here is probably the 'nominee' column and how many times they were nominated for a specific award.\n\nWait, but each row represents an individual nomination. So if someone was nominated multiple times in the same category, that would be a separate entry each time. But I need to see if any single nominee received more than one nomination in the same category in 2009.\n\nLet me go through the table row by row.\n\n1. First row: Tony Award for Best Play, nominee Neil Labute was nominated.\n2. Second row: Same award ceremony and category (Tony Award, best play), but different nominee Thomas Sadoski. So that's a separate nomination.\n3. Third row: Different category (Best performance by a leading actor), so not relevant for \"best play.\"\n4. Fourth row: Drama Desk Award, outstanding play, same as the first entry? No, it's a different award ceremony and different category (outstanding play vs best play).\n5. Fifth row: Same as fourth but different nominee Thomas Sadoski.\n6. Sixth row: Different again, not relevant for \"best play.\"\n7. Seventh row: Theatre World Award, same as previous ones? Not applicable.\n\nSo in 2009, for the Tony Award category of Best Play, two different nominees were named: Neil Labute and Thomas Sadoski. Each was only nominated once in that specific award category.\n\nTherefore, there isn't a single person who was nominated more than once for \"best play\" in 2009. So the claim that someone was nominated multiple times for best play doesn't hold. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim to verify: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that before 2009, the only year when \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award was because of some condition. Wait, actually, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read it again: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony.\" So perhaps it's saying that before 2009, \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award, and this was the only such occurrence.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that the years in question are all 2009. The nominees for various categories include people like Neil Labute, Thomas Sadoski, Marin Ireland, etc., but none of them seem to be \"reason to be pretty.\" Wait a minute\u2014maybe the claim is about \"Reason to Be Pretty\" being a play or something? Or perhaps it's a person's name. I might need to clarify that.\n\nWait, no, the table doesn't mention \"reason to be pretty\" as either a nominee or the award category. The nominees listed are all individuals like Neil Labute and Thomas Sadoski, not a play title. So maybe \"reason to be pretty\" is an award or something else? Or perhaps it's a misnomer for one of the categories.\n\nWait, looking at the table again: in 2009, under the Drama Desk Award category, there's an entry where the nominee is \"outstanding play.\" Hmm, but that's still not \"reason to be pretty.\" So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the claim is saying that before 2009, \"Reason to Be Pretty\" was only nominated at the Drama Desk Awards, and nowhere else, or that it's unique in some way. But given the table, all entries are from 2009, so maybe the claim is about the year 2009 specifically?\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"before 2009,\" so before 2009, there were no other instances where \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award. But looking at the table, in 2009, under the Theatre World Award category, Marin Ireland won. So maybe that's related? Or perhaps the claim is trying to say that before 2009, \"reason to be pretty\" didn't have any nominees elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"reason to be pretty\" is a play, and it was only nominated in 2009 for Drama Desk, but I'm not sure. The table doesn't show any entries for \"Reason to Be Pretty,\" so maybe the claim is incorrect because there are no such entries in the given data.\n\nWait, but the claim says that before 2009, \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award ceremony, and it was the only year. If I look through the table, all entries are from 2009. So if the claim is asserting something about years before 2009, but the table doesn't include any data for prior years, then perhaps the claim is based on incorrect information.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data in the table to support that \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award before 2009, the claim must be false. Also, the relevant cells would be the ones where \"nominee\" is involved for the Drama Desk Awards, which are rows 4,5,6.\n\nWait, but in the table, the nominees for the Drama Desk Awards are: outstanding play (row 4), Thomas Sadoski (row 5), and Terry Kinney (row 6). None of these are \"reason to be pretty.\" So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no evidence in the table that \"reason to be pretty\" was a nominee before 2009.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim says that before 2009, \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award and it was the only such occurrence. But since the table doesn't show any entries for years before 2009 or any nominees named \"reason to be pretty,\" the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, I need to check which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be those that could possibly relate to \"reason to be pretty.\" Since \"reason to be pretty\" isn't in the table as a nominee, maybe it's about an award category or another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is based on an incorrect assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the claim again: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony.\" So maybe it's saying that in years before 2009, there was only one instance where \"reason to be pretty\" had a nominee at the Drama Desk Awards. But since the table starts from 2009 and doesn't mention \"reason to be pretty,\" perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"reason to be pretty\" is referring to an award category or something else. But without that information in the table, I can't confirm anything. So, based on the table data, there's no evidence of \"reason to be pretty\" being a nominee before 2009, so the claim must be false.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells would be any rows where \"nominee\" is present for the Drama Desk Awards because that's where \"reason to be pretty\" could possibly have been. But since it wasn't, those cells are irrelevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that before 2009, \"reason to be pretty\" was the only year with a nominee at the Drama Desk Award ceremony. The table shows all entries are from 2009, and none mention \"reason to be pretty.\" Thus, there's no data supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
