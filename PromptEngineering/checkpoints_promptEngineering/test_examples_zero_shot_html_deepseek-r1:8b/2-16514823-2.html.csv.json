    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"g\u00f6teborg be match up with ullevi as an opponent on september 19th 2015\" is true based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that on September 19th, 2015, G\u00f6teborg was playing against Ullevi as their opponent in a match. So I need to find if there's an entry in the table for that specific date, specifically involving these two teams.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with various details like Date, Venue, Opponent, Goals, etc. The columns are: Date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), Venue, Opponent, Goals, Attendance, and Revenue.\n\nI need to search for matches that happened on September 19th, 2015. So I'll look at the \"Date\" column for this specific date. Once I find that row, I can check the \"Opponent\" column to see who G\u00f6teborg was playing against.\n\nLet me scan through each row's Date value:\n\n- The first few dates go up to August and September. I need to focus on rows where Date is 2015-09-19.\n\nLooking at the table, I find that there's a row with Date as \"2005 - 09 - 19\". Wait, that seems off because the claim is for 2015. Maybe it's a typo or formatting issue in the table? Or perhaps it's correct and I'm misreading.\n\nWait no, looking again, the first rows are from 2005 and go up to 2005-10-23. That can't be right. Maybe there's an error in how the dates are formatted in the table. But the claim is for September 19th, 2015, which isn't present here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the table only includes matches from 2005 and not beyond. So if the latest date in the table is October 23rd, 2005, then there's no match on September 19th, 2015. That would mean that the claim can't be fully supported because such a match doesn't exist in the provided data.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through each row:\n\n- The last few rows are in October 2005, but nothing beyond that. So yes, there's no September 19th, 2015 entry here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is incomplete or only shows a portion of matches. But regardless, based on what's provided, that specific date isn't present.\n\nAlso, I should check if G\u00f6teborg and Ullevi were opponents on any date in the table. Even if the exact September 19th, 2015 isn't there, maybe they faced each other earlier.\n\nLooking through the Opponent column, for example, on \"2005 - 09 - 19\", the venue is \"ullevi\" and the opponent is \"g\u00f6teborg\". So that's a match between two teams where one is playing against the other. But this was on September 19th, 2005, not 2015.\n\nSo the claim refers to September 19th, 2015, but the table only shows up to October 23rd, 2005. Therefore, there's no data supporting that G\u00f6teborg faced Ullevi on that specific date in 2015.\n\nMoreover, even if I consider that the match might have happened beyond the provided data, since the table doesn't include dates after 2005, we can't confirm it based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data presented in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"Date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
