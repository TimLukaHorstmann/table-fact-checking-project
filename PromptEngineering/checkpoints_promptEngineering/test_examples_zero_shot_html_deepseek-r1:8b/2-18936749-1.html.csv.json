The location is the northern state conference within IHSAA.\n2. Bremen's enrollment is compared to Culver Community.\n3. Bremen has a higher enrollment.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes like school name, location, mascot, enrollment, etc.\n\nI need to locate rows for both Bremen and Culver Community in the table.\n\nStarting with Bremen:\n- The first row (row 0) is about Bremen.

Since 505 is higher than 306, the claim seems to be true.\n\nTo verify this, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant.

The claim says, \"In the northern state conference (ihsaa), Bremen join 12 years after Culver Community.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table. The relevant columns here seem to be 'school' (to find Bremen and Culver Community), 'year joined' (to check the time difference between their entries). \n\nLooking through the rows, I need to locate both Bremen and Culver Community. \n\nStarting with Bremen: Scanning each row, I see that in the first row, the school is Bremen. So, Bremen's year joined is 1989.\n\nNow for Culver Community: I'll go through each row until I find the school name. It's in the second row where the school is Culver Community, and their year joined is 1977.\n\nNext, I need to calculate how many years passed between these two. So, from 1977 to 1989 is a span of 12 years (1989 - 1977 = 12). That matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Bremen indeed joined 12 years after Culver Community in the northern state conference.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I identified the relevant rows and columns for comparing Bremen and Culver Community's joining years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table lists schools with various attributes like their name, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and year joined. \n\nThe key here is the \"ihsaa class\" column because the claim is about whether two schools, Bremen and Culver Community, are in different classes within IHSAA. So I need to look at this column for both schools.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For Bremen: The ihsaa class is 'aa'.\n- For Culver Community: The ihsaa class is 'a'.\n\nSo, 'aa' and 'a' are different. Therefore, based on this information, the claim should be TRUE because they are in different classes.\n\nBut I also need to consider which cells are relevant. Each row corresponds to a school. Bremen is in the first row (row_index 0), and Culver Community is in the second row (row_index 1).

The claim is: \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), laville have a lower enrollment than jimtown.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions two schools: Laville and Jimtown. It's about their enrollments in the Northern State Conference, specifically comparing their numbers. So, my main focus will be on finding Laville and Jimtown in the table and checking their enrollment figures.\n\nNext, I'll scan through the 'school (ihsaa id)' column to locate both Laville and Jimtown. \n\nStarting with Laville: I see that there's a row where the school is \"laville.\" Let me note down its row index. Then for Jimtown, I find it in another row with the name \"jimtown.\"\n\nNow, I need to look at their respective enrollment numbers. From the table:\n\n- Laville has an enrollment of 413.\n- Jimtown has an enrollment of 642.\n\nThe claim states that Laville has a lower enrollment than Jimtown. So, comparing these two numbers: 413 is indeed less than 642.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data. \n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant.

The table's column \"year joined\" might give some clues about their regions, but it doesn't explicitly say which conferences they're in.
