    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"panama and trinidad tobago have a total of 3 bronze medals\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Panama and Trinidad & Tobago together have a total of three bronze medals. So, I need to check how many bronze medals each of these nations has in the table and see if their sum equals three.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different nation with their medal counts: gold, silver, bronze, and total. The relevant column here is \"bronze.\" I need to find the bronze medal count for Panama and Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nStarting with Panama: I'll scan through each row until I find the one where the nation is Panama. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 11: Nation is Panama. The bronze count is 1.\n\nNext, for Trinidad & Tobago: Looking through the rows again until I find that nation. It's in row 12. The bronze count there is also 2.\n\nWait a minute, according to this, Trinidad & Tobago has 2 bronze medals, not just one or two that would sum to three when combined with Panama. Let me double-check the table to make sure I didn't misread it.\n\nYes, in row 12: Trinidad and Tobago has 0 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze, totaling 4 medals. So their bronze count is indeed 2.\n\nSo adding up both countries: Panama has 1, Trinidad & Tobago has 2, so together that's 3 bronze medals. That matches the claim. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"panama , trinidad and tobago have more than 2 bronze medal each\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Panama in the table. Scanning through the 'nation' column: there's Panama at row 11. Looking at the 'bronze' column for that row, it says 1. So Panama has only 1 bronze medal.\n\nNext, Trinidad and Tobago is another nation mentioned in the claim. I'll locate that in the table too. It's at row 12. Checking the 'bronze' column here, it shows 2. So Trinidad and Tobago has 2 bronze medals.\n\nThe claim states that both Panama and Trinidad and Tobago have more than 2 bronze medals each. But from the table, Panama only has 1, which is not more than 2, and Trinidad and Tobago has exactly 2, which is also not more than 2. Therefore, neither meets the condition of having more than 2.\n\nSo the claim is false because both nations don't exceed 2 bronze medals each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Panama and Trinidad and Tobago each have more than 2 bronze medals. Checking the table:\n\n- Panama has 1 bronze medal (row 11).\n- Trinidad and Tobago has 2 bronze medals (row 12).\n\nNeither exceeds 2, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
