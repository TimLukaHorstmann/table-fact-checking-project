    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"on july 13th , set 3 be 12 - 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-reference it with the table data.\n\nFirst, the date mentioned in the claim is July 13th. Looking at the table, I see that there are two rows for \"13 jul\". So those are the relevant rows to check. The claim specifically mentions \"set 3\" and the score \"12 - 25.\" \n\nNow, I need to look into the table's columns. The table has several columns: date, score, set 1, set 2, set 3, and total. Since the claim is about set 3 on July 13th, I should focus on the \"set 3\" column for those rows.\n\nLooking at the first row under \"13 jul,\" in set 3, the score is \"12 - 25.\" That matches exactly what the claim states. So this seems to support the claim.\n\nBut wait, there's another row on the same date, July 13th. Let me check that too. The second row also has a date of \"13 jul,\" and in set 3, the score is \"25 - 13.\" That doesn't match the claim at all because it's 25-13 instead of 12-25.\n\nSo now I'm confused. There are two rows on July 13th, each with different scores for set 3. The first row matches the claim, but the second one does not. Does this mean that part of the table supports the claim and another part contradicts it?\n\nBut the claim is a specific statement about set 3 being \"12 -25\" on July 13th. So if at least one of the two rows on that date matches the claim, then perhaps the claim is TRUE because there's an instance where set 3 was indeed 12-25.\n\nHowever, the other row shows that set 3 was also 25-13 on the same day. So the data isn't entirely consistent with the claim. But since one of the rows supports it, maybe the claim is still considered TRUE as long as there's at least one match.\n\nAlternatively, if both instances need to be checked, then the claim would be FALSE because not all set 3 scores on July 13th are 12-25.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't specify whether it's considering all instances or just one. Typically, a claim is evaluated by checking if any of the relevant data points support it. So if at least one row matches, the claim could be considered TRUE.\n\nLooking back, in the first \"13 jul\" row, set 3 is indeed 12-25. Therefore, the claim is supported to some extent. However, the second row on the same date contradicts it by showing a different score.\n\nBut the instruction says that if fully supported, answer \"TRUE.\" So I think as long as there's at least one instance where the claim holds true, it should be considered TRUE. The other instances don't matter unless the claim requires all to be true, which isn't specified here.\n\nTherefore, based on the first row matching the claim, the relevant cells are both in \"set 3\" column for rows where date is July 13th. So the answer would be TRUE with those cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"set 3\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"set 3\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the set 2 of 16 - 25 be on 15 jul.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns: date, score, set 1, set 2, set 3, and total. Each row represents a different match on specific dates. The dates listed are July 13th, 14th, and 15th.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"set 2\" being \"16 - 25\" on July 15th. So I need to find in the table where set 2 has the score 16-25 and see if it's recorded for July 15th.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. July 13: There are two entries. The first row for July 13 has set 2 as 17 -25, and the second as 25 -10.\n2. July 14: Again, two entries. One has set 2 as 25 -10, the other as 15 -25.\n3. July 15: There are two rows. The first row for July 15 has set 2 as 16 -25, and the second as 25 -16.\n\nSo in July 15's first row, set 2 is indeed 16-25. That matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is the one where date is 15 jul, score is 16-25, which is in set 2.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that on July 15th, there is a match where set 2 is 16 -25. This directly supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"set 2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"when set 3 be 18 - 25 , the total be 53 - 75\" is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's stating a condition where in set 3, the score is 18 - 25, and as a result, the total score becomes 53 - 75. So I need to check if there are any rows in the table that match both of these conditions.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row has \"set 3\" as 18 - 25. To do this, I'll go through each row's set 3 column. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: set 1 is 9-25, set 2 is 17-25, set 3 is 12-25.\n- Row 1: set 3 is 25-13. Wait, no, set 3 for row 1 is 25 - 10, right? Because the scores are 25-23 in set 1, then 25-10 in set 2, and 25-13 in set 3. Wait, actually, let me clarify: each row has set 1, set 2, set 3, and total.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me list out all the set 3 scores:\n\nRow 0: set 3 is 12 - 25\nRow 1: set 3 is 25 - 13\nRow 2: set 3 is 25 - 11\nRow 3: set 3 is 15 - 25\nRow 4: set 3 is 18 - 25\nRow 5: set 3 is 25 - 14\n\nSo, the only row where set 3 is 18 - 25 is Row 4. Now I need to check what the total is for that row. The total column in Row 4 says 53 - 75. \n\nWait, no, looking at Row 4:\n\ndate: 15 jul\nscore: 0 - 3 (so total score would be 0-3 across all sets?)\nSet1:16-25\nSet2:19-25\nSet3:18-25\nTotal:53-75\n\nYes, so in this row, set3 is indeed 18-25 and the total is 53-75. Therefore, the condition stated in the claim is met by Row 4.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The claim says \"when set 3 be 18 - 25 , the total be 53 - 75.\" So it's a conditional where if set3 is 18-25, then the total must be 53-75. \n\nIn this case, there's exactly one occurrence where set3 is 18-25, and in that same row, the total is indeed 53-75. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where set3 is 18-25. From my earlier list, only Row 4 has set3 as 18-25. So no need to look further.\n\nThus, all conditions in the claim are fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"set 3\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
