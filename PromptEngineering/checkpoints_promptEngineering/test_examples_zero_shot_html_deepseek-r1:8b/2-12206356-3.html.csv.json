    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true based on the table provided and then figure out which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"On June 9, the record be 28 - 29 with a loss of Mulholland (5-6) and an opponent of the Yankee.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for June 9 in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that June 9 is row number 8, which corresponds to the Brewers game on that date. Wait, no, actually, looking again, each row seems to represent a specific date and team.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row's Date column for June 9. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: June 7 - Orioles\nRow 1: June 8 - Orioles\nRow 2: June 9 - Brewers\n\nSo, the Brewers played on June 9. The claim mentions \"the record be 28-29,\" which likely refers to the team's win-loss tally on that date. So I need to find out if on June 9, the team (which is the opponent) had a record of 28-29.\n\nLooking at each row, the Date column has June 9 for Brewers. Now, I need to check their overall record on that day. From the table, let's see what their W-L was after June 9 games. Since the table lists results per game, perhaps each row represents a game result, so the cumulative record would be updated as each game is played.\n\nI think each row shows the outcome of a specific game. So for example, the Brewers on June 7 had a certain result, and their record would have been updated accordingly.\n\nTo find the exact W-L after June 9, I need to see all games up until that point. Let me list out the dates and results:\n\nRow 0: June 7 - Orioles - Brewers lost (3-1), so their record went from whatever it was on June 6 to a loss here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each row is a game result for that specific date. So, the Brewers played on June 9, which was a loss against the Yankees? Wait, no, looking at row 8:\n\nRow 8: June 9 - Brewers vs. Orioles? Wait, no, the team is Brewers, opponent is Orioles? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, the table seems to have multiple teams playing each day, but the initial rows might not all be per team. Let me check the Column Names. The columns are Date, Team, Opponent, Result, and Record.\n\nSo for each row, it's a specific game on that date between two teams. So, June 9 would be Brewers vs Orioles? Wait no, looking at row 8: Date is June 9, Team is Brewers, Opponent is Orioles, Result is Brewers lost (5-0), with Bones pitching.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Mulholland\" as the losing pitcher with a result of 5-6. So I need to see if on June 9, Mulholland started and had a loss for the Yankees against the Brewers.\n\nBut in row 8, the Brewers played the Orioles, so that's not Yankees. Maybe the Yankees played another team on June 9? Let me check other rows around June 9.\n\nLooking at row 7: June 19 - Tigers, which is later. Row 6: June 20 - Red Sox. So, perhaps I missed something. Wait, perhaps the table has all games up to June 30, but each day's games are listed in different rows.\n\nWait, maybe the table isn't organized by date per team but just lists all games with their respective dates and teams. So, on June 9, there might be multiple games. Let me check row 8: June 9 - Brewers vs Orioles (Brewers lost). That's one game. But where is the Yankees' game?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps each row represents a single team's game on that date. So, for example, row 8 shows the Brewers playing on June 9 against the Orioles.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look through all rows and find any mention of Yankees on June 9.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: June 7 - Orioles vs someone (Orioles lost)\nRow 1: June 8 - Orioles vs someone else\nRow 2: June 9 - Brewers vs Orioles (Brewers lost)\nRow 3: June 10 - Tigers\n...\nWait, perhaps the Yankees played on another date. Let me check for a row with Yankees as the team or opponent.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nI see Brewers, Orioles, Tigers, Red Sox, etc., but not Yankees. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the table only includes certain teams and the Yankees are elsewhere. Or maybe the claim is referring to another date.\n\nWait, the claim says \"on June 9,\" so the game must have happened on that date. But in the given rows up to June 30, I don't see any mention of Yankees playing on June 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete or structured differently. Let me check row by row:\n\nRow 0: June 7 - Orioles (lost) vs someone\nRow 1: June 8 - Orioles (lost)\nRow 2: June 9 - Brewers (lost to Orioles)\nRow 3: June 10 - Tigers (lost)\n...\nWait, this might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because on June 9, the Brewers played the Orioles and lost, but Mulholland wasn't involved in that game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the team's record being 28-29 refers to a different date or team.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifically says \"on June 9,\" so I need to find if any game on that day involved the Yankees with a result of 28-29 and a loss by Mulholland.\n\nGiven that in row 8, the Brewers lost to Orioles, it's unlikely that was the Yankees. So perhaps there's no game involving the Yankees on June 9, which would make the claim incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a row where Yankees played on June 9.\n\nWait, let me check if any of the rows have Yankees as the team or opponent. Scanning through:\n\nRow 0: Orioles vs someone\nRow 1: Orioles vs Tigers? (No)\nRow 2: Brewers vs Orioles\nRow 3: Tigers vs Red Sox?\nWait, perhaps I'm not finding it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Yankees are listed under another date. For example, June 9 might have been a day when the Yankees played, but their row is further down.\n\nBut in the given table provided, the rows go up to June 30, with each row representing a specific game. So, if I don't see any row for June 9 involving Yankees, then the claim's reference is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the record being 28-29 refers to a different team or date.\n\nWait, perhaps the record refers to the Brewers' cumulative record on June 9. But looking at each row, the Record column increments with each game result. So, for example, if the Brewers played several games before June 9, their record would be updated accordingly.\n\nBut without knowing all prior results, it's hard to say. However, the claim specifically mentions a loss by Mulholland against the Yankees on June 9 with a final score of 5-6 and the team's record being 28-29.\n\nGiven that, I need to check if there was a game on June 9 where the Yankees played as either home or away team, with the opposing team winning 28-29 games up to that point.\n\nBut looking through the table, I don't see any row for June 9 involving Yankees. Therefore, it's possible that the claim is incorrect because there was no game on June 9 between the Yankees and another team as per the table provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only includes certain teams, but the Yankees are not listed here, making the claim based on unavailable data.\n\nIn conclusion, since I don't see a row for June 9 involving the Yankees or any opposing team with a record of 28-29, the claim might be false. Therefore, the relevant cells would be those showing the game on June 9 where the record was updated to 28-29 and the specific loss by Mulholland against the Yankees.\n</think>\n\nThe claim appears to be incorrect based on the provided table, as there is no evidence of a game involving the Yankees on June 9 with the specified results. Therefore, the relevant cells would be those indicating the game on June 9 where the record was updated and any loss by Mulholland against the Yankees, if present.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim does not hold based on the table provided. There is no evidence of a Yankees' game on June 9 with the specified outcome. The relevant cells would be those indicating the game on June 9 where the record was updated and any loss by Mulholland against the Yankees, if present.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe claim is false as there is no game on June 9 involving the Yankees in the provided table.",
