The claim is: \"the tie game number 6 ends with a score of 0 - 3.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It's an HTML table with columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, date. Each row represents a game or replay.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tie game number 6,\" so I need to find row 6 in the table. Looking at the table, row 6 has:\n\n- tie no: 6\n- home team: luton town\n- score: 0 - 3\n- away team: ipswich town\n- date: 23 january 1982\n\nThe score here is indeed 0 - 3. So at first glance, it seems the claim is true because row 6 has that exact score.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any replays or multiple entries for game number 6. Looking further down the table, after row 6, I see rows labeled as \"replay.\" For example, row 14 and 15 involve Chelsea vs Wrexham and Huddersfield Town vs Orient. None of these have tie no:6, so game 6 is only in row 6 with a score of 0 - 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in row 6's score column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the score in Gillingham's home game on 23 January 1982 was 0 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any relevant rows. Let me see what columns are there: tie no, home team, score, away team, date.\n\nThe key points in the claim are:\n- Home team is Gillingham.\n- The game was on 23 January 1982.\n- The score was 0 - 1.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Gillingham is the home team playing on that specific date. \n\nLooking at row by row:\n\nRow 4: tie no 4, home team Gillingham, score 0 - 1, away team West Bromwich Albion, date 23 January 1982. That seems to match exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index for this row is 3 (since it's the fourth row, starting from 0).\n- The columns we need are \"score\" and perhaps others, but the main one to verify the score is the \"score\" column.\n\nWait, do I need all columns? Or just the ones that directly support the claim. The claim mentions the score specifically, so focusing on the \"score\" column makes sense.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are where Gillingham is the home team and the date is 23 January 1982. That's row index 3, columns: \"home team\", \"away team\", \"date\", and \"score\". But maybe for the answer, I should list all the columns that have data relevant to verifying the claim. So, the \"score\" column is definitely needed because it directly addresses the score part of the claim. The home team and away team might be necessary to confirm which game it is, but since Gillingham is specified as the home team, we can focus on that. But perhaps for thoroughness, include all columns related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the \"score\" column is needed because the other details are given in the claim. Hmm, but the instruction says to check each condition against the table. So, checking if Gillingham was the home team and the score was 0-1 would require looking at both the home team and score columns.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies that it's a home game for Gillingham, so we need to confirm that the home team is indeed Gillingham. Similarly, the date must be correct, but since the claim includes the date, maybe just confirming the score is enough because if the date is wrong or the home team isn't Gillingham, then the score wouldn't apply.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should check each condition. So, perhaps I need to look for Gillingham as the home team on 23 January 1982 and verify that the score was 0-1.\n\nIn row 4 (index 3), all conditions are met: home team is Gillingham, date is 23 Jan 1982, score is 0 -1. So this row fully supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index: 3\n- Columns: \"home team\", \"score\"\n\nBut wait, the instruction's example includes two columns. So maybe I should include both the home team and the score. Alternatively, perhaps just the score column is necessary for verification since that's the key point in the claim.\n\nI think to be thorough, I'll list all relevant cells that directly support the claim. So, \"home team\" confirms it's Gillingham, and \"score\" verifies the 0-1 result.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains a row where Gillingham is the home team with a score of 0 - 1 on 23 January 1982.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the tie game between the home team of huddersfield away team of orient be list as number 15.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to see if there's a game involving Huddersfield Town as the home team and Orient as the away team, specifically numbered 15.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"tie no\" which seems to be numbering the games. The rows go from 1 to 14, then some have 'replay' in the tie no, like rows 14 and 15. Wait, row 15 has tie no 15 with Huddersfield Town as home and Orient as away.

Looking at the 'tie no' column:\n\nRow 1: tie no is 1\nRow 2: it's marked as 'replay', so probably not relevant for this check.\n...\nWait, looking through each row:\n- Row 3 has tie no=2\n- Row 4 has tie no=3. So that's the one we need to focus on.\n\nNext, I should look at the score column for tie number 3. The 'tie no' is 3 in row 4, and the score there is \"2 - 0\". \n\nSo both conditions are met: tie number 3 has a score of 2-0.

The home team is Sunderland, and they are playing against Liverpool on a specific date, January 23, 1982.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. Each row represents a match between two teams on a particular date.\n\nSo, I need to find if there's a row where:\n- The home team is Sunderland.\n- The opponent (away team) is Liverpool.\n- The date matches January 23, 1982.\n\nI'll go through each row to check these conditions step by step.\n\nRow 1: tie no=1, home team=blackpool, score=0-0, away=queens park rangers, date=23 Jan 82.

The away team is Queens Park Ranger (QPR).\n2. The score of that game is 0 - 0.\n\nI'll need to check each row in the table to see if any match both these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1:\n- Tie no: 1\n- Home team: blackpool\n- Score: 0 - 0\n- Away team: Queens Park Rangers (QPR)\n- Date: 23 Jan 1982\n\nHere, the away team is QPR and the score is 0 - 0.

Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row_index 0 (since it's the first row) but wait, actually in programming, rows start from 0. Let me check: in the table, the first data row is index 0? Wait no, looking at the JSON example, they have row indices starting at 0, so Row 1 would be index 0.\n\nWait, no, in the JSON example given, it's an array with objects like {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"Revenue\"} etc. So the table rows are 0-indexed? Let me check the table again.\n\nIn the provided table, the first row after headers is:\n\n1 | blackpool | 0 - 0 | Queens Park Rangers | 23 Jan 1982\n\nSo if I'm counting from 0, that's Row 0. But in the JSON example, it's using 0 for the first entry. So yes, rows are 0-indexed.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row_index 0 and column_name \"away_team\". Wait, no, because the claim is about both away team being QPR and score being 0-0.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, each row has multiple columns: tie no, home team, score, away team. So to verify the claim, I need to check which columns are relevant.\n\nThe claim checks two things: away_team and score. So for Row 0 (row_index 1 if starting from 1), both \"away_team\" and \"score\" columns must match.\n\nWait, no, in the JSON example, each cell is identified by row index and column name. So for the first data row (assuming it's row_index 0 or 1?), let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the provided table:\n\nIt starts with headers, then the first data row is Tie No:1 | Home Team: blackpool etc. So in terms of JSON structure, that would be row_index 0, and each column under it.\n\nSo for Row 0 (row_index 0), columns are tie_no, home_team, score, away_team, date.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to check are:\n\n- row_index: 0\n  - column_name: \"away_team\" because the claim specifies the away team is QPR.\n  - and also \"score\" because it's 0 - 0.\n\nSo both columns need to be checked. Therefore, in the JSON response, we should include both cells where the conditions are met.\n\nWait, but the claim states two things: the away team is QPR and the score is 0-0. So I need to check that both are correct for the same game.\n\nIn Row 1 (row_index 0), away_team is Queens Park Rangers and score is 0 - 0. Therefore, both conditions are met.

The claim says: \"the game with a tie number of 7 ends in a score of 0 - 3.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the tie number is 7. Let me scan through the table rows.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Tie no 1\nRow 2: Replay\nRow 3: Tie no 2\n...\nContinuing this way, I see that Row 7 has Tie no 7.\n\nSo, for Tie no 7, what's the score? Looking at the 'score' column for row 7, it says \"1 - 0\". That's a score of 1-0, not 0-3. \n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the game with tie number 7 does not end in 0-3.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a football match is true or false by checking the provided HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"the score in Gillingham's home game on 21 January 1982 be 0 - 1.\" So, I'm looking for a match where Gillingham was at home, the date was January 21, 1982, and the score was 0-1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns are tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. My first task is to find all matches where Gillingham is the home team and the date is January 21, 1982.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Tie no 4: Home team is Gillingham, date is 23 Jan 1982. That's not the 21st.\n2. Tie no 15 onwards: No more entries for Gillingham as home team in January 1982.\n\nWait, that's only two rows where Gillingham is the home team. Let me check each of them:\n\n- Tie no 4: Date is 23 Jan, score 0 -1. But the claim mentions 21 Jan, so this isn't it.\n- Any other matches? No, after tie no 4, Gillingham doesn't appear again as a home team in January 1982.\n\nSo there's no match on 21 Jan where Gillingham was at home with a score of 0-1. The only match they had was on the 23rd, which is two days later than the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no such game as described in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Gillingham played at home on January 21, 1982, with a score of 0-1. Looking through the table:\n\n- Only one match for Gillingham as home team is found: Tie no 4 on Jan 23, 1982, with a score of 0-1.\n- No match matches the date and specifics of the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"queen park ranger score the most in their game on 23 january 1982\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. First, I'll start by understanding the claim and then look through the table to find relevant information.\n\nThe claim mentions \"queen park ranger,\" which I think refers to Queens Park Rangers, a football team. It says they scored the most in their game on 23 January 1982. So, my task is to check if this is supported by the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a game. The columns are tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. My focus will be on the rows where Queens Park Rangers (QPR) are either the home or away team on 23 January 1982.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: tie no 1, home team is blackpool, score is 0-0 against QPR. So this isn't relevant because it's not QPR playing and they didn't score much here.\n\nRow 2: It says \"replay,\" but the home team is Queens Park Rangers with a score of 5-1. This looks like a playoff or a follow-up match. The date is 26 January, which is after the initial claim's date, so maybe this isn't directly relevant unless it's part of the same game series.\n\nWait, no, the claim specifically mentions 23 January, so row 2 might not be needed because its date is 26 Jan.\n\nRow 3: Home team is Bristol City. No mention of QPR here.\n\nRow 4: Watford as home team; again, no QPR.\n\nRow 5: Sunderland vs. Liverpool. No.\n\nRow 6: Luton Town vs. Ipswich Town. Nope.\n\nRow 7: Shrewsbury Town vs. Burnley. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Newcastle United vs. Grimsby Town. No.\n\nRow 9: Tottenham Hotspur vs. Leeds United. No QPR here.\n\nRow 10: Manchester City vs. Coventry City. No.\n\nRow 11: Brighton & Hove Albion vs. Oxford United. No.\n\nRow 12: Norwich City vs. Doncaster Rovers. Not relevant.\n\nRow 13: Crystal Palace vs. Bolton Wanderers. No.\n\nRow 14: Chelsea vs. Wrexham. Not QPR.\n\nThen, looking for QPR in the away team: Row 1 mentions them as away against blackpool, but that's a draw with 0-0 score. So not the highest.\n\nWait, row 2 is QPR at home with a 5-1 win on 26 Jan. But the claim refers to 23 Jan. So maybe there's another game on 23 Jan where QPR played. Let me check all rows again for games on 23 Jan.\n\nLooking at each row's date:\n\nRows 16: Hereford United vs Leicester City on 23 Jan. No QPR here.\n\nRow 2 is 26 Jan, which is after the claim's date.\n\nSo, in the table, I see that on 23 Jan, QPR was playing as the away team against blackpool with a score of 0-0. So their score wasn't the highest; it was zero. The claim says they scored the most, so that would mean higher than others. But if other teams had goals, maybe they did score more elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which game is being referred to. Maybe on 23 Jan, QPR played and scored a lot. Let me check all games on 23 Jan in the table.\n\nLooking through each row's date:\n\nRow 1: 23 Jan (blackpool vs QPR, 0-0)\nRow 16: Hereford vs Leicester, 23 Jan\nSo only two games on 23 Jan. QPR played and didn't score; others like Hereford had a score of 0-1.\n\nWait, but in row 16, Hereford lost 0-1. So perhaps other teams scored goals, but the claim is about QPR scoring the most.\n\nIf QPR only scored 0 on 23 Jan, then they didn't have the highest score. Therefore, the claim would be false because they didn't score at all in that game. Alternatively, maybe there's another game where they scored more.\n\nWait, no other games on 23 Jan with QPR. So their score was zero in that game.\n\nSo, according to the table, on 23 January 1982, Queens Park Rangers did not score the most; they actually didn't score at all in their game that day. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Queens Park Rangers (QPR) scored the most goals in their game on 23 January 1982, we need to check relevant cells in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with QPR and Date 23 Jan:**\n   - Row 1: QPR as away team vs. Blackpool, score 0-0.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Scores:**\n   - In Row 1, QPR's score is 0, which isn't higher than other teams' scores on the same date.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since QPR scored zero goals and there were no games on 23 Jan where they scored more, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** \"FALSE\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
