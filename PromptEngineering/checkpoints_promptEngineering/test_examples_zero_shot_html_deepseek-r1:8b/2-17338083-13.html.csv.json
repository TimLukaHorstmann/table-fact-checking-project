    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"from 830 bc , the state be song\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions \"from 830 bc\" and specifies that the state is \"song\". So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the 'from' column equals \"830 bc\" and the 'state' column is \"song\".\n\nI'll start by examining the 'from' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first few rows have 'from' values like 837 bc, 835 bc, etc.\n- Moving down, I see a row with 'from' as 830 bc. That's relevant because it matches the \"830 bc\" part of the claim.\n\nNow, I check what the state is for this specific row. The state corresponding to that 'from' value is \"song\". This aligns perfectly with the claim stating that the state is \"song\" at 830 bc.\n\nTo ensure there are no other relevant rows, I'll continue scanning the rest of the table. However, since the first occurrence already matches both conditions, and typically such claims reference specific instances without ambiguity, I can conclude that this row supports the claim fully.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"TRUE\", and the relevant cells are the one where 'state' is \"song\" and 'from' is \"830 bc\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"from\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"state\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and then identify the relevant cells that support this claim. The claim is: \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It seems to be saying that for the state 'jin', there are individuals named 'xi' or 'xian' who hold certain titles, possibly as rulers or nobles.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different state, with various attributes like type (sovereign), name, title, royal house, and from (the time period). The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"state\", \"name\", \"title\".\n\nI need to look for rows where the state is 'jin' because that's the condition specified in the claim. So I'll filter the table to find all rows where the first cell under 'state' is 'jin'.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- 9th row: state 'jin', name 'xi', title 'marquis'\n- 10th row: state 'jin', name 'xian', title 'marquis'\n\nSo both 'xi' and 'xian' are names associated with the state 'jin' as marquises. \n\nNow, checking if there's any other relevant information in the columns. The 'royal house' column has values like 'ji' for several rows. However, since the claim doesn't mention anything about the royal house, I can probably ignore that column unless it's required to verify something else.\n\nThe 'from' column provides dates, but again, the claim isn't about time periods, so those are not relevant here.\n\nFocusing on the 'name' and 'title' columns for state 'jin':\n\n- For 'xi', the title is 'marquis'.\n- For 'xian', the title is also 'marquis'.\n\nThe claim says \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin.\" Since both names are present as marquises of the state 'jin', this seems to support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the two rows where state is 'jin' with their respective names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai.\" So, there are two conditions here:\n\n1. The name is \"yi\".\n2. The royal house is \"ji\".\n3. The state is \"cai\".\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see the relevant ones are 'name', 'royal house', and 'state'. These correspond to column indices 2, 4, and 0 respectively.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check these conditions:\n\n- **Row 0**: State is cai (yes), name is yi (yes), royal house is ji (yes). All three conditions met.\n- **Row 1**: State is cao, so condition fails. Not relevant beyond row 0.\n- The other rows have different states like chu, jin, etc., so only Row 0 meets all the criteria.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by data in Row 0 for columns 'name', 'royal house', and 'state'. No need to check further as only one row matches.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin and the title be duke.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It's saying that there are two possible names\u2014xi and xian\u2014that correspond to a specific state (jin) and a specific title (duke). So, I need to look for rows in the table where the state is \"jin,\" the title is \"duke,\" and the name is either \"xi\" or \"xian.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find matches. The columns relevant here are \"state,\" \"type,\" \"name,\" \"title,\" and \"royal house.\" But for this claim, we're specifically interested in \"state\" being \"jin,\" \"title\" being \"duke,\" and \"name\" being either \"xi\" or \"xian.\"\n\nI'll start by locating all rows where the state is \"jin.\" Scanning through the table:\n\n1. First row with state \"jin\":\n   - Name: xi\n   - Title: marquis\n   - This doesn't match because the title is marquis, not duke.\n\n2. Second row with state \"jin\":\n   - Name: xian\n   - Title: marquis\n   - Again, the title isn't \"duke.\"\n\nSo far, no matches for \"duke\" as the title when state is \"jin.\" I'll check further down the table.\n\n3. Third occurrence of state \"jin\" is actually not present beyond the two I've already checked, so maybe there are only two rows for \"jin.\"\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me recount:\n\n- The first occurrence is row 8: jin, xi, marquis\n- Second occurrence is row 9: jin, xian, marquis\n\nYes, that's correct. So in both cases, the title is \"marquis,\" not \"duke.\"\n\nNow, looking for any rows where state is \"jin\" and title is \"duke.\" Scanning all rows again:\n\nI don't see any such rows. The only times \"jin\" appears are with titles \"marquis\" and once as \"ruler\" in the Qin section, but that's a different state.\n\nWait, no, looking at row 8: state is \"jin,\" type is \"sovereign,\" name is \"xi,\" title is \"marquis.\" So title isn't duke there. Similarly, row 9: same state and name xian, title marquis again.\n\nSo there are no rows where state is \"jin\" and title is \"duke.\" Therefore, the claim that xi or xian be the name when the state is jin and the title is duke doesn't hold true because in all cases for state jin, the title isn't duke; it's marquis.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"when the from be 830 bc , the state be wey\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It seems to be stating a condition where when the 'from' value is 830 BC, the corresponding state is 'wey'. So, my goal is to find if there's any row in the table where 'from' equals 830 bc and check if the state for that row is indeed 'wey'.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different state with various attributes. The columns relevant here are 'state', 'from', and perhaps 'title'. But the claim specifically mentions the 'from' column, so I'll focus on that.\n\nI need to go through each row of the 'from' column and see if any have the value \"830 bc\". Let's scan each row:\n\n1. The first row has 'from' as 837 bc.\n2. Next is 835 bc.\n3. Then 826 bc.\n4. 831 bc.\n5. 837 bc again for Chu.\n6. 827 bc, then 821 bc.\n7. Jin has 840 and 822 bc.\n8. Lu has 854 and 825 bc.\n9. Qi: 850 and 824 bc.\n10. Qin:845 and 822 bc.\n11. Song:830 bc. Wait, this row has 'from' as 830 bc.\n\nSo, the state for that row is 'song'. The claim says when 'from' is 830 bc, the state should be 'wey', but here it's 'song'.\n\nContinuing to check all rows:\n\n- Wey: from 855 bc.\n- Yan: 864 and 826 bc.\n  \nNone of these have 'from' as 830 bc except the Song row. So, when 'from' is 830 bc, the state is Song, not Wey.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no record where 'from' is 830 bc with the state being Wey. Instead, it's associated with Song.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Since the 'from' column has a cell with 830 bc (row index 9), that's the key cell to check. So, the relevant_cells would include this row and column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"from\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai and the year be 826.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into three conditions:\n1. The name is \"yi.\"\n2. The royal house is \"ji.\"\n3. The state is \"cai.\"\n4. The year is 826.\n\nWait, actually, it's four parts because there are two attributes in each condition (name and royal house, etc.). So I'll need to check each of these attributes in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying which rows match all three conditions: name \"yi,\" state \"cai,\" and year 826.\n\nStarting with the state column: \"cai\" is present in one row. Checking that row (row index 0), let's see:\n- Name: yi\n- Royal house: ji\n- Year: 837 bc\n\nHmm, the year here is 837 bc, not 826. So this doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"when\" these conditions are met, so perhaps it's about when all three happen together. But in the table, there's only one row with state cai and name yi (row index 0), but that year is 837 bc. There's another row where state cai isn't present\u2014looking at rows:\n\nWait no, looking back at the table, the first row has state \"cai,\" type \"sovereign,\" name \"yi,\" title \"marquis,\" royal house \"ji,\" and year 837 bc.\n\nAnother row with state \"cao\" is different. So only row index 0 has cai as the state.\n\nBut in that same row, the year is 837 bc, not 826. Therefore, none of the rows have state \"cai,\" name \"yi,\" and year 826. So the claim's conditions are not all met in any single row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check for each condition separately. Let me see:\n\nRoyal house \"ji\" is present in several rows. For example, row index 0 has \"ji,\" but state isn't \"cai.\" Other rows with \"ji\" include cai? Wait no, looking at the table, under \"state,\" the states are different. For instance, row index 0: state \"cai,\" royal house \"ji.\" Then rows for jin have state \"jin,\" not \"cai.\"\n\nWait, so I'm trying to find a row where:\n- State is \"cai\" (so from the first column)\n- Name is \"yi\" (second column)\n- Year is 826 bc\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index 0: state cai, name yi, year 837. Not matching.\n\nOther rows with state \"cai\"? Only row 0 has cai as the state. So no other rows match that. Therefore, there's no row where all three conditions are met\u2014state cai, name yi, and year 826.\n\nThus, the claim is not fully supported by any single row in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"}]}",
