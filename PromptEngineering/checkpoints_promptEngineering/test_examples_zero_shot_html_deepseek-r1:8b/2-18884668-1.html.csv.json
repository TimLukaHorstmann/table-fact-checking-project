Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"bosone 's cardinalatial order and title be cardinal - priest of s anastasia and be elevate circa 1116.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see what needs to be verified.\n\n1. **Cardinality and Title**: The claim mentions that bosone's position should be \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" Looking at the table, under the \"cardinalatial order and title\" column, I need to find the row where the name is bosone. \n\n2. **Elevation Date**: The claim states the elevation (elevation meaning when they became a cardinal) should be circa 1116. Again, looking at the table's \"elevated\" column for bosone.\n\nSo, starting with the table:\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one where the first cell is bosone.\n\n- Row 5: bosone, Italy, Cardinal - priest of s anastasia, circa 1116, Paschal II.\n\nWait, let me count. The rows are numbered from 0 to 8 (since there are 9 rows). So row 5 would be the sixth entry. Checking:\n\nRow 0: Kuno von Urach\nRow 1: Lamberto Scannabecchi\nRow 2: John of Crema\nRow 3: Guido Galli\nRow 4: Bosone\n\nYes, row index 4 (since it's zero-based) is bosone. Now, looking at the \"cardinalatial order and title\" column for this row: It says \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" That matches the claim's first part.\n\nNext, the elevation date is given as \"circa 1116.\" Looking at the \"elevated\" column in the table for bosone. The entry is \"circa 1116.\" So that also matches.\n\nPutting it together: The claim says bosone has a specific title and was elevated around 1116, which both are true according to the table.\n\nI should check if there's any other information needed. The claim doesn't mention nationality or anything else beyond the title and elevation date. So those parts don't affect this particular claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the pisa elector be elevate in 1117\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It mentions a Pisa elector who was elevated (promoted or assigned) in 1117. From the context of ecclesiastical history, \"elected\" usually refers to someone being chosen as a cardinal or a bishop, and \"elevated\" likely means they were promoted to a higher position.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an elector with details like nationality, their role and title, the year they were elevated, and the name of the pope during their elevation. The columns relevant here are \"elector\", \"cardinalatial order and title\", \"elevated\", and maybe \"elevator\" (though I think it's a typo for \"elevated\").\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"Pisa elector,\" so I need to look for an entry where the nationality is Pisa. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. The first row is about Kuno von Urach, German.\n2. Second: Lamberto Scannabecchi, Fagnano.\n3. Third: John of Crema, Crema.\n4. Fourth: Guido Galli, Italy.\n5. Fifth: Bosone, Italy.\n6. Sixth: Corrado de Suburra, Rome.\n7. Seventh: Gregorio Papareschi, Rome.\n8. Eighth: Pietro Pierleoni, Rome.\n9. Ninth: Crisogono Malcondini, Pisa.\n10. Tenth: Roscemanno Sanseverino, Marsica.\n\nSo the ninth row is about Crisogono Malcondini from Pisa. Now, let's check his \"elevated\" year. According to the table, it's 1117, which matches the claim of being elevated in that year.\n\nAdditionally, checking the \"elevator\" column (probably meant to be \"elevated\") confirms it as 1117. The pope at that time is listed as Paschal II, but the claim doesn't mention the pope, so that part isn't necessary for verification.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"elevated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"elector\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the cardinalatial order and title of bosone be cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns seem to be 'elector', 'nationality', 'cardinalatorial order and title', 'elevated', and 'elevator'. But since the claim is about the cardinalatial order and title, I should focus on that column.\n\nI need to find the row where the elector is \"bosone\" because that's the person in question. Scanning through the table rows:\n\n1. The first row after the header (row 0) has 'kuno von urach' as the elector.\n2. Row 1: 'lamberto scannabecchi , canreg'.\n3. Row 2: 'john of crema'.\n4. Row 3: 'guido galli , osb'.\n5. Row 4: 'bosone' \u2013 this is the one we need.\n\nIn row 4, under the column \"cardinalatorial order and title\", it says 'cardinal - priest of s anastasia'.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"the cardinal - priest of s anastasia be the cardinal order and title that be elevate earlier than 1116.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: elector, nationality, cardinalitial order and title, elevated, and elevator. My focus is on the claim about the \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\" being elevated before 1116.\n\nI need to find in the table which rows have the title \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" Scanning through each row, I see that this specific title appears only once. It's in the sixth row (since it's zero-indexed, but looking at the data, it's actually the fifth row because the first row is index 0). \n\nLooking at that particular row, the \"elevated\" column has a value of \"circa 1116.\" Wait, but the claim says \"earlier than 1116.\" So, the elevated year is around 1116. The term \"circa\" suggests it's approximately 1116, so not necessarily earlier.\n\nNow, considering whether \"circa 1116\" counts as before 1116. If something is \"circa\" a certain year, it could be either slightly before or after that year. However, the exact wording of the claim says \"earlier than 1116.\" So if the actual elevation was in 1116 or just around that time, it might not strictly be earlier.\n\nBut looking at other rows, some have \"circa 1107,\" \"circa 1117,\" and one has a range from 1106 to 1116. The specific row for \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\" is about 1116. Therefore, it's not earlier than 1116; it's either in 1116 or very close to that time.\n\nSo the claim doesn't hold because the elevation happened around 1116, not earlier.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cardinalitial order and title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the elector from pisa be elevate in 1117 by urban ii (or paschal ii).\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts:\n1. Elector from Pisa.\n2. Elevated in 1117.\n3. By Urban II or Paschal II.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an elector with their details. I need to find the rows where the nationality is \"Pisa\" and check if they were elevated around 1117 by either Urban II or Paschal II.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n- Row 0: Elector from Germany.\n- Row 1: From Fagnano, not Pisa.\n- Row 2: From Crema, not Pisa.\n- Row 3: From Italy, not Pisa.\n- Row 4: From Italy, not Pisa.\n- Row 5: From Rome, not Pisa.\n- Row 6: From Rome, not Pisa.\n- Row 7: From Pisa.

The claim is: \"the elector bosone be from rome and receive the cardinalatial order and title of the cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. Elector Bosone's nationality is Rome.\n2. He received the cardinalatial order and title as Cardinal-Priest of S Anastasia.\n\nI'll check each part against the table to see if they hold true.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for \"Bosone.\" Scanning through the rows, I see:\n- The fifth row has \"bosone\" as the elector. So that's row index 4 (since counting starts from 0).\n\nNow, checking nationality: In his row, under the 'nationality' column, it says \"italy.\" Wait, the claim says he's from Rome, but in the table, it's Italy. Hmm, does \"Italy\" encompass Rome? I think so, because Rome is a city within Italy. So maybe that part is correct.\n\nNext, his cardinalatial order and title: The 'cardinalatial order and title' column for Bosone says \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" That matches exactly what the claim states. So both parts seem to be true.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there's another Bosone or if it's spelled differently.

Timeframe is circa 1117, which doesn't match 1106.\n  \n- The sixth row mentions Cream again but it's about \"gregorio papareschi\", not an elector from Cream.\n\nWait, actually, I think the claim says 'elector from cream', so looking for rows where elector is from Cream and elevator is Paschal II around 1106.\n\nIn the third row, the elector is John of Crema (Cream), nationality is Crema. Elevator is paschal ii, but the timeframe is 1117, not 1106.\n\nIs there another row? The fifth row has \"guido galli\" from Italy. The fourth row is Bosone from Italy.
