Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" completing in the \"olympic game\" with a time of \"2\". But wait, the term \"Olympic Games\" could be plural or singular depending on context, but here it's probably referring to a specific event.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows for \"olympic games.\" Specifically, there are two entries: one in 2008 and another in 2012. Each of these entries has different positions and distances, like 29th place and 6th place, respectively. \n\nThe claim refers to a time of \"2,\" but I'm not sure what event this is referring to. In track and field, the '2' could refer to an event like the 200m or another specific race. However, looking at the table's 'notes' column, which lists distances in meters, there are no entries with a time of exactly \"2.\" For example, the closest one is 77.17 m in 2012, which doesn't match.\n\nAlso, the name \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" isn't mentioned anywhere in the table provided. The table only lists competitors with their positions and distances but not specific athletes' names or times. So there's no data to support that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich participated in the Olympics with a time of 2.\n\nTherefore, since there's no supporting evidence in the table for either part of the claim (the athlete's participation and the specific time), I have to conclude that the claim is not supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich complete in the olympic game 2 time\" isn't supported by the provided table. The table doesn't mention Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich or any participant with a time of exactly 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich place third place or higher in 1 competition\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" placing third place or higher in at least one competition. So, I need to look for any row where his position is 3rd or better (i.e., 1st, 2nd, or 3rd).\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year and some details about competitions. The columns we have are: year, competition, venue, position, and notes.\n\nWait a minute, the claim is specifically about \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich,\" but I don't see that name in any of the competition names listed in the 'competition' column. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the table isn't directly listing his results but rather other competitions where he might have participated.\n\nWait, no, looking again, each row lists a different competition, like \"world junior championships,\" \"European junior championships,\" etc. There's no mention of \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" in any of these. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that the data is about him? Or perhaps it's just an example table.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't mentioned anything else. The claim is about \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich,\" so if he isn't listed in the table at all, then there might be no data to support or contradict the claim. But that can't be right because the instructions say to check against the table. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe the name \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" is a redacted name, and I need to look for his performance in competitions listed here. But since none of the competition names match that, perhaps he's not in this dataset. Alternatively, maybe it's an error, but let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" is the person whose position we're checking across competitions. Since each row lists a different competition, I need to check if any of these competitions have him placing 3rd or higher.\n\nBut since his name isn't in the table, maybe this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant someone else's results. But given that the claim is about \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich,\" I might not find anything in the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check each row for any mention of his name. Scanning through the 'notes' column, I see distances like 61.51 m, 64.20 m, etc., which could be his results. But without his name in the table, I can't link these to him.\n\nWait, maybe the 'position' refers to his placement. So perhaps each row represents a different competition where he placed, and we need to check if any of those positions are 3rd or higher.\n\nBut since the claim is about \"1 competition,\" meaning at least one where he placed third or higher, I need to see if there's at least one row where position <=3.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1998: 10th \u2192 Not good.\n- 1999: 5th \u2192 Not good.\n- 2001: 11th \u2192 No.\n- 2003: 4th \u2192 Yes! That's third place or higher (4th is worse than 3rd, so actually lower). Wait, no. The claim says \"third place or higher,\" which would mean positions 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. So a 4th place wouldn't count.\n\nWait, position column: 10th, 5th, 11th, 4th, etc. So in the row for 2003, position is 4th, which is lower than 3rd. So that doesn't satisfy the claim.\n\nNext, check if any other rows have a position of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd:\n\nLooking at all positions:\n\n- 1998:10\n- 1999:5\n- 2001:11\n- 2003:4\n- 2005:14\n- 2006:15\n- 2008:29\n- 2009:14\n- 2012:6\n- 2013:3\n\nAh, in the last row (2013), position is 3rd. So that's a 3rd place finish.\n\nSo, the claim says \"third place or higher in 1 competition.\" Since there's at least one competition where he placed 3rd or better (specifically, exactly 3rd), this would support the claim as TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I'm assuming that the 'position' column refers to his placement. However, the 'notes' column has distances without any names. So perhaps each row is a different event, and the position is his ranking in that event.\n\nTherefore, since in 2013 he placed 3rd, which is third place, this satisfies \"third place or higher\" as third is considered higher than fourth but lower than second. Wait, no: when someone places 1st, they are first; 2nd, second; 3rd, third. So the claim says \"third place or higher,\" meaning positions 1,2,3. So if he placed 3rd, that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, since in 2013 he placed 3rd, the claim is supported as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided. In the year 2013, \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" achieved a third-place finish, meeting the criterion of placing third or higher in at least one competition.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true because there is evidence that \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" placed third in at least one competition (specifically in 2013).",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the competition type is specifically \"junior championship,\" and perhaps it happens twice. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact phrasing, so I'll need to parse this carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and see which ones have a competition type that matches what the claim is saying. The relevant column here is \"competition.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n1. 1998: world junior championships \u2013 That does include \"junior championship,\" but it's plural. Wait, no, the term is \"world junior championships,\" so maybe that counts as a junior championship.\n2. 1999: european junior championships \u2013 Same here, it has \"junior championships.\"\n3. 2001: european u23 championships \u2013 This one uses \"u23,\" not \"junior.\" So probably not relevant for the claim about \"junior championship.\"\n4. 2003: universiade \u2013 Not a competition I'm familiar with in this context, so maybe not.\n5. 2005: world championships \u2013 That's just \"world championships,\" no mention of junior.\n6. 2006: european championships \u2013 Similar to above, just \"championships.\"\n7. 2008: olympic games \u2013 Definitely not a junior championship.\n8. 2009: world championships \u2013 Again, same as before.\n9. 2012: olympic games \u2013 Same as 2008.\n10. 2013: world championships \u2013 No mention of juniors here.\n\nWait, in the table, I see that there are entries for \"world junior championships\" (1998) and \"european junior championships\" (1999). So these two rows have competition types that include \"junior championship.\" The claim is saying that the type is a junior championship twice. Since there are two such competitions listed in the table, it seems to align with the claim.\n\nBut I should also check if the term used in the claim matches exactly what's in the table. The claim says \"junior championship,\" but in the table, it's \"world junior championships\" and \"european junior championships.\" So technically, they are both \"junior championships,\" just with different prefixes.\n\nNow, considering that, does having two entries make the claim true? Yes, because there are two instances where the competition type includes \"junior championship.\"\n\nSo I think the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones in 1998 and 1999 where the competition type starts with \"junior championships.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"4 of the competition out of 10 be world wide championship.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table. They are: year, competition, venue, position, and notes. The claim mentions \"competition\" and specifically refers to \"world wide championship.\" So, my focus should be on the 'competition' column and how many times it's listed as \"world championships.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. 1998: world junior championships\n2. 1999: European junior championships\n3. 2001: European u23 championships\n4. 2003: Universiade\n5. 2005: world championships\n6. 2006: European championships\n7. 2008: Olympic games\n8. 2009: world championships\n9. 2012: Olympic games\n10. 2013: world championships\n\nNow, count how many times the competition is \"world championships.\" From the above, it's in 2005 (row 4), 2009 (row7), and 2013 (row9). Wait, that's three instances. But the claim says \"4 of the competition out of 10 be world wide championship.\"\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list each row with their index:\n\nRow 0: 1998\nRow1: 1999\nRow2:2001\nRow3:2003\nRow4:2005 - yes, \"world championships\"\nRow5:2006\nRow6:2008 - Olympic games\nRow7:2009 - \"world championships\" (row index 7)\nRow8:2012 - Olympic games\nRow9:2013 - \"world championships\"\n\nSo rows 4,7,9 are three instances where competition is world championships. The claim says four out of ten. So the count doesn't match\u2014three vs. four.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in row indices. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table, each <tr> corresponds to a row. The first row after <tbody> is 1998 as row index 0, then 1999 as row1, and so on up to row9 for 2013.\n\nSo the competitions are:\n\nRow4 (2005): world championships\nRow7 (2009): world championships\nRow9 (2013): world championships\n\nThat's three times. The claim says four. So the count is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are only three instances, not four.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"competition out of 10.\" Perhaps it refers to the first five rows? But that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the user meant \"4 competitions out of the total 10 be world wide championships.\" Since only three are, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that four competitions out of ten should be \"world wide championships,\" but according to the table, this happens three times.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"in luk\u00e1\u0161 melich 's last 2 competition he throw an average distance of 78.27 m\". So I'm looking for information about his last two competitions and their distances.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, competition, venue, position, and notes. The years listed are from 1998 up to 2013, with various competitions. I need to identify which of these could be Melich's last two competitions.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"last two competition\", so I should look for his most recent two competitions in the table. The latest year in the table is 2013, so that would be row index 8 (since it starts from 0). So the last two would be 2012 and 2013.\n\nLet me check those rows:\n\nFor 2012: \n- Year: 2012\n- Competition: Olympic games\n- Position: 6th\n- Notes: 77.17 m\n\nFor 2013:\n- Year: 2013\n- Competition: world championships\n- Position: 3rd\n- Notes: 79.36 m\n\nNow, I need to calculate the average distance of these two competitions. The distances are 77.17 and 79.36 meters.\n\nCalculating the average: (77.17 + 79.36) / 2 = (156.53) / 2 = 78.265 meters.\n\nThe claim states an average of 78.27 m, which is very close to 78.265. Considering possible rounding in the claim or data, it's reasonable to say they match.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there are any other relevant rows that might be considered his last two competitions. For example, if he participated in 2013 and then 2014, but since the table only goes up to 2013, those would not be included. So the last two are indeed 2012 and 2013.\n\nWait, looking at the table again, after 2013 there's no data. So yes, 2012 and 2013 are his last two competitions listed here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether \"Olympic games\" and \"world championships\" are both considered competitions by Melich. The table includes these as separate competitions, so they should be included in the average.\n\nAlso, checking the calculation again: 77.17 + 79.36 = 156.53; divided by 2 is exactly 78.265 m, which rounds to 78.27 when considering two decimal places. So the claim's figure of 78.27 m is correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}]}",

So, I need to check if there's any data in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: year, competition, venue, position, and notes. The rows represent different events over the years, including Olympic Games in 2008 and 2012.\n\nStarting with the first relevant event, in 2008 (row index 7), the competition is \"olympic games,\" venue is Beijing, China, and position is 29th. The notes say 70.56 m. I'm not sure if a 29th place counts as a medal. Typically, top three positions get medals, so 29th would be no medal.\n\nNext, in 2012 (row index 9), the competition again is \"olympic games,\" held in London, with position 6th and notes of 77.17 m. Sixth place might also not be a medal position. So neither of these rows show Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich winning a medal.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich\" specifically. I need to check if the table includes him. Scanning through the table, the names of competitors aren't provided in the 'notes' column. The positions and distances are there, but no mentions of specific athletes like Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich. So without his name in the table, it's unclear.\n\nHowever, the claim is about winning a medal at the Olympic Games. Even if his name isn't there, maybe we can infer based on typical participation. But I think for this task, the presence of his name in the table is crucial. Since he isn't listed, the claim might be false unless supported by data.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the 'notes' column includes his achievements beyond just the distance. If any of them mention a medal, but looking at the notes, they only have distances like 61.51 m, etc., so no medals mentioned there either.\n\nTherefore, there's no direct evidence in the table that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich won a medal at the Olympic Games.

The term \"best finish\" refers to his highest ranking achieved in competitions listed in the table. The claim states that his best finish is second. So I need to check if there's any record where Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich finished second in any of these competitions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has data for a specific competition. Let me go through each competition and see if any position \"2nd\" is recorded under the 'position' column for Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich.\n\nThe table includes competitions from 1998 to 2013, with various positions ranging from 10th to 3rd. I'll need to check each row to see if the 'position' is 2nd and whether it's associated with Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich. However, in the current table provided, the name \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich\" isn't explicitly mentioned. All the entries under the 'notes' column refer to distances, not specific athlete names.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table lists competitions, venue, year, position, and distance. It doesn't mention athletes by name. So perhaps the claim is about whether any athlete named Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich has a best finish of second in these competitions. But since the table doesn't include athlete names, there's no direct way to confirm if such an athlete exists or what their best finishes are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant a different athlete. For example, I'm aware that Jakub Nov\u00e1k is a Czech javelin thrower named Luk\u00e1\u0161 who might have had notable finishes. However, without specific data linking Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's performance to these competitions, it's impossible to verify from the table.\n\nGiven that the 'position' column in the table doesn't show any entries with \"2nd\" for any of the listed competitions, and since there's no reference to Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich specifically in the table, I can infer that there is no evidence supporting the claim. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because we don't have data showing a finish position of second for Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich's best finish is second,\" we need to check if any competition in the table lists a position of 2nd for him.

It seems like it's stating that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich achieved his best (highest) position in a competition when he was a junior. So, I'm looking for instances where he competed as a junior and check if his performance was better than when he wasn't.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year with details about the competition, venue, position, and notes. The 'position' column shows the rank he achieved in that year. The claim is specifically about his \"highest finish as a junior,\" so I should focus on rows where he was considered a junior.\n\nI need to determine which years correspond to him being a junior. Typically, athletes compete at various levels: junior, under-23, senior, etc. The table includes competitions like 'world junior championships,' 'european junior championships,' and 'european u23 championships.' These seem to indicate that in 1998, 1999, and 2001, he was a junior.\n\nSo, I'll look at rows for 1998, 1999, and 2001. For each of these:\n\n- **1998**: Position is 10th.\n- **1999**: Position is 5th.\n- **2001**: Position is 11th.\n\nComparing his positions in these junior competitions to his later performances as a senior (like in 2003, 2005, etc.), it's clear that his highest finish as a junior was the 5th place in 1999. \n\nNow, checking if any of the other rows could indicate a higher position when he wasn't a junior. For example, in 2003, he placed 4th at the Universiade, which is better than some of his junior positions but not necessarily higher than others. However, since the claim is about his \"highest finish as a junior,\" I should focus on whether he achieved a better position during those years compared to when he wasn't a junior.\n\nWait, actually, in 2003, he was competing at the Universiade, which might be considered a different level than junior. So, his best position as a junior is indeed 5th in 1999.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold because his highest finish during his junior years was better than some of his later performances. However, I should also check if there are any other relevant rows or if I'm missing something.\n\nLooking again, the claim says \"highest finish,\" so even if he did better as a senior, the question is whether in his junior participation, he achieved that high. Since 5th is higher than 10th and 11th in those years, it's correct that his highest as a junior was 5th.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"highest finish be as a junior,\" implying that the best (highest) position he achieved was when he was a junior. However, looking at the table, in later competitions, especially 2003 and beyond, he placed higher, like 4th in 2003, which is better than his junior positions. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because he achieved a higher position after being a junior.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The claim says that his highest finish was as a junior. So if he had a better (higher) position later on, then the claim would be false.\n\nFor example:\n\n- As a junior in 1999: 5th\n- Later in 2003: 4th (which is better than 5th)\n- In 2012: 6th (worse than 4th but better than some others)\n\nSo, since he achieved a higher position (4th) after being a junior, his highest finish wasn't as a junior. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, in 2003, was he considered a senior? The competition was 'universiade,' which might be for under-23 athletes. So perhaps he was still considered a junior or not. I need to clarify that.\n\nIn track and field, typically:\n\n- Junior refers to those who are less than 20 years old and have not yet achieved their 21st birthday.\n- Under-23 is another category, often separated from juniors but higher than them.\n- Seniors are adults over 23.\n\nSo, in 2003, the European U23 Championships would be for athletes aged 18-23. So, perhaps he was considered a senior at that point or an under-23 athlete, not a junior anymore.\n\nTherefore, his best position as a junior was indeed 5th in 1999. After that, as an under-23 or senior, he achieved higher positions (4th and up). Therefore, the claim is saying that his highest finish was as a junior, which is TRUE because his highest position during his junior years was better than some of his later performances.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"highest finish be as a junior,\" meaning that his best overall position was achieved when he was a junior. But in reality, he had better positions after being a junior, so the claim would be false because his highest finish wasn't as a junior.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe claim is stating that \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich's highest finish be as a junior.\" So, we need to see if the best (highest) position he achieved was during his junior years.\n\nLooking at all positions:\n\n- 1998: 10\n- 1999:5\n- 2000: ?\n- 2001:11\n- 2003:4\n- 2005: ?\n- 2012:6\n\nSo, the best position is 4th in 2003. Since he achieved this after his junior years, it means that his highest finish wasn't as a junior; it was later on.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because he achieved a higher position (4th) when he was likely an under-23 or senior athlete, not a junior anymore. So, the claim that his highest finish was as a junior is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich's highest finish be as a junior\" is **FALSE**. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- During his junior years (1998, 1999, and 2001), his best position was 5th in the 1999 European Junior Championships.\n- After transitioning to senior or under-23 competitions, he achieved higher positions, such as 4th at the 2003 Universiade.\n- Therefore, his highest finish (4th) occurred after his junior years, making the claim incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"4 of the competition be senior world championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that there are 4 competitions in the table which are labeled as \"senior world championships.\" So I need to look through each row and check if the 'competition' column mentions \"senior world championship.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first competition is \"world junior championships\" \u2014 this doesn't match.\n2. Next is \"european junior championships\" \u2014 also not a match.\n3. Then, \"european u23 championships\" \u2014 again, no.\n4. The fourth row lists \"universiade\" \u2014 not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: \"world championships\" \u2014 hmm, this could be tricky because 'world championships' can refer to different events. I need to see if it's specified as a senior one.\n6. Sixth row: \"european championships\" \u2014 no match.\n7. Seventh row: \"olympic games\" \u2014 not relevant here.\n8. Eighth row: another \"world championships\" \u2014 same as above.\n9. Ninth row: \"olympic games\" again.\n10. Tenth row: \"world championships\" once more.\n\nWait, the fifth, eighth, and tenth rows all say \"world championships.\" The claim is about \"senior world championship,\" so I need to check if any of these specify that it's a senior event or just refer to them as 'world championships' in general. Since the table doesn't specify 'senior,' each of these entries might not qualify unless explicitly stated.\n\nLooking back, none of the rows list \"senior world championship.\" Instead, they just say \"world championships\" without specifying seniority level. So there are three instances where 'world championships' appear, but none are labeled as senior specifically.\n\nThe claim states that there should be four competitions, so if only three entries match without the word 'senior,' then it's false. Also, even if they were all senior, there are only three, not four.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there aren't four entries explicitly stating \"senior world championship.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich never throw for greater than 78 m\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I should understand the claim. It says that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's throws were never more than 78 meters. So, I need to check each of his performances in the table and see if any of them exceed this distance.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists events from 1998 onwards. The columns are year, competition, venue, position, and notes. The 'notes' column seems to have the throw distances, so that's where I should focus.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row related to Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich. Wait, actually, looking at the table, it doesn't specify who threw in each event. But given that the claim is about him, I assume these are his performances. Alternatively, maybe the table includes all athletes, and I need to pick only those where he participated.\n\nBut without explicit information on who threw in each event, this could be tricky. However, the 'notes' column seems to correspond to throw distances, so perhaps it's safe to assume that for each row, the note is the relevant distance for that year.\n\nSo, let me list out the notes:\n\n1998: 61.51 m\n1999: 64.20 m\n2001: 66.41 m\n2003: 71.26 m\n2005: 74.53 m\n2006: 73.77 m\n2008: 70.56 m\n2009: 74.47 m\n2012: 77.17 m\n2013: 79.36 m\n\nNow, checking each of these against the claim:\n\nThe maximum distance in the notes is 79.36 meters from 2013. Since 79.36 is greater than 78, this would mean that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich did throw for more than 78 meters at least once.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich never throw for greater than 78 m\" is FALSE because in 2013, he threw 79.36 m which is over 78 m.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"notes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
