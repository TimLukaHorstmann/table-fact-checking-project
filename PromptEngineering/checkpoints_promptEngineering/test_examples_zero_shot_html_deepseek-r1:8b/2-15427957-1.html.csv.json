The claim is: \"the first time they be in tier 1 be in 1999.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's stating that the team first achieved Tier 1 status during the 1999 season. I need to check the table provided to see if there's a record of them being in Tier 1 for the first time in 1999.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different season from 1997-98 to 2012-13. The relevant columns here are \"season\" and \"tier\". \n\nI'll go through each row to see when they were in Tier 1 for the first time. Starting with 1997-98: Tier is 2, so not Tier 1. Next, 1998-99: still Tier 2. Then comes 1999-00: Tier 1. That seems like their first time being in Tier 1.\n\nWait, but I should check all the previous seasons to make sure they weren't in Tier 1 earlier. Before 1999-00, from 1997 onwards, none of the rows show Tier 1. So yes, 1999 is indeed their first year in Tier 1.\n\nNow, let's think about any other aspects. The claim doesn't mention other columns like league or postseason, so those aren't relevant here. It's solely about the tier level and the season.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim should be TRUE because they were first in Tier 1 during the 1999-00 season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tier\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tier\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"between 2000 and 2003, the only league represented be Bundesliga.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that from 2000 to 2003, the only league involved was Bundesliga. So I need to check each season in that period and see which leagues are listed.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are 'season', 'tier', 'league', 'postseason', and 'european competitions'. But for this claim, the most important column is 'league'.\n\nLet's go through each row from 2000-01 to 2002-03. Wait, the seasons listed in the table start from 1997-98 up to 2012-13. So between 2000 and 2003, which years are covered?\n\nFrom the table:\n- 2000 - 01: Bundesliga\n- 2001 - 02: Bundesliga\n- 2002 - 03: Bundesliga\n\nWait, no. Let me check each row:\n\n2000 - 01: tier is 1, league is Bundesliga.\n2001 - 02: tier 1, Bundesliga.\n2002 - 03: tier 1, Bundesliga.\n\nSo all those years, the league was Bundesliga. But wait, let's also check if there are any other leagues in that period. Let me look at the table again.\n\nLooking through each season between 2000 and 2003:\n\n- 1999-00: Bundesliga (not in our range)\n- 2000-01: Bundesliga\n- 2001-02: Bundesliga\n- 2002-03: Bundesliga\n\nSo within the specified years, all leagues are Bundesliga. However, I should also check if there's any other league in that period that might have been represented, but from what I see, it's only Bundesliga.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row:\n\nLooking for seasons starting with 2000:\n- 2000 - 01: Bundesliga\n- 2001 - 02: Bundesliga\n- 2002 - 03: Bundesliga\n\nYes, all those years are Bundesliga. So the claim says that between 2000 and 2003, the only league represented was Bundesliga. That seems to be true based on the table.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any row in that period with a different league. For example, tier changes or other leagues.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1997-98: BBL\n- 1998-99: BBL\n- 1999-00: Bundesliga\n- 2000-01: Bundesliga\n- 2001-02: Bundesliga\n- 2002-03: Bundesliga\n- 2003-04: Oberliga\n\nWait, 2003-04 is after our range.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the league be oberliga the last time the tier be 3\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"the league be oberliga\" refers to a situation where the league is the Oberliga. The second part, \"the last time the tier be 3\", means we're looking for the last season where the tier was 3.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to identify which rows have the tier as 3 and check if the corresponding league column is Oberliga. From the table, I can see that tier 3 only appears in one row: 2004 - 05, where the tier is 3, and the league is Oberliga. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Scanning through each row:\n\n- 1997-98: tier 2\n- 1998-99: tier 2\n- 1999-00: tier 1\n- 2000-01: tier 1\n- 2001-02: tier 1\n- 2002-03: tier 1\n- 2003-04: tier 1\n- 2004-05: tier 3, league Oberliga\n- Then other rows have tiers 2 and 1.\n\nSo the last time the tier was 3 is 2004 - 05. In that season, the league is Oberliga, which matches the claim. Therefore, the condition in the claim is satisfied because when the tier was 3, the league was Oberliga.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify the relevant cells that verify this. The row for 2004-05 has season as 2004 - 05, tier 3, and league Oberliga. So the relevant cells are row index 8 (since it's zero-indexed) and column_name \"league\".\n\nWait, let me count the rows starting from 0:\n\n1. 1997 - 98\n2. 1998 - 99\n...\n8. 2004 - 05\n\nYes, that's correct. So row_index is 8, and column_name is \"league\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the tier 3 season (2004-05) where the league was Oberliga.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"they be in the fiba europe cup champion european competition before 2005\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It seems to say that some team was in the FIBA Europe Cup as champions before 2005. So, I need to look for any row where the 'postseason' column indicates a championship or some form of winning that competition before the year 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season from 1997-98 up to 2012-13. The relevant columns here are 'tier', 'league', and 'postseason'. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's a match:\n\n1. **1997-98**: Tier 2, BBL. Postseason is '-', so no info.\n2. **1998-99**: Tier 2, BBL. Postseason is promotion playoffs. Not a championship.\n3. **1999-00**: Tier 1, Bundesliga. Postseason is quarterfinalist. No win here.\n4. **2000-01**: Tier 1, Bundesliga. Quarterfinalist again. Still no.\n5. **2001-02**: Tier 1, Bundesliga. Relegated. Not relevant.\n6. **2002-03**: Tier 1, Bundesliga. '-' for postseason. No info.\n7. **2003-04**: Tier 1, Bundesliga. Fiba Europe Cup champion. Wait, the 'postseason' here says \"fiba europe cup champion\". But the season is 2003-04. So, if this is correct, that would mean they were champions in that competition before 2005? \n\nWait, but 2003-04 is before 2005. So this row seems relevant because it shows they won the FIBA Europe Cup in 2003, which is before 2005.\n\nI should check if any other rows after 2004 also show wins in the FIBA Europe Cup or related competitions before 2005. \n\nLooking further:\n\n8. **2004-05**: Tier 3, Oberliga. Promoted. No relevant info.\n9. **2005-06**: Tier 2, BBL. '-' for postseason.\n10. **2006-07**: Tier 2, BBL. '-'\n11. **2007-08**: Tier 2, Pro A. '-'\n12. **2008-09**: Tier 2, Pro A. Promoted.

'-'\n\nSo the only row where they were champions in a European competition before 2005 is the 2003-04 season, specifically in the 'postseason' column indicating FIBA Europe Cup victory.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"postseason\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the first time they be relegate in the postseason be before the first time they be promote in the postseason.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. So, \"relegate\" refers to being demoted from a higher tier to a lower one, while \"promote\" is moving up to a higher tier. The term \"postseason\" likely refers to playoff situations where teams can be promoted or relegated.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all instances where a team was relegated in the postseason and all instances where they were promoted in the postseason. Then, I have to check if the first relegation happened before the first promotion.\n\nThe table has a column called \"postseason\" which lists various outcomes like 'promotion playoffs', 'quarterfinalist', 'relegated', etc. Another column is 'tier' which shows the league level each season.\n\nLet me go through the table row by row to identify when relegations and promotions occurred in the postseason.\n\nStarting from 1997-98:\n- Tier 2, League: 2. bbl, Postseason: -\nNo mention of promotion or relegation here.\n\n1998-99:\n- Tier 2, same league, postseason: promotion playoffs.\nSo this is a promotion, but not a relegation.\n\n1999-00:\n- Tier 1, Bundesliga, postseason: quarterfinalist.\nNo promotion or relegation mentioned.\n\n2000-01:\n- Tier 1, Bundesliga, postseason: quarterfinalist.\nNo info on promotion or relegation here.\n\n2001-02:\n- Tier 1, Bundesliga, postseason: relegated.\nThis is the first instance of a team being relegated in the postseason.\n\nMoving forward:\n2002-03 and 2003-04:\n- Tier 1, Bundesliga, but no mention of postseason outcomes except for 2003-04 where they were champions of something, but it's not clear if that's a promotion or just winning a competition. I need to check if it's considered a promotion.\n\n2004-05:\n- Tier 3, Oberliga, postseason: promoted.\nThis is the first instance of promotion in the postseason.\n\nSo, from this analysis, the first time they were relegated was in 2001-02 (Season 8), and the first promotion was in 2004-05 (Season 10). Since Season 8 comes before Season 10, the claim that the first relegation happens before the first promotion is TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other instances. Checking through the rest of the table:\n\nAfter 2004-05, there are more promotions in 2008-09 and 2011-12, but those are not in the postseason as per their 'postseason' column (they have '-'). So only 2004-05 has a promotion in the postseason.\n\nThus, the first relegation is indeed before the first promotion.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"}]}",

First, I'll break down what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tier 1\" and specifies that the last time they were in tier 1 was in 1999. Looking at the table, each row represents a season along with various details like their tier, league, etc.\n\nSo, I should look for rows where the tier is 1 and check if 1999 is mentioned as the most recent occurrence. The table has multiple entries for tier 1:\n\n- 1999 - 00: Tier 1\n- 2000 - 01: Tier 1\n- 2002 - 03: Tier 1\n- 2004 - 05: Not Tier 1\n- 2009 - 10: Tier 1\n- 2010 - 11: Tier 1 (but relegated, so maybe not relevant for being in tier 1 at the end of the season)\nWait, actually, the claim is about the last time they were in tier 1. So I should look for when their tier was 1 and whether after that, there are no more entries where tier is 1 except perhaps before 1999.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- After 1999 - 00, tier goes to 1 again in 2000 - 01, so that's a later season. Therefore, if they were in tier 1 again after 1999, then the last time can't be 1999.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that 1999 was their last time being in tier 1, but the table shows they were in tier 1 again in 2000-01 and beyond. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's a later season (2000-01) where they are still in tier 1.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for this check would be \"tier\" and \"season\". For each row from 1999-00 onwards, I should look at the tier column. \n\nRows after 1999-00 where tier is 1 include 2000-01, 2002-03, 2009-10, and 2010-11.

Each of these shows that after 1999, they were still in tier 1, making the claim false.\n\nI need to map each relevant cell with their row indices.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into two parts: \n1. \"oberliga be promote in the postseason\"\n2. \"before the last time the tier be 3\"\n\nI need to find out if there's a row where the league is oberliga and they were promoted during the postseason, and this happened before the last occurrence where the tier was 3.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row for the 'league' column and see when it says \"oberliga.\" From the data:\n\n- The season 2004 -05 has league as \"oberliga\" and was promoted.\n- Another oberliga entry is in 2011 -12? Wait, no, looking back, 2011-12 is pro a. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no. Looking through the 'league' column:\n\n1997-98: 2. bbl\n1998-99: 2. bbl\n1999-00: bundesliga\n2000-01: bundesliga\n2001-02: bundesliga\n2002-03: bundesliga\n2003-04: fiba europe cup champion\n2004-05: oberliga\n2005-06: 2. bbl\n2006-07: 2. bbl\n2007-08: pro a\n2008-09: pro a\n2009-10: bundesliga\n2010-11: bundesliga\n2011-12: pro a\n2012-13: bundesliga\n\nSo, \"oberliga\" is only in 2004-05. In that season, they were promoted.\n\nNow, the claim mentions promoting before the last time the tier was 3. The tier refers to the 'tier' column.\n\nLooking for when the tier was 3:\n\nIn 2004-05: tier is 3.\nIs there any later season where tier is 3 after 2004? Looking through all rows, I don't see another tier 3. So the last time tier was 3 is 2004-05.\n\nThe claim says \"before the last time,\" which would mean before 2004-05. But in 2004-05, they promoted during the season. However, I need to check if that promotion happened in the postseason.\n\nWait, the 'postseason' column for 2004-05 is blank (-). So it's unclear whether they were promoted in the postseason or not. The claim says \"oberliga be promote in the postseason,\" but if there's no indication of a postseason promotion, then this part might not hold.\n\nBut wait, let me check another angle. The last time tier was 3 is 2004-05. So any promotion before that would have to be earlier than 2004-05. Looking for oberliga promotions in the postseason before 2004-05, but I only see 2004-05 as the only oberliga season.\n\nWait, no other seasons before 2004-05 had oberliga. So, if the last tier 3 is 2004-05, and the promotion happened in that same season, it's not technically \"before\" the last time. Therefore, there might be an issue here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim means that they promoted in the postseason before the last time their tier was 3. Since the last tier 3 is 2004-05, and promotion happened that season (even if not specified as postseason), it's still within the same timeframe.\n\nWait, but the 'postseason' column for 2004-05 is empty. So there's no indication they promoted in the postseason during that time. Therefore, the promotion might not have occurred in the postseason at all. That would mean the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:\n\n1. There exists a season where league is oberliga and they were promoted.\n2. This happened before the last occurrence of tier 3.\n\nSince the last tier 3 is 2004-05, and promotion in that season would not be before it. Therefore, perhaps there's no such row where both conditions are met, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each relevant cell:\n\nLooking for rows where league is \"oberliga\" and tier is 3 (since promotion needs to happen in a tier 3 situation? Or does it not matter? The claim doesn't specify tiers related to promotion, so perhaps that's irrelevant.)\n\nWait, the claim just says promoting in the postseason before the last tier 3. So maybe any promotion by oberliga before the last tier 3.\n\nBut since the only oberliga is in 2004-05, and that's also the last tier 3, then it can't be before that. Hence, no such row exists where they promoted before the last tier 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that there is no evidence of an Oberliga promotion in the postseason before the last occurrence of a tier 3.

The relevant columns here are \"season,\" \"tier,\" \"league,\" and specifically for this claim, I need to focus on the \"league\" column between the years 2000-01 to 2003-04.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table that falls within the 2000-2003 range. \n\nStarting with 2000-01:\n- Season: 2000 - 01\n- League: Bundesliga\n\nNext, 2001-02:\n- League: Bundesliga (until 2002)\n\nThen, 2002-03:\n- League: Bundesliga\n\nWait, no, looking again, the 2002-03 row shows league as Bundesliga, and 2003-04 is also Bundesliga until 2004 when it drops to Oberliga.\n\nBut wait, let me check each relevant row:\n\n- 2000-01: Bundesliga\n- 2001-02: Bundesliga\n- 2002-03: Bundesliga\n- 2003-04: Bundesliga\n\nWait, that's not right. The table shows:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n2000 - 01: Bundesliga\n2001 - 02: Bundesliga (until 2002)\n2002 - 03: Bundesliga\n2003 - 04: Bundesliga until 2004 when it drops to Oberliga.\n\nWait, no, in row 2003-04, the league is Bundesliga. Then in 2004-05, it's Oberliga.\n\nSo between 2000 and 2003 (inclusive), all the leagues listed are Bundesliga. Therefore, there's only Bundesliga present during those years, meaning other leagues like Pro A or Oberliga were not present yet until later seasons.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\nFor example, in 2006-07, the league is 2. bbl, which is different from Bundesliga (1). But that's outside our timeframe of 2000-03.\n\nSo within 2000-01 to 2003-04, all entries are Bundesliga. That means between 2000 and 2003, the only league present was Bundesliga. Therefore, no other leagues were represented in those years.\n\nWait, but in 2004-05, it's Oberliga, which is a different league, but that's after 2003. So within 2000 to 2003, all leagues are Bundesliga, meaning that the claim is correct: only Bundesliga was not represented (no other leagues were present), so the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"the only league not represented between 2000 and 2003 is bundesliga.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. It's phrased a bit confusingly. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe claim: \"the only league not represent between 2000 and 2003 be bundesliga.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the intended meaning is that between 2000 and 2003, Bundesliga was the only league not represented, implying that other leagues were present during those years. But according to the table, during those years (2000-03), all entries are Bundesliga. So if other leagues were not present, then Bundesliga is the only one not represented? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again. The claim could be interpreted as: Between 2000 and 2003, the only league that was NOT represented is Bundesliga (meaning others were represented). But according to the table, during those years, all leagues listed are Bundesliga. So if other leagues were not present, then Bundesliga was the one that was present, but the claim says it's the only one not represented, which would be incorrect because it was actually represented.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express this:\n\nThe claim is: Between 2000 and 2003, only Bundesliga was not represented. So other leagues were represented during those years.\n\nBut looking at the table, in each of those years (2000-01 to 2003-04), the league is Bundesliga. So if other leagues weren't present, then the claim would be incorrect because it's saying that only Bundesliga was not represented when actually it was the only one that was present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to see which leagues were present between 2000 and 2003. If during those years, other leagues besides Bundesliga were present, then the claim would be false because it says only Bundesliga wasn't represented.\n\nBut according to the table, in the years from 2000-01 to 2003-04, all entries are Bundesliga. So no other leagues were present; therefore, the statement that \"only Bundesliga was not represented\" is incorrect because it's actually the only one that was represented during those years. So the claim would be false.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this:\n\nThe claim says: Between 2000 and 2003, the only league not represented is Bundesliga.\n\nThis implies that in those years, other leagues (not Bundesliga) were present.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2000-01: Bundesliga\n- 2001-02: Bundesliga until 2002\n- 2002-03: Bundesliga\n- 2003-04: Bundesliga\n\nSo during these years, only Bundesliga is listed. No other leagues are present in those rows.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that only Bundesliga was not represented when actually, it was the only one that was represented, and others were not.\n\nWait, no\u2014that would mean that other leagues were not present, so the claim saying only Bundesliga wasn't represented is wrong because others weren't there either. So the correct statement would be that all leagues (including Bundesliga) were not represented in those years, which contradicts the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that between 2000 and 2003, other leagues besides Bundesliga were present, but according to the table, they weren't.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me look at each row:\n\n- 1997-98: Regionalliga (not relevant)\n- 1998-99: Bundesliga\n- 1999-2000: Bundesliga\n- 2000-01: Bundesliga\n- 2001-02: Bundesliga until 2002, then in 2002-03: Bundesliga\n- 2003-04: Bundesliga\n\nSo from 2000-01 to 2003-04, all leagues are Bundesliga. Therefore, between those years, only Bundesliga was present, and no other leagues were represented.\n\nThus, the claim says that \"only Bundesliga wasn't represented,\" which is incorrect because it was actually represented. So the correct answer would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the table. Let me double-check each relevant row:\n\n- 2000-01: Bundesliga\n- 2001-02: Bundesliga until 2002 (so for that season, yes)\n- 2002-03: Bundesliga\n- 2003-04: Bundesliga\n\nYes, all those years are Bundesliga. Therefore, other leagues like Pro A or others were not present during those years.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because it says only Bundesliga wasn't represented when in fact, it was the only one that was present. So other leagues weren't there either, meaning the statement doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that between 2000 and 2003, only Bundesliga was not represented. However, according to the table, during those years, only Bundesliga was present. Therefore, no other leagues were represented, making the claim incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"League\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"League\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"League\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"League\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"they be in the fiba europe cup champion europ[ean competition before 2005\"\n\nHmm, it seems a bit fragmented. Maybe they mean that the team was a FIBA Europe Cup Champion in European competitions before 2005? So I need to check if any row in the table shows that.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: season, tier, league, postseason, and european competitions. \n\nI'll go through each row and see if the 'european competitions' column mentions FIBA Europe Cup or something similar before 2005.\n\nStarting from 1997-98 to 2013-14:\n\n- 1997-98: No\n- 1998-99: No\n- 1999-00: Quarterfinalist, not champion\n- 2000-01: Played Korac Cup, but that's different\n- 2001-02: Relegated, no\n- 2002-03: No\n- 2003-04: FIBA Europe Cup champion. Wait, that's in 2004-05 row? Let me check.\n\nWait, the 2003-04 row has \"fiba europe cup champion\" as European competitions. But the season is 2003-04, which is before 2005. So yes, they were champions in 2003-04, which is before 2005.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"before 2005\". So that's correct because 2004 is before 2005? Or does it need to be strictly before 2005?\n\nAlso, check other rows: from 2004-05 onwards, but looking for before 2005. The row in 2003-04 is the last season before 2005.\n\nSo yes, that's relevant.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim states: \"the first time they be relegate in the postseason be after the first time they be promote in the postseason.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. \"Relegate\" refers to being demoted from a higher tier to a lower one in a league. \"Promote\" is about moving up to a higher tier. The key point is the timing: the first relegation in the postseason should occur after the first promotion in the postseason.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find instances where the team was promoted and instances where they were relegated, specifically during the postseason. The columns relevant here are \"tier\", \"postseason\", and \"league\". \n\nI'll go through each row to identify promotions and relegations in the postseason.\n\nStarting from 1997-98:\n- Tier 2, no info on promotion or relegation in the column.\n- 1998-99: Tier 2 again, same as above.\n- 1999-00: Tier drops to 1, but there's a note about being a quarterfinalist. Not sure if that counts as promotion.\n- 2000-01: Tier remains 1, quarterfinalist again.\n- 2001-02: Tier drops to 2, and they were relegated. So that's the first relegation in the postseason? Wait, when was their last promotion before this?\n\nLooking back:\nThe earliest promotion in the table is in 2004-05 when they moved from tier 3 to tier 2 (promoted). Then again in 2008-09 moving from pro A to tier 2 (promoted), and so on.\n\nWait, no: The \"tier\" column shows that in 1997-98 it's tier 2, so promotion would be from a lower tier. But the first promotion mentioned is in 2004-05 when they were promoted from tier 3 to tier 2. \n\nNow for relegations:\nThe earliest is in 2001-02 when they were relegated from tier 1 to tier 2.\n\nSo looking at the claim: The first relegation (in postseason) should be after the first promotion (in postseason). But in reality, their first promotion was in 2004-05, and the first relegation was in 2001-02. That means the relegation happened before the promotion. So the claim is FALSE because the first relegation occurred earlier than the first promotion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all promotions and relegations:\n\nPromotions:\n- 2004-05: Promoted from tier 3 to 2\n- 2008-09: Promoted from pro A (tier 2) to Bundesliga (tier 1)\n- 2011-12: Promoted from pro A to Bundesliga\n\nRelegations:\n- 2001-02: Relegated from Bundesliga (tier 1) to tier 2\n- 2010-11: Relegated from Bundesliga to tier 2\n\nSo the first promotion in the table is in 2004-05, and the first relegation is earlier in 2001-02. Therefore, the first relegation happened before the first promotion, making the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe first relegation occurred in 2001-02, while the first promotion was in 2004-05. Since the relegation happened before the promotion, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"postseason\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
