    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim that \"philippe streiff have the highest number of lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being claimed here.\n\nFirst, I should locate Philippe Streiff in the table. Looking through each row, I see his name in the first column. He's in row 13 (since it starts from 0). Now, I need to find out his number of laps. According to the 'laps' column, he has 0 laps.\n\nNext, I should check who else has a high number of laps. The claim says \"highest,\" so I'm looking for the maximum value in the 'laps' column. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Nigel Mansell: 52\n- Nelson Piquet: 52\n- Teo Fabi: 51\n- Thierry Boutsen: 51\n- Ayrton Senna: 50\n- Alain Prost: 50\n- Stefan Johansson: 50\n- Piercarlo Ghinzani: 50\n- Christian Danner: 49\n- Ren\u00e9 Arnoux: 49\n- Ivan Capelli: 49\n- Philippe Alliot: 49\n- Satoru Nakajima: 49\n- Jonathan Palmer: 47\n- Riccardo Patrese: 43\n- Michele Alboreto: 42\n- Andrea de Cesaris: 35\n- Derek Warwick: 35\n- Eddie Cheever: 31\n- Gerhard Berger: 5\n- Adri\u00e1n Campos: 3\n- Alessandro Nannini: 1\n- Alex Caffi: 0\n\nWait, so the highest number of laps is 52 by both Mansell and Piquet. So if Streiff has 0, that's definitely not the highest.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"have the highest number of lap.\" Maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation. But based on what's written, he didn't have the highest; others had more.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Now, to find the relevant cells: I need to list all rows that have the maximum laps (52). Looking back:\n\n- Row 0: Mansell\n- Row 1: Piquet\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include these two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim states: \"alex caffi have a lap total of 0 because of electrical issue and philippe streiff have 0 lap as well do to an accident.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. It mentions two drivers: Alex Caffi and Philippe Streiff. Each should have a lap total of 0 with specific reasons.\n\nI'll start by looking up each driver in the table. Let's find their rows first.\n\nAlex Caffi is in row number 13 (since the rows are numbered from 0, but looking at the table, it seems to be zero-indexed). Wait, actually, when I look at the table, each <tr> tag represents a row, and they're listed sequentially. So the first row after <thead> is index 0, so I need to count accordingly.\n\nWait, no, in the given HTML code, the first <tr> inside <tbody> is for Nigel Mansell, which would be row 0. Then Nelson Piquet is row 1, and so on. So to find Alex Caffi, I'll go through each row until I see his name.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n... (several rows later) \n\nRow 12: Alex Caffi has 0 laps in column \"Lap\" and his reason is \"electrical\". Then row 13: Philippe Streiff with 0 laps, reason \"accident\".\n\nSo for Alex Caffi, lap total is indeed 0 because of electrical issue. Now, checking Philippe Streiff, he also has 0 laps but his reason is listed as \"accident\" in the table.\n\nWait, the claim says Philippe Streiff had 0 laps due to an accident, which matches his row's reason. So both drivers have 0 laps with their respective reasons mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to verify if these cells are relevant. The claim refers to two specific rows: Alex Caffi and Philippe Streiff. Each has a \"Lap\" column value that is 0 and the corresponding reason columns (which in the table seem to be under \"Reason\"). Wait, actually, looking back at the table structure, each row has \"Driver\", \"Lap\", \"Reason\". So for both drivers, their \"Lap\" cell is 0.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Alex Caffi: row index 12 (assuming rows start at 0), column \"Lap\".\n- For Philippe Streiff: row index 13, column \"Lap\".\n\nWait, actually, I need to count the rows correctly. Let's list them out:\n\nRows in the table after <tbody>:\n\n1. Nigel Mansell - row 0\n2. Nelson Piquet - row 1\n...\nContinuing until:\n\n12. Alex Caffi - row 12 (since there are multiple drivers before him)\n13. Philippe Streiff - row 13\n\nYes, that's correct. So the relevant cells are their \"Lap\" entries.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE because both drivers have 0 laps with the reasons stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data for both Alex Caffi and Philippe Streiff.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Lap\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
