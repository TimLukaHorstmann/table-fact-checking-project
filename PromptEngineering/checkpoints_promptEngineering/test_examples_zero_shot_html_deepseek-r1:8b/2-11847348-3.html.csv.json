The claim says, \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be the only player to score 8 goal in the league.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. Each row represents a player with their respective stats in these categories.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions bok\u0161i\u0107 scoring 8 goals in the league. So, I need to find bok\u0161i\u0107's entry in the 'league' column. From the table, looking for the name \"bok\u0161i\u0107\" brings me to the first row (row_index: 0). The 'league' value here is 8. That matches the claim.\n\nNow, the claim says bok\u0161i\u0107 is the only player with this achievement. I need to check if any other players have a league score of 8. Scanning through each row:\n\n- whelan has 4\n- n\u00e9meth has 3\n- ince has 2\n- cooper, queudrue, marinelli, mustoe, deane, johnston, greening, stockdale, festa, windass, southgate, carbone, ehiogu all have 1 or 0\n- murphy and wilson have 0 in league but maybe their fa cup or other cups?\nWait, no. The 'league' column is separate from the 'fa cup' and 'league cup.' So, I'm only concerned with the 'league' column for this check.\n\nLooking at all players:\n\nOnly bok\u0161i\u0107 has a 'league' value of 8. None of the others have 8 in the league column. Some have higher numbers elsewhere, like whelan has 3 in fa cup and 7 total, but that's not relevant here because the claim is about the league.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider if any other players might have 8 goals in league. But from the table, it seems no one else does. Even own goals only have 1 in league, which isn't 8.\n\nSo, based on this, bok\u0161i\u0107 is indeed the sole player with 8 goals in the league. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in the fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Whelan is the sole player who scored exactly three goals in the FA Cup. To verify this, I should look into the relevant data from the table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which columns are important here. The 'name' column gives us the player's name, and the 'fa cup' column shows the number of goals they scored in the FA Cup. So for Whelan, these two columns are key.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with their respective stats. I need to find Whelan's row and check his FA Cup goal count. \n\nSearching through the rows, I see that Whelan is listed as one of the players. Specifically, in the second row from the top (row_index: 1), the 'fa cup' column has a value of 3. That matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if any other players scored exactly three goals in the FA Cup to see if Whelan is indeed the only one. Scanning through the rest of the 'fa cup' column, I notice that Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 0, Whealan has 3, then others have varying numbers like N\u00e9meth with 1, Ince with 1, Cooper and others with 0 or similar.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The table shows:\n\n- bok\u0161i\u0107: 0\n- whelan: 3\n- n\u00e9meth: 1\n- ince: 1\n- cooper: 0\n- queudrue: 0\n- marinelli: 0\n- mustoe: 0\n- deane: 0\n- johnston: 0\n- greening: 0\n- stockdale: 0\n- festa: 0\n- windass: 0\n- southgate: 0\n- carbone: 0\n- ehiogu: 0\n- murphy: 0\n- wilson: 0\n- cambell: 1\n- own goals: 1\n\nSo, from this, only Whelan has scored exactly three FA Cup goals. No other players have that number. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure there are no other cells that might affect this conclusion, but since the claim specifically mentions scoring three goals in the FA Cup and Whelan being the only one, the relevant cells are just his name and fa cup count.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the rows, I see that Marinelli is listed in row 6 under the 'name' column, and Johnston is in row 7. Both have a total of 1 goal each according to their respective 'total' columns.\n\nNext, I need to check if Marinelli has exactly one more total goal than Johnston. Since both have 1, that would mean Marinelli should have 2 and Johnston should have 1 for the claim to be true. But looking at the table, both have 1 in the 'total' column. Therefore, there's no difference in their total goals.\n\nSo, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.

So I need to look for both players in the 'name' column and then check the corresponding 'league' column values.\n\nI'll go through the rows one by one until I find both names. \n\n- Cambell is listed at row index 8 (since it's zero-indexed, that's the ninth row). In this row, under 'league', the value is 0.\n- Ehiogu is in row index 12. Under 'league', the value is also 0.\n\nWait a second, both have 0 goals in the league. So Cambell has 0, ehiogu also has 0. The claim says \"1 less goal,\" which would mean Cambell should have one less than ehiogu.

The claim says that \"cooper , marinelli , mustoe , and queudrue all score 2 total goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find each of these names: cooper, marinelli, mustoe, and queudrue. Each row represents a player with their stats.\n\nStarting with cooper: looking at the table, Cooper is in row 8 (since it's zero-indexed, but wait, actually in HTML tables tbody starts from row 0 or 1? Wait, the first <tr> is row 0. Let me count. The first row after thead is row 0, so:\n\nRow 0: bok\u0161i\u0107\nRow 1: whelan\n...\nLooking at the table, I see Cooper is in one of the rows towards the end. Let me find it.\n\nLooking through the table, the entries are:\n\nAfter Bok\u0161i\u0107, etc., looking for Cooper. It's in row index 9 (since rows start from 0). Wait no, let me count each <tr>. The first tr after thead is row 0: bok\u0161i\u0107, then up to row 13 is festa, and row 14 is windass, row 15 southgate, row 16 carbone, row17 ehiogu, row18 murphy, row19 wilson, row20 cambell, row21 own goals.\n\nWait, actually, let me count each <tr> in the tbody. Each <tr> represents a row. So:\n\n1. bok\u0161i\u0107 - row 0\n2. whelan - 1\n3. n\u00e9meth - 2\n4. ince - 3\n5. cooper - 4 (row index 4)\n6. queudrue -5\n7. marinelli -6\n8. mustoe -7\n9. deane -8\n10. johnston -9\n11. greening -10\n12. stockdale -11\n13. festa -12\n14. windass -13\n15. southgate -14\n16. carbone -15\n17. ehiogu -16\n18. murphy -17\n19. wilson -18\n20. cambell -19\n21. own goals -20\n\nSo Cooper is at row 4, marinelli at 6, mustoe at7, queudrue at5.\n\nNow, for each of these players, I need to check their 'total' column because the claim refers to \"score 2 total goal.\" The 'total' column is the last one in the table. So for Cooper, row4, the total is 2.\n\nMarinelli is at row6, total is 2.\n\nMustoe is at row7, total is 2.\n\nQueudrue is at row5, total is 2.\n\nSo all four of them have a total of 2 goals. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because each of them scored 2 in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check their rows:\n\nRow4: cooper - total 2\nRow5: queudrue - total2\nRow6: marinelli - total2\nRow7: mustoe - total2\n\nYes, all correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells in the table that support the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league.\" \n\nSo, breaking this down, the claim has two main parts:\n1. Bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 goals.\n2. Bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players who scored 8 goals.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to verify these points.\n\nStarting with the first part: checking if Bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 goals. In the table, each row represents a player, and the columns are 'name', 'league', 'fa cup', 'league cup', and 'total'. \n\nFocusing on the 'bok\u0161i\u0107' row:\n- The 'name' column is \"bok\u0161i\u0107.\"\n- 'League' has a value of 8.\n- 'Fa cup' is 0, 'League cup' is 0, and 'Total' is 8.\n\nSo, Bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 goals in the league. That checks out for the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: whether there are exactly two other players who also scored 8 goals in the league. To find this, I need to look at each row and check if any other players have a 'league' value of 8.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 in the league.\nNext, checking the rest of the players:\n\n1. whelan: 4\n2. n\u00e9meth:3\n3. ince:2\n4. cooper:2\n5. queudrue:2\n6. marinelli:2\n7. mustoe:2\n8. deane:1\n9. johnston:1\n10. greening:1\n11. stockdale:1\n12. festa:1\n13. windass:1\n14. southgate:1\n15. carbone:1\n16. ehiogu:1\n17. murphy:0\n18. wilson:0\n19. cambell:0\n20. own goals:1\n\nFrom this, it seems that only Bok\u0161i\u0107 has a league value of 8. None of the other players have 8 in the league column. Therefore, there aren't two other players who scored 8 goals.\n\nSo, the second part of the claim is not supported by the table. Since both conditions must be met for the claim to be TRUE, but only the first condition is satisfied, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For Bok\u0161i\u0107, the relevant cell is the one in row 0 (since rows start at index 0) under 'league'. Additionally, even though the second part isn't met, we still consider the relevant cells based on the first condition.\n\nWait, but since the claim is about being \"1 of 3 players\", I should also look for any other players with 8 in league. Since none exist, perhaps only Bok\u0161i\u0107's cell is relevant for the first part. But the second part requires two others, so no cells from other rows are relevant.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- Row 0 (bok\u0161i\u0107) under 'league' column.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there aren't two other players with 8 goals in the league. The only relevant cell is Bok\u0161i\u0107's league score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in any competition.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and understand what each column represents. The columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. So, for each player, these columns show their performance in different competitions.\n\nLooking specifically at Whelan's row, under the \"fa cup\" column, it says 3. That means Whelan scored 3 goals in the FA Cup. Now, I need to check if any other players have a similar or higher score in any competition. \n\nI'll go through each player one by one. Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 0 in fa cup and league cup, total 8. Whelan's 3 is higher than others so far. Next, N\u00e9meth has 1 in fa cup and 2 in league cup, total 6. Ince has 1 in fa cup, total 3. Cooper, Queudrue, Marinelli, Mustoe, Deane, Johnston, Greening, Stockdale, Festa, Windass, Southgate, Carbone, Ehiogu\u2014all have 0 or 1 goals in the fa cup. \n\nThen there are players like Murphy and Wilson who have 0 in fa cup but 1 in league cup. Cambell has 1 in fa cup but 0 elsewhere. Own Goals have 1 in fa cup and total of 2.\n\nWait, so Whelan is the only one with a 3 in any competition. Let me check again. Oh, wait, in the \"league cup\" column, no one else has more than 2 goals. So Whelan's 3 is unique to him in the fa cup. \n\nI think that makes him the sole player who scored 3 goals in any competition listed here. No other player reaches 3 goals in any of their competitions based on this table.

Let me go through each row.\n\nLooking at the 'name' column:\n- The first few rows have names like bok\u0161i\u0107, whelan, n\u00e9meth, etc.\n- Then there's marinelli, which is one of the later entries. Specifically, I see marinelli in row 6 (since it's zero-indexed? Wait, no, looking at the HTML, each <tr> represents a row.

Because after that, the rows are for deane at index 9, johnston at 10, etc. Wait no, let me list them out properly.\n\nThe table has 14 rows in total.

Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the HTML:\n\n- <tr> elements start at the first one as row 0.\nSo the list is:\n0: bok\u0161i\u0107\n1: whelan\n2: n\u00e9meth\n3: ince\n4: cooper\n5: queudrue\n6: marinelli\n7: mustoe\n8: deane\n9: johnston\n10: greening\n11: stockdale\n12: festa\n13: windass\n14: southgate\n15: carbone\n16: ehiogu\n17: murphy\n18: wilson\n19: cambell\n20: own goals\n\nWait, but the table in the HTML has 14 rows? No, let me count:\n\nLooking at the <tr> tags in the tbody:\n\n1. bok\u0161i\u0107 (row 0)\n2. whelan (1)\n3. n\u00e9meth (2)\n4. ince (3)\n5. cooper (4)\n6. queudrue (5)\n7. marinelli (6)\n8. mustoe (7)\n9. deane (8)\n10. johnston (9)\n11. greening (10)\n12. stockdale (11)\n13. festa (12)\n14. windass (13)\n15. southgate (14)\n16. carbone (15)\n17. ehiogu (16)\n18. murphy (17)\n19. wilson (18)\n20. cambell (19)\n21. own goals (20)\n\nWait, that's 21 rows, so row indices from 0 to 20.\n\nSo marinelli is in row 6, and johnston is in row 9.\n\nNow, I need to check the columns where goals are recorded. The columns are: name, goals, etc. Wait, looking at the table headers:\n\nThe table's header isn't explicitly given, but from the data, it seems each row has a 'name' and then some columns like 'goals'. Looking at the claim about scoring goals, I think we're interested in the column that shows the number of goals scored by each player.\n\nIn the table, after the name, there are other columns. For example, looking at the last row for \"own goals,\" it has 1 in the goals column and so on. So the relevant columns are the ones with numerical values, likely 'goals'.\n\nSo, to check if marinelli and johnston scored the same number of goals, I need to find their respective goal counts.\n\nLooking for marinelli: in row 6. What's the data? From the HTML:\n\nThe row is:\n<tr>\n  <td>marinelli</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  ... other columns maybe?\n\nWait, but looking at the table structure, each row has 'name', and then some stats. For example, in the last row for \"own goals,\" the data is:\n\n<td>own goals</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td>\n\nSo perhaps the columns after name are: goals, assists, something else, etc.\n\nBut to confirm, let's take another example. Let's look at row 9 (johnston):\n\n<td>johnston</td>\n... then some numbers.\n\nIf I assume that the second column is 'goals', then marinelli would have 1 goal (from row 6: <td>marinelli</td><td>1</td>...), and johnston, in row 9, what's his goals?\n\nLooking at the data for row 9: it's johnston, so the second column is probably 0. Let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps each player has a 'goals' column. For example, looking at Cambell (row 19), which has <td>cambell</td><td>1</td>... Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are structured as name, goals, assists, etc.\n\nSo for marinelli: row index 6, column 1 (goals) is 1.\n\nJohnston: row index 9, column 1 (goals) is 0.\n\nTherefore, their goal counts are different. Marinelli has 1, Johnston has 0. So the claim that they scored the same number of goals is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure which columns are relevant. Maybe it's not just 'goals' but any column with numbers. Alternatively, perhaps there's a specific column for own goals or something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nIn row 6: marinelli has 1 in some column (probably goals).\n\nRow 9: johnston has 0 in the same column.\n\nSo yes, their goal counts are different.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"marinelli and johnston score the same number of goals,\" we need to check their respective goal counts from the table. \n\n- **Marinelli** is found in row 6 with a goal count of 1.\n- **Johnston** is found in row 9 with a goal count of 0.\n\nSince their goal counts differ, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table with several columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The claim is that \"cooper , marinelli , mustoe , and queudrue be the only player to score 2 or more goal.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that these four players are the only ones who scored two or more goals in their careers. To verify this, I should check each of these players' total goals and see if any other players have scored two or more as well.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating each of the named players: cooper, marinelli, mustoe, and queudrue. \n\nFor Cooper:\n- The \"total\" column shows 2. So Cooper scored 2 goals.\n\nMarinelli:\n- Total is also 2. So Marinelli scored 2 goals.\n\nMustoe:\n- Total is 2 as well. Mustoe scored 2 goals.\n\nQueudrue:\n- His total is 2, so he scored 2 goals.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other players in the table who have scored two or more goals. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Bok\u0161i\u0107: Total is 8. So he has scored more than 2.\n2. Whelan: Total is 7. Also more than 2.\n3. N\u00e9meth: Total is 6. More than 2.\n4. Ince: Total is 3. More than 2.\n5. Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue already checked; they have 2 each.\n6. Ehiogu: Total is 1. No.\n7. Murphy: Total is 0 for fa cup and league cup, but the total is 1. So no.\n8. Wilson: Total is 1.\n9. Cambell: Total is 1.\n10. Own goals: Their total is 2.\n\nWait, own goals have a total of 2 as well. That's another player (or perhaps a team aspect) that scored two goals. But the claim says \"player,\" so maybe own goals aren't considered players. However, in the context of football, an own goal is scored by a player against their own team, so it should count.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other players with 2 or more. Looking at the table:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107:8, Whelan:7, N\u00e9meth:6, Ince:3, Cooper:2, Marinelli:2, Mustoe:2, Queudrue:2, Ehiogu:1, Murphy:0 (wait no, Murphy's total is 1?), Wait let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107 has total 8.\n- Whelan:7\n- N\u00e9meth:6\n- Ince:3\n- Cooper:2\n- Marinelli:2\n- Mustoe:2\n- Queudrue:2\n- Ehiogu:1\n- Murphy:0 in fa cup, 1 in total? Wait no, looking at the table:\n\nWait, for each player's row, the columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. So let me check each player's total.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: Bok\u0161i\u0107: total 8\nRow1: Whelan:7\nRow2:N\u00e9meth:6\nRow3:Ince:3\nRow4: Cooper:2\nRow5: Marinelli:2\nRow6: Mustoe:2\nRow7: Queudrue:2\nRow8:Ehiogu:1\nRow9:Murphy:0 in fa cup, 1 in total?\nWait no, looking at the data:\n\nFor example, Murphy's row shows league=0, fa cup=0, league cup=1, total=1.\n\nSimilarly, Wilson has league=0, fa cup=0, league cup=1, total=1.\n\nCambell: league=0, fa cup=1, league cup=0, total=1.\n\nOwn goals: league=1, fa cup=1, league cup=0, total=2.\n\nSo, besides the four named players (Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, Queudrue), who each have 2 goals, Own Goals also have a total of 2. So that's another player (or entity) that scored two or more goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there are other players who scored two or more goals beyond the four mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are the only players to score two or more goals. However, upon examining the table, Own Goals also have a total of 2, indicating another player (or entity) has scored two goals.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:** The claim focuses on Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue.\n2. **Check Their Totals:** Each of these players has a total of 2 goals.\n3. **Review the Entire Table:** Find other players with two or more goals.\n4. **Find Own Goals:** They have a total of 2, indicating another entity that scored two goals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince Own Goals also scored two or more goals, the claim is not fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
