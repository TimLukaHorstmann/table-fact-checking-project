    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"justin rose be from the united state\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking at the table and understanding each part.\n\nFirst, the table lists various golf players along with their scores, country, and some other details. The relevant information here is the player's name, their country, and possibly their performance metrics like score and to par.\n\nThe claim in question is about Justin Rose's nationality. So my main focus should be on finding Justin Rose in the table and checking which country he is listed as.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n- The first row after the headers is Brian Watts from the US, with a score of 210 and to par e.\n- Next, Jim Furyk, also US, score 212, to par +2.\n- Mark O'Meara, same as above.\n- Jesper Parnevik from Sweden.\n- Then comes Justin Rose. His row has him listed as \"justin rose (a)\" from England. The parentheses might indicate an amatorial status, but his country is clearly England here.\n\nWait, that's a problem for the claim. The claim says he's from the United States, but according to the table, he's from England. So the claim would be false.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other relevant cells. Since the claim is about his nationality, the relevant columns are 'player' and 'country'. So I need to find Justin Rose in the 'player' column and check the corresponding 'country' cell.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- The fifth row has \"justin rose (a)\" as the player, country England. That's the only occurrence of his name.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the row where he appears, which is row index 4 (since rows start at 0). The columns are 'player' and 'country'. Therefore, I should include those two cells in relevant_cells.\n\nNow, evaluating the claim: since Justin Rose is listed as from England, not the United States, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"justin rose be from the united state\" is true or false, we check the table for Justin Rose's country. The table lists him as being from England.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"danish thomas bj\u00f8rn rank lower than tiger wood\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim and understanding each part.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two players: Thomas Bj\u00f8rn from Denmark and Tiger Woods. It's about their rankings. I should look into how their rankings are determined in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists several golfers with their scores, to par, and their positions. The positions are labeled as numbers like 1, t2, t6, etc., which likely stand for tied positions. For example, t2 means tied for second place.\n\nNow, I need to find where Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods are in this table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 5 is Justin Rose (a), not relevant here.\n- Then there's Thomas Bj\u00f8rn in row 6, position t6. His score is 68 + 71 + 76 = 215, and to par is +5.\n\nTiger Woods is also listed in row 9, same as Thomas Bj\u00f8rn, with the same score of 65 + 73 + 77 = 215 and a to par of +5. So both are tied at t6, meaning they have the same rank or position in the standings.\n\nThe claim says that Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods. However, since both are at t6, their rankings are equal. In golf tournaments, when players tie for the same score, they share the same rank, so neither is ranked lower than the other. Therefore, the claim might be false because they have the same position.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's a specific order within tied positions that could affect this. If Thomas Bj\u00f8rn comes after Tiger Woods in the list, does that mean he's ranked lower? Let me look at their exact row indices. Thomas is in row 6 and Tiger is in row 9. Since both are t6, they're tied, so their rankings are equal. The actual positions don't determine who is higher based on tie order unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, the claim that Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods isn't accurate because they have identical scores and thus share the same rank. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
