    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"manny pacquiao have his first tko , in a winning bout , in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again to understand what it's stating. It says Manny Pacquiao had his first KO (which I know stands for Knockout) via TKO (Technical Knockout), in a winning bout, specifically in 2001.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight or event involving Manny Pacquiao. The columns include number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. So my focus will be on the 'result' column because that's where the outcome of the fight is recorded.\n\nI need to find any fights in 2001 where Manny had a KO/TKO victory. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. First row: Opponent Chatchai Sasakul, result \"ko 8 / 12\". Wait, that's a knockout, but it's not TKO. Hmm, the term used here is 'ko', which might be considered a KO, but I'm not sure if that's technically a TKO or just a KO.\n\n2. Second row: Same opponent, same date, and same result. So same as first row. Again, it's listed as \"ko\", so maybe that's his first KO?\n\n3. Third row: Date is June 23, 2001, against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. The result is \"tko 6 / 12\". TKO stands for Technical Knockout, which fits the claim since it mentions a KO via TKO.\n\n4. Fourth row onwards are after 2003 and beyond, so they don't apply to 2001.\n\nWait, but the first two rows also mention Manny having a KO in December 1998. So if the first KO was in 1998, then the claim about it being his first in 2001 would be false. However, sometimes the first TKO might not count as the same thing. But according to the table, the earliest KO is in 1998.\n\nWait no, looking again: The third row's date is June 23, 2001, and that's a TKO. So if the claim says his first KO was in 2001, but there was already a KO in 1998, then the claim is incorrect. However, the term \"first TKO\" might mean he didn't have any TKO before that.\n\nWait, the third row is the first TKO? Because the earlier ones are just KO, not TKO. So perhaps his first KO was in 1998, and the first TKO was in 2001. The claim says \"first tko\", so maybe it's referring to a TKO specifically.\n\nBut wait, the user didn't specify whether they mean any KO or TKO specifically. But the term \"TKO\" is different from KO. So if the claim refers to his first TKO, then the third row in 2001 would be relevant.\n\nSo let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: KO but not TKO.\n- Row 1: Same as above.\n- Row 2: TKO in 2001. That's the only TKO in 2001.\n- The claim is about having his first TKO in a winning bout in 2001.\n\nSo in the table, he had his first TKO in 2001 against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, which was a win because the result is TKO. So that would make the claim TRUE if it's referring to TKO as the first knockout of that type.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"his first tko , in a winning bout , in 2001\". It doesn't specify whether he had any KO before that. From the table, he had KOs in 1998, so his first TKO was in 2001, making the claim TRUE because it's about TKO, not all types of knockouts.\n\nSo I need to check if there's a row where the result is TKO and date is 2001. Yes, that's row 2 (row_index 2). So relevant_cells would include that row.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, row indices start from 0. So row 2 is the third fight. So to confirm:\n\nRow 0: Dec 04, 1998 - KO\nRow 1: Same date - KO\nRow 2: Jun 23, 2001 - TKO\nSo that's his first TKO in 2001.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because he had a TKO (not just KO) in 2001.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for Manny Pacquiao's first Technical Knockout (TKO) in 2001. The third row shows a TKO against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba on June 23, 2001, making the claim TRUE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** Verify that Manny Pacquiao had his first TKO in a winning bout in 2001.\n2. **Review the Table Rows:**\n   - Rows 0 and 1 (1998) show KO but not TKO.\n   - Row 2 (2001) shows a TKO, which is a Technical Knockout.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since there's a TKO in 2001 as his first such victory, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Manny Pacquiao had his first Technical Knockout in a winning bout against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba on June 23, 2001.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Manny Pacquiao's first Technical Knockout (TKO) occurred in 2001 against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, making the claim TRUE.\",\n  \"result\": \"TRUE\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"From 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao lacks any defense 50% of the time.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table from 1998 onwards. Let's see how many fights Manny had during that period and examine his defense stats.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: 1998-12-04 vs Chatchai Sasakul. Result is KO 8/12. Defenses: 1.\n- Row 1: Same date as above, but different title (lineal flyweight). Same result and defenses: 1.\n- Row 2: 2001-06-23 vs Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. Tko 6/12. Defenses: 4.\n- Row 3: 2003-11-15 vs Marco Antonio Barrera. Tko 11/12. Defenses: 2.\n- Row 4: 2008-03-15 vs Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez. SD 12/12. Defenses: 0.\n- Row 5: Same date, different title (the ring junior lightweight). Same result and defenses: 0.\n- Row 6: 2008-06-28 vs David D\u00edaz. Tko 9/12. Defenses: 0.\n- Row 7: 2009-05-02 vs Ricky Hatton. KO 2/12. Defenses: 0.\n\nSo, from 1998 to 2009, Manny fought at least 1 fight each year starting from 1998 up to 2009. Let's count the number of fights:\n\nRows 0 to 7 correspond to 1998, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2008 again, 2008, 2009\u2014wait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, looking at the years: row 0 is 1998, row 2 is 2001, row 3 is 2003, rows 4 and 5 are 2008, row 6 is also 2008, and row 7 is 2009. So that's 9 fights from 1998 to 2009.\n\nNow, examining the defense (defenses) column: \n\n- Rows 0:1, 1:1, 2:4, 3:2, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0.\n\nSo, out of 9 fights, how many times did he lack any defense (defense = 0)? Looking at the data:\n\nRows 4,5,6,7 have defenses as 0. That's 4 fights where defense is 0.\n\nBut wait, row 2 has a defense of 4, and others are either 1 or 2 except for rows 4-7 which are 0. So, in the years from 1998 to 2009, there are 4 instances where defense was 0.\n\nNow, the claim says that he lacks any defense 50% of the time. Let's see how many fights that would be. If it's 50%, then out of N fights, N/2 should have defense 0. \n\nFrom the data, total fights from 1998 to 2009 are 9? Wait, actually, looking back, the table has rows 0 through 7, which is 8 rows, but the years spanned are 1998, 2001, 2003, 2008 (twice), and 2009. That's 8 fights, not 9.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 0: 1998\nRow 1: same date as row 0? Or different? The table shows two rows with the same number (1) but different titles, both on 1998-12-04. So that's two separate fights in the same year. Then in 2001, 2003, 2008 (twice), and 2009. So total fights from 1998 to 2009: \n\n- 1998: 2 fights\n- 2001: 1 fight\n- 2003: 1 fight\n- 2008: 2 fights\n- 2009: 1 fight\n\nTotal of 7 fights.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me list them with their years:\n\nRow 0: 1998 (number=1)\nRow 1: 1998 (same number as row 0 but different title)\nRow 2: 2001\nRow 3: 2003\nRow 4: 2008\nRow 5: 2008\nRow 6: 2008 (same number as previous rows, different title)\nRow 7: 2009\n\nSo from row 0 to row 7, it's 8 fights, but the years involved are 1998 (2 fights), 2001 (1), 2003 (1), 2008 (2 or more?), and 2009 (1). \n\nWait, actually, the 'number' column increments from 1 to 7. So each row is a separate fight, regardless of date. So total fights from 1998 to 2009: rows 0-7, which is 8 fights.\n\nLooking at defense:\n\nRow 0:1\nRow 1:1\nRow 2:4\nRow 3:2\nRow 4:0\nRow 5:0\nRow 6:0\nRow 7:0\n\nSo out of 8 fights, rows 4-7 have defense 0. That's 4 fights where defense is 0.\n\n50% of 8 is 4. So yes, in 4 out of 8 fights (from 1998 to 2009), his defense was 0.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"lacks any defense 50% of the time.\" Lacking any defense would mean defense = 0. So if he lacks any defense 50% of the time, that's 4 out of 8 fights.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate based on the data provided in the table.\n\nWait, but looking again, row 2 has defense=4 and row 3=2, which are not 0. So yes, only rows 4-7 (4 fights) have defense=0, which is exactly 50% of 8 fights.\n\nSo the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on analyzing each fight Manny Pacquiao had from 1998 to 2009. Out of 8 fights, he lacked any defense in exactly 4 instances, which is 50%. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Each row corresponds to a specific fight where defense was recorded.\n- Rows 4, 5, 6, and 7 (defenses=0) are the ones contributing to the 50%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"true\": true,\n  \"cells\": [\n    { \"row\": 4, \"defense\": 0 },\n    { \"row\": 5, \"defense\": 0 },\n    { \"row\": 6, \"defense\": 0 },\n    { \"row\": 7, \"defense\": 0 }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"manny pacquiao win more bout in 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's saying that Manny Pacquiao won more bouts (fights) in 2008. So, my task is to check how many fights Manny had in 2008 and whether he won all or most of them.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a different fight. The columns are number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. I need to focus on the 'date' column to see which fights happened in 2008 and then check the 'result' for those specific fights.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First two rows: both have dates as \"1998 - 12 - 04\". So these are from 1998, not 2008.\n2. Third row: date is \"2001 - 06 - 23\" \u2013 that's 2001, still before 2008.\n3. Fourth row: \"2003 - 11 - 15\" \u2013 also in 2003.\n4. Fifth and sixth rows: both have dates as \"2008 - 03 - 15\". That's March 2008.\n5. Seventh row: date is \"2008 - 06 - 28\" \u2013 June 2008.\n6. Eighth row: \"2009 - 05 - 02\" \u2013 that's 2009, so beyond 2008.\n\nSo the relevant rows for 2008 are rows 5 and 6. Now, let me check the results of those fights.\n\nRow 5: result is \"sd 12 / 12\". I think 'sd' stands for \"split decision.\" In boxing, a split decision means that one fighter won some rounds but not all, so it's a win, but not a knockout or something more conclusive. Since Manny won this fight, it counts as a victory.\n\nRow 6: result is \"tko 9 / 12\". 'TKO' stands for \"Technical Knockout.\" This means the opponent was unable to continue, so it's definitely a win for Manny.\n\nSo in both 2008 fights, Manny Pacquiao won. Therefore, he won more bouts in 2008 than not winning any or losing some. The claim is that he \"win more bout\" which implies he won most of them, and since there are only two fights in 2008 and he won both, the statement holds true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other fights in 2008. From the table, it seems only rows 5 and 6 are from 2008. So that's two wins.\n\nAnother thing to consider: does \"more bouts\" mean more than a certain number? The claim doesn't specify, just says \"win more bout,\" which I take to mean he won more than he lost or something like that. Since he won both, it's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are rows 5 and 6 in columns 'result'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the 'opponent' column, I see \"ricky hatton\" in one of the rows. \n\nNext, I'll check the specific details of that fight. The relevant row is row index 8 (since it starts from 0). Looking at the 'result' column for this row, it says \"ko 2 / 12\". This indicates that Manny Pacquiao knocked out Ricky Hatton in the second round.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this was his biggest difference in final scoring points. The table doesn't provide information on the final scoring points from each bout, so I can't directly compare scores.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"From 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao fought in 5 weight categories\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a timeframe from 1998 to 2009 and specifies that during this period, Manny Pacquiao fought in 5 different weight categories. So, my goal is to check how many distinct weight categories Manny fought in within those years by examining the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight, with columns like 'name' (Manny's name), 'titles' (the specific weight category), 'date', etc. The relevant column for this task is 'titles' because it indicates which weight category each fight belongs to.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table and extract the 'titles' information. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Manny Pacquiao vs Chatchai Sasakul: WBC Flyweight (112)\n2. Same opponent, but different title: Lineal Flyweight (112)\n3. Lehlohonolo Ledwaba fight: IBF Super Bantamweight (122)\n4. Marco Antonio Barrera fight: The Ring Featherweight (126)\n5. Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez fight: WBC Super Featherweight (130) and The Ring Junior Lightweight (130)\n6. David D\u00edaz fight: WBC Lightweight (135)\n7. Ricky Hatton fight: The Ring Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nNow, I need to count the unique weight categories mentioned here.\n\nStarting with each 'titles' entry:\n\n1. WBC Flyweight (112)\n2. Lineal Flyweight (112) \u2013 same as above\n3. IBF Super Bantamweight (122)\n4. The Ring Featherweight (126)\n5. WBC Super Featherweight (130)\n6. The Ring Junior Lightweight (130) \u2013 same as above\n7. WBC Lightweight (135)\n8. The Ring Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nWait, that's more than 5. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each 'titles' column:\n\n- WBC Flyweight (112): Row 1 and 2 are duplicates in the sense they both refer to Flyweight but under different sanctioning bodies? Or is Lineal Flyweight a separate category?\n\nBut wait, in boxing, flyweight can be divided into different categories based on organizations or specific weight ranges. So, WBC Flyweight and Lineal Flyweight might actually be considered separate categories because the Lineal Flyweight refers to the same weight class but under a different governing body's rules.\n\nSimilarly, the IBF Super Bantamweight is another distinct category.\n\nSo, listing all unique 'titles':\n\n1. WBC Flyweight (112)\n2. Lineal Flyweight (112) \u2013 possibly considered a different category if it's a different organization's title\n3. IBF Super Bantamweight (122)\n4. The Ring Featherweight (126)\n5. WBC Super Featherweight (130)\n6. The Ring Junior Lightweight (130) \u2013 same as Super Featherweight? Or different?\n7. WBC Lightweight (135)\n8. The Ring Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nWait, but from the table, each 'titles' entry is unique in terms of their names, so they are all distinct categories.\n\nSo that's 8 different weight categories. But the claim says \"5 weight categories.\" Hmm, that suggests a discrepancy.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the user considers only major weight classes without getting into specific sanctioning bodies. For example, Flyweight, Bantamweight, Featherweight, Lightweight, and Welterweight. Let's see if those are covered.\n\nLooking at the 'titles':\n\n- WBC Flyweight (112): Flyweight\n- Lineal Flyweight (112): Same as above, but possibly under a different body\n- IBF Super Bantamweight (122): Super Bantamweight is a higher weight class than Flyweight. Wait, no, Flyweight is the lowest, then Bantamweight (115-123 lbs), Super Bantamweight (122-129). So Manny fought in Super Bantamweight as well.\n\nBut wait, in the table:\n\nRow 3: IBF Super Bantamweight (122) \u2013 that's a separate category from Flyweight.\n\nSimilarly, Row 4: The Ring Featherweight (126): Featherweight is next after Super Bantamweight (which is up to 129). So Featherweight would be up to around 135.\n\nRow 5 and 6: WBC Super Featherweight (130) and The Ring Junior Lightweight (130). Wait, Junior Lightweight is the same as Super Featherweight? Or is there a difference?\n\nWait, in some organizations, Super Featherweight might go up to 140. So The Ring Junior Lightweight could be a separate category.\n\nRow 7: WBC Lightweight (135): Lightweight is above Featherweight.\n\nRow 8: The Ring Junior Welterweight (140): Wait, that's Welterweight at 140? Or perhaps it's considered as a higher weight class.\n\nBut the key point is that from 1998 to 2009, Manny fought in multiple weight categories. The claim says he fought in 5, but according to my analysis, there are more than 5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting or overcomplicating. Let's list all unique 'titles' again:\n\n1. WBC Flyweight (112)\n2. Lineal Flyweight (112) \u2013 same as above\n3. IBF Super Bantamweight (122)\n4. The Ring Featherweight (126)\n5. WBC Super Featherweight (130)\n6. The Ring Junior Lightweight (130)\n7. WBC Lightweight (135)\n8. The Ring Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nThat's 8 unique categories, which is more than 5. So the claim seems incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe some of these are considered subcategories or not relevant. For example, Flyweight and Super Bantamweight are different, but in reality, Manny Pacquiao started as a flyweight boxer, then moved to super bantamweight, then featherweight, lightweight, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering major divisions: Flyweight, Bantamweight, Featherweight, Lightweight, Welterweight. Let me see if all these are represented in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'titles':\n\n- WBC Flyweight (112): Flyweight\n- IBF Super Bantamweight (122): Super Bantamweight is a higher division than Bantamweight, so perhaps that's considered separately.\n- The Ring Featherweight (126): Featherweight\n- WBC Super Featherweight (130): Super Featherweight\n- WBC Lightweight (135): Lightweight\n- The Ring Junior Welterweight (140): This might be considered as Cruiserweight or something else, but if we're sticking to the main divisions, maybe not.\n\nWait, no. The main weight classes are Flyweight, Bantamweight, Featherweight, Lightweight, Super Lightweight, Welterweight, Cruiserweight, and Heavyweight.\n\nManny Pacquiao started in Flyweight (112), then moved up to Super Bantamweight (122), then Featherweight (126), then Lightweight (135). So that's four major categories: Flyweight, Super Bantamweight, Featherweight, Lightweight.\n\nBut the table shows more because some fights are under different sanctioning bodies. For example:\n\n- WBC Flyweight vs Lineal Flyweight\n- IBF Super Bantamweight vs The Ring Featherweight?\nWait, no. IBF Super Bantamweight is a separate division from Featherweight.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe the user is considering each 'titles' as a unique category regardless of actual weight class hierarchy, so if there are 8 different 'titles', then that's 8 categories.\n\nBut the claim says \"5 weight categories,\" which is likely referring to major divisions. So perhaps the correct answer is that the claim is FALSE because Manny fought in more than 5 weight categories during that time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user counts only the major ones: Flyweight, Bantamweight, Featherweight, Lightweight, and Welterweight. But looking at the table:\n\n- He fought as Flyweight (WBC)\n- Then Super Bantamweight (IBF)\n- Then Featherweight (The Ring)\n- Then Super Featherweight (WBC) which is technically a higher weight than Featherweight\n- Lightweight (WBC)\n- And then Junior Welterweight, which might be considered as Welterweight.\n\nSo that would be 6 categories: Flyweight, Super Bantamweight, Featherweight, Super Featherweight, Lightweight, and Welterweight. So even more than 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Manny fought in more than 5 weight categories during 1998-2009.\n\nWait, but the exact number might be tricky. Let me count each unique 'titles' again:\n\n1. WBC Flyweight (112)\n2. Lineal Flyweight (112) \u2013 same as above? Or different.\n3. IBF Super Bantamweight (122)\n4. The Ring Featherweight (126)\n5. WBC Super Featherweight (130)\n6. The Ring Junior Lightweight (130)\n7. WBC Lightweight (135)\n8. The Ring Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nThat's 8 unique 'titles', which is more than 5.\n\nSo, the claim that he fought in only 5 weight categories during that period is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Manny Pacquiao fought in exactly 5 weight categories between 1998 and 2009 is incorrect. Analysis of his fights shows he participated in at least 8 unique weight divisions during that time.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; Manny Pacquiao fought in more than five weight categories during the period from 1998 to 2009.",

So I need to check if in this period, there's only one instance where his defenses were zero.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with various details like name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. The \"defenses\" column seems to indicate how many defensive actions or strategies Pacquiao used in that particular fight.\n\nI should go through each row within the specified years (1998-2009) and check the \"defenses\" column. \n\nStarting with row 0: It's from 1998, so within the timeframe. The defenses are listed as 1. That means he had one defense, so this doesn't count towards the times he lacked any defense.\n\nRow 1: Same date as row 0 but a different title. Again, defenses are 1. So no lack of defense here.\n\nRow 2: Date is 2001, which is within the timeframe. Defenses are 4. He used four defenses, so not applicable.\n\nRow 3: 2003, so included. Defenses listed as 2. Not zero, so doesn't count.\n\nRow 4: 2008, in the timeframe. Defenses are 0. This is one instance where he had no defense.\n\nRow 5: Same date as row 4 but a different title. Also defenses are 0, which would be another instance if considering each fight separately.\n\nWait, that's two instances now (rows 4 and 5) with defenses 0. But the claim says \"only 1 time.\" So this might mean the claim is false because there are at least two fights where he had no defense.\n\nBut wait, looking back, row 4 has Manny Pacquiao fighting Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez for WBC Super Featherweight (130) on March 15, 2008. The result is a split decision (SD 12/12), with defenses 0.\n\nRow 5 is another fight on the same date but different title: The Ring Junior Lightweight (130). Also against M\u00e1rquez, result SD 12/12, and defenses 0.\n\nSo that's two fights where he had no defense. Therefore, the claim saying \"only 1 time\" seems incorrect. \n\nBut let me double-check all rows within 1998-2009. Rows 0 to row 6 (since 2009 is included). Wait, row 6: May 2, 2009, which is within the timeframe. Opponent Ricky Hatton, result ko 2/12, defenses listed as 0. So that's another instance where defenses are zero.\n\nSo now I have three instances: rows 4,5, and 6 with defenses 0. That means Pacquiao had no defense on three occasions within the timeframe. Therefore, the claim is false because it says only one time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense only once between 1998 and 2009. However, analyzing the table, there are three instances (rows 4, 5, and 6) where his defenses were zero. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Only rows from 1998 to 2009 are considered.\n2. **Check Each Row's Defenses:**\n   - **Row 4 (2008):** Defenses = 0\n   - **Row 5 (2008):** Defenses = 0\n   - **Row 6 (2009):** Defenses = 0\n3. **Total Instances:** Three instances where defenses are zero, contradicting the claim of only one.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because there were three fights within the timeframe where Manny Pacquiao had no defense.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"manny pacquiao win the most bout in 2001\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that Manny Pacquiao won the most bouts in 2001. So I need to check if there's any record in the table where he had the highest number of wins that year.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several fights with details like number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. The \"date\" column is formatted as \"YYYY - MM - DD\". I need to focus on the rows where the date is in 2001 because that's the year mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Date is 1998-12-04 \u2013 not 2001.\n2. Second row: Same as above, so not relevant.\n3. Third row: Date is 2001-06-23 \u2013 this is in 2001. The opponent was Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, and the result was a tko 6 /12. Defenses were 4.\n4. Fourth row: Date is 2003-11-15 \u2013 not 2001.\n5. Fifth row: 2008-03-15 \u2013 nope.\n6. Sixth row: Same date as fifth, so irrelevant.\n7. Seventh row: 2008-06-28 \u2013 nope.\n8. Eighth row: 2009-05-02 \u2013 nope.\n\nSo only the third row is relevant because it's in 2001.\n\nLooking at that specific fight:\n- Opponent: Lehlohonolo Ledwaba\n- Result: tko 6 /12\n- Defenses: 4\n\nThe result shows a win, so Manny Pacquiao did win this bout. Now, the claim is about him winning \"the most\" bouts in 2001. Since there's only one fight listed for 2001 (third row), it's the only one he had that year, so by default, he won the most bouts (just one) in that year.\n\nWait a second, but the table might not list all his fights. Maybe there are other fights not included here? The claim says \"the most bout\", which could imply more than others. But based on the information provided, since only one fight is listed for 2001, he did win it, making the statement true.\n\nI should also check if any other row for 2001 exists that I might have missed. Scanning through again, no, all other dates are outside 2001 except for the third row.\n\nTherefore, considering the information in the table, the claim is TRUE because Manny Pacquiao had one win in 2001, and there's no indication of more wins that year from the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim is: \"Manny Pacquiao had his first Tko in a losing bout in 1998.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. A Tko stands for Technical Knockout. The claim specifies it's his first Tko, which implies this was the earliest such occurrence in his career. It also says that he lost the bout, so the result column should show a loss. Lastly, the date is 1998.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. Let me go through each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the table headers: number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, defenses. The columns are numbered from 0 to 5 (since there's also a 'defenses' column). So, row indices start from 0.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n- Name: Manny Pacquiao\n- Date: 1998 - 12 - 04\n- Opponent: Chatchai Sasakul\n- Result: ko 8 / 12\n- Number of defenses: 1\n\nWait, the result here is a knockout, not a Tko. So this isn't a Tko. It's a KO, which might be an early victory for him.\n\nRow 1:\nSame data as row 0? Wait, same number (1), same name, same date, same opponent, same result. So that's probably a duplicate entry or maybe different titles but same fight. But again, the result is ko, so not Tko.\n\nRow 2: Manny Pacquiao vs Lehlohonolo Ledwaba\n- Date: 2001 - 06 - 23\n- Result: tko 6 / 12\n\nHere, the result is a Tko. Now, was this his first Tko? Let's check other rows before this one to see if there's an earlier Tko.\n\nRow 3:\nDate: 2003 - 11 - 15 vs Marco Antonio Barrera\nResult: tko 11 /12\n\nSo another Tko here. But since row 2 is in 2001 and row 3 in 2003, row 2 comes first. Wait, but before that, rows 0 and 1 are in 1998, which are KOs, not TKOs.\n\nWait, the claim says the first Tko was in 1998. But from the table, the first Tko is in 2001 (row 2). So if row 2 is Manny's first Tko, then the claim is false because it happened in 2001, not 1998.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm whether any of the earlier rows have a Tko. Let me check:\n\nRows before row 2 are 0,1, and 4 (wait, no, let me count again).\n\nWait, the table has 9 rows. Let's list them out:\n\nRow 0: date 1998-12-04, result ko\nRow 1: same as row 0? Maybe a duplicate entry with different titles.\nRow 2: 2001-06-23, tko\nRow 3: 2003-11-15, tko\nRow 4: 2008-03-15, sd (so not Tko)\nRow 5: same as row 4? Again, sd\nRow 6: 2008-06-28, tko\nRow 7: 2009-05-02, ko\n\nSo rows 2,3,6 have Tko results.\n\nWait, but the claim is about his first Tko in a losing bout. So I need to check if that's accurate.\n\nLooking at row 2: Manny vs Ledwaba. The result is tko 6/12, which means he lost. So this is a losing Tko bout. But it happened in 2001, not 1998. Therefore, the claim says it was in 1998, but according to the table, that's incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, row 0 and 1 are in 1998 with KO results, so he won those fights, not lost them. So his first losing Tko would be row 2, which is after 2001.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the first Tko loss occurred later than 1998.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about Manny Pacquiao's fighting categories between 1998 and 2009 is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim: \"From 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao fought in the same weight category.\" So, we need to check if all his fights during those years were within a single weight category. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like the number, name (Manny Pacquiao), titles (like WBC Flyweight), date, opponent, result, and defenses. The key column here is probably the \"titles\" or \"name,\" but more importantly, we need to see if he was fighting in the same weight category across these fights.\n\nThe table has several rows, each with a different title. For example, one row says \"WBC flyweight (112)\" while another says \"Lineal flyweight (112)\", and others mention \"IBF super bantamweight,\" \"The Ring featherweight,\" etc. Some even have similar opponents like Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez fighting in different weight categories.\n\nWait a minute, but looking closely, most of the rows have \"number\" as 1, which might indicate they're all Manny Pacquiao's fights, each in different years and against different opponents. The \"titles\" vary, so his weight categories differ across these fights. For instance, he fought at flyweight (112), super bantamweight (122), featherweight (126), super featherweight (130), lightweight (135), junior welterweight (140). These are all distinct weight categories.\n\nNow, the claim says he fought in \"the same\" category from 1998 to 2009. But according to the table, he was fighting in multiple categories during those years. Each row corresponds to a different fight in a different weight class.\n\nSo, checking each cell, the relevant columns are \"titles\" because they show his weight categories. Therefore, we need to look at all rows where Manny Pacquiao's title changes, which would disprove the claim.\n\nThus, since he fought in multiple categories within that time frame, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Manny Pacquiao having the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"manny pacquiao have the biggest difference in score point during his bout with marco antonio barrera.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any rows where Manny Pacquiao fought Marco Antonio Barrera. Let me scan through each row's opponent column.\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Chatchai Sasakul \u2013 not him.\nRow 1: Same as above.\nRow 2: Lehlohonolo Ledwaba \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Marco Antonio Barrera \u2013 yes, that's the one. So this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, looking at the columns related to the claim. The key terms are \"score point difference.\" In the table, I see 'result' and 'defenses' as possible columns, but I'm not sure if they directly relate. Wait, perhaps it's about the scorecard points or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe 'defenses' refers to the number of defense rounds? Or is there another column that shows points? Let me check the table again.\n\nIn the provided table, columns are: number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, defenses. There's no explicit 'score difference' or 'points' column. Hmm.\n\nThe result column has entries like \"ko 8 / 12\" and \"tko 6 / 12\". The numbers after KO or TKO might indicate the round in which the fight ended, not necessarily points. The 'defenses' column just has numbers like 1,4,2,0, etc., but I'm not sure if that's score points.\n\nWait, maybe the 'result' column includes a scorecard points difference? For example, if the result was something like \"Points: 12-8 in favor,\" but in this case, the results are just how the fight ended, not specific scores.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'defenses' column refers to defense points. But I don't have context on that. If the claim is about a significant point difference, and looking at the row with Barrera, the result was \"tko 11 / 12\" and defenses as 2. So, does this mean a big score difference? Not sure.\n\nBut since there's no explicit column for score points or differences in the table, maybe the claim is not fully supported. Alternatively, perhaps 'defenses' refers to something else, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, another angle: if the result includes a split decision or something, but looking at the row, it's a Tko 11 /12, which might mean it was stopped in round 11, and maybe the score was 12-11 or similar. But without exact points, it's unclear.\n\nSo, given that there's no specific column for score difference, I think the claim isn't directly supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
