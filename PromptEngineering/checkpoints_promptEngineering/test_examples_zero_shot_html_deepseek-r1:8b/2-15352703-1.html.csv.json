    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about draft pick number 155 and whether it comes from Arizona University.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a draft round, pick number, player name, position, and college. The relevant columns here are \"pick\" and \"college.\"\n\nI need to find the row where the pick number is 155. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Pick 16, not 155.\n- Row 2: Pick 43, nope.\n- Row 3: Pick 70, no.\n- Row 4: Pick 101, nope.\n- Row 6: Here's pick 155. The college for this pick is Arizona.\n\nSo the draft pick number 155 comes from Arizona. But wait, the claim says \"Arizona university.\" Does \"arizona\" in the table refer to Arizona University? Or could it be another Arizona team or school?\n\nIn the table, it's listed as \"arizona,\" which I believe corresponds to Arizona State University, not necessarily \"university\" specifically, but a common term. However, the exact wording might matter.\n\nThe claim is about whether 155 comes from \"arizona university.\" The table shows \"arizona,\" so if \"arizona\" in the table refers to the same as \"Arizona University,\" then it's correct. Otherwise, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking back at the table data, for pick number 6, college is Arizona, and another entry for pick 155 is also Arizona. So both are Arizona.\n\nTherefore, since the claim states that draft pick 155 comes from Arizona University, and according to the table it's Arizona, I think this supports the claim being TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Arizona is the college with the last draft pick in the picks listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: round, pick, player, position, and college. The task is to find out which cells are relevant to verify this claim. \n\nThe key elements of the claim are \"Arizona\" as the college and \"last draft pick.\" So I need to check if there's a pick number that corresponds to the highest or last pick for Arizona in the table.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. Row 0: Fresno State, pick 16\n2. Row 1: Louisville, pick 43\n3. Row 2: Arizona, pick 70\n4. Row 3: LSU, pick 101\n5. Row 4: Arizona, pick 155\n6. Row 5: Arizona, pick 167 (wait, no, actually looking back, the table has multiple rows for round 7 and others. Let me recount correctly.)\n\nWait, I see that in the tbody, there are several rows. For example:\n\n- Round 1, pick 16: Fresno State\n- Round 2, pick 43: Louisville\n- Round 3, pick 70: Arizona\n- Round 4, pick 101: LSU\n- Round 6, pick 155: Arizona (position punter)\n- Then there are multiple rows for round 7 and others.\n\nWait, but looking closely, the table has some duplicate rounds, like round 7 appears more than once. So I need to check all entries for Arizona.\n\nLooking through each college:\n\nArizona is listed in row 2 with pick 70 (round 3), row 4 with pick 155 (round 6), and also in row 5 with pick 167? Wait no, let me check again.\n\nWait the table seems to have:\n\n- Row 0: Fresno\n- Row1: Louisville\n- Row2: Arizona, pick70\n- Row3: LSU,101\n- Row4: Arizona,155 (round6)\n- Then round7 has multiple players, but college for one is Minnesota-Duluth, another is Carson-Newman, and another is Syracuse. None of these are Arizona.\n\nSimilarly, UCLA is listed as pick209 (row7) and pick266 (row10). Northwestern State, LA is also there.\n\nSo the picks for Arizona are 70 (round3), 155 (round6). Are there any higher picks? Let's see the maximum pick number in the table. The highest pick is 293, which is assigned to Northwestern State, LA (row11).\n\nWait no, let me check each row:\n\nLooking at all the pick numbers:\n\n16,43,70,101,155,167,171,182,209,239,266,293.\n\nThe highest pick number in the table is 293. So Arizona's picks are 70 and 155, both lower than 293.\n\nTherefore, the last draft pick (highest pick) in this table is Northwestern State, LA with pick293. Therefore, Arizona does not have the last draft pick.\n\nSo the claim that \"Arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Arizona has the highest pick number in the table. The highest pick is 293 by Northwestern State, LA, so Arizona doesn't hold it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
