    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The claim says, \"the match in cairo , egypt go 1 set longer than in forest hill , us.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has several columns: outcome, date, championship, surface, opponent in the final, and score in the final. My focus is on the 'score in the final' column because the claim is about how many sets each match lasted.\n\nI need to find the rows where the championship is cairo, Egypt and forest hills, US. So I'll scan through each row until I find those locations.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row where the date is 1979 and the championship is cairo, egypt. The opponent in the final is peter feigl, and the score is 5-7, 6-3, 1-6. Wait, how many sets is that? Let me count: there are three sets listed here (5-7, 6-3, 1-6), so that's three sets.\n\nNext, I need to find the match in forest hill, US. Scanning through the rows, I see a row with date 1981 and championship forest hills, us. The opponent is eddie dibbs, and the score is 3-6, 2-6. That's also two sets: first set 3-6, second set 2-6.\n\nWait, so cairo egypt had three sets and forest hill, US had two sets. So the claim says cairo went one set longer than forest hill. But in reality, Cairo had more sets, not just one longer. So the claim isn't accurate because it's not exactly one set longer; it's two sets longer.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row includes details like the date, location, surface, opponent in the final, and score. The columns relevant here are 'opponent in the final' because that's where we'll find who Kirmayr played against.\n\nI need to find rows where Carlos Kirmayr is either Van Winitsky or Eddie Dibbs as the opponent. From the table, I can see:\n\n- In 1982 (row index 5), the opponent was Van Winitsky.\n- In 1981 (row index 4), the opponent was Eddie Dibbs.\n\nSo, Carlos Kirmayr played against both Van Winitsky and Eddie Dibbs. Now, the claim is about how many more games he played against Van Winitsky than Eddie Dibbs.\n\nLooking at their counts: He played one game against Van Winitsky in 1982 (since it's a final, likely only once) and one game against Eddie Dibbs in 1981. So, the difference is zero; he didn't play more games against one than the other. The claim says he has \"one more,\" which isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"carlos kirmayr lose to peter feigl 3 year after lose to jos\u00e9 higueras.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify key elements in the claim. The main points are:\n\n1. Carlos Kirmayr lost to Peter Feigl.\n2. This loss happened three years after he lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\n\nNow, I need to check if these points are supported by the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various tournaments with columns such as outcome, date, championship location, surface type, opponent in the final, and score in the final. The 'outcome' column indicates whether someone was a runner-up or not.\n\nI'll start by looking for Carlos Kirmayr in the table. Scanning through the rows, I don't see any entry where the opponent is Carlos Kirmayr. The opponents listed are Jos\u00e9 Higueras (row 0), Peter Feigl (row 1), Dominique Bedel (row 2), Eddie Dibbs (row 3), and Van Winitsky (row 4). There's no mention of Carlos Kirmayr as an opponent in any final.\n\nSince the claim mentions Carlos Kirmayr losing, but he isn't present in the table as an opponent, it seems like there's no data to support his participation or loss in these finals. Therefore, the first part of the claim can't be verified because Carlos Kirmayr isn't listed.\n\nAdditionally, even if he were, looking at the dates, the years are 1976, 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1982. If a loss happened three years after losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976, it would be around 1979, which is exactly when Peter Feigl's row is (row index 1). However, since Carlos Kirmayr isn't in the table as an opponent, this makes the claim unsupported.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are not supported by the provided data.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"against jos\u00e9 higueras , carlos kirmayr only win 1 set.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that when Carlos Kirmayr played against Jos\u00e9 Higueras, they only won one set in the match. So I need to look for any matches where these two players faced each other and check how many sets each won.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different final with details about the outcome, date, championship, surface, opponent, and score. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first row (row index 0) has an opponent named jos\u00e9 higueras. The scores are 7-5, 4-6, 4-6. So in this match, the player against Higueras won two sets and lost one. But the claim is about Kirmayr only winning 1 set. Wait, I'm not sure who played whom here. Is the \"opponent in the final\" the one they're playing against? Yes, so in row 0, the opponent is Higueras. So if this player (probably Kirmayr) lost two sets and won one, that would mean he didn't only win 1 set.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"against jos\u00e9 higueras , carlos kirmayr only win 1 set.\" So perhaps it's saying that in their match against Higueras, Kirmayr won only one set.\n\nLooking at row 0: the scores are 7-5 (first set), 4-6 (second), 4-6 (third). Wait, but in a final, how many sets are played? Usually, it's best of five or something. Here, all rows have three sets, which is unusual because most finals don't go to three sets unless specified.\n\nWait, maybe the table has a mistake. But regardless, each row shows the score as three numbers separated by commas. So in row 0: 7-5,4-6,4-6. That means the final had three sets, and the player lost two sets (4-6) and won one set (7-5). So against Higueras, this player only won one set. \n\nBut then there's another point\u2014Carlos Kirmayr is mentioned in the claim. I need to check if any row has an opponent who is Carlos Kirmayr.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: opponent is Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\nRow 1: Peter Feigl.\nRow 2: Dominique Bedel.\nRow 3: Eddie Dibbs.\nRow 4: Van Winitsky.\n\nNo row mentions Carlos Kirmayr as an opponent. So if the claim refers to a match where both played against each other, but there's no such row in the table. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about when Kirmayr was playing Higueras and only won one set. But since there's only one match against Higueras (row 0), which we saw that the player (not necessarily Kirmayr) did win one set.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if Kirmayr is involved in any of these matches. Since none of the opponents are Carlos Kirmayr, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no match between them in the table. So the claim might be false because either there's no such match or the score doesn't support it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about a different final where both played each other, but that's not in the table. So the relevant cells would be row 0 and perhaps another one if Kirmayr was involved elsewhere, but since he isn't in the opponents list, only row 0 is relevant.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Carlos Kirmayr as players. Since there's no entry for Carlos Kirmayr as an opponent, maybe the statement is false because either there's no match or the score doesn't fit.\n\nBut in row 0, the player against Higueras only won one set. If that player was Kirmayr, then perhaps it's true, but if not, then it's false. However, since the table doesn't mention Kirmayr as an opponent, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about a match where Kirmayr and Higueras faced each other, but that's not in the table.\n\nSo, considering this, the relevant cells would be row 0 (where they played) and the 'score in the final' column because the score shows one set won. But since the claim is about Kirmayr only winning one set against Higueras, but there's no evidence of a match where both played each other beyond row 0, which might not be Kirmayr.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me break it down:\n\n- The claim says that against Jos\u00e9 Higueras, Carlos Kirmayr only won one set.\n- I need to find in the table if there's a match where they faced each other and Kirmayr only won one set.\n\nLooking at row 0: opponent is Jos\u00e9 Higueras. Score: 7-5,4-6,4-6. So the player against Higueras lost two sets and won one. If that player is Kirmayr, then the claim would be true for this match.\n\nBut if Kirmayr didn't play against Higueras in any of these matches (since none of the opponents are him), then the statement is false because there's no such match where they played each other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table includes all finals that Kirmayr participated in. But since he isn't listed as an opponent in any row, perhaps the claim is referring to a specific final where this occurred, but it's not present in the table.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is false because there's no match between Higueras and Kirmayr in the table, or if there is (row 0), then the statement would only be true for that match. But since Kirmayr isn't listed as an opponent elsewhere, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about a specific final where both played each other and Kirmayr won only one set against Higueras. If row 0 is such a case, then the statement would be true if that player is Kirmayr, but since we don't know who played Higueras in row 0, it's ambiguous.\n\nIn conclusion, without knowing whether the player in row 0 is Kirmayr, we can't confirm the claim. Therefore, perhaps the claim is false because either there's no such match or the score doesn't support it if it exists.\n\nBut considering that row 0 shows a case where against Higueras, someone won only one set, and if that person is Kirmayr, then the statement would be true. However, since we don't know who played Higueras in row 0, maybe the statement is false because it's not proven.\n\nAlternatively, the relevant cells are row 0 (where they played) and 'score in final' column. So I think the answer is that the claim is false because there's no such match where both played each other, so the statement can't be verified or is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether Carlos Kirmayr only won one set against Jos\u00e9 Higueras based on the provided table of finals. Here's a structured breakdown:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**: The claim states that in a match between Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Carlos Kirmayr, Kirmayr won only one set.\n\n2. **Data Extraction**:\n   - Review each row for opponents involving Higueras or Kirmayr.\n   - **Row 0**: Opponent is Jos\u00e9 Higueras. Scores: 7-5,4-6,4-6. The player won one set (7-5) and lost two.\n   - No other rows mention Carlos Kirmayr as an opponent.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is only one match involving Jos\u00e9 Higueras (row 0), but Carlos Kirmayr isn't listed as an opponent in any row.\n   - Without evidence of a match between Kirmayr and Higueras, the claim cannot be substantiated.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The claim is false because there's no record of Carlos Kirmayr facing Jos\u00e9 Higueras in the provided table.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is false as there's no evidence of a match between Carlos Kirmayr and Jos\u00e9 Higueras in the table.",

The table has several columns: outcome, date, championship, surface, opponent in the final, and score in the final. Each row represents a different year from 1976 to 1982, with details about a championship, including who won or lost.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Carlos Kirmayr not winning any championships during that time period. So, I need to check if there's any evidence in the table where he won a championship between 1976 and 1982.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row (row index 0) has an outcome of \"runner - up.\" The date is 1976, and the championship location is Santiago, Chile. The surface is clay, opponent is Jos\u00e9 Higueras, and the score shows that Kirmayr lost. So no win here.\n\n2. Row 1 (1979): Again, outcome is runner-up, so he didn't win this championship either.\n\n3. Row 2 (1980): He was the runner-up again, not winning.\n\n4. Row 3 (1981): Runner-up once more.\n\n5. Row 4 (1982): Runner-up in this case too.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any row where the outcome is \"winner\" or anything indicating he won a championship. Since all outcomes are \"runner - up,\" it seems Carlos didn't win any during these years. \n\nTherefore, the claim that he doesn't win a championship between 1976 and 1982 is TRUE because none of the entries show him winning.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking each row in the table for evidence of Carlos Kirmayr winning a championship.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about a tennis match is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the match in santiago , chile go 1 set longer than in forest hill , us.\" So the claim is comparing two matches, one held in Santiago, Chile and another in Forest Hills, US. It's stating that the match in Chile had one more set than the one in the US.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year and location of a championship. The relevant columns here are \"outcome,\" \"date,\" \"championship,\" \"surface,\" \"opponent in the final,\" and \"score in the final.\" But for this claim, the key columns are \"championship\" (to identify the locations) and \"score in the final\" (to count the number of sets played).\n\nSo I need to find the rows where the championship is Santiago, Chile and Forest Hills, US.\n\nStarting with Santiago, Chile: Scanning through the table, the first row has \"santiago , chile\" as the location. So that's row index 0.\n\nNext, looking for Forest Hills, US: The fourth row has \"forest hills , us\" listed under the championship column, so that's row index 3.\n\nNow, I need to check the scores in the final for both these matches.\n\nFor Santiago, Chile (row 0), the score is \"7 - 5 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6.\" This means there were three sets played. The match went to a third set, so that's two full sets before the final one. Wait, no\u2014each number represents a separate set's outcome. So the first set was 7-5 in favor of someone, the second set was lost by the runner-up 4-6, and the third set they also lost 4-6. So total sets played: 3.\n\nFor Forest Hills, US (row 3), the score is \"3 - 6 , 2 - 6.\" Let's parse this. The first set was 3-6, which means one set. Then the second set was 2-6, so another set. So total sets played: 2.\n\nThe claim states that Santiago's match had one more set than Forest Hills. Santiago had 3 sets and Forest Hills had 2, so yes, it is indeed one longer.\n\nWait a second, but sometimes in tennis tournaments, especially Grand Slams, the final can have four sets if necessary. But in this case, both matches didn't go to four sets; they each stopped after three or two sets respectively. So Santiago's match had more sets than Forest Hills'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the match in Santiago, Chile had one more set than in Forest Hills, US.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"against dominique bedel , carlos kirmayr only win 1 set\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It says that against Dominique Bedel and Carlos Kirmayr, they only won 1 set. So I need to check if these two opponents are in the table and see how many sets each match resulted in.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column called \"opponent in the final\" and another column for the score. I'll scan through each row to find the relevant information.\n\nStarting with the first row: the opponent is Jos\u00e9 Higueras, so that's not Dominique Bedel or Carlos Kirmayr. Next, Peter Feigl isn't either. Then, Dominique Bedel is in the fourth row. The score for that final was 4-6 and 6-7, which are two sets lost by the player (so they won 2 sets? Wait, no\u2014wait, the \"score in the final\" column shows both scores. So if it's a best-of-5 or something, but here each entry has three numbers separated by commas, like \"4 - 6 , 6 - 7\". Hmm, that's three sets. So in the match against Dominique Bedel, the opponent won two sets and lost one? Or did they win two sets to take the match?\n\nWait, I think each of these is the score for each set. For example, in the first row, it's \"7 - 5 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6\". That would be three sets: player won set 1 (7-5), lost set 2 (4-6), and lost set 3 (4-6). So they played three sets and the opponent won two, meaning the player in question (runner-up) only won one set. But wait, the claim is about how many sets they won against Dominique Bedel.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: the claim says that when playing against Dominique Bedel and Carlos Kirmayr, they only won 1 set. So for each of these opponents, did the player in question win only one set?\n\nLooking at the fourth row, the opponent is Dominique Bedel, and the score is \"4 - 6 , 6 - 7\". Wait, that's two sets, right? So the score is split into two parts: first set (4-6) and second set (6-7). So that means the player lost both sets. Therefore, against Dominique Bedel, they didn't win any sets.\n\nNow, where does Carlos Kirmayr come in? Looking through the table, I don't see Carlos Kirmayr as an opponent. The opponents listed are Jos\u00e9 Higueras, Peter Feigl, Dominique Bedel, Eddie Dibbs, and Van Winitsky. So Carlos Kirmayr isn't mentioned here.\n\nWait, so maybe the claim is incorrect because Carlos Kirmayr isn't even in the table. Or perhaps I misread it. Let me check again: \"against dominique bedel , carlos kirmayr only win 1 set.\" So both opponents are Dominique Bedel and Carlos Kirmayr. But since Carlos Kirmayr isn't in any row, maybe that part of the claim is false.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be where the opponent is either Dominique Bedel or Carlos Kirmayr. Since Carlos Kirmayr isn't present, I need to check only Dominique Bedel's match.\n\nIn the fourth row, against Dominique Bedel, the score was 4-6 and 6-7, meaning the player lost both sets. Therefore, they didn't win any sets against him, let alone just one.\n\nSo the claim that they only won 1 set against both Dominique Bedel and Carlos Kirmayr is false because Carlos isn't in the table, and against Dominique Bedel, they didn't win any sets.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Also, I need to identify which cells are relevant: for Dominique Bedel, it's row 3 (since rows start from 0?), column \"opponent in the final\" and \"score in the final\". Wait, no\u2014the fourth row is index 3 because it starts at 0.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the row where opponent is Dominique Bedel, which is row 3, columns \"opponent in the final\" and \"score in the final\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Carlos Kirmayr isn't an opponent listed, and against Dominique Bedel, the player didn't win any sets.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The opponents mentioned are Jos\u00e9 Higueras, Peter Feigl, Dominique Bedel, Eddie Dibbs, and Van Winitsky.\n\nThis means Carlos Kirmayr might not be directly involved in these finals. If he's not listed here, it's unclear if he has played against the opponents mentioned. The claim refers to games he supposedly played against Peter Feigl and Eddie Dibbs, but without evidence in this table, I can't verify it.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data on Carlos Kirmayr in the table, the claim isn't supported by the information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions Carlos Kirmayr playing more games against Peter Feigl than Eddie Dibbs. However, the table doesn't list any matches involving Carlos Kirmayr, making it impossible to verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"carlos kirmayr do not win a championship between 1976 and 1980\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It's stating that Carlos Kirmayr did not win any championships during the years 1976 through 1980. So, to verify this, I need to check if there's any record in the table where Carlos Kirmayr is listed as a winner of a championship within those years.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: outcome, date, championship, surface, opponent in the final, and score in the final. The rows represent different tournaments or finals where someone was either the runner-up or maybe the winner.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if Carlos Kirmayr is mentioned as a champion.\n\nRow 0: The \"opponent in the final\" is jos\u00e9 higueras, not Carlos. The outcome is \"runner - up,\" so he didn't win.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is peter feigl. Again, outcome is runner-up.\n\nRow 2: Opponent is dominique bedel. Outcome is runner-up.\n\nRow 3: Opponent is eddie dibbs. Outcome is runner-up.\n\nRow 4: Opponent is van winitsky. Outcome is runner-up.\n\nSo in all the rows provided, Carlos Kirmayr isn't listed as a winner of any championship. The opponents are other players, and the outcome for each is that he was the runner-up, not the winner.\n\nNow, considering the years from 1976 to 1980, the table only covers up to 1982, but within 1976-1980, there's no mention of Carlos Kirmayr winning. The claim says he doesn't win any in that period, which seems to be true based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's no evidence in the provided data that Carlos Kirmayr won a championship between 1976 and 1980.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "carlos kirmayr lose to van winitsky 3 year after lose to jos\u00e9 higueras",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break down what the claim says: \"carlos kirmayr lose to van winitsky 3 year after lose to jos\u00e9 higueras.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of this statement. It mentions Carlos Kirmayr losing to Van Winitsky three years after losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras. So there are two losses involved here: one against Jos\u00e9 Higueras and another against Van Winitsky, with a three-year gap between them.\n\nLooking at the table, I'm looking for relevant information about Carlos Kirmayr's losses. The table lists several rows, each representing different tournaments. Each row has details like the outcome (whether they were runners-up or not), date, championship location, surface type, opponent in the final, and score.\n\nI need to find if there are any entries where Carlos Kirmayr was a runner-up. Wait, but looking at the table's 'opponent in the final' column, I see names like Jos\u00e9 Higueras, Peter Feigl, Dominique Bedel, Eddie Dibbs, and Van Winitsky. None of these opponents are named Carlos Kirmayr. So maybe Carlos Kirmayr isn't directly listed as a runner-up or an opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says Carlos Kirmayr lost to Van Winitsky three years after losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras. So I need to check if in the table there's a instance where Carlos Kirmayr lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras and then three years later, he lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1976: Runner-up is someone else, opponent is Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\n- 1979: Runner-up again, but opponent is Peter Feigl.\n- 1980: Runner-up, opponent Dominique Bedel.\n- 1981: Runner-up, Eddie Dibbs.\n- 1982: Runner-up, Van Winitsky.\n\nSo in the 1982 row, the runner-up lost to Van Winitsky. Now I need to see if there's a prior instance where Carlos Kirmayr lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras three years before that.\n\nLooking back at the earlier rows:\n\n- The first row is 1976, and the opponent was Jos\u00e9 Higueras. So perhaps in 1976, whoever was playing lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras, making them the runner-up. Then in 1979, the next possible year three years later, someone else might have lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nWait, but the claim says Carlos Kirmayr loses to Van Winitsky three years after losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras. So I need to see if there's a row where Carlos Kirmayr is an opponent against Jos\u00e9 Higueras in one year, and then three years later he loses to Van Winitsky.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nIn 1976, the runner-up was someone who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras. So that person (runner-up) lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976. Then in 1979, they might have lost again three years later. But wait, in 1979, the opponent is Peter Feigl, not Van Winitsky.\n\nIn 1982, someone lost to Van Winitsky. If that person is Carlos Kirmayr, and he previously lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 or earlier, then the three-year gap would be from 1979 to 1982, but that's only three years after 1979? Wait, no, 1982 minus 1979 is three years.\n\nBut wait, the initial loss to Jos\u00e9 Higueras was in 1976. So if Carlos Kirmayr lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and then again lost three years later in 1979, but in 1979, he lost to Peter Feigl, not Van Winitsky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the loss to Jos\u00e9 Higueras happened in a different year. Let me check each row for opponents:\n\n- 1976: Opponent is Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\n- 1979: Opponent is Peter Feigl.\n- 1980: Dominique Bedel.\n- 1981: Eddie Dibbs.\n- 1982: Van Winitsky.\n\nSo the only time Jos\u00e9 Higueras was an opponent was in 1976. So if Carlos Kirmayr lost to him in 1976, then three years later would be 1979. But in 1979, he lost to Peter Feigl, not Van Winitsky. So that doesn't align with the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the loss to Jos\u00e9 Higueras was in a different year, but looking at the table, it's only in 1976. Then in 1982, three years after 1979 (but not after 1976), he lost to Van Winitsky. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting who lost whom. Each row shows a runner-up, which means they lost the final. So if in 1976, someone lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras and became runner-up, then three years later, say in 1979, that same person could have lost again. But in 1979, the opponent was Peter Feigl, so it's a different person.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Carlos Kirmayr is the one who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976, and then three years later in 1979, he lost to someone else (Peter Feigl), but that doesn't involve Van Winitsky. Then in 1982, perhaps Van Winitsky lost to someone else, making it not Carlos Kirmayr.\n\nWait, the claim is about Carlos Kirmayr losing to Van Winitsky three years after losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras. So we need two separate entries: one where Carlos Kirmayr lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras, and another where he lost to Van Winitsky three years later.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- In 1976, someone (runner-up) lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\n- In 1982, runner-up lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nSo if Carlos Kirmayr was that person in both cases, then losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and then again to Van Winitsky in 1982. But three years after 1976 would be 1979, but he didn't lose to Van Winitsky then; instead, someone else did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loss to Jos\u00e9 Higueras was later. Let me check each row:\n\n1976: Runner-up lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\n1979: Runner-up lost to Peter Feigl.\n1980: Runner-up lost to Dominique Bedel.\n1981: Runner-up lost to Eddie Dibbs.\n1982: Runner-up lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nSo if Carlos Kirmayr was the runner-up in 1982, losing to Van Winitsky, then he must have also lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in a previous year. But when? The only opponent of Jos\u00e9 Higueras is in 1976, so that's a different person.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Carlos Kirmayr was the runner-up in 1976 against Jos\u00e9 Higueras, then three years later in 1979 he was again the runner-up, but the opponent was Peter Feigl. But then he didn't lose to Van Winitsky in 1982.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with who is the player and who is the opponent. Each row is about a tournament, so the runner-up is the one who lost to the winner (probably). So for example, in 1976, the runner-up lost to the actual winner, which would be someone else, but in this table, it's showing that the runner-up was someone who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras. Wait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps each row is a different event, and the runner-up is someone specific. For example, in 1976, the runner-up lost to the opponent, who was Jos\u00e9 Higueras. Then in 1979, another runner-up lost to Peter Feigl, etc.\n\nSo if Carlos Kirmayr was the runner-up in both 1976 and 1982, he would have lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and then three years later (1979), but that doesn't match. Alternatively, losing to Van Winitsky in 1982, but when did he lose to Jos\u00e9 Higueras?\n\nWait, maybe the person who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 is someone else, not Carlos Kirmayr. Then Carlos Kirmayr could have lost to Van Winitsky in 1982, but that would only be five years later (from 1976 to 1982), which is more than three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the person who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 is Carlos Kirmayr, and then three years later in 1979, he lost again. But in 1979, the opponent was Peter Feigl, so that doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key points are:\n\n- The claim says someone (Carlos Kirmayr) lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in one year.\n- Then three years later, he lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nLooking at the table, in 1976, someone lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras. Then in 1982, someone lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nIf Carlos Kirmayr is that person, then he lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and three years later (1982 -3=1979) should have lost again, but he didn't lose to Van Winitsky; instead, in 1982, he lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nWait, so perhaps the time gap is not from the first loss to the second, but that between losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras and losing to Van Winitsky is three years. But if he lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976, then in 1979 (three years later) he would have had a chance to lose again. However, in 1979, the opponent was Peter Feigl, not Van Winitsky.\n\nSo maybe it's not Carlos Kirmayr losing to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976, but someone else, and then three years later, that same person loses to Van Winitsky in 1982. But that would be a five-year gap if starting from 1976.\n\nWait, no: 1979 is three years after 1976. So if he lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976, and then in 1979, he lost again (to Peter Feigl), but the claim is about losing to Van Winitsky. Then in 1982, it's Van Winitsky.\n\nSo perhaps the person who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 is different from the one who lost to Van Winitsky in 1982. Therefore, Carlos Kirmayr might not be involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Carlos Kirmayr was the runner-up in both 1976 and 1982, meaning he lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and then again to someone else (Peter Feigl) in 1979, and then in 1982, he lost to Van Winitsky. But that would mean he lost three times: 1976, 1979, 1982.\n\nBut the claim is about losing to both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Van Winitsky within three years of each other.\n\nI think I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe it's better to consider the actual data in the table.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- In 1976, the runner-up lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\n- In 1979, the runner-up lost to Peter Feigl.\n- In 1982, the runner-up lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nAssuming that each row is a separate event with its own set of participants, the person who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 might not be the same as the one who lost to Van Winitsky in 1982. So if Carlos Kirmayr was the runner-up in both 1976 and 1982, then he would have lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and then later to Van Winitsky in 1982, which is six years apart.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 was Carlos Kirmayr, and then three years later (1979), he lost again. But in 1979, the opponent was Peter Feigl, not Van Winitsky. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the person who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 is someone else, say Person A, and the person who lost to Van Winitsky in 1982 is Carlos Kirmayr. Then Carlos Kirmayr lost to Van Winitsky in 1982, but when did he lose to Jos\u00e9 Higueras? He didn't, unless it's also in 1976.\n\nBut that would mean he lost to two different people within the same year or something, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is that there is no such person Carlos Kirmayr who lost to both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Van Winitsky with the given data. Or perhaps it's possible if he was the runner-up in 1976 and then again in 1982, but the opponents are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the table doesn't show all the participants, so there could be overlaps where Carlos Kirmayr lost to both within three years.\n\nBut looking back, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to note that each row is a separate event with its own loser and winner. So in 1976, someone lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras; in 1982, someone else lost to Van Winitsky. Therefore, unless Carlos Kirmayr was the same person in both, which would mean he lost to two different people, which isn't possible, then perhaps it's not feasible.\n\nWait, but if Carlos Kirmayr was the runner-up in both 1976 and 1982, he would have lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and then again to Van Winitsky in 1982. But that's six years apart, so not three years between losing to each.\n\nAlternatively, if he lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 and then three years later (1979) lost to someone else, but that's not Van Winitsky. So perhaps it's impossible with the given data.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The table only shows three events: 1976, 1979, 1982. So if Carlos Kirmayr was involved in all of them, he would have lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976, then perhaps someone else in 1979, and Van Winitsky in 1982. But the claim is that he lost to both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Van Winitsky within three years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about losing to them on different occasions, but the time between losing to each is three years.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to say. Maybe the answer is that there is no such person in the table who lost to both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Van Winitsky within three years of each loss.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look at the dates: 1976, 1979 (three years later), and 1982 (another three years). So if someone lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976, they would have had a chance to lose again in 1979. But Van Winitsky is only mentioned in 1982.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person who lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras in 1976 was someone who later lost to Van Winitsky in 1982, making it six years between losses. So not three years apart.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe the answer is that there's no such Carlos Kirmayr in the given data who lost to both within three years.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, it is not possible for a single person named Carlos Kirmayr to have lost to both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Van Winitsky within three years of each other. The events listed are:\n\n- **1976**: Runner-up lost to Jos\u00e9 Higueras.\n- **1979**: Runner-up lost to Peter Feigl.\n- **1982**: Runner-up lost to Van Winitsky.\n\nThere is no evidence in the table that Carlos Kirmayr participated in all three events, or that he lost to both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Van Winitsky within the specified time frame. Therefore, it's concluded that such a scenario does not exist with the given information.\n\n**Answer:** There is no evidence in the provided data indicating that Carlos Kirmayr lost to both Jos\u00e9 Higueras and Van Winitsky within three years of each other.",
