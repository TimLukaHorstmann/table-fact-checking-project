    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Tevita Vaikona in the table. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see his name listed in one of the rows. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the first row: player is Robbie Paul. No match there. Second row: Tevita Vaikona is indeed here. Great, so that's the row we're interested in.\n\nNow, the claim mentions three specific pieces of information: points scored (100), tries made (25), and goals scored (0). Wait, actually, the claim says \"score 100 point on 25 tries\". Hmm, perhaps it's just emphasizing points from tries? Or maybe there's a part about goals. But looking at the table, each player has 'goals' and 'points' columns.\n\nSo, I need to check if Tevita Vaikona has exactly 25 tries and 100 points. Let me look at his 'tries' column. The data shows 25 for Tevita in that cell. That's correct.\n\nNext, the points. His row says 100 under the 'points' column. Wait, no, hold on. In the table, each player has a 'goals' column and a 'points' column. So, Tevita has 0 goals and 100 points? Or is it that goals are part of points? No, typically in rugby, points are separate from tries. Each try can give points, and sometimes conversions or penalties add more.\n\nWait, but the table seems to have two numerical columns: 'tries' (number of tries scored) and 'goals', which might be the number of successful conversions or similar. Then there's a separate 'points' column. For Tevita Vaikona, in the 'goals' column, it's 0, and in 'points' it's 100.\n\nSo, if the claim says \"score 100 point on 25 tries\", it might be conflating points with goals or something else. But in rugby terms, points can come from tries (usually 5 points each), conversions (additional points after a try), penalties, and drop goals. So, if Tevita scored 25 tries, that would be 25*5=125 points. However, the table shows his points as 100. That discrepancy suggests something's off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me re-examine the table structure. The columns are: player name, tries, goals, and points. So for Tevita Vaikona, he has 25 tries, 0 goals, but 100 points. That doesn't align because 25 tries should be 125 points if each try is worth 5.\n\nThis inconsistency raises a red flag. The claim says Tevita scored 100 points on 25 tries. If the 'points' column represents total points from all sources, then 25 tries at 5 points each would indeed give 125 points, not 100. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this context, 'goals' are the same as points. But Tevita has 0 goals and 100 points. That doesn't make sense either because goals should be part of points. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps in this table, 'points' is calculated differently. Maybe each try gives a certain number of points, but then there are other factors like conversions. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the key point is that Tevita has 25 tries and 100 points. If each try is worth 5 points, 25*5=125, which doesn't match 100.\n\nSo, either the table data is incorrect, or the claim is inaccurate because 25 tries wouldn't lead to 100 points if each try is 5 points. Therefore, the claim that Tevita scored 100 points on 25 tries might be FALSE because it's inconsistent with the data provided.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe 'points' in this table include other sources like penalties or drop goals. If so, maybe he didn't just get points from tries but also added some others to reach 100. However, without knowing the exact breakdown, we can't confirm that. But based on what's given, 25 tries would typically lead to more than 100 points if each is worth at least 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this context, 'tries' are counted differently, but I think in rugby, a try is always worth 5 points. So the number of tries should directly correlate with points from tries. If Tevita has 25 tries, he should have at least 125 points from that, unless there were other sources like goals or penalties.\n\nWait, but the 'goals' column for Tevita is 0, so maybe all his points came from elsewhere, not from tries. That would explain why it's only 100. But then, the claim says \"score 100 point on 25 tries,\" which implies that the points were from the tries. So if he didn't score any goals but still has 25 tries and 100 points, that suggests that each try gave him less than 5 points, which isn't standard.\n\nTherefore, there's a discrepancy between the number of tries and the total points. The claim states 25 tries leading to 100 points, but in reality, based on typical rugby scoring, this wouldn't add up unless there are other factors not accounted for in the table. Since the table shows 25 tries and 100 points without any additional context about how those points were earned, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim that Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points on 25 tries doesn't align with the data provided because 25 tries at 5 points each would result in more than 100 points.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"tevita vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify who Tevita Vaikona is in the table. Scanning through the 'player' column, I see his name in row 1 (since it starts from 0, but sometimes people count rows starting at 1). Let me confirm: the first row after the headers is Robbie Paul, then Tevita Vaikona is in the second row. So his row index is 1.\n\nNow, looking at Tevita's data: position is wing, tries are 25, goals 0, points 100. So he has exactly 25 tries and 100 points. The claim says he scores at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries. Wait, more than 23? He made 25, which is more than 23. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to check if he's the only player who meets both conditions: scoring at least 100 points and having more than 23 tries. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking for players with more than 23 tries first because the claim specifies \"make more than 23 tries.\" Let's see:\n\n- Robbie Paul: 23 tries, exactly 23, so not more.\n- Tevita Vaikona: 25, which is more.\n- Leon Pryce: 16, no.\n- Nathan McAvoy:4, no.\n- Michael Withers:31, which is more than 23. His points are 124, which is also above 100.\nWait, so Michael Withers has 31 tries (more than 23) and 124 points (which is more than 100). So he also meets both conditions.\n\nThat's a problem because the claim says Tevita is the only one. So already, there are at least two players: Tevita and Michael Withers. I need to check if anyone else qualifies.\n\nContinuing down:\n\n- Henry Paul:9 tries, less.\n- Paul Deacon:6, no.\n- Joe Vagana:2, nope.\n- James Lowes:13, no.\n- Paul Anderson:8, no.\n- Daniel Gartner:14, nope.\n- Mike Forshaw:6, no.\n- Graham Mackay:12, which is less than 23. His points are 50, so even if he had more tries, it's under 100.\nWait, Graham Mackay has 12 tries and scored 1 goal, but that's only 50 points. So even if his tries were over 23, the points wouldn't reach 100.\n\nNext:\n\n- Paul Sykes:0, no.\n- Rob Parker:0, no.\n- Stuart Spruce:6, nope.\n- Stuart Fielden:3, no.\n\nWait, wait, I think I missed some rows. Let me recount because there are many players listed. Maybe I should list all the players with tries >23 and points >=100.\n\nTevita Vaikona: 25 tries, 100 points \u2192 qualifies.\n\nMichael Withers:31 tries, 124 points \u2192 qualifies.\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- Brian McDermott:3 tries, no.\n- Graham Mackay:12, as above.\n- Paul Sykes:0.\n- Rob Parker:0.\n- Stuart Spruce:6.\n- Stuart Fielden:3.\n\nWhat about other players? Let me check if anyone else has more than 23 tries and at least 100 points.\n\nWait, Michael Withers is the only other one so far. But let's make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking back:\n\nAfter Tevita Vaikona (row1), Robbie Paul is row0, then Tevita is row1, then row2: Leon Pryce, etc.\n\nLet me list all players with tries >23 and points >=100:\n\n- Tevita Vaikona: 25 >23, 100 \u2265100 \u2192 qualifies.\n- Michael Withers:31 >23, 124 \u2265100 \u2192 qualifies.\n\nIs there anyone else? Let's check each row:\n\nRow index 0: Robbie Paul. Tries=23 (exactly), so not more than 23. So no.\nRow1: Tevita Vaikona \u2192 yes.\nRow2: Leon Pryce:16, nope.\nRow3: Nathan McAvoy:4, nope.\nRow4: Michael Withers:31, points=124 \u2192 qualifies.\nRow5: Henry Paul:9, no.\nRow6: Paul Deacon:6, no.\nRow7: Joe Vagana:2, no.\nRow8: James Lowes:13, no.\nRow9: Paul Anderson:8, no.\nRow10: Daniel Gartner:14, nope.\nRow11: Mike Forshaw:6, no.\nRow12: Graham Mackay:12, points=50 \u2192 under 100, so even if tries were over 23, it's not enough.\nRow13: Paul Sykes:0, no.\nRow14: Rob Parker:0, no.\nRow15: Stuart Spruce:6, no.\nRow16: Stuart Fielden:3, no.\n\nThat seems to cover all rows. So only Tevita Vaikona and Michael Withers meet both conditions. Therefore, the claim that Tevita is the only one is false because Michael also does so.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this verification.\n\nFor each of these two players, their row index and the columns we looked at. For Tevita, his row is 1, and we checked the 'tries' (column_name: Tries) and 'points' (Points). Similarly, Michael Withers is in row4; we also checked his Tries and Points.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row1, Tries\n- Row1, Points\n- Row4, Tries\n- Row4, Points\n\nWait, but the claim only mentions Tevita. So maybe I should include all relevant players. Since Michael also qualifies, he's another data point. So yes, both of their cells are relevant.\n\nSo in the JSON, we need to list all the cells that were checked. Therefore, for each qualifying player, their row index and the columns Tries and Points.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Tries\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Tries\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}]}",
