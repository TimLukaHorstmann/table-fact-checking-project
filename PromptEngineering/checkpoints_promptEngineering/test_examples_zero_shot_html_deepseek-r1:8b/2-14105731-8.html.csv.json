    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"the format of season 6 be q145.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table data.\n\nLet me break down the claim:\n- It mentions \"format\" which in the table is one of the columns.\n- It refers to \"season 6,\" so I need to find season 6 in the table.\n- The format is given as \"q145,\" so I need to check if for season 6, the format column has \"q145.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various details like episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find where the season is 6. Season numbers are in the 'season' column. Let's go row by row:\n\n1. Row 0: season 1\n2. Row 1: season 2\n3. Row 2: season 3\n4. Row 3: season 4\n5. Row 4: season 5\n6. Row 5: season 6 \u2192 This is the row we need to check.\n7. The rest are seasons beyond 6, but since the claim is about season 6 specifically, I can stop once I find it.\n\nSo, for season 6, which is row index 5 (since rows start at 0), let's look at the 'format' column. The format in that row is \"q145.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim states that the format of season 6 is q145, and according to the table, that's exactly what it is.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells for verification. The relevant cells are the specific data points used to confirm the claim. In this case, I need the row index (5) and the column name ('format') where the value 'q145' is located.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it mentions season 6.0 having a format of 'q245'. So, I need to check if in the provided table, there's an entry for season 6 with format 'q245'.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the season is 6.0. Since in the table, seasons are numbered from 1 to 16, I'm specifically looking for the row where 'season' is 6.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 222: Season 6.\nSo, this is the relevant row for season 6.\n\nNow, within this row, I need to check what the format is. The format column has values like 'h75', 'h76', etc., and sometimes multiple formats separated by a slash, such as \"denisa 's greedy doll / denisa 's slumber party\".\n\nLooking at row 222: the format is 'q145'. The claim says it should be 'q245'. Since q145 isn't equal to q245, this doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n- Row 222 has season=6 and format=q145.\nYes, that's correct. So the format is 'q145', not 'q245'.\n\nTherefore, the claim that season 6.0 has format q245 is FALSE because the actual format for season 6 is q145.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The 'season' column in row 222 and the 'format' column in the same row.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Season 6 has a format of 'q245'. From the table:\n\n- **Season 6** is represented by row index 222 (row_index: 222).\n- The 'format' for this season is listed as 'q145', not 'q245'.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 222, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 222, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with episodes of some show, and there's a claim I need to verify. The claim is: \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The claim mentions episode number 223 having a specific format, which is 'q147'. So I should look at where 223 appears in the table and check the corresponding 'format' column for that row.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows, each with an 'episode' number. I'll go through each row to find where the episode number is 223. Scanning down, I spot that row 7 (since it starts counting from 0 or 1? Wait, looking at the first row is 217 as episode 0? No, actually in HTML tables, rows are indexed starting from 0 if we count programmatically, but in the context of the table, each row represents a separate episode. So let's check each row.\n\nRow 0: Episode 217\nRow 1: Episode 218\n...\nWait, no, the first <tr> is actually the first row as per HTML, so I think the rows are indexed starting from 0 to n-1. But in the table provided, the first episode is 217, and it's row index 0.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the structure:\n\nThe first <tr> after <thead> is the first data row, which has episode number 217, so that's row index 0.\n\nThen each subsequent <tr> increments the row index. So to find where episode 223 is, I need to count down from 217 up to 223.\n\nWait, no: looking at the table:\n\nLooking at the 'episode' column:\n- Row 0: 217\n- Row 1: 218\n- Row 2: 219\n...\nContinuing this way, let me count until I reach 223. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for row where episode is 223.\n\nLooking through each <tr>:\n\nRow 7 (index 7? Let's see):\n\nWait, the first row after the header is episode 217 as row 0. So:\n\nRow 0: 217\nRow 1: 218\n...\nSo row index increases by 1 for each <tr>. The 223rd episode would be at a higher index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list all episodes and their indices.\n\nWait, the table starts with 217 as the first episode (row 0), then 218 (row 1), up to 231 (last row). So 223 is somewhere in between. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: 217\nRow 1: 218\nRow 2: 219\nRow 3: 220\nRow 4: 221\nRow 5: 222\nRow 6: 223\n\nAh, so episode number 223 is in row index 6.\n\nNow, looking at the 'format' column for that row. The format for episode 223 is listed as 'q147'. So that part checks out\u2014episode 223 has the format q147.\n\nBut the claim says \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" So I need to check if any other episodes have the same format code, 'q147'.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: h75\nRow 1: h76\n...\nRow 6 (223): q147\nContinuing beyond that:\n\nRow 7: h81\nRow 8: h82\n... up to row 15 (231).\n\nSo only row 6 has the format 'q147'. Therefore, 223 is indeed the only episode with this format.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure no other rows have 'q147' in the format column. Let me go through each row:\n\nRows 0-5: formats are h75, h76, h81, etc.\u2014none of these are q147.\nRow 6: q147\nRows 7 onwards: none have q147.\n\nSo yes, only row 6 (episode 223) has the format 'q147'. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is where episode number 223 is located in the table. The 'format' column for this episode is 'q147', and no other episodes share this format.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}",
