The claim says: \"the number of fatalities be unknown for aircraft ju - 52.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table columns to find relevant information. The table has columns: location, aircraft, tail number, aircraft damage, and fatalities.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"aircraft ju - 52.\" So I need to locate this in the 'aircraft' column. Scanning each row's aircraft field:\n\n- Row 0: Lockheed L-14\n- Row 1: Ju-52\n- Row 2: F27-200\n- Row 3: Boeing 737-200\n- Row 4: Boeing 737-200\n- Row 5: Boeing 747SP\n\nHere, in row index 1, the aircraft is \"ju - 52\". That's exactly what the claim refers to.\n\nNext, I check the 'fatalities' column for this row. The fatalities are listed as \"unknown\" in that specific cell.\n\nSo, the claim states that the number of fatalities is unknown for ju-52. Since the table shows \"unknown\" under fatalities for that row, it fully supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are at row index 1, column 'fatalities'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about an aircraft is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"aircraft f27 - 200 's tail number be cr - aib and have 3 / 3 fatalities.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to and locate that information in the table. Let's break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. **Tail Number**: The claim specifies that the aircraft \"f27 - 200\" should have a tail number of \"cr - aib.\"\n2. **Fatalities**: It also mentions that there were \"3 / 3\" fatalities.\n\nSo, my approach will be to search the table for rows where the aircraft is f27 - 200 and check both the tail number and the number of fatalities.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The table has columns: location, aircraft, tail number, aircraft damage, fatalities.\n- There are six rows in total.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the aircraft model is \"f27 - 200.\"\n\nRow 0:\n- Location: quelimane\n- Aircraft: lockheed l - 14\n- Tail Number: cr - aav\n- Fatalities: unknown\n\nThis doesn't match because the aircraft isn't f27 - 200.\n\nRow 1:\n- Location: lagoa p\u00e1ti\n- Aircraft: ju - 52\n- Tail Number: unknown\n- Fatalities: unknown\n\nAgain, no match for f27 - 200.\n\nRow 2:\n- Location: louren\u00e7o marques\n- Aircraft: f27 - 200\n- Tail Number: cr - aib\n- Fatalities: 3 / 3\n\nThis seems to match both the aircraft model and tail number. But I should check the rest to be thorough.\n\nRow 3:\n- Location: quelimane\n- Aircraft: boeing 737 - 200\n- Tail Number: c9 - bab\n- Fatalities: 0 / 110\n\nNot a match for f27 - 200.\n\nRow 4:\n- Location: lichinga\n- Aircraft: boeing 737 - 200\n- Tail Number: c9 - bad\n- Fatalities: 0 / 108\n\nAgain, not a match.\n\nRow 5:\n- Location: off maputo\n- Aircraft: boeing 747sp\n- Tail Number: zs - spf\n- Fatalities: 0 / 66\n\nNo match here either.\n\nSo, the only row that matches both parts of the claim is Row 2. It has the aircraft as f27 - 200 with a tail number cr - aib and 3 / 3 fatalities. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on this information.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other rows where \"f27 - 200\" appears. From the table provided, it only appears in Row 2. So, there's only one relevant row that matches both parts of the claim.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones from Row 2 for tail number and fatalities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tail number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

In row 1, under 'fatalities', it says \"unknown.\" So that's matching the claim which states an unknown number of fatalities.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure there are no other rows with the same location and aircraft.

The claim has two main parts: checking the location and checking the tail number.\n\nStarting with the location: the claim mentions \"off maputo\". Looking at the table, there's a row where location is \"off maputo\". That seems to match. So that part of the claim is supported by the table.\n\nNext, the tail number in the claim is \"zs - spf\". I need to find this exact string in the table's Tail Number column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The first row has \"cr - aav\"\n- Second: \"unknown\"\n- Third: \"cr - aib\"\n- Fourth: \"c9 - bab\"\n- Fifth: \"c9 - bad\"\n- Sixth: \"zs - spf\"\n\nYes, the sixth row has \"zs - spf\" as the tail number.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"it be not know if there be fatalities on ju - 52.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find all the relevant cells that might verify this claim. Let's see what the columns are: location, aircraft, tail number, aircraft damage, and fatalities.\n\nThe key part of the claim is \"ju - 52\" and whether there were fatalities. So, I need to find where \"ju - 52\" appears in the table and check the fatalities column for that row.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row has location \"quelimane\", not relevant.\n2. Second row: location is \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\". Hmm, but the claim mentions \"ju - 52\". Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. Oh, wait, no\u2014each row's location and aircraft are separate. So in row 0: location=quelimane, aircraft=lockheed l-14; row1: lagoa p\u00e1ti, ju-52; so the second row is the one with \"ju - 52\".\n\nSo, for row index 1 (second row), let's check the relevant columns. The column names are location, aircraft, tail number, damage, and fatalities.\n\nThe claim mentions \"ju - 52\", which is in the \"aircraft\" column of row 1. So the relevant cells would be: row_index=1, column_name=\"aircraft\"; and also, we need to check if there's any mention of fatalities in that row.\n\nSo for row 1, \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\", the aircraft is \"ju -52\". The claim says it's not known if there are fatalities. So I should look at the fatalities column for this row. In the table, the fifth column (fatalities) for row1 is \"unknown\".\n\nTherefore, in row1, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index=1, column_name=\"aircraft\" because that's where \"ju -52\" is.\n- row_index=1, column_name=\"fatalities\" because it shows whether there were fatalities or not.\n\nSo, I think the claim is referring to the lack of knowledge about fatalities for \"ju -52\". In the table, for row1, the fatalities are marked as \"unknown\", which aligns with the claim. Therefore, the relevant cells would be these two: the aircraft and fatalities columns in row1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that it's unknown if there were fatalities on the \"ju - 52\" aircraft. The table confirms this by showing \"unknown\" in the fatalities column for the corresponding row.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data**: Look for rows where the aircraft is \"ju - 52\".\n2. **Locate the correct row**: Found in row index 1 (second row).\n3. **Check columns**: The claim focuses on fatalities, so check the \"fatalities\" column.\n4. **Conclusion**: The \"fatalities\" cell is marked as \"unknown\", which supports the claim.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Row 1, \"aircraft\" column (ju -52)\n- Row 1, \"fatalities\" column (unknown)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's stating that in \"lagoa p\u00e1ti,\" there's a \"ju - 52\" aircraft. So, to verify this, I need to check if there's an entry for \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\" as the location and \"ju - 52\" as the aircraft in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different location with corresponding aircraft details. The locations listed are: quelimane, lagoa p\u00e1ti, louren\u00e7o marques, quelimane again, lichinga, and off maputo.\n\nNow, focusing on the second row because that's where \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\" is mentioned. The columns are location, aircraft, tail number, aircraft damage, and fatalities.\n\nIn row 1 (row index starting from 0), the location is \"lagoa p\u00e1ti,\" the aircraft is listed as \"ju - 52.\" So this matches the claim exactly. There's no other occurrence of \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\" in the table, so it's only present once here.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the location of the ju -52 aircraft.\" So yes, in \"lagoa p\u00e1ti,\" there is a \"ju -52\" aircraft. That seems to confirm the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other relevant cells are involved. The columns we need to consider are location and aircraft because that's what the claim is about.

The claim is: \"cr - aib be the tail number with 0 / 110 fatalities.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see which cells in the table are relevant.\n\nStarting with \"cr - aib\": I need to find where this appears as a tail number in the table. Scanning through the 'tail number' column, I see that row 2 has \"unknown\" and row 3 is \"cr - aib\". So, row_index 2 and the column is 'tail number'.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"0 / 110 fatalities.\" Looking at the 'fatalities' column, in row 3, it's listed as \"3 / 3\". That doesn't match. Wait, let me double-check: no, row 3 has 3/3, which is not 0/110. So maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps the tail number \"cr - aib\" is in row 2 or 3. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: location quelimane, tail number cr-aav. Not cr-aib.\nRow 1: lagoa pati, unknown.\nRow 2: louren\u00e7o marques, cr-aib. Tail number is cr-aib here, and fatalities are 3/3.\nRow 3: quelimane, boeing 737-200, c9-bab. Not cr-aib.\nWait, no, row 0 is \"cr - aav\", row2 is \"cr - aib\". So row_index 2, 'tail number' column.\n\nBut in row 2, the fatalities are 3/3, not 0/110. So there's a discrepancy here. The claim says cr-aib has 0/110, but the table shows it has 3/3.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look again:\n\nRow 2: location louren\u00e7o marques, aircraft f27-200, tail number cr-aib, damage w/o, fatalities 3/3.\nSo that's row 2, column 'fatalities' is 3/3.\n\nBut the claim says \"cr - aib be the tail number with 0 / 110 fatalities.\" So the tail number cr-aib has 0/110. But in the table, it's 3/3. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the fatalities don't match.\n\nWait, but I might have misread which row has which data. Let me list all rows:\n\nRow 0:\nlocation: quelimane\naircraft: lockheed l-14\ntail number: cr-aav\ndamage: w/o\nfatalities: unknown\n\nRow1:\nlocation: lagoa pati\naircraft: ju-52\ntail number: unknown\ndamage: w/o\nfatalities: unknown\n\nRow2:\nlocation: louren\u00e7o marques\naircraft: f27-200\ntail number: cr-aib\ndamage: w/o\nfatalities: 3/3\n\nRow3:\nlocation: quelimane\naircraft: boeing 737-200\ntail number: c9-bab\ndamage: w/o\nfatalities: 0/110\n\nRow4:\nlocation: lichinga\naircraft: boeing 737-200\ntail number: c9-bad\ndamage: w/o\nfatalities: 0/108\n\nRow5:\nlocation: off maputo\naircraft: boeing 747sp\ntail number: zs-spf\ndamage: w/o\nfatalities: 0/66\n\nSo, the claim is about \"cr - aib\" being the tail number with 0/110 fatalities. Looking at row2, cr-aib has 3/3. So it doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, looking at row3: the tail number is c9-bab, not cr-aib, and fatalities are 0/110. So perhaps the claim refers to this row?\n\nWait no, because the claim specifically mentions \"cr - aib\". Therefore, the only occurrence of cr-aib in the table is row2, which has 3/3. Since the claim says it's 0/110, that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the tail numbers. Let me check if any other rows have \"cr - aib\". Row0: cr-aav; row1: unknown; row2: cr-aib; row3: c9-bab; etc. So only row2 has cr-aib, with 3/3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it attributes different fatalities to the tail number cr-aib than what's in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"cr - aib\" is the tail number with 0 / 110 fatalities. However, in the table, \"cr - aib\" corresponds to row 2, which lists 3/3 fatalities. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Tail Number:** The claim refers to \"cr - aib\". Looking at the 'tail number' column, only row 2 has this value.\n2. **Check Fatalities for \"cr - aib\":** Row 2's 'fatalities' are listed as 3/3, not 0/110.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the actual fatalities don't match the claim, it is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"tail number\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the number of fatalities that occur for the ju - 52 aircraft be 3 / 3.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim need to be checked against the table. The claim mentions two things: the specific aircraft (\"ju - 52\") and the number of fatalities (\"3 / 3\"). So, I need to look for rows where the \"aircraft\" column matches \"ju - 52\" and see what the \"fatalities\" column says there.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a location, aircraft, tail number, damage, and fatalities. Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. The first row has an aircraft of \"lockheed l - 14\", not relevant.\n2. Second row: location is \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\", aircraft is \"ju - 52\". That's our target row since it matches the aircraft in question.\n3. Third row: location is \"louren\u00e7o marques\", so probably not relevant unless there are multiple entries for ju-52, which I don't see here.\n4. The fourth and following rows have different aircrafts like Boeing 737-200 and others, none matching ju - 52.\n\nSo, focusing on the second row where location is \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\" and aircraft is \"ju - 52\". Now, checking the \"fatalities\" column for this row: it says \"unknown\".\n\nWait, that's a problem. The claim states that the fatalities are \"3 / 3\", but in the table, it shows \"unknown.\" That means there's a discrepancy between what's claimed and what's actually in the table.\n\nI should also check if there's another occurrence of ju -52 elsewhere, but scanning through all rows again, I don't see any other entries for that specific aircraft. So, this is the only row relevant to the claim.\n\nSince the table says \"unknown\" for fatalities, which doesn't match \"3 / 3,\" the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's assertion about the ju -52 aircraft having 3/3 fatalities isn't supported as the table shows \"unknown\" for that row. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the ju - 52 aircraft have a location of off maputo and 0 / 108 fatalities.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim and see if it matches the data in the table.\n\nStarting with the location part: The claim mentions \"off maputo\" as the location. Looking through the table, I need to find the row where the location is \"off maputo\". Let me check each row:\n\n1. Row 0: quelimane\n2. Row 1: lagoa p\u00e1ti\n3. Row 2: louren\u00e7o marques\n4. Row 3: quelimane\n5. Row 4: lichinga\n6. Row 5: off maputo\n\nSo, the sixth row (row index 5) has \"off maputo\" as the location. That matches the claim's location part.\n\nNext, looking at the fatalities part: The claim states \"0 / 108 fatalities.\" In the table, the 'fatalities' column should have this value for the corresponding row and aircraft. Since the location matches in row 5, I check that row.\n\nIn row 5:\n- Location: off maputo\n- Aircraft: boeing 747sp\n- Tail number: zs - spf\n- Fatalities: 0 / 66\n\nWait a minute, the fatalities here are \"0 / 66\", not \"0 / 108\". That's different. So there's a discrepancy between the claim and the table data.\n\nI should also check if there's another row that might have \"ju - 52\" as the aircraft because the claim starts with that. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1 has \"ju - 52\" as the aircraft, but its location is lagoa p\u00e1ti, not off maputo.\n- The other rows don't mention \"ju - 52\".\n\nSo, the only row where both the location is off maputo and the fatalities are mentioned is row 5, but the fatalities there are 0/66, not 0/108.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: location and fatalities. The location matches one row, but the fatalities don't match that specific row. So the claim is incorrect for the fatalities part, making it FALSE overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim states: \"the aircraft with tail number c9 - bad have an unknown number of fatalities.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row where the tail number is \"c9 - bad.\" Scanning each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Tail number is cr-aav.\n2. Row 1: Tail number is unknown.\n3. Row 2: Tail number is cr-aib.\n4. Row 3: Tail number is c9-bab.\n5. Row 4: Tail number is c9-bad.\n6. Row 5: Tail number is zs-spf.\n\nSo, the aircraft with tail number \"c9 - bad\" is in row 4. Now, I'll check the fatalities column for this row. The value is \"0 / 108.\" This indicates that there were 0 fatalities out of a total of 108 people on board. \n\nThe claim says the number of fatalities is unknown. However, according to the table, it's explicitly stated as 0 / 108. Therefore, the number of fatalities isn't unknown; it's specifically zero.\n\nSince the claim incorrectly states that the fatalities are unknown for this aircraft, the statement must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
