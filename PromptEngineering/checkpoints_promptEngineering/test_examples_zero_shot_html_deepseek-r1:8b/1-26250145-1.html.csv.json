    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"didi benami sing the song choice angel before lean on me\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two songs: \"angel\" and \"lean on me.\" The claim says Didi Benami sang \"angel\" before \"lean on me.\" So, I need to check if these performances occurred in that order in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week or category. The relevant columns for this analysis are \"song choice,\" which tells us what song was performed, and \"original artist,\" indicating who sang it.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Week: audition**\n   - Song Choice: hey jude\n   - Original Artist: the beatles\n\n2. **Week: hollywood (first solo)**\n   - Song Choice: terrified\n   - Original Artist: katharine mcphee\n\n3. **Week: hollywood (group performance)**\n   - Song Choice: no one\n   - Original Artist: alicia keys\n\n4. **Week: hollywood (second solo)**\n   - Song Choice: angel\n   - Original Artist: sarah mclachlan\n\n5. **Top 24 (12 women)**\n   - Song Choice: the way i am\n   - Original Artist: ingrid michaelson\n\n6. **Top 20 (10 women)**\n   - Song Choice: lean on me\n   - Original Artist: bill withers\n\n7. **Top 16 (8 women)**\n   - Song Choice: rhiannon\n   - Original Artist: fleetwood mac\n\n8. **Top 12**\n   - Song Choice: play with fire\n   - Original Artist: the rolling stones\n\n9. **Top 11**\n   - Song Choice: you 're no good\n   - Original Artist: betty everett\n\nNow, let's identify where \"angel\" and \"lean on me\" appear.\n\n- \"Angel\" is in row 4 (row_index: 3), sung by Sarah Mclachlan.\n- \"Lean on Me\" is in row 6 (row_index: 5), sung by Bill WITHERS.\n\nThe claim states that Didi Benami sang \"angel\" before \"lean on me.\" Looking at the row indices, \"angel\" is in row 3 and \"lean on me\" is in row 5. So yes, \"angel\" comes before \"lean on me.\"\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim mentions \"didi benami,\" but looking at the table, I don't see any rows where the original artist is Didi Benami. All the artists listed are different: The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah Mclachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill WITHERS, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Betty Everett. None of these are Didi Benami.\n\nSo even though \"angel\" is performed by Sarah Mclachlan before \"lean on me,\" the original artist in both cases isn't Didi Benami. Therefore, the claim might be false because Didi Benami isn't listed as the performer for either song.\n\nWait again\u2014am I sure? Let me double-check each row:\n\nLooking at each \"original artist\" column:\n\n- Row 0: the beatles\n- Row1: katharine mcphee\n- Row2: alicia keys\n- Row3: sarah mclachlan (sings angel)\n- Row4: ingrid michaelson\n- Row5: bill withers (leans on me)\n- Rows after that don't have these songs.\n\nSo, no Didi Benami anywhere. Therefore, the claim is false because she didn't perform either song in the given context.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Didi Benami singing \"angel\" before \"lean on me,\" but the table shows neither song was performed by her. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"no one be not the last song choice for didi benami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that \"no one\" was not the last song choice for Didi Benami. So I need to check if in the table there's a row where \"no one\" is listed as the song choice and whether it's the last one. But wait, the table has several columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result.\n\nI'll start by looking for any rows where the song choice is \"no one\". Scanning through each row:\n\n1. The first row has \"hey jude\" as the song choice.\n2. The second and third rows have \"terrified\" and \"no one\", respectively, but not in this context.\n3. The fourth row's song choice is \"angel\".\n4. Then, the top 24, top 20, etc., rows list different songs like \"the way I am\", \"lean on me\", \"rhiannon\", etc.\n\nWait a minute, I see that in the second row, it says the song choice is \"no one\" for the Hollywood group performance by Alicia Keys. But that's not the last row. The last row before the end is top 11 with \"you're no good\".\n\nHold on, the claim is about Didi Benami specifically. So I should look for any rows where the original artist is Didi Benami. Looking through each row:\n\n- The first row has the Beatles.\n- Second and third have Katharine McPhee and Alicia Keys.\n- Fourth: Sarah Mclachlan.\n- Top 24, 20, 16, 12, 11: none of these seem to be Didi Benami.\n\nWait, I might have missed a row. Let me go through each row again:\n\n1. Week: audition, theme: auditor's choice, song choice: hey jude, artist: Beatles.\n2. Hollywood, first solo: terrified, Katharine McPhee.\n3. Hollywood, group performance: no one, Alicia Keys.\n4. Hollywood, second solo: angel, Sarah Mclachlan.\n5. Top 24 (12 women): billboard hits, Ingrid Michaelson.\n6. Top 20: Lean on Me, Bill Wither's.\n7. Top 16: rhiannon, Fleetwood Mac.\n8. Top 12: Play with Fire, Rolling Stones.\n9. Top 11: you're no good, Betty Everett.\n\nI don't see any Didi Benami mentioned in the original artist column. So perhaps there is no row where she is involved. If that's the case, then talking about her song choice wouldn't be possible because she isn't present in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check each row again for Didi Benami. No, none of the original artists are Didi Benami. So if the claim is about her song choices, there's no relevant data here. Therefore, the claim can't be verified as TRUE because she isn't present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is implying that \"no one\" was not chosen last by her, but without any of her rows, it's impossible to confirm or deny. So the answer would have to be FALSE because there's no evidence supporting the claim based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Didi Benami's song choices, but she isn't listed in the table's original artists column. Without her involvement, the claim can't be validated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"didi benami be number 5 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women)\".\n\nFirst, I should look through the table for any mention of Didi Benami. But looking at the 'original artist' column, I don't see her name there. The original artists listed are The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah Mclachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Wither, Fleetwood Mac, and The Rolling Stones. None of these are Didi Benami.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"number 5 in order\" for two specific weeks: top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women). I need to check these rows to see if any have an order number of 5.\n\nLooking at the row for 'top 20 (10 women)', the order is listed as 5. The song is \"lean on Me\" by Bill Wither. So in this row, the order is indeed 5.\n\nNow, checking the 'top 16 (8 women)' row: the order is also 5, and the song is \"rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac. So both specified weeks have an order of 5.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"didi benami be number 5 in order\". Since Didi Benami isn't listed as the original artist for either of these weeks, this part doesn't hold. The numbers do match, but the artists don't involve her.\n\nSo, the claim is making a connection between Didi Benami being number 5 and these two weeks, which isn't supported by the table because she isn't present in those rows. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates Didi Benami with specific weeks where she isn't listed as the original artist.

The claim is: \"the way i am be one of 3 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. Song Title: \"the way i am\"\n2. Theme/Category: \"billboard hot 100 hits\"\n3. Number of Choices: 3\n4. It's a song choice.\n\nSo, looking at the table provided, I need to find if \"the way i am\" appears in any row where the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\", and whether it's one of three song choices.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. The first row after the header is about \"audition\" with \"hey jude\". Not relevant.\n2. Next, \"hollywood\" category with different themes like \"first solo\", etc. None mention billboard hot 100 hits.\n3. Then \"top 24 (12 women)\" row: theme is billboard hot 100 hits, song choice is \"the way i am\". So that's one instance.\n4. Next, \"top 20 (10 women)\": song is \"lean on me\", not relevant.\n5. \"top 16 (8 women)\": song is \"rhiannon\".\n6. \"top 12\": different theme and song.\n7. \"top 11\": again a different song.\n\nWait, so in the \"top 24\" row, there's only one instance of \"the way i am\". The claim says it should be one of three choices. So does that mean we're missing two other entries?\n\nLooking back at the table, I don't see any other rows where both \"billboard hot 100 hits\" is the theme and \"the way i am\" is the song choice. There's only one occurrence.\n\nTherefore, since there are not three instances of \"the way i am\" under \"billboard hot 100 hits\", the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that \"the way i am\" appears once as a song choice with the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits\".

This song was sung during a week that had a Hollywood theme.\n\nSo I need to check if there's any row in the table where the song choice is \"terrified\" and the corresponding week has a theme related to Hollywood.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week with various themes. The relevant columns for this claim are \"song choice\" and \"theme.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Song choice is \"hey jude,\" so not relevant.\nRow 1: Theme is \"first solo.\" The song is \"terrified.\" So the theme here doesn't mention Hollywood, but it's about a solo performance. So no, not a Hollywood theme week.\nRow 2: Theme is \"group performance,\" song is \"no one.\" Not relevant.\nRow 3: Song is \"angel,\" so not \"terrified.\"\nRow 4: Week is \"top 24 (12 women),\" theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" song is \"the way I am.\" Not relevant.\nRow 5: Song is \"lean on me,\" no.\nRow 6: Song is \"rhiannon,\" nope.\nRow 7: Theme is \"the rolling stones,\" so not Hollywood, but let's note that this week has a theme of \"the rolling stones\" and the song is \"play with fire.\" So no.\nRow 8: Theme is \"billboard 1 hits,\" song is \"you're no good.\" Not relevant.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me check again for any row where both conditions are met. The claim says the song is \"terrified\" and it was in a Hollywood-themed week.\n\nLooking back at Row 1: theme is \"first solo,\" song is \"terrified.\" So that's one possible candidate because the song is \"terrified.\" But the theme isn't Hollywood; it's about a solo performance. So does this row meet both conditions? No, because the theme doesn't align with Hollywood.\n\nIs there any other row where the song choice is \"terrified\" and the theme is related to Hollywood?

It seems like it's a statement about someone named Didi Benami singing a song called \"no one\" before performing \"hey jude.\" So, I need to check if there are any entries in the table that support this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week or event, with columns for theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result.

None of them mention \"no one\" as the song choice.\n- Rows 5 to 9 have different themes and song choices. \n\nWait, in row 0, it's labeled as \"audition,\" with the theme as \"auditioner's choice,\" song choice is \"hey jude,\" original artist \"the beatles.\" That doesn't match.\n\nThen, looking for any row where \"no one\" is the song choice.

Looking at the table, I see that it's about some sort of performance weeks with themes and song choices. Each row has a week name, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result.\n\nFirst, I should identify where Didi Benami might be mentioned in the table. Scanning through each row's \"original artist\" column: the Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah Mclachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Betty Everett. I don't see Didi Benami listed here.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to a specific week or context not directly in the table? Or perhaps it's about the song choices. Let me check each row for any mention of \"no one\" as a song choice.\n\nLooking through the \"song choice\" column: hey jude, terrified, no one, angel, the way I am, lean on me, rhiannon, play with fire, you're no good. Oh, there's a row where the song choice is \"no one.\" That's in the third row under Hollywood week.\n\nSo that row has \"order\" as n/a and result as advanced.

Or perhaps it's about the order.\n\nIn that specific row, the order is n/a. If we're considering the order as the position in the performance, maybe \"no one\" being chosen as the last song would imply a certain order number. But without Didi Benami being listed, I'm not sure how they are connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is suggesting that in some context, no one was chosen last by Didi Benami.

Now, I need to check if she's mentioned elsewhere that might relate to her order number. Looking at the 'song choice' column:\n\nIn week 'top 20 (10 women)', the song is 'Lean on Me' by Bill Withers. In 'top 16', it's 'Rhiannon' by Fleetwood Mac. None of these are Didi Benami.\n\nThe claim mentions \"order for both weeks.\" So, perhaps she was in both top 20 and top 16 weeks?

Let me see: For week 'top 24 (12 women)', the song is 'The Way I Am' by Ingrid Michaelson. In top 20, it's Bill Withers. In top 16, Fleetwood Mac.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Didi Benami is someone else in the process, like a contestant number. But looking at the order column:\n\n- Top 24: n/a\n- Top 20: 5\n- Top 16:5\n\nBut since Didi isn't an original artist here, maybe she's in another role. However, I don't see her name in any relevant columns. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no evidence of her being number 4 in either week.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

It mentions a song called \"the way i am\" being one of five song choices under the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits.\"\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column for \"theme\" and another for \"song choice.\" My task is to check if any row has both \"the way i am\" in the \"song choice\" column and \"billboard hot 100 hits\" in the \"theme\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first row mentions \"hey jude\" as the song choice, so that's not it.\n2. Next is \"terrified,\" then \"no one,\" then \"angel.\" None of these are \"the way i am.\"\n3. Moving down, the rows mention different themes like \"first solo,\" \"group performance,\" and \"second solo,\" but again, no \"billboard hot 100 hits\" theme.\n4. The top 24 row: theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" song choice is \"the way i am.\" Wait, that's exactly what the claim says!\n5. Then there are more rows with \"billboard hot 100 hits\" as the theme but different song choices like \"lean on me\" and \"rhiannon.\"\n6. The next few rows have themes like \"the rolling stones\" and \"billboard 1 hits,\" which don't apply here.\n\nSo, the relevant row is the top 24 one where both conditions are met: the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\" and the song choice is \"the way i am.\" This directly supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows a row where \"the way i am\" is listed as the song choice under the \"billboard hot 100 hits\" theme, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme.\" Wait, that seems a bit confusing. The user probably meant to say that \"terrified\" is one of the songs she sang during a week with a Bollywood theme. But I should check if \"terrified\" appears as a song choice and whether that week had a Bollywood theme.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week, with details like the theme, song choice, original artist, etc. My goal is to find rows where the theme is Bollywood and see if \"terrified\" is listed under \"song choice.\"\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. The first few rows have themes like \"audition,\" \"hollywood,\" etc., but none mention Bollywood.\n2. Then I see a row with \"top 24 (12 women)\" and the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits.\" That's not Bollywood.\n3. Next, \"top 20 (10 women)\" also has \"billboard hot 100 hits.\"\n4. The \"top 16 (8 women)\" row again mentions \"billboard hot 100 hits.\"\n5. Then there's a row for \"top 12\" with theme \"the rolling stones.\"\n6. Finally, the \"top 11\" row is about \"billboard 1 hits.\"\n\nNone of these themes are Bollywood. So I need to check if any week had a Bollywood theme. If not, then \"terrified\" couldn't have been sung in such a week.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row? Let me scan again. No, all the themes listed are different from Bollywood. For example, \"group performance,\" \"first solo,\" \"second solo,\" \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" \"the rolling stones,\" and \"billboard 1 hits.\" None of these are Bollywood.\n\nSo since there's no week with a Bollywood theme in this table, any song performed during such a week wouldn't be listed here. Therefore, the claim that \"terrified\" was sung in a week with a Bollywood theme is false because there's no evidence of a Bollywood-themed week in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if any row indicates a Bollywood theme and if \"terrified\" is listed as a song choice.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Bollywood Theme**: None of the rows explicitly mention Bollywood as the theme.\n2. **Check for Song \"Terrified\"**: Since no rows have a Bollywood theme, there's no relevant data to confirm or deny the claim.\n\nSince no relevant cells support the claim, it is deemed false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
