    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. The key points are:\n\n1. Adelaide United plays.\n2. They play in front of a specific number of people (25,039).\n3. These people are at Adelaide Oval.\n\nSo I need to check if these elements are all present and accurate in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game that Adelaide United played. The columns include details like the date, opponents, stadium name, attendance numbers, etc.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Adelaide oval\" because that's one of the specific venues mentioned in the claim. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 18: Date is December 28, 2007. Opponent is Sydney FC. Stadium is Adelaide Oval. Attendance is 25,039.\n\nThat seems to match up exactly with the first part of the claim about the venue and attendance. Now, I need to ensure that Adelaide United actually played on that date at Adelaide Oval against Sydney FC.\n\nLooking at row 18:\n\n- The \"Team\" column for this row is \"adelaide united\".\n- Opponent is \"sydney fc\".\n- Stadium: \"adelaide oval\".\n- Attendance: 25,039.\n\nAll the details in row 18 align perfectly with the claim. So there's no discrepancy here; everything checks out.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where Adelaide Oval was the venue and attendance was around 25k, but from a quick glance, row 18 is the only one that matches both the venue and the exact crowd number mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table, specifically row 18, the claim must be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"Adelaide United play in front of 10256 crowd in Hindmarsh Stadium on November 18.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and map it to the table columns.\n\n1. **Club**: Adelaide United.\n   - Looking through the table, all rows list \"adelaide united\" as the club, so this is correct.\n\n2. **Event Location**: Hindmarsh Stadium.\n   - Scanning each row's 'Stadium' column: Rows 0-20 mention various stadiums. I need to find the one on November 18.\n   - November 18 corresponds to row index 13. Checking row 13, the stadium is indeed \"hindmarsh stadium.\"\n\n3. **Crowd Size**: 10256.\n   - Looking at row 13's 'Revenue' column (assuming Revenue refers to attendance), it shows 10256.\n\n4. **Date**: November 18, 2007.\n   - The date in the claim is November 18, but looking at the table, the exact date for row 13 is November 18, 2007.\n\nSince all these points match exactly in the table, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE and verified by checking the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is that \"Sydney FC play at Adelaide Oval.\" I need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. Sydney FC is a football club from Sydney, and Adelaide Oval is a stadium in Adelaide. The claim is stating that they play their matches at this specific venue.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like the date, home team, away team, and venue. My task is to check if there's any match where Sydney FC plays against another team at Adelaide Oval.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 0**: November 2007. Home team is Melbourne Victory vs Adelaide United. Not Sydney FC.\n- **Row 1**: December 2007. Away team is Sydney FC, but the venue is Telstra Dome in Melbourne. Not Adelaide Oval.\n- **Row 2**: January 2008. Home team is Newcastle Jets vs Adelaide United. No Sydney FC here.\n- **Row 3**: January 2008. Perth Glory plays Adelaide United at Members Equity Stadium. Still not Sydney FC or Adelaide Oval.\n\nWait, I might have missed something earlier. Let me double-check the venues. The claim mentions Adelaide Oval specifically, so I need to look for that venue in the table. Scanning through all rows:\n\n- Most games are either at Hindmarsh Stadium, Westpac Stadium, Telstra Dome, or Members Equity Stadium.\n- In row 18 (December 2007), the venue is Adelaide Oval when Sydney FC plays against Sydney FC? Wait, no. The home team is Sydney FC, but looking closely, the away team is also Sydney FC. That can't be right because they can't play against themselves.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in row 18. Let me check again:\n\nRow 18: December 2007. Adelaide United vs Sydney FC at Adelaide Oval. Oh! Here it is. The home team is Adelaide United, the away team is Sydney FC, and the venue is Adelaide Oval. So this matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, there's a match where Sydney FC plays against Adelaide United at Adelaide Oval, which supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify if \"Sydney FC play at Adelaide Oval,\" we look for any row where Sydney FC is listed as either the home or away team with Adelaide Oval as the venue. \n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Row 18** (December 2007): Adelaide United (home) vs Sydney FC (away) at Adelaide Oval.\n\nThis direct match confirms that Sydney FC does play at Adelaide Oval.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
