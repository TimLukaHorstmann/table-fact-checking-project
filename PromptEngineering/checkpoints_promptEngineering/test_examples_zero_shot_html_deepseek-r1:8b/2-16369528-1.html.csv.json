    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1998, n / a win the lifetime achievement award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns for this claim seem to be 'year', 'best teenage/young adult', and 'lifetime achievement'. The 'reader's vote' and 'best non-fiction' might not be directly related here.\n\nThe claim mentions 1998 specifically. So I should find the row corresponding to 1998. Scanning through, I see that row is in position 3 (since it starts from 0, but let me double-check). Wait, looking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: 1996\n- Row 1: 1997\n- Row 2: 1998\nYes, so row_index is 2.\n\nNow, I need to look at the 'lifetime achievement' column for this row. According to the table, in 1998, the cell under 'lifetime achievement' is empty, marked as 'na'. So there's no author or winner listed here.\n\nThe claim says that \"n/a\" won the lifetime achievement award in 1998. However, in the table, for 1998, the 'best teenage/young adult' column is also 'na', but 'lifetime achievement' is also 'na'. Wait, but the claim refers to \"n/a win\", which implies that someone named n/a received the award. But in reality, since both are 'na', maybe there's no winner listed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The table has a column for each category: best teenage/young adult, reader's vote, best non-fiction, and lifetime achievement. For 1998, all except lifetime achievement have 'na'. But in the row for 1998, the 'lifetime achievement' is also 'na', meaning no one received it that year.\n\nSo the claim is stating that \"n/a\" won the lifetime achievement award in 1998. But since there's a specific column for 'lifetime achievement', and in 1998, the cell under that column is 'na', which typically stands for not applicable or not available. So perhaps no one won it in 1998.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no entry for a winner in the 'lifetime achievement' column for 1998.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"n/a\" received the lifetime achievement award in 1998. However, the table shows both 'best teenage/young adult' and 'lifetime achievement' columns as 'na', indicating no specific winner that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells from the table that support or refute the claim.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"there be 3 year show when the reader 's vote be na and the lifetime achievement be na.\" Hmm, there's some possible confusion here. The user might mean that in three consecutive years (maybe 1996, 1997, 1998), both the 'reader's vote' and 'lifetime achievement' columns have 'na' values.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to examine each row from 1996 onwards to see where both 'reader's vote' and 'lifetime achievement' are marked as 'na'. \n\nStarting with 1996: 'reader's vote' is 'na', but 'lifetime achievement' has a name (Jon Cleary). So this year doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nNext, 1997: 'reader's vote' is 'na', but 'lifetime achievement' lists Alan Yates. Again, only one column meets the condition.\n\nIn 1998, both columns are 'na'. That's one year that fits. Then in 1999, 'reader's vote' is 'na', but 'lifetime achievement' has a name again. Similarly, from 2000 onwards, either one or none of the columns meet the condition.\n\nWait, so only 1998 meets both conditions. The claim mentions \"3 year show\", implying three years where both are 'na'. But according to the table, only one year (1998) satisfies this. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's stating there are three such years when in fact only one exists.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to list the rows and columns for 1996, 1997, and 1998 where both 'reader's vote' and 'lifetime achievement' are 'na'. Only 1998 meets this, so that's the only cell needed. However, since the claim refers to three years, but only one qualifies, I should include all rows from 1996 to 2002 just in case there were more instances beyond what's visible here.\n\nWait, perhaps the user might have meant any three consecutive or non-consecutive years where both columns are 'na'. From the table provided, only 1998 fits. But maybe I should check each row for the condition. Let me go through each year:\n\n- 1996: reader vote na, lifetime achievement not na.\n- 1997: same as above.\n- 1998: both na \u2192 count =1\n- 1999: only one is na.\n- Similarly, from 2000 onwards, mostly 'na' in both columns but with exceptions.\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nAfter 1998, in 2000 to 2010, some have 'na' in both. Let me check each row from 1996 onward up to 2011:\n\n- 1996: reader vote na (yes), lifetime achievement not na.\n- 1997: same as above.\n- 1998: both na \u2192 count =1\n- 1999: no\n- 2000: no\n- 2001: only one is na (reader's vote)\n- 2002: reader's vote is non-na, lifetime achievement is 'patrick gallagher' \u2192 no\nWait, in 2002, the columns are:\n\nReader's vote: apartment 255 by bunty avieson (not na), so both not na.\n\nWait, wait. Let me correct that. In row 2001, reader's vote is 'bleeding hearts...' which is non-na, and lifetime achievement is 'professor stephen knight' \u2192 both are filled.\n\nIn row 2002: reader's vote is 'apartment 255 by bunty avieson', which is non-na; lifetime achievement is 'patrick gallagher' \u2192 both not na.\n\nWait, so I think the only year where both are 'na' is 1998. So if the claim says there are three such years, it's false because only one exists.\n\nBut perhaps I need to check beyond 2011? The table provided goes up to row index 15 (assuming each year from 1996 to 2011). Let me see:\n\nLooking at rows 0-15:\n\nRow 0: 1996 \u2192 both not.\nRow 1: 1997 \u2192 both not.\nRow 2: 1998 \u2192 both na \u2192 count=1\nRow 3: 1999 \u2192 both not.\nRow 4: 2000 \u2192 both not? Wait, in row 4, reader's vote is 'na', and lifetime achievement is 'na'? Let me check:\n\nWait, the table provided is a bit unclear. Each row seems to represent a year, but I can't see all the columns. For example, for 1996, 'reader's vote' is 'na', and 'lifetime achievement' is 'Jon Cleary'.\n\nSimilarly, in 2000, perhaps both are 'na'? Let me check each row:\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list each year and check both columns.\n\n- 1996: reader's vote na, lifetime achievement not.\n- 1997: same as above.\n- 1998: both na \u2192 count=1\n- 1999: no\n- 2000: Let me see, in row 4 (assuming 2000), 'reader's vote' is 'na', and 'lifetime achievement' might be 'na' or not. But without seeing the exact data, I can't be certain beyond what's shown.\n\nBut given the table provided, only 1998 has both columns as 'na'. So if the claim says three years, that's false. Therefore, answer is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells would be all rows where both are 'na', which is only row 2 (1998). But since the claim refers to three years, perhaps I should list all rows from 1996 to 2011 in case there were more instances beyond what's visible here. However, based on the table given, only 1998 fits.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, the user might have meant any three years where both are 'na', regardless of being consecutive or not. So I need to check all rows up to row index 15 (2011) for instances where both columns are 'na'.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 1996 \u2192 both? Reader vote na, lifetime achievement not.\nRow 1: 1997 \u2192 same as above.\nRow 2: 1998 \u2192 both na \u2192 count=1\nRow 3: 1999 \u2192 reader's vote na, but lifetime achievement not.\nRow 4: 2000 \u2192 reader's vote na? Let me check the columns:\n\nFrom the table provided earlier (which I can't see in full), for row 4 (2000):\n\nColumns: 'reader's vote' and 'lifetime achievement'. If both are 'na', that would be another count.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each row up to row 15 for where both columns are 'na'.\n\nBut without the exact table data beyond what was initially provided, it's hard. However, from the initial rows shown:\n\n- Rows 0: 1996 \u2192 both not.\n- Row 1: 1997 \u2192 both not.\n- Row 2: 1998 \u2192 both na \u2192 count=1\n- Row 3: 1999 \u2192 reader vote na, but lifetime achievement not.\n- Row 4: 2000 \u2192 reader's vote is 'na', lifetime achievement is 'na'? Let me check:\n\nIn the table provided earlier, row 4 (2000) shows both columns as 'na'?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says that for row 4, column 'reader's vote' is 'na' and 'lifetime achievement' is 'Jon Cleary'? No, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only row 2 (1998) has both columns as 'na'. Therefore, if the claim states there are three years where both are 'na', but in reality only one exists, then it's FALSE.\n\nHence, the relevant cells would be all rows where both columns are 'na' \u2192 which is only row 2. However, since the user mentioned \"three year show\", I think they're referring to three instances. So perhaps I need to list all rows where both are 'na'.\n\nBut given that only row 2 meets this, the answer would be FALSE.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON, I'll include all relevant cells where both columns are 'na' \u2192 which is just row 2 (index 2), and columns 'reader's vote' and 'lifetime achievement'.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"reader's vote\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"}]}",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"after 2005, the winner of the lifetime achievement award be andrew rule john silvester , sandra harvey lindsay simpson , marele day , shane maloney , and peter doyle.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has a column called \"lifetime achievement\" which lists the winners for each year from 1996 to 2011. My task is to check if after 2005, specifically starting from 2006 onwards, the winners mentioned in the claim are correctly listed.\n\nThe relevant years to check are 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 because the claim says \"after 2005.\" So I need to look at each of these rows and see if the \"lifetime achievement\" column matches any of the names in the claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2006: Andrew Rule and John Silvester\n- 2007: Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson\n- 2008: Marele Day\n- 2009: Shane Maloney\n- 2010: Peter Doyle\n- 2011: No winner listed (na)\n\nNow, comparing these winners to the claim:\n\nThe claim lists Andrew Rule John Silvester, Sandra Harvey Lindsay Simpson, Marele Day, Shane Maloney, and Peter Doyle. \n\nI'll check each relevant cell in the table to see if they match any part of the claim.\n\nFor 2006: The winners are Andrew Rule and John Silvester. The claim includes \"andrew rule john silvester\" as a single entity. However, in the table, it's split into two names. But since the cell contains both names together, it matches the claim's first part.\n\nFor 2007: Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson are listed together. This exactly matches the second part of the claim.\n\nFor 2008: Marele Day is listed alone. The claim includes \"marele day,\" so this matches as well.\n\nFor 2009: Shane Maloney is listed, which matches the next part of the claim.\n\nFor 2010: Peter Doyle is listed, matching the last part of the claim.\n\n2011 has na, so it doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, all the winners from 2006 to 2010 in the \"lifetime achievement\" column match exactly with the names listed in the claim. The only year not covered is 2005, but since the claim says \"after 2005,\" we don't need to check that. \n\nSo, each of these relevant cells supports the claim.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"na win the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that 'na' (which probably stands for \"not available\" or missing data) wins the \"lifetime achievement\" award only after the year 1998. So I need to check if there are any entries in the \"lifetime achievement\" column where the year is 1998 or later and the value is 'na'. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific year from 1996 onwards. The \"lifetime achievement\" column has values like names (Jon Cleary, Alan Yates, etc.) but also some 'na's. I need to find rows where the year is >=1998 and the \"lifetime achievement\" is 'na'.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n- 1996: 'na' in lifetime achievement? Yes, but the year is before 1998.\n- 1997: 'na', year is before 1998.\n- 1998: Check if 'na' in lifetime. From the table, 1998 has 'na' in that column. So this row meets both conditions: year >=1998 and 'na'.\n- 1999: 'na' but year is after 1998, so it also meets.\n- 2000: 'na', same here.\n- 2001: 'bleeding hearts...' not 'na'.\n- 2002: 'blue murder...' not 'na'.\n- 2003: 'na', yes, and year is 2003 >=1998.\n- Similarly, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 all have 'na' in lifetime achievement with years after 1998.\n\nSo from 1998 onwards, there are multiple instances where the \"lifetime achievement\" is 'na'. The claim says that 'na' wins this only after 1998. But wait, in 1996 and 1997, 'na' was also present but for those years it's before 1998. However, the claim specifically mentions that they win only after 1998, implying that 'na' does not occur before that.\n\nWait, but if 'na' appears as early as 1996, then the statement isn't fully accurate because 'na' was present before 1998. But perhaps the claim is saying that starting from 1998 onwards, 'na' occurs. So let me clarify.\n\nThe exact wording is: \"na win the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998.\" This could mean two things: either that prior to 1998, 'na' did not win, or that from 1998 onwards, 'na' starts winning. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nBefore 1998 (i.e., 1996 and 1997), in the \"lifetime achievement\" column, we have Jon Cleary and Alan Yates. So those are actual wins by named individuals. Then starting from 1998, we see 'na's: 1998 has 'na', then 2003, etc.\n\nSo the pattern is that before 1998, the \"lifetime achievement\" was not 'na'; it was filled with names. Starting in 1998, the entry becomes 'na'. Therefore, the claim might be correct because from 1998 onwards, 'na' is present, but prior to that, it wasn't.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"only after the year 1998\", which could imply that before 1998, 'na' did not exist in that column. From the table, that's true\u2014before 1998, the entries are actual names, so 'na' isn't present until 1998 and onwards.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because starting from 1998, 'na' appears in the \"lifetime achievement\" column, and prior to that, it wasn't present. So the relevant cells would be all rows where year >=1998 and the column is \"lifetime achievement\".\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if 'na' appears only after 1998 in the \"lifetime achievement\" column.\n\n1. **Identify Rows**: We look for rows with a year >=1998.\n2. **Check Column Data**: For each of these rows, examine the \"lifetime achievement\" value.\n3. **Determine 'na' Presence**: Confirm if the value is 'na'.\n\nAfter checking, from 1998 onwards, the \"lifetime achievement\" column contains 'na'. Before 1998, it doesn't.\n\n**Answer**: TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells**: All rows starting from year 1998 in \"lifetime achievement\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"na only win the reader's vote in 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"na only win the reader's vote in 2011.\" From the context of the table, \"na\" stands for \"not available,\" which typically means that data isn't provided or applicable for that specific year and category.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: year, best teenage/young adult, reader's vote, best non-fiction, and lifetime achievement. The rows represent different years from 1996 to 2011. Each cell in these rows provides information (or lack thereof) for each category.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim, it specifically mentions \"reader's vote\" and the year \"2011.\" So I should look at the \"reader's vote\" column for the year 2011. According to the table, in 2011, the \"reader's vote\" cell is marked as \"na.\" That means there was no available data or winner listed for that category in that particular year.\n\nThe claim states that \"na only win the reader's vote in 2011,\" which implies that in 2011, \"na\" is the sole winner of the reader's vote. However, since \"na\" indicates the absence of data, it doesn't mean that \"na\" actually won anything. Instead, it just means there was no winner recorded for that year.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might be relevant. For example, are there any other years where \"reader's vote\" is \"na,\" or does \"na\" appear in another column that might affect the claim? But since the claim specifically mentions 2011 and the \"reader's vote,\" only the cell for 2011 in that column is directly related.\n\nSo, considering all this, the claim isn't supported by the data because \"na\" doesn't indicate a win; it indicates missing information. Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the table shows \"na\" in the reader's vote for 2011, indicating no data, not a win.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"reader 's vote\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Andrew Rule, John Silverster, Sandra Harvey Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day be the only 1 [sic] to win the lifetime achievement when 'NA' wins the best - non fiction and reader 's vote after the year 2005.\"\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It says that Andrew Rule, John Silverster, Sandra Harvey Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day are the only ones to have won the lifetime achievement award when \"NA\" wins both the best non-fiction and reader's vote after 2005.\n\nHmm, so the claim is saying that these four individuals are the sole recipients of the lifetime achievement award under specific conditions. But looking at the table, I see that the 'lifetime achievement' column lists names of people who won it each year. For years after 2005, let's check:\n\nLooking through the table rows starting from 2006 onwards:\n\n- 2006: Andrew Rule and John Silvester\n- 2007: Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson\n- 2008: Marele Day\n- 2009: Shane Maloney\n- 2010: Peter Doyle\n- 2011: No winner listed.\n\nWait, so in 2006, both Andrew Rule and John Silvester won. In 2007, Sandra and Lindsay won together. In 2008, only Marele Day. Then others like Shane Maloney, Peter Doyle, and no winner in 2011.\n\nThe claim says that these four are the only ones to have won when 'NA' wins best non-fiction and reader's vote after 2005. But looking at the table, in some years where 'NA' might have won, but others also won together or alone. For example, in 2006, Andrew and John both won. So that doesn't fit because it's not only one person winning.\n\nAlso, in 2007, Sandra and Lindsay are two people, so again, more than one winner. The claim says \"the only 1,\" which might be a typo meaning 'one' or 'a single.' If it means exactly one person wins, then in 2006, there were two, which would disprove the claim.\n\nMoreover, the claim mentions that this happens when 'NA' wins best non-fiction and reader's vote. From the table, let's check the 'best non - fiction' column:\n\nLooking for cells where 'best non - fiction' is not 'na':\n\n- 1997: \"how to write crime edited by marele day\"\n- 2001: \"bleeding hearts by lindy cameron\"\n- 2002: \"blue murder by ken catran\"\n- 2003: \"apartment 255 by bunty avieson\"\n\nWait, so starting from 1997, some years have non-NA entries. The claim says after 2005. Let's check from 2006 onwards:\n\n2006: no entry\n2007: no entry\n2008: no entry\n2009: no entry\n2010: no entry\n2011: no entry\n\nWait, actually, in the 'best non - fiction' column for years after 2005, it's mostly NA except for specific ones. For example:\n\n- 2006: NA\n- 2007: NA\n- 2008: NA\n- 2009: NA\n- 2010: NA\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table provided, I think I might have misread it. The 'best non - fiction' column seems to have data only for certain years:\n\n1997: how to write crime...\n2001: bleeding hearts...\n2002: blue murder...\n2003: apartment 255...\n\nOther years after 2005, like 2006 onwards, the 'best non - fiction' is NA. So, after 2005, in the relevant years (from 2006 onwards), the best non-fiction is NA except for those four specific years where it's not.\n\nBut according to the table, from 2006 onwards, only 2006, 2007, etc., have 'NA' in 'best non - fiction'. Wait, actually, looking at the columns:\n\nIn the table, each year has three columns: 'year', 'best non - fiction', and 'reader's vote'.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow for 2006:\n- Year: 2006\n- best non - fiction: NA\n- reader's vote: NA\n\nSo, in years after 2005 (like 2006, 2007, etc.), the 'best non - fiction' is NA. So, when does 'NA' win both 'best non - fiction' and 'reader's vote'? It seems that for these post-2005 years, both columns are NA, which presumably means they won.\n\nBut wait, in 2006: best non - fiction and reader's vote are both NA, so 'NA' wins. Similarly for 2007, etc.\n\nSo the claim is saying that when 'NA' wins both after 2005, only those four individuals (Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey Lindsay Simpson, Marele Day) win the lifetime achievement. But in reality, looking at the table:\n\n- In 2006: Andrew and John won.\n- In 2007: Sandra and Lindsay won.\n- In 2008: Marele alone won.\n- 2009: Shane Maloney\n- 2010: Peter Doyle\n\nSo, each time when 'NA' wins both, multiple people win the lifetime achievement. For example, in 2006, two winners; 2007, two winners; 2008, one winner (Marele). So the claim that only those four are the only ones to have won is incorrect because other individuals also won in those years.\n\nMoreover, the claim seems to suggest that these four are the only ones who ever win after 2005 when 'NA' wins both categories. But in reality, Shane Maloney and Peter Doyle also won in those same conditions (i.e., 'NA' winning both) without being part of the mentioned group.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because other individuals besides Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day have won the lifetime achievement when 'NA' wins both categories after 2005.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because multiple individuals, including Shane Maloney and Peter Doyle, also received the lifetime achievement award in years when 'NA' won both categories. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2006,\n      \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2007,\n      \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2008,\n      \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"there be over 3 times when the reader 's vote be not n/a and the lifetime achievement be also na.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It's saying that there are more than three instances where both the \"reader's vote\" column and the \"lifetime achievement\" column have values that are not \"na\". So my task is to go through each row of the table and check these two columns.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has a row for each year from 1996 to 2011. For each year, there's a value in the \"reader's vote\" column and the \"lifetime achievement\" column. My focus is on checking when both of these are not 'na'.\n\nI'll start by going through each row:\n\n- 1996: \"reader's vote\" is na, \"lifetime achievement\" is Jon Cleary (not na). So only one column is filled; both aren't non-na.\n- 1997: Both columns have values. \"Reader's vote\" is a book title, and \"lifetime achievement\" is Alan Yates. So both are not na here. That's the first time.\n- 1998: Both are na. Doesn't count.\n- 1999: \"reader's vote\" is na; doesn't matter since only one column is filled.\n- 2000: Both are na.\n- 2001: \"reader's vote\" has a book, so it's not na. \"Lifetime achievement\" is a name, also not na. So that's the second time both are non-na.\n- 2002: \"reader's vote\" is another book (so not na), and \"lifetime achievement\" is Patrick Gallagher. That's the third time both are non-na.\n- 2003 to 2009: Let me check each:\n  - 2003: Both are na, so no.\n  - 2004: Both are na.\n  - 2005: Both are na.\n  - 2006: \"reader's vote\" is na; doesn't matter.\n  - 2007: Both are na.\n  - 2008: \"reader's vote\" is na, but \"lifetime achievement\" has a name. Only one column is filled.\n  - 2009: Both are na except \"reader's vote\".\n- 2010: \"reader's vote\" is na; doesn't matter.\n- 2011: Both are na.\n\nSo the instances where both columns are not na are:\n\n1997 (row index 1), 2001 (row index 5), and 2002 (row index 6). That makes three times. The claim says \"over 3 times,\" which means more than three, so it's asking if there are four or more instances.\n\nBut wait, in the table, I only found three instances where both columns are not na. So the claim is saying that there are over 3 such cases, but actually, there are exactly three. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it claims there are more than three, but there aren't; it's exactly three.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells are those rows where both columns have non-na values. That would be row indices 1, 5, and 6 for \"reader's vote\" and \"lifetime achievement\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"reader 's vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reader 's vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"reader 's vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lifetime achievement\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
