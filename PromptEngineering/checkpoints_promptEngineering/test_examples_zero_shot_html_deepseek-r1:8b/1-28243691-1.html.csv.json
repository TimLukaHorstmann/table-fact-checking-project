    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"4 of the university list be private, the rest be public.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"the rest\" implies that after 4 universities are identified as private, all remaining ones are public. So my task is to count how many private and how many public universities there are in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with various attributes, including whether it's private or public. I need to focus on the \"affiliation\" column specifically because that's where the type (private or public) is indicated.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one and note down their affiliation:\n\n1. Baylor University: Private, Baptist\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette: Public\n3. Louisiana State University: Public\n4. University of North Texas: Public\n5. University of Oklahoma: Public\n6. Rice University: Private / Non-Secretarian\n7. Southern Methodist University: Private / Methodist\n8. Texas A&M University: Public\n9. Texas Christian University: Private / Disciples of Christ\n10. Texas State University at San Marcos: Public\n11. Texas Tech University: Public\n12. University of Texas at Austin: Public\n\nNow, let's count the private ones. Looking at each affiliation:\n\n- Baylor: Private (1)\n- Rice: Private (2)\n- Southern Methodist: Private (3)\n- Texas Christian: Private (4)\n\nThat makes 4 private universities. The rest would be public, which are the remaining 8 universities. \n\nSo the claim is that exactly 4 are private and the rest public. From my count, that's correct. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant column is \"affiliation,\" so I'll list the row indices for each of the 4 private universities.\n\nRow indices start at 0, so:\n\n- Baylor: row_index 0\n- Rice: row_index 5\n- Southern Methodist: row_index 6\n- Texas Christian: row_index 8\n\nThese are the cells that show affiliation as private, which is necessary to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"affiliation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"affiliation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"affiliation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"affiliation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant columns for this claim are \"enrollment\" because we're comparing the number of students.\n\nNext, I'll locate Rice University and the University of Texas at Austin in the table. \n\nRice University is found in row 8 (since the first row is index 0). Looking at the \"enrollment\" column for Rice, it's listed as 6799 students.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin is in row 12. Checking its \"enrollment\" column, it shows 50995 students.\n\nNow, I need to verify if Rice has the least enrollment and UT Austin has the most.

The claim is: \"southern methodist university be found in 1911 and texas tech university be found in 1923.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the task. I have a table with several universities, each row representing a different institution. Each row has multiple columns like institution name, location, founded year, affiliation, enrollment, team nickname, and primary conference.\n\nMy goal is to check if both parts of the claim are correct using the table data. So I need to find Southern Methodist University (SMU) in the table and verify its founding year. Then do the same for Texas Tech University (TTU).\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row's \"institution\" column until I find SMU. \n\nI go through the rows one by one:\n1. Baylor University - not SMU\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette - nope\n3. Louisiana State University - not\n4. University of North Texas - nope\n5. University of Oklahoma - no\n6. Rice University - nope\n7. Southern Methodist University - yes, that's row 7. The \"founded\" column for this row has the value 1911. So SMU was founded in 1911, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, I need to find Texas Tech University (TTU). I'll continue scanning:\n8. Texas A&M University - not TTU\n9. Texas Christian University - nope\n10. University of Texas at San Marcos - nope\n11. Texas Tech University - yes, that's row 11. The \"founded\" column shows 1923.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"10 of the school list be found before 1900\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that at least 10 schools from the list were founded before the year 1900. So I need to check each row in the table and see which institutions were established prior to 1900.\n\nLooking at the 'founded' column, I'll go through each entry:\n\n1. Baylor University - Founded in 1845 (before 1900)\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette - 1898 (before 1900)\n3. Louisiana State University - 1860 (before 1900)\n4. University of North Texas - 1890 (before 1900)\n5. University of Oklahoma - 1890 (before 1900)\n6. Rice University - 1891 (before 1900)\n7. Southern Methodist University - 1911 (after 1900)\n8. Texas A&M University - 1871 (before 1900)\n9. Texas Christian University - 1873 (before 1900)\n10. San Marcos State University - 1899 (before 1900)\n11. Texas Tech University - 1923 (after 1900)\n12. University of Texas at Austin - 1883 (before 1900)\n\nNow, let's count how many were founded before 1900. That would be institutions with a 'founded' year less than 1900.\n\nCounting them:\n\n1. Baylor\n2. Louisiana-Lafayette\n3. LSU\n4. North Texas\n5. Oklahoma\n6. Rice\n7. A&M\n8. TCU\n9. San Marcos\n10. Texas Tech? Wait, no, Texas Tech is 1923 which is after. So that's 10 schools before 1900.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Baylor (1845)\n2. Louisiana-Lafayette (1898)\n3. LSU (1860)\n4. North Texas (1890)\n5. Oklahoma (1890)\n6. Rice (1891)\n7. A&M (1871)\n8. TCU (1873)\n9. San Marcos (1899)\n10. University of Texas at Austin (1883)\n\nYes, that's 10 schools founded before 1900.\n\nWait, but in the table, the rows are numbered from 0 to 12. So row indices go from 0 (Baylor) up to 12 (UT Austin). Let me check each relevant column for 'founded' and see which meet the condition.\n\nSo, I need to find all schools where the 'founded' year is less than 1900. That's 10 schools as I've counted.\n\nNow, according to the claim, \"10 of the school list be found before 1900.\" So if there are exactly 10, the claim would be TRUE. However, looking at the table, some rows might have the same 'founded' year or similar details, so I need to ensure that all these 10 are indeed separate and valid.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Baylor: 1845\n- Louisiana-Lafayette:1898\n- LSU:1860\n- North Texas:1890\n- Oklahoma:1890\n- Rice:1891\n- A&M:1871\n- TCU:1873\n- San Marcos:1899\n- UT Austin:1883\n\nYes, these are all distinct and 10 in total. So the claim is that at least 10 were founded before 1900, which seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, but looking again, San Marcos was founded in 1899, which is still before 1900. So that's the 10th.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by exactly 10 schools. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all the rows where 'founded' <1900.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"10 of the school list be found before 1900\" is true, we need to check each institution's founding year in the table. \n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The key column here is 'founded'.\n2. **Check Each Row**: We count how many schools were established before 1900.\n3. **Count the Schools**: There are exactly 10 schools founded before 1900.\n\nBased on this, the claim is TRUE, and all these schools are identified by their row indices in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"3 school list have an enrollment between 30000 and 40000 students\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what the claim is asking. It mentions that three schools have enrollments within a specific range\u2014between 30,000 and 40,000 students. So my goal is to check each school's enrollment figure in the table and see if exactly three of them fall into this range.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and note the enrollment numbers:\n\n1. Baylor University: 14,769\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette: 16,361\n3. Louisiana State University: 25,215\n4. University of North Texas: 36,206\n5. University of Oklahoma: 29,931\n6. Rice University: 6,799\n7. Southern Methodist University: 10,693\n8. Texas A&M University: 48,702\n9. Texas Christian University: 8,696\n10. San Marcos (Texas State University at San Marcos): 32,586\n11. Texas Tech University: 30,049\n12. University of Texas at Austin: 50,995\n\nNow, I'll identify which enrollments fall between 30,000 and 40,000.\n\n- Texas A&M University has 48,702 students, which is above 40,000.\n- University of North Texas: 36,206 \u2013 within the range.\n- University of Oklahoma: 29,931 \u2013 just below 30,000, so it's not included.\n- San Marcos: 32,586 \u2013 within the range.\n\nWait, that gives me three schools: University of North Texas (36,206), San Marcos (32,586), and... wait, let me double-check. Let me go through each enrollment:\n\n1. Baylor: ~14k \u2013 no\n2. UL Lafayette: ~16k \u2013 no\n3. LSU: 25k \u2013 yes, but 25k is below 30k.\n4. UNTX: 36k \u2013 yes.\n5. OU: 29k \u2013 just below 30k, so no.\n6. Rice: ~7k \u2013 no\n7. SMU: ~10k \u2013 no\n8. Texas A&M: ~48k \u2013 no\n9. TCU: ~8k \u2013 no\n10. San Marcos: ~32k \u2013 yes.\n11. TTU: 30,049 \u2013 exactly at the lower bound, but does it include 30k? The claim says \"between,\" which might mean strictly greater than 30k and less than 40k. If it's inclusive, then 30,049 is included.\n\nWait, that adds another school. So now we have UNTX (36k), San Marcos (32k), and TTU (30,049). That's three schools if the range includes 30k. But sometimes \"between\" can be exclusive. If it's exclusive of 30k, then only the above two would qualify.\n\nLet me check each again:\n\n- UNTX: 36k \u2013 yes\n- San Marcos: 32k \u2013 yes\n- TTU: 30,049 \u2013 if the range is >=30k and <=40k, then yes. But if it's strictly >30k, then no.\n\nThe claim says \"between,\" which can sometimes be interpreted as not including the endpoints. So perhaps only UNTX and San Marcos fit if we don't include TTU.\n\nBut let me check the enrollments again to make sure I didn't miss any:\n\n- Baylor: 14,769 \u2013 no\n- UL Lafayette: 16,361 \u2013 no\n- LSU: 25,215 \u2013 no\n- UNTX: 36,206 \u2013 yes\n- OU: 29,931 \u2013 no (if strict >30k)\n- Rice: ~7k \u2013 no\n- SMU: ~10k \u2013 no\n- A&M: 48k \u2013 no\n- TCU: ~8k \u2013 no\n- San Marcos: 32,586 \u2013 yes\n- TTU: 30,049 \u2013 maybe yes if inclusive\n- UT Austin: 50k \u2013 no\n\nSo depending on the inclusivity of \"between,\" there are either two or three schools. The term \"between\" can be a bit ambiguous. In some contexts, it's exclusive, meaning greater than 30,000 and less than 40,000. If that's the case, TTU would not qualify because 30,049 is just over 30k but might still be considered within the range depending on interpretation.\n\nHowever, in real terms, sometimes \"between\" can include the endpoints. For example, if a store says products are between $10 and $20, it might include $10 and $20.\n\nBut to be precise, let's check the exact wording of the claim: \"enrollment between 30000 and 40000 students.\" It doesn't specify inclusive or exclusive.\n\nGiven that, it's safer to consider only enrollments strictly greater than 30,000 and less than 40,000. So 30,049 might be considered within the range because 30k is the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, if we include exactly 30k, then TTU would count. But since 30,049 is just over 30k, it's possible that the claim counts it as within the range.\n\nSo, considering that:\n\n- UNTX: 36,206 \u2013 yes\n- San Marcos: 32,586 \u2013 yes\n- TTU: 30,049 \u2013 yes (if inclusive)\n\nThat makes three schools. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE because exactly three schools meet the criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Enrollment\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"4 of the university list be public , the rest be private\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it says that out of all the universities listed in the table, 4 are public and the remaining are private. So, my task is to count how many universities are public and then see if exactly 4 meet that criterion.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a university with various attributes, including whether it's public or private. I'll go through each row one by one.\n\n1. Baylor University: The affiliation is listed as \"private , baptist\". So, this is a private institution.\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette: Affiliation is \"public\", so that's public.\n3. Louisiana State University: It says \"public\", another public one.\n4. University of North Texas: \"public\" again, so that's the third public university.\n5. University of Oklahoma: \"public\", making it the fourth public institution.\n6. Rice University: The affiliation is \"private / non - sectarian\". So, private.\n7. Southern Methodist University: It's \"private / methodist\". Private.\n8. Texas A&M University: \"public\" \u2013 that's the fifth public university.\n9. Texas Christian University: \"private / disciples of christ\". Private.\n10. Texas State Universitysan Marcos: \"public\", sixth public institution.\n11. Texas Tech University: \"public\", seventh public university.\n12. University of Texas at Austin: \"public\", which is the eighth public university.\n\nNow, counting the public ones: Louisiana State (1), University of North Texas (2), University of Oklahoma (3), Texas A&M (4), Texas State (5), Texas Tech (6), and University of Texas (7). Wait, that's seven public universities, not four. So the initial claim that only four are public is incorrect.\n\nThe claim says 4 public and the rest private. But according to my count, there are more than four public universities\u2014specifically, seven. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this conclusion. The relevant columns for determining public vs. private status are \"affiliation\". Each university's affiliation indicates whether it's public or private. So, the column to look at is \"affiliation\".\n\nI'll go through each row and note their affiliation:\n\n1. Baylor University: Private\n2. UL Lafayette: Public\n3. LSU: Public\n4. UNTx: Public\n5. OU: Public\n6. Rice: Private\n7. SMU: Private\n8. Texas A&M: Public\n9. TCU: Private\n10. Tx State: Public\n11. TTU: Public\n12. UT Austin: Public\n\nFrom this, the public universities are rows 2,3,4,5,8,10,11,12. So their row indices are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10 (assuming row_index starts at 0). Wait, actually, looking back, the first row is Baylor, which is index 0.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this claim: \"10 of the school list be found after 1900.\" My task is to determine whether this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that there are 10 schools listed in the table where they were founded (founded year) after 1900. So, my goal is to check each school's founding date and see if at least 10 of them were established after 1900.\n\nLooking at the HTML table, I can see each row represents a different institution with various attributes, one of which is the \"founded\" year. My first step is to extract all the founded years from the table and then count how many of these are greater than 1900.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Baylor University**: Founded in 1845. This is before 1900, so it doesn't count.\n2. **University of Louisiana at Lafayette**: 1898 \u2013 also before 1900.\n3. **Louisiana State University**: 1860 \u2013 pre-1900.\n4. **University of North Texas**: 1890 \u2013 still before 1900.\n5. **University of Oklahoma**: 1890 \u2013 same as above.\n6. **Rice University**: 1891 \u2013 again, before 1900.\n7. **Southern Methodist University**: 1911 \u2013 this is after 1900. So count = 1.\n8. **Texas A&M University**: 1871 \u2013 pre-1900.\n9. **Texas Christian University**: 1873 \u2013 same as above.\n10. **University of Texas at San Marcos**: 1899 \u2013 just shy of 1900. Hmm, 1899 is before 1900, so it doesn't count.\n11. **Texas Tech University**: 1923 \u2013 this is after 1900. Count increases to 2.\n12. **University of Texas at Austin**: 1883 \u2013 pre-1900.\n\nWait a minute, that only gives me two schools (Southern Methodist and Texas Tech) founded after 1900. That's way less than 10. But let me double-check the table to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I miscounted or overlooked some rows. Let me list all the founded years:\n\n- Baylor: 1845\n- Louisiana at Lafayette: 1898\n- LSU: 1860\n- North Texas: 1890\n- Oklahoma: 1890\n- Rice: 1891\n- SMU: 1911\n- A&M: 1871\n- TCU: 1873\n- San Marcos: 1899\n- Tech: 1923\n- UT Austin: 1883\n\nSo, from this list, only two schools (SMU and Tech) were founded after 1900. The rest are before. Therefore, there are only 2 schools in the table that meet the criteria, not 10.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"10 of the school list be found after 1900.\" That seems incorrect based on my count. However, I should consider if the table includes all the schools mentioned in the claim or if I might have missed some rows.\n\nLooking back at the table structure, each row represents a different institution, and there are 13 rows in total. But according to my count, only two of them were founded after 1900. That's a big discrepancy from the claim which suggests there should be 10.\n\nPerhaps I made an error in interpreting the \"founded\" column. Let me check each row again:\n\n1. Baylor: 1845 \u2013 no\n2. Louisiana Lafayette: 1898 \u2013 no\n3. LSU: 1860 \u2013 no\n4. North Texas: 1890 \u2013 no\n5. Oklahoma: 1890 \u2013 no\n6. Rice: 1891 \u2013 no\n7. SMU: 1911 \u2013 yes (1)\n8. A&M: 1871 \u2013 no\n9. TCU: 1873 \u2013 no\n10. San Marcos: 1899 \u2013 no\n11. Tech: 1923 \u2013 yes (2)\n12. UT Austin: 1883 \u2013 no\n\nYes, that's correct. Only two after 1900. So the claim is definitely false.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes universities have multiple campuses or branches. For example, University of Texas at San Marcos might be considered a separate entity from the main UT Austin. But in this table, each row represents a distinct school, so I think it's safe to consider each as one institution. Therefore, San Marcos is one and Tech another.\n\nSo, with only two schools after 1900, the claim that there are 10 is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"Southern Methodist University was founded in 1871 and Texas Tech University was founded in 1923.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see if it matches the information in the table.\n\nStarting with Southern Methodist University (SMU). In the table, SMU is listed in row index 8. The columns are institution, location, founded, affiliation, enrollment, team nickname, and primary conference. So, the relevant column for the founding year would be \"founded\". Looking at that cell, it says 1911. Wait, but the claim says 1871. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so SMU was actually founded in 1911 according to the table, not 1871 as stated in the claim. So this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, checking Texas Tech University (TTU). In the table, TTU is listed in row index 12. The \"founded\" column for TTU shows 1923. The claim says it was founded in 1923, which matches exactly. So that part is correct.\n\nSo the claim has one accurate statement and one incorrect. Since the claim includes both parts as true, but SMU's founding year doesn't match, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"3 school list have an enrollment between 20000 and 40000 students.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which schools in the table might fall into this category. Looking at the 'enrollment' column, I'll go through each row to see if the number is between 20,000 and 40,000.\n\n1. Baylor University has an enrollment of 14,769. That's below 20,000, so it doesn't count.\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette has 16,361 students. Still below 20,000.\n3. Louisiana State University enrolls 25,215. This is within the range, so this school qualifies.\n4. University of North Texas has 36,206. Also in the range, another qualifier.\n5. University of Oklahoma: 29,931. Also falls into the category.\n6. Rice University: 6,799. Too low.\n7. Southern Methodist University: 10,693. Not enough.\n8. Texas A&M University: 48,702. Above 40,000, so it doesn't qualify.\n9. Texas Christian University: 8,696. Below 20k.\n10. Texas State University at San Marcos: 32,586. Within the range, another qualifier.\n11. Texas Tech University: 30,049. Also within the range.\n12. University of Texas at Austin: 50,995. Above 40k.\n\nSo, from the list above, Louisiana State University, University of North Texas, University of Oklahoma, Texas State University at San Marcos, and Texas Tech University have enrollments between 20,000 and 40,000. That makes five schools, not three. Therefore, the claim is false because there are more than three schools meeting that criterion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
