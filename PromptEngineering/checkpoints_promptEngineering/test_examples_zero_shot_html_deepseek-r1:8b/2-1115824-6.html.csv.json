The claim says: \"the street address for the prudential tower building be 800 boylston street.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate where this information is in the table. Looking at the table columns, there's one named \"street address\". That's probably relevant. So, I'll look under each row to find the prudential tower.\n\nNext, scanning through each row: the first few are about different buildings like old state house, old north church, etc., but then in the 6th row (row index 5), the building is called \"prudential tower.\" The street address there is \"800 boylston street.\" So that matches exactly with what the claim says.\n\nNow, I should note down which cells are relevant. That would be the specific row and column for the prudential tower's street address. So row index 5 and column \"street address\".\n\nSince all the information in the claim is directly supported by the table, the answer should be TRUE, and only the relevant cell needs to be included.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"street address\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that the Prudential Tower has 52 floors. I remember from the table that each row represents a different building with various attributes like name, street address, years as tallest, height in feet and meters, and floors. \n\nI should find the relevant row for the Prudential Tower. Scanning through the table, I see a row where the name is \"prudential tower.\" That's in the sixth row of the tbody section. So row_index would be 5 since it starts counting from 0.\n\nNext, I need to check which columns are relevant. The claim mentions floors, so the 'floors' column is definitely important. Looking at that column for the Prudential Tower, the value is \"52.\" That matches exactly with the claim, confirming that the number of floors is indeed 52.\n\nI don't think any other columns are directly related to this specific claim. The height and years as tallest are about building history but not the number of floors. So only the 'floors' column needs to be checked for verification.\n\nTherefore, since the Prudential Tower has 52 floors as per the table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the custom house tower have thirty - 2 floor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's saying that the Custom House Tower has 32 floors because it mentions \"thirty-2.\" Wait, thirty minus two would be 28, but in the table, I remember seeing a row for Custom House Tower with 32 floors. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check.\n\nNext, I'll go through each step as instructed. The claim is about the number of floors in the Custom House Tower. So, I should focus on the relevant column in the table which is \"floors.\"\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows. The first row is old state house with 3 floors, then old north church with 1, park street church with 1, church of the covenant with 1, custom house tower with 32, prudential tower with 52, and hancock place with 60.\n\nSo, for Custom House Tower, the \"floors\" column has the value 32. The claim says \"thirty-2,\" which is 30 minus 2, equaling 28. That's not matching 32. So that part of the claim seems incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the wording. Does \"thirty-2\" refer to 32 or 28? It could be a typo where they meant to say \"thirty-two.\" But in the given text, it's written as \"thirty - 2 floor,\" which probably means 30 minus 2, so 28. Since the actual number is 32, that doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the Custom House Tower has 32 floors, not 28 or thirty-2. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the custom house tower have thirty - 2 floor,\" we need to check the relevant cells in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the building**: The claim refers to \"Custom House Tower.\"\n2. **Check floors column**: In the table, the row for Custom House Tower has a value of 32 in the \"floors\" column.\n3. **Compare with claim**: The claim states \"thirty-2,\" which is 28. Since 32 \u2260 28, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the building on 800 boylston street have fifty - 2 floor\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to 800 Boylston Street. Looking at the table, each row has a 'street address' column. Scanning through:\n\n- old state house: 206 Washington\n- old north church: 193 Salem\n- park street church: 1 Park\n- church of the covenant: 67 Newbury\n- custom house tower: 3 McKinley Square\n- prudential tower: 800 Boylston\n- hancock place: 200 Clarendon\n\nSo, the row for 800 Boylston Street is the sixth one (index starting from 0 would be 5), and it's under the 'prudential tower' name.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'floors' column for this building. From the table, prudential tower has 52 floors listed in that column.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim: \"fifty - 2 floor\". Wait, there might be a typo here. The user wrote \"fifty - 2\", which could mean either 50 or 52. But in the context of floors, it's more likely to be either 50 or 52.\n\nLooking at the table, prudential tower has 52 floors. So if the claim is saying 50-2 floor, perhaps they meant 52 (as sometimes buildings have multiple numbers, like base floor and total floors). Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for 52.\n\nAlternatively, \"fifty - 2\" could imply that there are 50 usable floors or something else, but I think in this context, the claim is about the number of floors. So if the building actually has 52 floors, then saying \"fifty-2\" might be a way to refer to 52 (like 50+2).\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is stating that it's on 800 Boylston Street and it has fifty-two floors. The original table shows 52 floors for prudential tower.\n\nSo the claim says 50-2 floor, which likely means 52 floors, matching the table. Therefore, the claim is accurate.\n\nAdditionally, checking other parts of the claim: the building is on 800 Boylston Street, which matches the table, and it has a specific number of floors as stated.\n\nTherefore, all aspects of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"prudential tower have 52 floor\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"prudential tower\" having 52 floors. Looking at the table, I need to find where this information might be located. The relevant columns in the table are name, street address, years as tallest, height ft (m), and floors. So, the 'floors' column should have the number of floors each building has.\n\nI remember that in data tables like this, each row represents a different building. So, I should look for the row where \"prudential tower\" is listed and then check the corresponding 'floors' value. \n\nLet me scan through the rows one by one to find the correct building. The first row is old state house, second is old north church, third is park street church, fourth is church of the covenant, fifth is custom house tower, sixth is prudential tower, and seventh is hancock place. So, the prudential tower is in the 6th row.\n\nNow, for that row, what's the 'floors' value? Looking at each column, the last one is 'floors.' The prudential tower's row has 52 as the floors value. That matches exactly with the claim made, which states that \"prudential tower have 52 floor.\"\n\nSo, since the table confirms that the prudential tower has 52 floors, the claim should be true. \n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other possible interpretations. The claim says \"have 52 floor,\" using 'floor' singular, but the table uses 'floors,' plural. However, in English, sometimes people refer to multiple floors as a single unit with 'floor' in a collective sense. So that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlso, I need to note which cells are relevant for this check. The row index of prudential tower is 5 (since it's zero-indexed), and the column name is 'floors.' So, the relevant_cells would be at row_index 5 and column_name 'floors.'\n\nTherefore, after verifying the claim against the table, I can conclude that the statement is true because the number of floors for prudential tower in the table matches the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be true as the table confirms the prudential tower has 52 floors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand what each column represents. The relevant columns here are \"name,\" \"street address,\" and \"floors.\" Since the claim is about the number of floors in the Custom House Tower, I should focus on that specific row and the \"floors\" column specifically.\n\nI'll locate the row for \"custom house tower.\" It's the fifth row in the table. Now, looking at the \"floors\" column for this row, it says 32. That seems like a lot of floors, definitely more than just one.\n\nThe claim is stating that the Custom House Tower company has only 1 floor. But according to the table, it actually has 32 floors. So the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n\nI need to make sure I'm checking the right cells. The \"name\" column confirms it's about the Custom House Tower, and the \"floors\" column is essential for determining the number of floors. So the relevant cells are at row 5 (since it's zero-indexed as 4 if counting from 0) in the \"floors\" column.\n\nPutting this together, since the number of floors is 32, not 1, the claim is definitely FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"floors\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the specific building mentioned in the claim. The address provided is 800 Boylston Street, and from the table, that corresponds to the row with \"prudential tower.\" So I should focus on the relevant data in that row.\n\nNext, I need to identify which columns are important for evaluating the number of floors. In the table, the columns related to floors are:\n- 'floors' (which seems to directly indicate the number of floors)\n- 'height ft (m)' and possibly 'years as tallest', but those might relate more to height rather than floor count.\n\nSo the primary column to check is 'floors'. Looking at the 'prudential tower' row, under 'floors', it says 52. I'll need to compare this number with other buildings in the same table to see if it has the highest number of floors.\n\nNow, let me list out all the 'floors' values from each building:\n- old state house: 3\n- old north church: 1\n- park street church: 1\n- church of the covenant: 1\n- custom house tower: 32\n- prudential tower: 52\n- hancock place: 60\n\nComparing these, the highest number is 60 from hancock place. Therefore, the building on 800 Boylston Street (prudential tower) does not have the most floors; hancock place has more.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because the prudential tower doesn't have the maximum number of floors compared to all buildings listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the prudential tower at 800 Boylston Street does not have the highest number of floors (52) when compared to other buildings in the table.

The columns are: name, street address, years as tallest, height ft (m), and floors. I need to find the row where the name is \"Prudential Tower.\"\n\nI'll scan down the 'name' column:\n\n1. old state house\n2. old north church\n3. park street church\n4. church of the covenant\n5. custom house tower\n6. prudential tower\n7. hancock place\n\nSo, the Prudential Tower is the 6th row in the table.\n\nNow, I'll look at the 'street address' column for that row. The entry is \"800 boylston street.\" Hmm, that's different from what the claim says, which is \"200 clarendon street.\"\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check. The 6th row: name is Prudential Tower, street address is 800 Boylston Street. So the claim is incorrect because it states a different street address.\n\nBut wait, there's another building named Hancock Place at row 7 with a street address of \"200 clarendon street.\" So perhaps the user confused the two buildings? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nNo, the Prudential Tower in the table has the address 800 Boylston Street. Therefore, the claim is false because it attributes 200 Clarendon Street to the Prudential Tower, which isn't correct based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the street address of the Prudential Tower, I checked the relevant row in the table.

That's the specific building we're interested in. So, the row index for this entry is 6 (since it's the seventh row in the table, but indexes start at 0). \n\nNext, I need to check the number of floors for this building. The 'floors' column for this row shows \"52\". The claim says that the building has less than 52 floors. However, 52 is not less than 52; it's exactly 52.\n\nSo, comparing the claim to the table data, the building at 800 Boylston Street has exactly 52 floors, not less.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and the data it contains. The table has several columns: name, street address, years as tallest, height ft (m), and floors. There are seven buildings listed with their corresponding details.\n\nThe claim in question is that \"prudential tower have more than 52 floor.\" I need to verify this by checking the relevant cells in the table. Since the claim is about the number of floors, my focus should be on the 'floors' column for the Prudential Tower.\n\nLooking at the rows one by one:\n\n1. The first row is about the old state house with 3 floors.\n2. The second row is the old north church with 1 floor.\n3. The third row is park street church, also with 1 floor.\n4. The fourth row is the church of the covenant, again 1 floor.\n5. The fifth row is the custom house tower with 32 floors.\n6. The sixth row is about the Prudential Tower, which has 52 floors.\n7. The seventh row is Hancock Place with 60 floors.\n\nNow, focusing on the Prudential Tower's data: in the 'floors' column, it shows 52. The claim says \"more than 52,\" so I need to check if this number is correct and whether there's a higher count elsewhere or if it's accurately presented.\n\nLooking at the table again, I see that Hancock Place has 60 floors, which is more than 52. However, the claim specifically mentions the Prudential Tower. So, unless there's an error in the table, the Prudential Tower only has 52 floors.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim could be about whether it's more than 52. If the table says 52, then the claim is false because it's exactly 52, not more. But I should double-check if maybe there's a mistake in reading the data.\n\nLooking at the 'floors' column for Prudential Tower: it's written as \"52\" in the HTML. So, the number is definitely 52. Therefore, the claim that it has more than 52 floors is incorrect because it only has 52 floors.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, regarding the relevant cells, I need to identify which cells were checked. The key columns here are 'name' and 'floors.' Since the claim is about the Prudential Tower, I need to find its row index and the 'floors' column name.\n\nLooking at the table, Prudential Tower is the sixth entry (index 6).
