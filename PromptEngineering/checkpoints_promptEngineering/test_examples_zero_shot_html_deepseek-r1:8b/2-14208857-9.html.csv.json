    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim is: \"On April 16, the opponent was the New York Ranger.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the date is April 16. Let me go through each row in the table.\n\nRow 1: April 8 - opponent is NY Rangers.\nRow 2: April 9 - same opponent.\nRow 3: April 11 - same.\nRow 4: April 12 - same.\nRow 5: April 14 - same.\nRow 6: April 16 - this is the date we're interested in.\n\nNow, I check the opponent for row 6. The opponent is listed as \"new york rangers\" (all lowercase). But the claim says \"New York Ranger.\" Wait, is that a typo? Actually, the original table has \"new york rangers\" with all lowercase except the first letter of each word, which might not matter. But in the claim, it's written as \"the opponent be the new york ranger,\" but maybe they meant \"rangers\" and not \"ranger.\"\n\nLooking at the relevant cells, I see that on April 16 (row index 6), the column is 'opponent' with value 'new york rangers'. So it matches the claim's date, but does it match the opponent name?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the table. Let me double-check: row 6 has the opponent as \"new york rangers\" and the series outcome. The claim is about April 16, so that's the correct row.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the opponent be the new york ranger.\" Hmm, maybe it's a typo, but in the table, the opponent is the New York Rangers (plural). So if the claim refers to \"New York Ranger\" singular, that might be incorrect. But I think the main point is whether on April 16, the opponent was NY Rangers, regardless of pluralization.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row index 6 and column 'opponent'. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE because the opponent on April 16 is indeed the New York Rangers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and the specific instruction to identify relevant cells.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"game 6 be hold on april 11\". Let me break that down. It seems like the claim is making two points:\n\n1. The game number is 6.\n2. The date of this game was April 11.\n\nMy job is to check if there's a row in the table where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, and series status. So, I'll need to find the row corresponding to game 6 and see what date it has.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Game 1 on April 8.\n- Row 2: Game 2 on April 9.\n- Row 3: Game 3 on April 11. Wait, this is game 3 on April 11. But the claim is about game 6 on April 11.\n\nSo, row 3 has game number 3, not 6. Let's continue:\n\n- Row 4: Game 4 on April 12.\n- Row 5: Game 5 on April 14.\n- Row 6: Game 6 on April 16.\n\nHmm, the claim says \"game 6 be hold on april 11\". So according to this, game 6 should have been played on April 11. But looking at row 6 (which is game 6), the date is April 16, not April 11. That means the date in the table for game 6 doesn't match what's claimed.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread. Let me double-check each row. The rows are numbered from 1 to 6, and each corresponds correctly to their game numbers. So game 6 is indeed on April 16, not April 11.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"game 6 be hold on april 11\" is incorrect because the actual date for game 6 is April 16, as per the table provided.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones that directly relate to the claim. Since the claim refers to game 6 and its date on April 11, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index where game is 6 (which is row 6) and the column for the date.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",
