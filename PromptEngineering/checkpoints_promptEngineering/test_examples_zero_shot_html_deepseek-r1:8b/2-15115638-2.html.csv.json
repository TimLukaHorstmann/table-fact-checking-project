    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Patty Sheehan be the runner up in the Corning Classic on May 30, 1982\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand each column. The relevant columns seem to be 'date', 'tournament', 'winning score', 'margin of victory', and 'runner(s) - up'. Each row represents a different tournament with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions Patty Sheehan being the runner-up in the Corning Classic on May 30, 1982. So I need to find the corresponding row in the table that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the date column: May 30, 1982. Scanning through the rows, I see a row with \"may 30 , 1982\" as the date and the tournament is \"corning classic\". That's the correct row.\n\nNow, checking who the runner-up was for that specific tournament. The 'runner (s) - up' column for May 30, 1982 lists \"patty sheehan\". So it looks like Patty Sheehan was indeed the runner-up in that event.\n\nI should also double-check if there are any other rows with similar data to avoid confusion. Let's see, another row on Sep 12, 1982 mentions \"carole charbonnier\" as the runner-up in the Mary Kay Classic, which is a different tournament and date. So no conflict there.\n\nThere's a May 30, 1982 entry for Corning Classic with Patty Sheehan as the runner-up. The winning score and margin of victory are provided but aren't necessary to confirm the claim about her being the runner-up.\n\nTherefore, all the conditions in the claim are met by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in row 5 (index 5) for \"runner(s) - up\" in the Corning Classic tournament on May 30, 1982.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"judy rankin be the runner up on aug 3 , 1969\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a specific date: August 3, 1969. Looking at the table, I should check which row corresponds to this date. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 1: jul 3 , 1966\n- Row 2: aug 3 , 1969\n- Row 3: may 5 , 1974\n- And so on.\n\nSo, Row 2 is the one for August 3, 1969. Now, the claim says \"judy rankin be the runner up.\" I need to see who the runner-up was in that tournament.\n\nLooking at the table's columns, we have 'runner (s) - up'. For Row 2, this column has \"judy rankin\". So, Judy Rankin is listed as the runner-up for that event on August 3, 1969. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other row with the same date or similar information. The next row after Row 2 is May 5, 1974, which is a different date and tournament. So, only Row 2 is relevant here.\n\nAdditionally, checking other columns in that row: 'winning score' and 'margin of victory' don't affect whether Judy Rankin was the runner-up. The key column here is 'runner (s) - up', which directly mentions her name. \n\nI think I've covered all necessary parts. There's no conflicting information, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"On Sep 12, 1982, Carole Charbonnier was a runner-up with a 1-stroke margin of victory.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the elements of the claim:\n\n1. **Date**: September 12, 1982.\n2. **Runner-up**: Carole Charbonnier.\n3. **Margin of Victory**: 1 stroke.\n\nNow, I need to look into the table provided and find the relevant rows and columns that correspond to these pieces of information.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament with details including date, tournament name, winning score, margin of victory, and runners-up.\n\nI'll scan through each row to see if any match the claim.\n\n- **First Row**: Jul 3, 1966 \u2013 Doesn't match the date.\n- **Second Row**: Aug 3, 1969 \u2013 Doesn't match the date.\n- **Third Row**: May 5, 1974 \u2013 Doesn't match the date.\n- **Fourth Row**: May 29, 1977 \u2013 Doesn't match the date.\n- **Fifth Row**: Sep 7, 1980 \u2013 Close but not Sep 12, 1982. Also, the runners-up here are Carolyn Hill and Lori Garbacz, which doesn't include Carole Charbonnier.\n- **Sixth Row**: May 30, 1982 \u2013 Doesn't match the date (September vs. May).\n- **Seventh Row**: Sep 12, 1982 \u2013 This is our target row because it matches both the date and the runner-up mentioned in the claim.\n\nIn this seventh row:\n- **Date**: Sep 12, 1982.\n- **Runner-up**: Carole Charbonnier.\n- **Margin of Victory**: 1 stroke.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says: \"the margin of victory on May 29, 1977 be 4 stroke.\" \n\nFirst, I'll go through each step as instructed. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's talking about a specific date, May 29, 1977, and claims that the margin of victory on that day was 4 strokes. So, my task is to check if this statement matches any data in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's an HTML table with headers: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runner-up. Each row represents a different event with details filled in those columns.\n\nI'll need to locate the row where the date is May 29, 1977. Let me scan through each <td> element under the date column to find that exact date.\n\nThe table has several rows:\n\n1. July 3, 1966\n2. August 3, 1969\n3. May 5, 1974\n4. May 29, 1977 \u2013 This is the row we're interested in.\n5. September 7, 1980\n6. May 30, 1982\n7. September 12, 1982\n\nSo, the fourth row (index 3) has the date May 29, 1977.\n\nNow, I'll check the \"margin of victory\" column for that specific row. The columns in the table are: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runner-up. So, for row index 3, the \"margin of victory\" cell has the value \"1 stroke.\"\n\nThe claim states that the margin was a \"4 stroke.\" Comparing this to what's in the table, it shows \"1 stroke,\" which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I'm not missing any other relevant cells. The claim also mentions May 29, 1977 specifically, so only that row is relevant here. There are no other rows with that date, so I don't need to check others.\n\nSo, to sum it up: The claim says the margin was 4 strokes, but the table shows it as 1 stroke for May 29, 1977. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the runner - up on corn classic be carole charbonnier\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim. It says that the runner-up in the Corn Classic was Carole Charbonnier. So I need to check if there's any row in the table related to the \"Corn Classic\" where the runner-up is Carole Charbonnier.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see each row has several columns: date, tournament, winning score, margin of victory, and runner(s) - up. My main focus here is on the \"tournament\" column because that's where the specific names of the tournaments are listed. \n\nNext, I'll search through the \"tournament\" column to find any mention of \"Corn Classic.\" Scanning each row:\n\n1. The first tournament is \"us women's open.\"\n2. Second: \"buckeye savings invitational.\"\n3. Third: \"lady tara classic.\"\n4. Fourth: \"lady keystone open.\"\n5. Fifth: \"barth classic.\"\n6. Sixth: \"corning classic.\"\n7. Seventh: \"mary kay classic.\"\n\nSo, the \"Corn Classic\" isn't directly listed here. Wait, maybe I misread it? Let me double-check. The fifth row is \"barth classic,\" sixth is \"corning classic.\" Hmm, so perhaps the tournament in question is \"Corning Classic,\" not \"Corn Classic.\" That might be a typo or different spelling.\n\nNow, looking at the row for \"corning classic\" (row index 5), I see the runner-up is listed as Patty Sheehan. So if the claim was about the Corn Classic, but the tournament in the table is spelled as \"Corning Classic,\" there's a discrepancy. \n\nBut wait, maybe it's a different event with similar naming. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant \"Corning Classic.\" If that's the case, then according to the table, the runner-up was Patty Sheehan, not Carole Charbonnier.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim states that the runner-up in the Corn Classic is Carole Charbonnier. However, looking at the table, there's no row for \"Corn Classic.\" Instead, there's a \"corning classic\" where the runner-up was Patty Sheehan. If the tournaments are different due to spelling differences, then the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nAlternatively, if it's supposed to be \"Corning Classic,\" then the runner-up is Patty Sheehan, not Carole Charbonnier, so the claim would still be FALSE.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe I missed a row. Let me check each one again. Row indices go from 0 to 6. The fifth row (index 5) is \"corning classic,\" and the seventh row (index 6) is \"mary kay classic.\" No entry for Corn Classic here.\n\nTherefore, there's no data in the table supporting that the runner-up in the Corn Classic was Carole Charbonnier. In fact, the tournament name doesn't match, so the claim isn't supported.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about the runner-up on the \"Corn Classic\" being Carole Charbonnier is TRUE or FALSE, I first checked each row of the table for any mention of \"Corn Classic.\" The closest match was \"corning classic,\" but this does not match the claim. Additionally, the runner-up listed for \"corning classic\" is Patty Sheehan, not Carole Charbonnier.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** None, as there's no matching tournament in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Each row represents a different event with specific details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"donna caponi\" as a runner-up on August 3, 1969. So, I need to check if there's any row in the table that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: July 3, 1966; Runner-up is Carol Mann.\n- Row 1: August 3, 1969; Tournament is Buckeye Savings Invitational. The runner-up isn't mentioned here because the column only shows \"runner(s) - up\" as Judy Rankin. Wait, no\u2014Judy Rankin is listed as the runner-up for that row? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table's second row (row 1) has:\n- Date: Aug 3, 1969\n- Tournament: Buckeye Savings Invitational\n- Winning score: +3\n- Margin of victory: 3 strokes\n- Runner(s)-up: Judy Rankin\n\nSo, in this case, the runner-up is Judy Rankin, not Donna Caponi. Therefore, there's no row where Donna Caponi was the runner-up on that specific date.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's another row with August 3, 1969 and Donna Caponi as runner-up. But from the table, only Row 1 has August 3, 1969, and Judy Rankin is the runner-up.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Donna Caponi wasn't a runner-up on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Donna Caponi was a runner-up on August 3, 1969.

It mentions a \"-10\" win score and a specific date, September 12, 1982.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament with details like date, tournament name, winning score, margin of victory, and the runners-up. The column for \"winning score\" seems to be what we're interested in here because the claim refers to \"-10.\"\n\nI should go through each row to see if there's a winning score of -10 on September 12, 1982.\n\nStarting from the first row: July 3, 1966. The winning score is +9. Not -10.\n\nSecond row: August 3, 1969. Winning score is +3. Still not -10.\n\nThird row: May 5, 1974. Winning score is e (which might stand for a tie or something else). Not -10.\n\nFourth row: May 29, 1977. Winning score is -9. Close but not -10.\n\nFifth row: September 7, 1980. Winning score is -4. Getting closer, but still not -10.\n\nSixth row: May 30, 1982. Winning score is -8. Still not there yet.\n\nSeventh row: September 12, 1982. This is the date in question. Let's check the winning score here. It says \"-10 (70 +69 +67 =206)\". Wait a minute\u2014the numbers inside the parentheses add up to 206, but that doesn't directly translate. However, the overall winning score is -10.\n\nSo this row matches both the date and the winning score of -10. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: The claim mentions \"the date when the win score be...\" So we're looking for the date column in that row and the winning score column.\n\nThe date is September 12, 1982, which is the 6th row if we start counting from 0.
