    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"this table includes petrol engines that have single-point fuel injection.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. A petrol engine is an internal combustion engine that uses petrol (gasoline) as fuel. Single-point fuel injection refers to a fuel injection system where the engine has only one injector. In such systems, the fuel is injected at a single point in the cylinder, which can be less efficient than multi-point systems but is commonly used in some engines.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with several columns: model, engine, displacement, valvetrain, fuel system, max power at rpm, max torque at rpm, and years. The rows represent different types of engines or specific models within those types.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if there are any petrol engines in the table that use single-point fuel injection. So first, I'll scan through each row to see which ones are petrol engines and then check their fuel system column.\n\nLooking at the first row after the headers, all the cells say \"petrol engines.\" However, this seems repetitive and might just be placeholders or a general category. The next rows have specific models like 1.6 ie, 2.0 ie, diesel engines, etc. \n\nNow, I'll look for any petrol engine model that has 'single-point fuel injection' in the fuel system column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- The second row is about a 1.6 ie engine. It's a petrol engine, and its fuel system is 'single - point fuel injection'. That matches exactly what the claim is saying.\n- Other petrol engines like 2.0 ie have 'multi - point fuel injection', which doesn't apply here.\n\nSo this specific row (row index 1) has a petrol engine with single-point fuel injection, supporting the claim. \n\nI don't see any other relevant cells because the rest either are diesel or have different types of fuel systems. So the relevant cell is at row index 1 under 'fuel system' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 1996 - 1999 there be a diesel engine with indirect injection and 1.9 td.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two main parts. It mentions two specific attributes: \n1. Diesel engine type (specifically \"1.9 td\")\n2. Injection method (\"indirect injection\")\n\nThe time frame is 1996 - 1999. I'll need to look through the table and check if any engine fits all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are: model, engine, displacement, valvetrain, fuel system, max power at rpm, max torque at rpm, years.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for diesel engines within 1996-1999. The third row is \"diesel engines\" as a general category, but it seems to have multiple entries under that in the rows below.\n\nFocusing on the specific model \"1.9 td\". Scanning down, I see:\n- Row with index 8: model is \"1.9 td\", engine is \"psa xud9\", displacement 1905 cc, sohc 8v, indirect injection, max power 4000 rpm, torque 2250 rpm, years 1996-1999.\n- Another row for \"1.9 td\" with index 9: same model but engine \"psa dw8\", different torque.\n\nThis row at index 8 has the exact model \"1.9 td\" and is a diesel engine with indirect injection. The years match 1996 - 1999.\n\nNow, checking if there's an entry for this in the table. Yes, row index 8 meets all criteria: it's a diesel engine (fuel system column says 'diesel engines'), model is \"1.9 td\", and the fuel system is indirect injection.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"model\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"years\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the engine psa xud9 have an indirect injection fuel system\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it mentions two things about the PSA XUD9 engine\u2014specifically that it uses an indirect injection fuel system. So, my task is to find any relevant cells in the table that can confirm or deny this.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different engine model, and within each row, there are columns for various specs like model, engine, displacement, valvetrain, fuel system, max power, etc. The key column for our claim is \"fuel system.\"\n\nI need to identify which rows have the engine model as \"psa xud9.\" Let's scan through the table:\n\n1. The first row after the headers seems to be a general category, but I think it might not be specific enough. However, looking at the data, the second row is about \"1.6 ie,\" third about \"2.0 ie,\" and then starting from fourth row, we have diesel engines.\n\nWait, the fourth row is \"diesel engines\" as a whole. Then, looking further down, I see rows for \"1.9 d,\" \"1.9 d,\" and \"1.9 td.\" Hmm, but where is \"psa xud9\"?\n\nLooking more carefully: The fifth row has \"1.9 d\" with engine \"psa xud9,\" displacement 1905 cc, valvetrain sohc 8v, fuel system indirect injection, etc.\n\nSo, the relevant row for PSA XUD9 is the fifth one. Now, in that row, the \"fuel system\" column says \"indirect injection,\" which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, I need to check if this is the case. So, the relevant cells would be the row index where engine is XUD9 and the fuel system column.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to provide a list of objects with row_index and column_name. So, for each relevant cell, we have to specify which columns are checked.\n\nIn this case, the claim is about two things: that the engine is PSA XUD9 and that the fuel system is indirect injection.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table structure, I realize that each row's first <td> is the model, so for example, in the fifth row, the first cell is \"1.9 d,\" but then the second cell is \"psa xud9.\" So, perhaps I need to check if the engine is XUD9 and the fuel system.\n\nBut actually, the claim is about the engine's fuel system being indirect injection. So, in the table, for each row that has engine as XUD9, we should look at the fuel system column.\n\nWait, but in the fifth row, the model is \"1.9 d,\" not \"psa xud9.\" Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 0: petrol engines\n- Row 1: 1.6 ie\n- Row 2: 2.0 ie\n- Row 3: diesel engines (general)\n- Row 4: 1.9 d with PSA XUD9 engine\n- Row 5: another 1.9 d with PSA DW8\n- Row 6: 1.9 td\n- Row 7: 2.0 JTD\n\nWait, so in row 4, the first <td> is \"1.9 d,\" and the second cell is \"psa xud9.\" So the engine model for that row is PSA XUD9.\n\nTherefore, in row 4 (row index 4), the fuel system column has the value \"indirect injection.\" So that matches the claim.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table, I see that row indices start from 0. So row 1 is 1.6 ie, row 2 is 2.0 ie, row 3 is diesel engines, row 4 is 1.9 d with XUD9, and so on.\n\nSo to confirm the claim, we need to look at the \"fuel system\" column in row 4, which indeed says \"indirect injection.\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For row index 4 (which corresponds to the fifth row in the HTML table), check the \"fuel system\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The PSA XUD9 engine has an indirect injection fuel system as specified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"a diesel engine that be 2.0 jtd from 1997 have common rail direct injection\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's about a specific diesel engine: 2.0 JTD from 1997, and it should have common rail direct injection.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the \"model\" column mentions \"2.0 jtd\". There are two such rows: one with row_index 5 and another with row_index 6.\n\nRow 5: \n- Model: 2.0 JTD\n- Engine: PSA DW10\n- Displacement: 1997 cc\n- Valvetrain: SOHC 8v\n- Fuel system: Common rail direct injection\n- Max power at rpm: 4000\n- Max torque: 1750\n- Years: 1999 - 2006\n\nRow 6:\n- Model: 2.0 JTD 1\n- Engine: PSA DW10\n- Displacement: 1997 cc\n- Valvetrain: DOHC 16v\n- Fuel system: Common rail direct injection\n- Max power at rpm: 4000\n- Max torque: 1750\n- Years: 2000 - 2006\n\nWait, the claim refers to a 1997 model. Looking back, both rows for 2.0 JTD start from 1999 onwards. So there's no row for 1997. That might be an issue.\n\nBut the claim says \"from 1997\", so I need to check if any row in 1997 exists. Scanning through the table, the earliest diesel entries are 1.9 D and 1.9 TD from 1996-1999, then 2.0 JTD from 1999 onwards. So no entry for 1997.\n\nHowever, the relevant cells might not necessarily be just the ones in 1997 because perhaps the claim is making a general statement about 2.0 JTD engines regardless of the year, but it specifically mentions \"from 1997\". \n\nLooking at row 5 (1999-2006), the fuel system column says \"common rail direct injection\", which matches the claim.\n\nSo even though there's no entry for 1997 in the table, the 2.0 JTD model starting from 1999 does have common rail direct injection. Therefore, it seems like the claim is true based on the available data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because a diesel engine with the 2.0 JTD model, specifically from PSA DW10 and produced between 1999-2006, has common rail direct injection as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"a fuel system with multi point fuel injection also have dohc 16 volt\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems to be stating that if a fuel system uses multi-point fuel injection, then it also has a DOHC (Double Overhead Camshaft) 16-volt setup. Wait, actually, looking closer, I think there might be a typo in \"dohc 16 volt\" because DOHC refers to the camshaft type and voltage isn't part of that terminology. Maybe they meant \"DOHC 16v\" as in a 16-valve engine? Or perhaps it's an incorrect phrase. But the key is that the claim links multi-point fuel injection with having a specific type of valvetrain, which I think is what \"DOHC\" refers to.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a different engine model with various attributes like displacement, valvetrain, fuel system, max power, torque, and years. The columns are model, engine, displacement, valvetrain, fuel system, max power at rpm, max torque at rpm, and years.\n\nThe claim is about the relationship between multi-point fuel injection and having a DOHC 16v valvetrain. So I need to check if any rows where the fuel system is multi-point also have a DOHC 16v valvetrain.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. The first row after headers seems to be all petrol engines, but that might not be relevant.\n2. The second row: model is \"2.0 ie\", engine is \"psa ew10\", displacement 1997 cc, valvetrain \"dohc 16v\", fuel system \"multi - point fuel injection\". So here, multi-point fuel injection corresponds to DOHC 16v. That's a match.\n3. The third row: diesel engines, not relevant for the claim since it's about petrol.\n4. Fourth row: model is \"1.9 d\", engine \"psa xud9\", displacement 1905 cc, valvetrain \"sohc 8v\", fuel system \"indirect injection\". Doesn't match.\n5. Fifth row: another 1.9 d with PSA DW8, same as above, so no match.\n6. Sixth row: \"1.9 td\" with PSA XUD9, sohc 8v, indirect injection. No match.\n7. Seventh row: \"2.0 jtd\", PSA DW10, dohc 16v, common rail direct injection. But the fuel system is diesel, so not applicable for the claim which is about multi-point in petrol engines.\n8. Eighth row: \"2.0 jtd 1\" with same engine as above but DOHC, again diesel.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the second row is a petrol engine with multi-point fuel injection and DOHC 16v valvetrain. So that supports the claim. But are there any other examples? The fourth to eighth rows are diesel, so they don't apply since the claim is about fuel systems in general, but specifically, the term \"multi-point\" in the table is under petrol engines.\n\nSo only the second row has multi-point and DOHC 16v. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are that specific row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the second row in the table where a fuel system with multi-point injection is associated with a DOHC 16v valvetrain.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"valvetrain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the engine psa dw10 have an indirect injection fuel system.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the engine model mentioned in the claim, which is \"psa dw10.\" I'll go through each row of the table to find where this engine appears.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. The first row after the headers lists \"1.6 ie\" and others, so not relevant.\n2. Next is \"2.0 ie,\" still not matching.\n3. Then we have diesel engines which also don't match.\n4. Now I see a row with \"1.9 d\" using psa xud9. Not the one I'm looking for.\n5. Another \"1.9 d\" with psa dw8. Still not matching the engine model in the claim.\n6. Next is \"1.9 td\" with psa xud9 again, not relevant.\n7. Then there's a row with \"2.0 jtd\" and psa dw10 as engine. This seems to match because it's psa dw10.\n\nNow that I've found the matching engine, I'll check the fuel system column for this row. The column name is \"fuel system,\" so I look at its value. It says \"common rail direct injection.\"\n\nWait, the claim says \"indirect injection fuel system.\" But in the table, psa dw10 has common rail direct injection, not indirect. Common rail is a type of direct injection, so it's different from indirect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the engine psa dw10 uses direct injection, not indirect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 1996 - 1999 there be a diesel engine with single - point fuel injection.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any diesel engines that fall within the years 1996-1999 and have single-point fuel injection.\n\nLooking at the table, the models are categorized under 'model', which includes both petrol and diesel engines. For diesel engines, the relevant rows are:\n\n1. <tr> for \"diesel engines\" (this is probably a header or category)\n2. <tr> with model 1.9 d, PSA XUD9\n3. Another <tr> for 1.9 d, PSA DW8\n4. <tr> for 1.9 td, PSA XUD9\n5. <tr> for 2.0 JTD, PSA DW10\n\nNow, focusing on the years 1996-1999:\n\nThe first diesel entry is under 1.9 d with PSA XUD9, years 1996-1999. The 'fuel system' column for this model says \"indirect injection.\" So it's not single-point fuel injection.\n\nNext, the second diesel row in 1999-2006 (model 1.9 d, PSA DW8) is outside our range.\n\nThen, the 1.9 td has years 1996-1999 but again, indirect injection.\n\nThe last one, 2.0 JTD from 1999-2006: also not in our target years and I think it's common rail direct injection, which isn't single-point either.\n\nSo none of the diesel engines in 1996-1999 have single-point fuel injection. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that within 1996-1999, there was a diesel engine with single-point fuel injection.

Diesel engine\n2. Model number: 2.0 jtd\n3. Year: 1997\n4. Fuel injection type: multi-point\n\nI'll start by locating the relevant row in the table. Looking at the \"model\" column, I see that one of the rows is \"2.0 jtd\". The corresponding row index is 5 (since it's the sixth row starting from 0). \n\nNext, I check the \"years\" column for this model to confirm if it includes 1997. According to the table, the years for the \"2.0 jtd\" engine are listed as 1999 - 2006. This means that while the model exists in the table, it's from 1999 onwards and doesn't include 1997. Therefore, there's no record of a \"2.0 jtd\" diesel engine from 1997.\n\nSince the claim refers to a specific year (1997) that isn't present for the \"2.0 jtd\" model in the table, the claim isn't supported by the provided data. \n\nI should also verify if any other rows might have matching details.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"this table includes petrol engines that have indirect injection\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that within the table, there are petrol engines which use indirect injection. So, I need to look through the table to find any petrol engines (under the 'model' column) and check if their fuel system is indirect injection.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns include model, engine, displacement, valvetrain, fuel system, max power at rpm, max torque at rpm, and years. The rows have various models, which are either petrol or diesel engines.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for models that are petrol engines. \n\n1. The first row is \"petrol engines\" as the model, but it's a general term, so I'm not sure if it refers to specific engines. It might be better to look at the other rows where specific models are listed.\n\n2. Next, there's \"1.6 ie\", which I think stands for 1.6 liter engine with something else, maybe indirect injection? Wait, no, in the 'fuel system' column for this row, it says \"single - point fuel injection\". So that's not indirect.\n\n3. Then, \"2.0 ie\" refers to a 2.0-liter engine. The fuel system here is \"multi - point fuel injection\", which again isn't indirect.\n\n4. The next set of rows are diesel engines, so I can skip those since the claim is about petrol engines.\n\n5. Now, looking at the 1.9 d models: one has \"indirect injection\" in the fuel system. So that's a petrol engine (model is 1.9 d) with indirect injection. Wait, but is it a petrol or diesel? The model column says \"1.9 d\", and earlier in the table, under 'engine' for this row, it's \"psa xud9\" which is known to be a diesel engine. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, no, hold on. In the table, under the 'model' column, it says \"1.9 d\", but in the 'engine' column, it's specified as \"psa xud9\" and other engines for the 1.9 d rows are also marked as diesel engines in the 'model' and 'engine' columns. So actually, those are diesel engines, not petrol.\n\nWait, so I need to correct myself: when looking at the models, the 1.9 d is under the 'model' column, but in the 'engine' column, it's specified as \"psa xud9\", which is a diesel engine. So that's not a petrol engine.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.\n\nLooking again at the table:\n\n- The first two rows after the header are for specific petrol engines: 1.6 ie and 2.0 ie, both with different fuel systems but still under 'petrol engines' in the model column? Wait no, the model column lists them as \"petrol engines\", \"1.6 ie\", \"2.0 ie\", etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table:\n\nIn the first data row after the header, all columns are filled with \"petrol engines\". Then, the next rows have specific models like \"1.6 ie\" and so on. Wait, that might be a mistake in how I'm interpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model column has entries like \"1.6 ie\", which is a specific petrol engine model, while other entries are more generic.\n\nWait, maybe the table's 'model' column lists different engine models, some of which are petrol and others diesel. So to clarify:\n\n- The first data row after the header seems to list general categories: all cells say \"petrol engines\", but perhaps that's a mistake or perhaps it's indicating something else.\n\nBut then in subsequent rows, specific models are listed. For example, \"1.6 ie\" is a model, \"2.0 ie\" another, etc., and these are under the 'model' column. So I think each row represents a different engine model, either petrol or diesel.\n\nSo, to find petrol engines with indirect injection, I need to look for rows where:\n\n- The 'model' is a petrol engine (so not diesel)\n- In that row, the 'fuel system' is \"indirect injection\"\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First data row: model = \"petrol engines\", but it's unclear if this refers to specific models or just a category.\n\n2. Next row: model = \"1.6 ie\". Fuel system column says \"single - point fuel injection\".\n\n3. Then, model = \"2.0 ie\". Fuel system is \"multi - point fuel injection\".\n\n4. Next rows are diesel engines, so I can skip them as the claim is about petrol.\n\nWait, but perhaps the 'model' column isn't correctly indicating the type of engine. Maybe in some rows, the 'model' is \"petrol engines\", while others have specific models like \"1.6 ie\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is a different model, and the 'model' column indicates whether it's petrol or diesel based on the name.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to list out all the rows with their details:\n\nRow 0 (first data row):\n- model: petrol engines\n- engine: petrol engines\n- displacement: ...\n- valvetrain: ...\n- fuel system: petrol engines\n- power and torque: ...\n- years: ...\n\nBut wait, in the 'fuel system' column, it says \"petrol engines\". Wait no, that can't be right. Let me check the table again.\n\nWait, looking at the table provided:\n\nThe first data row after headers has all columns filled with \"petrol engines\". So model is \"petrol engines\", engine is \"petrol engines\", displacement, valvetrain, fuel system, etc., all say \"petrol engines\". That seems odd. Maybe that's a general category or perhaps an error.\n\nBut then in the next rows:\n\nRow 1: model = \"1.6 ie\", engine = \"1.6 ie\", fuel system = \"single - point\"\n\nRow 2: model = \"2.0 ie\", engine = \"2.0 ie\", fuel system = \"multi - point\"\n\nThen rows 3-5 are diesel engines, as the model and engine columns have terms like \"diesel engine\".\n\nSo in this table, only the first data row after header is \"petrol engines\" across all columns, which might be a general category.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'model' column lists specific models, and sometimes they are petrol or diesel. So I need to check each model to see if it's petrol and has indirect injection.\n\nBut in the table, only the first data row is labeled as \"petrol engines\" across all columns. The other rows have different models.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the 'model' column refers to specific engine types, and some are petrol, others diesel.\n\nSo to find petrol engines with indirect injection, I need to check for any model in the 'model' column that is a petrol engine (so not diesel) and has \"indirect injection\" in the 'fuel system' column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: all cells say \"petrol engines\". So if this refers to specific models, then perhaps it's a petrol engine. The fuel system here is \"petrol engines\", which doesn't make sense because fuel systems are either indirect or not. Wait, no, the 'fuel system' column in row 0 says \"petrol engines\" as well? That can't be right. Maybe there was a mistake in how the table is structured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first data row is a header for petrol engines, and the subsequent rows are specific models under that category. But that doesn't make much sense because the 'model' column then repeats \"petrol engines\" as well.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The claim is that there exists at least one petrol engine in the table with indirect injection.\n\nSo, looking for any row where:\n\n- Model is a petrol engine (so not diesel)\n- Fuel system column says \"indirect injection\"\n\nNow, checking each row:\n\nRow 0: model = \"petrol engines\", fuel system = \"petrol engines\". This seems unclear. If the model is \"petrol engines\", perhaps it's a category, and the 'fuel system' for this category might not be directly applicable or correct.\n\nRows 1-2: models are specific (\"1.6 ie\" and \"2.0 ie\"), fuel systems are \"single - point\" and \"multi - point\", neither is indirect injection.\n\nRows 3-5: diesel engines, so they don't count for the claim about petrol.\n\nSo, based on this, I can't find any row where both conditions are met: model is a petrol engine and fuel system is indirect injection. Therefore, there's no such engine in the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the 'model' column isn't correctly indicating whether it's petrol or diesel. For example, sometimes \"1.6 ie\" could be an inline engine (indicating possibly petrol). Or maybe \"ie\" stands for something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'fuel system' column in row 0 is a mistake and should say \"indirect injection\", but as it's currently written, it says \"petrol engines\".\n\nSo, if I consider that row 0 is a specific engine (model = petrol engines), and its fuel system is also \"petrol engines\", which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps there are no petrol engines in the table with indirect injection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to interpret it differently. If row 0 is a header for all petrol engines, then perhaps within that category, some engines have indirect injection. But the 'fuel system' column says \"petrol engines\" which again doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I've considered all possibilities and concluded that there are no petrol engines in the table with indirect injection.\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the provided data, we can determine that there are no petrol engines within the listed specifications that utilize an indirect fuel injection system. \n\n**Answer:** There are no petrol engines with indirect injection in the given data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"a fuel system with multi point fuel injection also have sohc 8 volt.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what each part of the claim means. The term \"multi point fuel injection\" refers to a fuel system where the engine has multiple points where fuel is injected into the cylinders. In the table, looking at the 'fuel system' column, there are several options: single-point fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection.\n\nNext, I look for cells that have \"multi-point fuel injection.\" From the table, in row 2 (model 2.0 ie), the fuel system is \"multi - point fuel injection\". So this row has a model with multi-point fuel injection.\n\nNow, I need to check if this same row also mentions something about an SOHC 8V engine. Looking at the 'valvetrain' column in that row, it says \"dohc 16v.\" DOHC stands for Double Overhead Camshaft, which is different from SOHC (Single Overhead Camshaft). So this row doesn't have SOHC 8V.\n\nI should check all rows where fuel system is multi-point. Looking further, I don't see any other models with \"multi - point fuel injection.\" The only one is the 2.0 ie model in row 2. Since that row's valvetrain isn't SOHC 8V but DOHC 16V, it doesn't support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported because there's no matching model with both multi-point fuel injection and SOHC 8V.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, I examined all rows for \"multi - point fuel injection\" in the 'fuel system' column. The only relevant row is the 2.0 ie engine, which has a DOHC valvetrain, not SOHC 8V.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"valvetrain\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
