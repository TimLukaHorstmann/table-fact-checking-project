    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's stating that there doesn't exist a player draft (from Tennessee State) where the player's rank is below 261.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a round, overall rank, player name, position, and school/club team. The relevant columns here are \"round\", \"overall\", \"player\", \"position\", and \"school / club team\".\n\nI need to focus on players from Tennessee State. From the table, I'll scan through each row to check if any player is from Tennessee State with an overall rank less than 261.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Round 1: school is 'houston' \u2192 Not Tennessee State.\n- Round 2: school is 'wisconsin' and 'oklahoma'.\n- Round 3: Kentucky.\n- Round 4: Colorado.\n- Round 5: USC.\n- Round 6: LSU and Minnesota.\n- Round 7: Texas A&M.\n- Round 8: San Diego State.\n- Round 9: Duke and Mississippi.\n- Round 10: Tennessee State. The player here is John Henry Smith with overall rank 261.\n\nWait, the claim says \"rank lower than 261\". So 261 is not lower than itself. But I should check if there's any player from Tennessee State with a rank less than 261.\n\nIn this table, only one player is from Tennessee State (Row 10). Their rank is exactly 261. There are no other players from Tennessee State in the table with a rank below 261.\n\nSo, based on this, there isn't any player draft from Tennessee State with a lower rank than 261. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because it correctly states that such a draft doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
