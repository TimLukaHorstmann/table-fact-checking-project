    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography do not go to william ivey long\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography was not awarded to William Ivey Long. So, my goal is to check if there's any information in the table that supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various awards, including Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards, along with details like the category and who received them. The specific award we're interested in is \"outstanding choreography\" under the \"Drama Desk Award\" category for the year 2005.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to find the relevant entries. Let's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **First Row**: This is about the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. It mentions that the award was won, but it doesn't pertain to choreography or William Ivey Long.\n\n2. **Second Row**: Another Tony Award entry, this time for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. The nominee here is Gary Beach, so not relevant.\n\n3. **Third Row**: This row discusses the Tony Award for Best Choreography, which was won by Jerry Mitchell. Not relevant since we're looking at Drama Desk Awards and William Ivey Long isn't mentioned here.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: This is about the Tony Award for Best Costume Design, and William Ivey Long is the nominee here, but it's under a different award category (Tony), not Drama Desk. So, even if he didn't win this one, that doesn't impact our claim about the Drama Desk.\n\n5. **Fifth Row**: Here, we have the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical, which was won by the same-named entry. Not related to choreography or William Ivey Long.\n\n6. **Sixth Row**: This is where things get relevant. The row mentions that in 2005, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography went to Jerry Mitchell. So, this shows that someone else received the award, not William Ivey Long.\n\n7. **Seventh Row**: Another Drama Desk Award entry, but it's for Outstanding Costume Design, and the nominee is William Ivey Long. However, the result here is \"nominated,\" meaning he didn't win this particular award. But since we're focusing on Outstanding Choreography, this row doesn't directly support our claim.\n\nFrom the table, in 2005, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography was awarded to Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long. There's no indication that William Ivey Long received any Drama Desk Award in 2005 related to choreography. In fact, he was only nominated for Best Costume Design but didn't win it.\n\nSo, based on this information, the claim is TRUE because the data shows that the award did not go to William Ivey Long. The relevant cells are the one where Jerry Mitchell won the Outstanding Choreography award (row 6) and perhaps the one where William was nominated for costume design (row 7), but since he didn't win in that category, it's more about showing that he didn't receive the choreography award.\n\nI should make sure to list only the relevant cells that directly pertain to the claim. The sixth row is definitely relevant because it shows the winner of Outstanding Choreography, and the seventh row indirectly supports by showing William was nominated but didn't win in another category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony award be qilliam ivey long\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions a nominee for the best costume design at the Tony Award in 2005, and the name given is \"qilliam ivey long\". Wait, I notice that there's a typo here: it should be \"William Ivey Long\", not \"qilliam\". Maybe that's a clue.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find cells related to best costume design in 2005 under the Tony Award. The columns relevant here are 'year', 'award', 'category', 'nominee', and 'result'.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\n1. First row: It's about the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. Nominee is also that same category, so not relevant.\n2. Second row: Nominates Gary Beach for performance. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: Won by Jerry Mitchell for choreography. Not relevant.\n4. Fourth row: Nominated William Ivey Long for costume design. This seems relevant because it's about best costume design at the Tony Award in 2005, and the nominee is William Ivey Long.\n   \nI notice that the claim has a typo, using \"qilliam\" instead of \"William\". So if the claim uses an incorrect name, it might be false unless the table shows someone else with that name. Let me check the other rows for any mention of costume design.\n\nLooking further:\n- The fifth row is about Drama Desk Award, so not relevant.\n- Sixth row: Won by Jerry Mitchell for choreography, again not relevant.\n- Seventh row: Nominated William Ivey Long for outstanding costume design at Drama Desk, but the award is different here. So this isn't part of Tony Award.\n\nSo, in the table, under Tony Award in 2005, the only relevant cell is the fourth row where William Ivey Long was nominated for best costume design. The claim correctly mentions the category and year but has a typo in the name. However, the user might have made that mistake, so perhaps we should overlook it if the actual table matches.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"qilliam ivey long\", which is incorrect. The correct name is William Ivey Long, as per the table. So the claim has an error in the name, making it false because the nominee's name doesn't match.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the statement against the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Award and Year**: The claim specifies \"Tony Award\" and \"2005\". This matches the fourth row in the table where William Ivey Long was nominated for best costume design at the Tony Award.\n\n2. **Category**: The claim mentions \"best costume design\", which aligns with the 'category' column in the fourth row of the table.\n\n3. **Nominee Name**: The claim refers to \"qilliam ivey long\". However, in the table, the correct name is \"William Ivey Long\". This discrepancy suggests a possible typo or error in the claim.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim correctly identifies the award, year, and category but incorrectly states the nominee's name. Since the name provided does not match the table data, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 2 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what the claim is saying. It's stating that Jerry Mitchell was one of two winners for a Tony Award. So, I need to check if in any row where the nominee is Jerry Mitchell, there's a 'won' result in the Tony category.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award event with details like year, award name, category, nominee, and whether they won or were nominated.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony award\n   - Category: Best revival of a musical\n   - Nominee: Best revival of a musical\n   - Result: Won\n   - Since the nominee here is \"best revival...\", not Jerry Mitchell, this row doesn't apply.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony award\n   - Category: Best performance by a leading actor in a musical\n   - Nominee: Gary Beach\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Again, the nominee is Gary Beach, not Jerry Mitchell.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony award\n   - Category: Best choreography\n   - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n   - Result: Won\n   - Here, the nominee is Jerry Mitchell and the result is 'won'. This row is relevant because it shows that Jerry Mitchell won a Tony award.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony award\n   - Category: Best costume design\n   - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Not relevant since the nominee isn't Jerry Mitchell.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Drama desk award\n   - Category: Outstanding revival of a musical\n   - Nominee: Outstanding revival of a musical\n   - Result: Won\n   - Not relevant as the nominee is not Jerry Mitchell.\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Drama desk award\n   - Category: Outstanding choreography\n   - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n   - Result: Won\n   - This row also shows Jerry Mitchell winning a Drama Desk award, but the claim is specifically about a Tony award.\n\n7. **Row 6**:\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Drama desk award\n   - Category: Outstanding costume design\n   - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Not relevant.\n\nSo, focusing on the claim about a Tony award, I look for any rows where Jerry Mitchell was the nominee and the result is 'won' in the Tony category. Only Row 2 meets this criterion. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row. However, I should check if there are other instances or if perhaps another Tony award category also lists Jerry Mitchell.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, all entries for the Tony award and Drama Desk awards. The only two times Jerry Mitchell is a nominee are in Rows 2 (Tony choreography) and Row 5 (Drama choreography), both with 'won' results. So, he won one Tony award, which makes him one of possibly more than two winners? Or was it a specific category that had two winners?\n\nThe claim says \"1 of 2 winner\", implying that in the particular award category, there were two winners. From Row 2, Jerry Mitchell won Best Choreography. I need to check if in that specific category, he was indeed one of two winners.\n\nLooking at the table's column 'result', for the Tony award and category Best choreography (Row 2), only Jerry Mitchell is marked as 'won'. There are no other entries in that row, so it seems he was the sole winner. Therefore, the claim that he was \"1 of 2\" might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The table only shows one row for Best Choreography, and only Jerry Mitchell is listed there with a 'won' result. So if the claim says he was one of two winners, but according to this data, he was the sole winner in that category, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut I should check all relevant cells. The relevant cells are Row 2, column 'result' because it shows he won a Tony award. But since it's only him, not two people, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if the table has another nominee for Best Choreography who also won. Looking at the table, in the same year and category, no other entries exist beyond Row 2. So Jerry Mitchell was the only winner in that category.\n\nTherefore, the claim stating he was one of two winners is FALSE because there's only him as the winner.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is where Jerry Mitchell won a Tony award for Best Choreography, but since it's alone, the claim about being one of two winners is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several rows and columns: year, award, category, nominee, result.\n\nI'm looking for any row where the nominee is Jerry Mitchell and the award is a Drama Desk Award. Then, I need to check if he was one of three nominees. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about the Tony Awards, so I can skip that.\n2. Second row: nominee is Gary Beach, not Jerry Mitchell.\n3. Third row: nominee is Jerry Mitchell for Choreography, and the award is a Drama Desk Award. So this is relevant because it's about Jerry being nominated for a Drama Desk Award.\n4. Fourth row: nominee is William Ivey Long, so not Jerry.\n5. Fifth row: same category but different nominees, so skip.\n6. Sixth row: same as third row, so this is the second instance where Jerry Mitchell is a nominee for Choreography and the award is Drama Desk.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table again:\n\n- Row 2 (index 0) is for Tony Award, Choreography, but not Drama Desk.\n- Row 3 (index 1): Drama Desk, Choreography, Jerry Mitchell. Result is won.\n- Row 4 (index 2): Drama Desk, Costume Design, William Ivey Long. Nominated.\n- So in row 3, the result is 'won', which might be a bit confusing because being one of three nominees usually results in either winning or not. But in this case, the claim says he's one of three nominees for the award.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, in 2005, under Drama Desk Awards:\n\n- For outstanding choreography, Jerry Mitchell won.\n- Also, for outstanding costume design, William Ivey Long was nominated.\n\nBut the claim is about being one of three nominees. So perhaps the relevant rows are where he was a nominee for a category that had multiple nominees.\n\nIn the table, in 2005, under Drama Desk Awards:\n\n- outstanding choreography: Jerry Mitchell won.\n- outstanding costume design: William Ivey Long was nominated.\n\nBut from the table, it seems that for Choreography, only one person is listed as winning. So perhaps the claim is referring to a specific category where he was among three nominees but didn't win?\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nRow 5 (index 4): Drama Desk Award, outstanding revival of musical, same nominee, won.\n\nRow 6 (index 5): Drama Desk Award, outstanding choreography, Jerry Mitchell, won.\n\nSo in row 6, he was the sole winner for Choreography. So if the claim says he's one of three nominees, that would require there to be two other nominees in that category. But from the table, it only lists him as a single nominee. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table may not list all nominees but just the ones who either won or were nominated. So perhaps the relevant cells are rows where Jerry Mitchell is a nominee for a Drama Desk Award, regardless of whether he was one of three.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- In row 3 (index 1): category is Choreography, award is Drama Desk, nominee is Jerry Mitchell, result won.\n- Row 6 (index 5): same as above.\n\nSo in both cases, he's a single nominee for Choreography and won. So does that mean he wasn't part of a group of three? Or maybe the table doesn't list all three nominees?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if there are any other Drama Desk Award rows where Jerry Mitchell is a nominee. From the table, only two rows: row 3 and row 6.\n\nIn both cases, he's the sole nominee for Choreography. So that would mean he wasn't one of three, but actually just one. Therefore, the claim might be false because he was not part of three nominees; he was a single nominee who won.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps the table only lists winners and nominees, so in the category of Choreography for Drama Desk, Jerry Mitchell is listed as a winner, meaning he was one of three or more nominees who competed but only he won.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"be 1 of 3 nominee,\" which would require that there were three people nominated before him. If the table shows only him being nominated in that category, then it's not true. But if the table doesn't list all three, perhaps it's possible. However, based on what's shown, he's alone as a nominee for Choreography.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about being a nominee for a Drama Desk Award, regardless of winning or losing. If the table shows him being nominated, then yes, he was a nominee, and if there were three nominees in that category, including himself, then the claim is true.\n\nBut from the table, I only see two entries related to Drama Desk Awards:\n\n- outstanding choreography: Jerry Mitchell (won)\n- outstanding costume design: William Ivey Long (nominated)\n\nSo in Choreography, he was alone. Therefore, he wasn't one of three nominees but just one. Thus, the claim is false because he wasn't part of a group of three nominees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 3: Drama Desk Award, Choreography, Jerry Mitchell, result won.\nRow 6: same category, same person, same award, same result.\n\nSo in both cases, it's just him being the winner. No other nominees are listed for that category, so he can't be one of three. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award\" is true, we check the table for any instances where Jerry Mitchell was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as part of a group of three.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Row 3 (index 1)**: Jerry Mitchell received a Drama Desk Award for Choreography and won.\n- **Row 6 (index 5)**: Same as above, he won again for the same category.\n\nIn both cases, only one person is listed as being nominated and winning. There's no indication of three nominees in his category from the table provided. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because Jerry Mitchell was not part of a group of three nominees but rather a single nominee who won the award.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"gary beach be 1 of 4 nominee for a tony award.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if Gary Beach is listed as a nominee for a Tony Award. The table has several rows under different awards like Tony and Drama Desk.\n\nLooking at the first few rows, the fourth column is \"nominee\". In the second row, I see Gary Beach's name in the nominee column, and the award is a Tony. So that matches part of the claim\u2014Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award.\n\nNow, the claim also says he was \"1 of 4 nominees.\" From the table, I need to check how many times Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award. In row 2, his name appears once as a nominee. But are there more? Checking other rows, I don't see another entry for Gary Beach under the \"nominee\" column in any award category. So it looks like he was only nominated once.\n\nWait, but the claim says he's one of four nominees. That would mean there should be three others alongside him. Looking at the table, in row 2, the other columns are \"award\" and \"result.\" The other nominees for that award (best performance by a leading actor) aren't listed here, so maybe the table doesn't include them. But according to the provided data, Gary Beach was only one of the nominees in that specific category.\n\nHowever, the claim doesn't specify which Tony Award category he was nominated in. Since row 2 is about the best performance by a leading actor, and he was indeed a nominee there, it's possible that there were other nominees in that category not listed here. But the table doesn't provide information on the number of nominees beyond what's shown.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 of 4 nominees.\" If Gary Beach was one of four, then I need to see if the data supports this. From row 2, it shows only his name as a nominee for that award, so perhaps in the actual context, there were three others, making him one of four. The table might not list all nominees, but based on what's given, he was at least a nominee.\n\nSo, the relevant part is that Gary Beach is listed as a nominee for a Tony Award, which supports the first part of the claim. However, whether he was exactly one of four depends on context beyond the table. But since the table shows he was nominated once, it might be sufficient to say he was one of the nominees, even if the exact number isn't clear here.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"1 of 4,\" which implies that there were three others. The table doesn't specify how many were nominated in that category. So maybe the correct answer is false because we don't know from the table whether he was part of a group of four.\n\nWait no, the claim's wording is about being one of four nominees for any Tony Award, not necessarily the same category. Looking at the table, Gary Beach is only listed once as a nominee in the Tony Awards. So if that's the case, maybe there were more than just three other nominees across different categories. But the claim specifies \"a tony award,\" so it could be any category.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the table only shows Gary Beach being nominated once. The claim says he was one of four nominees for a Tony Award, meaning there should have been three others in his category or across all categories. Since the table doesn't provide details on how many were nominated alongside him, it's unclear.\n\nBut the way the claim is phrased suggests that Gary Beach was indeed part of a group of four nominees. So even though the table only shows one nomination for him, perhaps in reality, there were three others. The table isn't comprehensive, so maybe the answer is true based on his actual nomination status beyond the table.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check each condition against the table and determine if it's fully supported. Since the table shows Gary Beach was a nominee for a Tony Award once, that supports the claim at least in part. But does it show he was one of four? The table doesn't specify the number of nominees per category, so we can't confirm from the table alone.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The claim says he was \"1 of 4,\" which implies there were three others. From the table, I only see him listed as a nominee once. Therefore, without knowing that there were more, maybe the claim isn't fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about being one of four nominees for any Tony Award. The table shows he was at least a nominee. It doesn't specify how many others were with him, but the key point is that he was a nominee. So the relevant cell is where Gary Beach is listed as a nominee for a Tony Award.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 2, column \"nominee\" because that's where his name appears as a nominee. Therefore, even though the table doesn't specify if there were four nominees, it does show he was at least one, which supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gary Beach was one of four nominees for a Tony Award. The table shows that Gary Beach was indeed nominated for a Tony Award in 2005. Therefore, this supports the first part of the claim. However, the table doesn't provide information about how many other nominees there were for that award category or in total. Since the claim specifies \"1 of 4,\" and the table only confirms one nomination, it's unclear if he was indeed part of a group of four without external data. Thus, based on the given table alone, the claim is not fully supported.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The claim is: \"willam ivey long win the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into key parts:\n- Name: William Ivey Long\n- Award: Drama Desk Award\n- Year: 2005\n- Category: Outstanding Choreography\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where the 'nominee' column is \"William Ivey Long\" and the 'result' is \"won.\" Also, the award type should be \"Drama Desk Award,\" and the year should be 2005.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row (row_index 0):**\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony Award\n   - Category: Best Revival of a Musical\n   - Nominee: Best Revival of a Musical\n   - Result: Won\n   - Doesn't match because the award is Tony, not Drama Desk.\n\n2. **Second Row (row_index 1):**\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony Award\n   - Category: Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\n   - Nominee: Gary Beach\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Doesn't match; different category and nominee.\n\n3. **Third Row (row_index 2):**\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony Award\n   - Category: Best Choreography\n   - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n   - Result: Won\n   - Not relevant because the award is Tony and the nominee isn't William Ivey Long.\n\n4. **Fourth Row (row_index 3):**\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Tony Award\n   - Category: Best Costume Design\n   - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Doesn't match because the result is 'nominated' and the category isn't Choreography.\n\n5. **Fifth Row (row_index 4):**\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Drama Desk Award\n   - Category: Outstanding Revival of a Musical\n   - Nominee: Outstanding Revival of a Musical\n   - Result: Won\n   - Doesn't match; nominee is the same as category, not William Ivey Long.\n\n6. **Sixth Row (row_index 5):**\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Drama Desk Award\n   - Category: Outstanding Choreography\n   - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n   - Result: Won\n   - Not relevant because the nominee isn't William Ivey Long.\n\n7. **Seventh Row (row_index 6):**\n   - Year: 2005\n   - Award: Drama Desk Award\n   - Category: Outstanding Costume Design\n   - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n   - Result: Nominated\n   - Doesn't match because the category is Costume Design, not Choreography.\n\nFrom this analysis, none of the rows match all parts of the claim. The claim states that William Ivey Long won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2005, but looking at the table, he was only nominated for Outstanding Costume Design, not Choreography. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the 2005 nominee for best costume design won the award.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like year, award, category, nominee, and result. My focus is on the 2005 entries because the claim mentions the 2005 nominee.\n\nLooking through each row for 2005, I see that there are two rows related to best costume design. The first one (row index 3) is under the 'drama desk award' category, with the nominee being 'william ivey long' and the result is 'nominated'. The second relevant row is also for 'best costume design' but I need to check if it's 2005. Wait, actually, in the table provided, only one row for 2005 has best costume design as the category. Let me confirm: \n\nIn the tbody, row indices go from 0 upwards. Row 3 (index 3) is for 'best costume design' under 'drama desk award'. So there's only one entry in 2005 for that category.\n\nNow, the claim says this nominee won the award. But according to the table, the result is 'nominated', not 'won'. That means the claim is incorrect because the nominee didn't win; they were just nominated.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row index 3, column 'result' because that's where we see the outcome. Therefore, since the result isn't a win, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 2005 nominee for best costume design won the award. Checking the table, in 2005, under the 'drama desk award', 'best costume design' category, the nominee 'william ivey long' was only nominated, not winning.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"jerry mitchell win 2 tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards. To verify this, I need to check the table for any entries where Jerry Mitchell was a nominee and whether he won in those categories.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award, category, nominee, and result. The relevant columns here are \"nominee\" and \"result.\" So, my focus should be on these two columns for Jerry Mitchell.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row (row_index 0):\n   - Nominee: best revival of a musical\n   - Result: won\n   Not relevant because the nominee is not Jerry Mitchell.\n\n2. Second row (row_index 1):\n   - Nominee: Gary Beach\n   - Result: nominated\n   Irrelevant as well; the nominee isn't Jerry.\n\n3. Third row (row_index 2):\n   - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n   - Category: best choreography\n   - Result: won\n   This is relevant because Jerry Mitchell won in this category. That's one Tony Award.\n\n4. Fourth row (row_index 3):\n   - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n   - Result: nominated\n   Not relevant here.\n\n5. Fifth row (row_index 4):\n   - Nominee: outstanding revival of a musical\n   - Result: won\n   Irrelevant since the nominee isn't Jerry.\n\n6. Sixth row (row_index 5):\n   - Nominee: Jerry Mitchell\n   - Category: outstanding choreography\n   - Result: won\n   Another win for Jerry Mitchell in this category. That's the second Tony Award.\n\n7. Seventh row (row_index 6):\n   - Nominee: William Ivey Long\n   - Result: nominated\n   Not relevant.\n\nSo, from rows 2 and 5, Jerry Mitchell has two wins in different categories: best choreography and outstanding choreography. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the table data.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The claim says \"win 2 tony award.\" Are these separate awards or a single award with multiple wins? Looking at the categories:\n\n- Best choreography (row 2)\n- Outstanding choreography (row 5)\n\nThese are two distinct categories, each resulting in a win for Jerry Mitchell. Therefore, he indeed won two Tony Awards.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are where \"nominee\" is Jerry Mitchell and the result is \"won.\" Those are rows 2 and 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions Jerry Mitchell being nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award. So I need to check if there's any data in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award and its details. The columns are year, award, category, nominee, and result. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. In 2005, Jerry Mitchell won for best choreography under the Tony Award.\n2. He also won outstanding choreography in the Drama Desk Award that same year.\n3. There's another row where William Ivey Long was nominated for outstanding costume design in the Drama Desk Awards.\n\nNow, focusing on Jerry Mitchell and the Drama Desk Award: he has two wins (rows 5 and 6) but no nominations. The claim says he was \"nominated\" three times. However, from the table, there's no record of him being nominated for a Drama Desk Award. He won twice, but that doesn't count as a nomination.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"be nominate,\" which might be a typo for \"nomination.\" So we're looking for instances where Jerry Mitchell was nominated, not just winning.\n\nIn the table, under Drama Desk Awards in 2005, there's only one instance with his name, and he won it. No entries show him being nominated. Therefore, the claim that he was nominated three times is false because the table doesn't support this.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It's saying that Gary Beach was one of four winners for a Tony Award. So, I should look through the table to see if Gary Beach won any Tony Awards in 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award category and whether someone won or was nominated. The first column is the year, which is 2005, so that's relevant. \n\nI'll check each row for the year 2005 where \"award\" is a Tony Award because the claim mentions a Tony Award specifically.\n\nRow 0: Year 2005, award is Tony Award, category is best revival of a musical. The nominee is also best revival, but since they both have \"won\", I think this might be the winning entry for that category.\nRow 1: Year 2005, award is Tony Award, category is best performance by a leading actor in a musical. Nominee is Gary Beach, and the result is nominated, so he didn't win here.\nRow 2: Year 2005, award is Tony Award, category is best choreography. Nominee is Jerry Mitchell, who won. So not Gary Beach.\nRow 3: Year 2005, award is Tony Award, category is best costume design. Nominee is William Ivey Long, result is nominated. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Year 2005, award is Drama Desk Award. Not relevant since the claim is about a Tony Award.\nRow 5: Year 2005, award is Drama Desk Award. Same as above.\n\nSo in the table, Gary Beach was only a nominee for a Tony Award in 2005 but didn't win. Therefore, he can't be one of the four winners because he didn't actually win that award. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"1 of 4 winner\", implying he was part of a group of four who each won different categories. But in row 0, the same person (best revival) won twice? Or maybe it's two people winning in separate categories.\n\nLooking at row 0: nominee and result are both \"won\". So that category was won by someone else, not Gary Beach. Therefore, Gary Beach only got nominated, so he didn't win any Tony Award in 2005. \n\nSo the claim is false because Gary Beach did not win a Tony Award in 2005. He was just nominated.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award,\" we check the table for entries where Gary Beach won a Tony Award in 2005.\n\n- **Year**: 2005\n- **Award**: Tony Award\n- **Nominee**: Gary Beach\n- **Result**: Nominated\n\nGary Beach was only nominated, not a winner. Therefore, he couldn't be one of four winners.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
