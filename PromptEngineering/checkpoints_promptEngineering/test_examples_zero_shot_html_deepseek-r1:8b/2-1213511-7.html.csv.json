    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about the table is true or false and then identify which cells in the table support that claim.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the toronto maple leaf of bemidji state university (wcha) draft a player from the united state.\" Hmm, let me break this down. It seems to be talking about the Toronto Maple Leafs drafting a player who is connected to Bemidji State University and whose nationality is United States.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different player with various attributes like their pick number, name, position, nationality, NHL team, and college/junior/club team. So, I need to find if there's a player in the table who meets all the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one. Starting from row 0:\n\n- Row 0: Player is Peter Harasym. His NHL team is Los Angeles Kings, and his college team is Clarkson University (ECAC). Not relevant because he's not connected to Bemidji State or Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nRow 1: Norm Dube plays for Los Angeles Kings, college team Sherbrooke Castors (QMJHL). Not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Bruce Abbey with Peterborough Petes (OH). No match.\n\nRow 3: Bobby Gerard is a Canadian playing for Philadelphia Flyers. Not US and not Bemidji.\n\nRow 4: Dale Smedsmo is from the US, plays left wing for Toronto Maple Leafs, college team Bemidji State University (WCHA). Okay, this seems relevant because his NHL team is Toronto Maple Leafs and his college team is Bemidji. His nationality is United States, which fits.\n\nWait, but let me check further rows to ensure there's no other player that also fits the claim. Continuing:\n\nRow 5: Dave Smith plays for St Louis Blues, college Regina Pats (WCHL). Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Peter Sullivan with Montreal Canadiens and Oshawa Generals (OH). No match.\n\nRow 7: Doug Keeler is Canadian, NY Rangers, Ottawa 67's (OH). Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 8: Jean-Denis Royal plays for NY Rangers, college team Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes. Not relevant.\n\nRow 9: Steve Johnson with Toronto Maple Leafs and Verdun Maple Leafs (QMJHL). His nationality is Canada, so doesn't match the US part of the claim.\n\nWait a second. Let's look back at row 4 again. Dale Smedsmo is from the US, plays for Toronto Maple Leafs, college team Bemidji State University. So, he was drafted by Toronto Maple Leafs and is from the US. That matches the claim: \"the toronto maple leaf of bemidji state university (wcha) draft a player from the united state.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if there's another player who also meets these criteria. Looking through all rows, only row 4 stands out as matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row 4, specifically the 'nhl team' and 'college / junior / club team' columns because those are where Toronto Maple Leafs and Bemidji State University (WCHA) are mentioned. Also, his nationality is Canada? Wait no, wait: Dale Smedsmo's nationality is United States according to the table. So in the claim, it says \"from the united state,\" which matches.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 4, columns 'nhl team' and 'college / junior / club team'. Let me check other rows again just to be thorough, but none seem to match all three criteria: being drafted by Toronto Maple Leafs, attending Bemidji State University, and being from the US.\n\nWait, one more thing. The claim says \"the toronto maple leaf of bemidji state university (wcha) draft a player from the united state.\" So it's about the action of drafting, which implies that the player was drafted by Toronto Maple Leafs while playing for Bemidji State University and is from the US.\n\nYes, row 4 fits perfectly. Therefore, I'll mark those cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if a player exists who is associated with both the Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL team) and Bemidji State University (college team), and is from the United States.\n\nUpon reviewing the table, **row 4** corresponds to **Dale Smedsmo**, whose details are:\n- NHL Team: Toronto Maple Leafs\n- College/Club Team: Bemidji State University (WCHA)\n- Nationality: United States\n\nThese match all criteria mentioned in the claim. The relevant cells are therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the new york ranger draft defender saint - j\u00e9r\u00f4me alouettes (qmjhl)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a player named Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes, who is a defender drafted by the New York Rangers and was part of the QMJHL. So I need to find if such a player exists in the table with these details.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for pick, player, position, nationality, NHL team, and college/junior/club team. The rows are numbered from 85 to 98.\n\nI'll scan through each row to see if any player matches \"Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes.\" Let's check each row:\n\n- Row 85: Player is \"al simmons\" \u2013 no match.\n- Row 86: \"jim nahrgang\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 87: \"bill green\" \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 88: \"doug elliott\" \u2013 no.\n- Row 89: \"peter harasym\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 90: \"norm dube\" \u2013 no match.\n- Row 91: \"bruce abbey\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 92: \"bobby gerard\" \u2013 not matching.\n- Row 93: \"dale smedsmo\" \u2013 no.\n- Row 94: \"dave smith\" \u2013 no.\n- Row 95: \"peter sullivan\" \u2013 no.\n- Row 96: \"doug keeler\" \u2013 nope.\n- Row 97: Player is \"jean - denis royal\" \u2013 close, but not the same as Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes. Wait, maybe it's a different name?\n- Row 98: \"steve johnson\" \u2013 no match.\n\nHmm, none of these players are named Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes. The closest is Jean-Denis Royal in row 97, but that's not the same name as Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes. Also, his NHL team is New York Rangers, which matches the claim, and his college/junior/club team is Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (QMJHL), which aligns with the claim.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the table has a different name for that player? Let me double-check row 97. The player is Jean-Denis Royal, position is defence, nationality Canada, NHL team New York Rangers, and college/junior/club team Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (QMJHL). So actually, he does have the same junior team as mentioned in the claim, but his first name is different from what's in the claim.\n\nThe claim refers to \"saint - j\u00e9r\u00f4me alouettes,\" which might be a nickname or a mononym. Maybe Jean-Denis Royal goes by Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me in some context, but I don't think that's accurate. It's possible the table uses different names, and perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to a specific player who isn't listed here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another row where the name matches exactly. Since none of the other rows match, I think the claim might be FALSE because there's no exact match for Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes in the table. However, if Jean-Denis Royal is known as Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, then perhaps it's TRUE, but based on the given data, he's not listed under that name.\n\nSo, considering the strict instruction to check each cell, the only relevant cells would be row 97 because it's the only one related to New York Rangers and QMJHL. But since the player's name doesn't match exactly, I'll have to mark it as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 97,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "bemidji state university have a player of the canadian nationality draft by the toronto maple leaf",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim is: \"Bemidji State University have a player of Canadian nationality drafted by the Toronto Maple Leaf.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: \n1. Bemidji State University has at least one player.\n2. That player is of Canadian nationality and was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leaf.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with various attributes. The relevant columns for this claim would be:\n- Player's name (to find if Bemidji State players exist)\n- Position (though maybe not directly relevant here)\n- Nationality\n- NHL team (specifically looking for Toronto Maple Leaf)\n\nSo I need to check each row where the college/junior/club team is Bemidji State University. \n\nLooking at the table, I see row 93: \n- pick: 93\n- player: Dale Smedsmo\n- position: left wing\n- nationality: United States\n- NHL team: Toronto Maple Leaf\n\nWait, his nationality is listed as United States, so he's not Canadian. That means the second part of the claim is false because a Canadian player wasn't drafted by the Toronto Maple Leaf from Bemidji State.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed another row where Bemidji State players are listed with Canadian nationality and Toronto Maple Leaf as their NHL team. Let me check again.\n\nRow 93 is the only one mentioning Bemidji State University, and the player there isn't Canadian. So no other rows for Bemidji State. Therefore, the claim's second part fails because there's no Canadian player from Bemidji State drafted by Toronto Maple Leaf.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I'm misinterpreting something. The claim says \"have a player...drafted by.\" But in the table, each player is listed with their NHL team and college/junior team. So if a player is drafted by Toronto Maple Leaf, they should be in that column as such.\n\nLooking again at row 93: Dale Smedsmo's NHL team is Toronto Maple Leaf but his nationality is US. No other rows for Bemidji State. Therefore, there is no Canadian player from Bemidji State University drafted by Toronto Maple Leaf. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 93,\n      \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
