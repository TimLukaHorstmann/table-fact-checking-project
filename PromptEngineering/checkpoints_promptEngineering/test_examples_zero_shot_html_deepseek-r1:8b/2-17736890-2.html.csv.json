    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game between ipswich town and leyton orient have the highest attendance of the list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which part of the claim relates to the table. The claim mentions a specific game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient. So, I need to look for that particular match in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Scanning through the rows, I see:\n\n- Row 1: Coventry City vs. Aldershot Town\n- Row 2: Milton Keynes Dons vs. Norwich City\n- ...\n- Continuing down...\n- Row 18: Ipswich Town vs. Leyton Orient\n\nYes, row 18 is the game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient.\n\nNow, the claim says this game has the highest attendance in the list. To verify that, I need to check the \"attendance\" column for this specific row and compare it with all other attendances in the table.\n\nLooking at the attendance numbers:\n\n- Row 1: 9293\n- Row 2: 6261\n- Row 3: 2735\n- Row 4: 2571\n- Row 5: 2566\n- Row 6: 2998\n- ...\n- Continuing down...\n- Row 18: 10477\n\nSo, the attendance for Ipswich Town vs. Leyton Orient is 10,477.\n\nNow, I need to see if this is the highest number in the table. Scanning through all attendances:\n\nI notice that row 18 has the highest attendance of 10,477. No other row exceeds this number. For example, row 6 has 2,998 and row 18 is significantly higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient does have the highest attendance in the list.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells are in row 18 for the \"attendance\" column. So, the row index is 18 (but since JSON indices start at 0, it's actually row 17 if counting from 0). However, the instruction says to use the given row numbers as they appear in the table. Since the table starts with row 1, I'll keep it as 18.\n\nWait, looking back, the table has rows numbered starting from 1 up to 18. So, the relevant cells are in row 18 and column \"attendance\". Therefore, the relevant_cells should be an object with row_index=18 and column_name=\"attendance\".\n</think>\n\nThe game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient (row 18) has the highest attendance of 10,477, which is higher than all other attendances listed. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and HTML structure. The claim is: \"the score of the game with the lowest attendance be 1 - 2\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that there's a match where the score is 1-2 and this match has the lowest attendance among all games listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns relevant here are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score 1\", \"away team\", and \"attendance\". \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to:\n\n1. Identify which game has the lowest attendance.\n2. Check what the score was for that game.\n\nSo, step one is to find the row with the smallest \"attendance\" number. Let me go through each row's attendance:\n\n- Row 1: 9293\n- Row 2: 6261\n- Row 3: 2735\n- Row 4: 2571\n- Row 5: 2566\n- Row 6: 2998\n- Row 7: 5366\n- Row 8: 2682\n- Row 9: 6471\n- Row 10: 5574\n- Row 11: 3399\n- Row 12: 5684\n- Row 13: 6239\n- Row 14: 3525\n- Row 15: 7230\n- Row 16: 3094\n- Row 17: 2360\n- Row 18: 10477\n\nThe smallest attendance here is 2360, which is in row 17. So, the game with the lowest attendance is row 17.\n\nNow, looking at row 17, the \"score 1\" column says \"1 - 2\". The home team is Dagenham & Redbridge, and the away team is Reading. So the score is indeed 1-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because there's a game (row 17) with the lowest attendance of 2360 and the score is 1-2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because row 17 has the lowest attendance of 2360 and the score for that game is 1 - 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"score 1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim made about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"only 1 game result in a 0 score for both team, but change after extra time.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that only one match ended with both teams scoring zero goals (a 0-0 draw), but then the result changed after extra time. So, in other words, there was a game where both teams had zero at halftime or full-time, but due to extra time, the outcome altered.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like tie number, home team, score 1 (which I assume is the half-time score), away team, and attendance. The key columns here are \"score 1\" for both teams because that's what determines if the game ended in a 0-0 draw at halftime.\n\nI need to check each row to see if there's any instance where both teams have a score of 0 - 0 in their first half or full-time score. Then, I need to verify if any such game had its result changed after extra time.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 1: Coventry City vs Aldershot Town. Scores are 3-1 and 1-0 for home and away respectively. Not a 0-0.\nRow 2: Milton Keynes Dons vs Norwich City. Scores are 1-0 and 0-1. Again, not a 0-0.\nRow 3: Wycombe Wanderers vs Birmingham City. Scores are 0-4 and 4-0. So both teams scored, but it's not a 0-0 for either team in the first half.\nWait, actually, home team is 0-4, away is 4-0. So the score at halftime was 0-4 for Birmingham, but the total score is 0-4 as well. Hmm, no, wait: the \"score 1\" column might be the full-time score or halftime. The wording isn't entirely clear. But in this case, since both teams scored goals (away team scored 4, home scored 0), it's not a 0-0.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 4: Brighton & Hove Albion vs Barnet. Scores are 4-0 and 0-1. Not a 0-0.\nRow 5: Gillingham vs Colchester United. Scores are 0-1 and 1-0. So home team scored 0 in the first half, away scored 1. Not a 0-0 for both.\nRow 6: Southend United vs Cheltenham Town. Scores are 0-0 for both teams. Ah, this is the first instance where both teams have a 0-0 at halftime or full-time. So row 6 is relevant.\n\nThen, looking at the rest of the rows to see if any other games had a 0-0 score and then changed after extra time. But I only need one such game for the claim to hold true, unless it's saying only one.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"only 1 game result in a 0 score for both team,\" implying that there's exactly one such case. So beyond row 6, do any other rows have both teams at 0-0?\n\nLooking through:\n\nRow 7: Dagenham & Redbridge vs Reading. Scores are 1-2 and 2-1. No.\nRow 8: Ipswich Town vs Leyton Orient. Scores are 4-1 and 1-4. Not a 0-0.\n\nWait, but in row 6, the score is 0-0 for both teams. So that's one game where both teams scored zero at halftime or full-time. Then, did the result change after extra time? The table doesn't show the full-time score beyond \"score 1,\" so it's unclear if there was an extra time change.\n\nBut according to the table, row 6 is index 5 (if rows start from 0). Wait no, the claim refers to only one game having a 0-0 score. So row 6 is that game. Then, did the result after extra time change? I don't have data on that because the table only shows \"score 1,\" which might be halftime or full-time.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The claim says \"only 1 game result in a 0 score for both team, but change after extra time.\" So it's not just that there was a 0-0, but that the outcome changed after extra time, meaning the final result wasn't a draw but a win for someone.\n\nBut without knowing the full-time scores or if extra time affected the outcome, I can't be sure. The table doesn't show the final score; only \"score 1.\" So perhaps I need to infer.\n\nWait, the columns are \"tie_number\", \"home_team\", \"score_1\", \"away_team\", etc. So maybe \"score_1\" is halftime or first half. If that's the case, row 6 shows both teams with score_1 of 0-0. Then, in full-time, perhaps it changed.\n\nBut without seeing the full-time scores, I can't confirm if there was a change after extra time. So perhaps the claim isn't fully supported because we don't have data on whether the result changed post-extra time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"score_1\" is the full-time score, so 0-0 would mean no goals were scored by either team in the entire match, which is different from a 0-0 draw where both teams scored. So perhaps I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, but if \"score_1\" is the halftime score, then 0-0 for both teams means neither scored in the first half, but they might have scored in extra time. If the result changed after extra time, it would mean that a team won despite both teams having 0 at halftime.\n\nBut again, without knowing the full-time or final scores, I can't confirm whether such a case exists beyond row 6.\n\nSo, based on the table provided, only one game had both teams at 0-0 in \"score_1\" (row 6). But since we don't have data on the final result, perhaps the claim is false because it's not confirmed that the outcome changed after extra time. Or maybe it's true if such a case exists.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 1 game result in a 0 score for both team, but change after extra time.\" So two things: only one game had both teams at 0, and in that game, the result changed after extra time.\n\nSo, I need to confirm if such a game exists. If row 6 is that game, then perhaps it's true. But without knowing the final score, I can't be sure. Alternatively, maybe \"score_1\" indicates full-time scores. So if both teams scored zero in full-time, but one team won after extra time.\n\nWait, no, because if both scored zero, it's a 0-0 draw regardless of extra time. Unless the rules are different, like in some tournaments where a win can be achieved even if both scored in extra time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"score_1\" is just the halftime score. So both teams had 0 at halftime, but then one scored after extra time to make it 1-0 or something. But again, without knowing, I'm unsure.\n\nGiven that the table only shows \"score_1,\" which could be either halftime or full-time, and doesn't show any other scores, perhaps the claim is false because we don't have enough data to confirm if the outcome changed after extra time.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that there's insufficient information in the provided data to confirm whether such a game exists where both teams scored zero and then the result changed after extra time. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided data indicates that only one game (row 6) shows both teams with a score of 0 in \"score_1.\" However, without additional information regarding the full-time or final scores to determine if the outcome changed after extra time, it is not possible to confirm whether the result altered post-extra time. Therefore, there isn't enough data to support the claim that the outcome changed.\n\n**Answer:** The claim cannot be fully verified with the given information.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the highest score for any team be 4 and only appear thrice on the table.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It mentions two main points:\n\n1. The highest score for any team is 4.\n2. This score of 4 appears exactly three times in the table.\n\nI'll start by examining each row to find all instances where the score is 4. Looking at the table, each row has a \"score 1\" column which represents the goals or points scored by the home team.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 1: 3 - 1 (home team's score is 3)\n- Row 2: 1 - 0\n- Row 3: 0 - 4 (away team scored 4, but I need to check if the highest score by any team is 4. Since it's the away team here, but the home team scored 0, so the highest in this row is 4.\n- Row 4: 4 - 0\n- Row 5: 0 - 1\n- Row 6: 0 - 0\n- Row 7: 2 - 0\n- Row 8: 2 - 0\n- Row 9: 1 - 3 (away team scored 3, home scored 1)\n- Row 10: 1 - 0\n- Row 11: 1 - 2\n- Row 12: 2 - 1\n- Row 13: 0 - 1\n- Row 14: 0 - 1\n- Row 15: 2 - 3\n- Row 16: 2 - 1\n- Row 17: 1 - 2\n- Row 18: 4 - 1\n\nWait, row 18 has a score of 4 for the home team (Ipswich Town). So in this case, both rows 3 and 18 have away teams scoring 4, and row 4 has the home team scoring 4.\n\nNow, let's count how many times the score is exactly 4. From what I can see:\n\n- Row 3: Away team scored 4 \u2192 one instance.\n- Row 4: Home team scored 4 \u2192 second instance.\n- Row 18: Home team scored 4 \u2192 third instance.\n\nSo that's three instances where a team scored 4, which aligns with the claim that it appears thrice.\n\nNext, I need to check if any team scored higher than 4. Looking through all the scores:\n\nThe highest score in any row is 4. None of the rows show a score above 4. For example, row 15 has a score of 3-2, so the highest there is 3. No other row exceeds that except for the ones with 4.\n\nSo the first part of the claim holds: the highest score is indeed 4.\n\nNow, regarding the frequency: as I counted earlier, there are three instances where a team scored 4. So the second condition also holds.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest score for any team is 4 and appears exactly three times. From the table analysis:\n\n1. The highest score is 4.\n2. It occurs three times (rows 3, 4, and 18).\n\nThus, both conditions are met.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says, \"for all the game list, the attendance be never under 2360.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has a few columns: tie no, home team, score 1, away team, and attendance. There are multiple rows, each representing a different game.\n\nMy task is to check every row's attendance against the claim. The claim states that all attendances should never be under 2360. So I need to make sure that in every single row of the table, the attendance column has a number equal to or greater than 2360.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Attendance is 9293. That's above 2360.\n2. Row 2: 6261. Also above 2360.\n3. Row 3: 2735. Wait, that's exactly 2735. Hmm, the claim says \"never under 2360.\" So 2735 is above 2360, so it's okay.\n4. Row 4: 2571. Again, higher than 2360.\n5. Row 5: 2566. Just a bit over 2360.\n6. Row 6: 2998. Above.\n7. Then there's a row where the home and away teams are both \"cheltenham town won...\" which might be an error, but looking at attendance, it's 2998. Okay.\n8. Row 7: 5366. Good.\n9. Row 8: 2682. That's above 2360.\n10. Row 9: 6471. Fine.\n11. Row 10: 5574. Above.\n12. Row 11: 3399. Hmm, that's below 2360? Wait, no, 3399 is more than 2360.\n13. Row 12: 5684. Okay.\n14. Row 13: 6239. Good.\n15. Row 14: 3525. That's above 2360.\n16. Row 15: 7230. Fine.\n17. Row 16: 3094. Wait, that's just over 3000. Is 3094 under 2360? No, it's higher than 2360.\n18. Row 17: 2360. Exactly 2360.\n\nWait a minute, looking at row 3, attendance is 2735. That's above 2360. So the claim says \"never under,\" which includes strictly below. So any attendance less than 2360 would make the claim false. But in all rows, I don't see any attendance that's below 2360. The lowest seems to be row 17 at 2360 exactly, but it's not under.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: Row 3 is 2735, which is above. Row 4 is 2571, also above. Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier rows.\n\nLet me list all the attendances:\n\n- Row 1: 9293\n- Row 2: 6261\n- Row 3: 2735\n- Row 4: 2571\n- Row 5: 2566\n- Row 6: 2998\n- Row 7: 2998 (duplicate)\n- Row 8: 2682\n- Row 9: 6471\n- Row 10: 5574\n- Row 11: 3399\n- Row 12: 5684\n- Row 13: 6239\n- Row 14: 3525\n- Row 15: 7230\n- Row 16: 3094\n- Row 17: 2360\n- Row 18: 10477\n\nNow, looking for any row where attendance is less than 2360. The lowest is 2360 in row 17 and 18 has 10477 which is way higher.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"never under,\" so equal to or above is okay. So as long as all attendances are at least 2360, the claim holds.\n\nLooking through each attendance:\n\nRow 3: 2735 > 2360\n\nRow 4: 2571 > 2360\n\nRow 5: 2566 > 2360\n\nWait, that's right. So even row 5 is 2566 which is just 14 over 2360.\n\nSo in all rows, the attendance is either exactly 2360 or higher. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because none of them are under 2360.\n\nBut wait, looking at row 17: 2360. Is that included? The claim says \"never under,\" so equal to is allowed. So yes, it's not under.\n\nTherefore, all attendances meet or exceed 2360.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the attendance for every game in the list never falls below 2360. By examining each row of the provided table, we see that all attendances are either exactly 2360 or higher. Therefore, the claim holds true as there are no instances where attendance is under 2360.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim is: \"the score of the game with the lowest attendance be 4 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that there's a game (from the table) which has the lowest attendance, and for that game, the score was 4 - 1.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists multiple games with their home team, scores, away team, and attendance numbers. My task is to find out if any row in this table meets both conditions: having the lowest attendance and a score of 4 - 1.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows have the lowest attendance. To do that, I need to look at the \"attendance\" column across all rows. Let's list out the attendances:\n\n- Row 1: 9293\n- Row 2: 6261\n- Row 3: 2735\n- Row 4: 2571\n- Row 5: 2566\n- Row 6: 2998\n- Row 7: 5366\n- Row 8: 2682\n- Row 9: 6471\n- Row 10: 5574\n- Row 11: 3399\n- Row 12: 5684\n- Row 13: 6239\n- Row 14: 3525\n- Row 15: 7230\n- Row 16: 3094\n- Row 17: 2360\n- Row 18: 10477\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest attendance. Looking at these numbers, the smallest one seems to be 2360 in Row 17. So, the game with Swansea City vs. Brentford had 2360 attendees.\n\nNext, I check what the score was for this game. The \"score 1\" column shows \"1 - 2\". Wait, that's a score of 1-2, not 4-1. That doesn't match the claim.\n\nSo, even though Row 17 has the lowest attendance, its score isn't 4-1.

The key column here is \"score 1\". I need to check each \"score 1\" value to see if any are 0-0.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Score is 3 - 1 \u2192 Not 0-0.\n2. Row 2: Score is 1 - 0 \u2192 Not 0-0.\n3. Row 3: Score is 0 - 4 \u2192 Home team scored 0, away scored 4. But since it's 0-4, not both zero.\n4. Row 4: Score is 4 - 0 \u2192 No.\n5. Row 5: 0 - 1 \u2192 Not both zero.\n6. Row 6: 0 - 0 \u2192 Oh, here we go. The score is 0 - 0 for this game (Southend United vs Cheltenham Town). So, that's a game where both teams have zero points.\n\nWait, but looking at the table provided, row 6 shows \"cheltenham town won 1 - 0 after extra time\" repeated in all columns. That seems confusing because the score is displayed as 0-0 in the original table, and then the win is mentioned. So perhaps there was an extra time where Cheltenham scored a goal.\n\nBut for the purpose of this claim, it's about the score during the game. If the final score was 0-0, that means both teams didn't score, which would make the claim false because such a game exists.\n\nSo, I need to find any row where both \"score1\" are 0. Looking at each row:\n\nWait, in the table provided, after row 6, it's mentioned as \"cheltenham town won 1 - 0 after extra time\", which suggests that the actual score during regulation was 0-0, and then Cheltenham won in extra time.\n\nSo in row 6, the score is 0-0. That means both teams had zero points in the game before extra time. Therefore, there exists at least one game where both teams scored zero points, which contradicts the claim.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE because the claim states that no such games exist, but we have at least one.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score 1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"the game between ipswich town and leyton orient have the highest attendance of the list but the lowest total score.\" So, two main points here: highest attendance and lowest total score in their game.\n\nFirst, I should find the specific row for Ipswich Town vs. Leyton Orient. Looking through the table, each row has a 'home team' and 'away team'. Let me scan the rows:\n\nRow 1: Coventry City vs Aldershot Town\nRow 2: Milton Keynes Dons vs Norwich City\n...\nLooking further down, I see in Row 18: Home team is Ipswich Town, away is Leyton Orient. So that's row index 18.\n\nNext, check the 'attendance' column for this game. The attendance is 10477. Now, I need to compare this against all other attendances in the table to see if it's the highest.\n\nLooking through each row:\nRow 1: 9293\nRow 2: 6261\nRow 3: 2735\nRow 4: 2571\nRow 5: 2566\nRow 6: 2998\nRow 7: 5366\nRow 8: 2682\nRow 9: 6471\nRow10:5574\nRow11:3399\nRow12:5684\nRow13:6239\nRow14:3525\nRow15:7230\nRow16:3094\nRow17:2360\nRow18:10477\n\nSo the attendances are all lower than 10477 except for maybe one. Wait, let me check if any other attendance is higher. Scanning through, the highest before row 18 is 7230 (Row15). So yes, 10477 is the highest.\n\nNow, the second part: the game has the lowest total score. Let's look at the 'score 1' column for this game. The score is 4 - 1, which is a total of 5 goals (since it's home 4-1 away). Wait, no\u2014 actually, in football, when they say \"4 - 1\", that means the home team scored 4 and the away scored 1. So the total goals are 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nNow I need to check all other games' scores to see if this is indeed the lowest or not. Let me go through each row's 'score 1' column:\n\nRow1: 3-1 \u2192 4 goals\nRow2: 1-0 \u2192 1 goal\nRow3: 0-4 \u2192 4 goals\nRow4:4-0\u21924 goals\nRow5:0-1\u21921 goal\nRow6:2-1\u21923 goals\nRow7:2-1\u21923\nRow8:4-1\u21925\nWait, no, row18 is the one we're focusing on. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing rows. Let me correct that.\n\nEach row's 'score 1' represents the score of the home team vs the away team. So for each game, the total goals are home_score + away_score. For example, a 4-1 score means 5 goals in total.\n\nLooking at all games:\n\nRow1: 3-1 \u2192 4\nRow2:1-0\u21921\nRow3:0-4\u21924\nRow4:4-0\u21924\nRow5:0-1\u21921\nRow6:2-1\u21923\nRow7:2-1\u21923\nRow8:4-1\u21925\nRow9:2-3\u21925\nRow10:2-1\u21923\nRow11:1-2\u21923\nRow12:2-1\u21923\nRow13:1-2\u21923\nRow14:4-1\u21925\nRow15:2-3\u21925\nRow16:2-1\u21923\nRow17:1-2\u21923\nRow18:4-1\u21925\n\nSo the scores in 'score 1' are:\n\nNow, looking for the lowest total goals. The minimum seems to be 1 (Rows2 and Row5). So in row2, the game is Milton Keynes Dons vs Norwich City with a score of 1-0, total goals 1.\n\nSimilarly, Row5: Swindon Town vs Queens Park Rangers, score 0-1, total goals 1.\n\nSo both these games have a lower total score (1) than the Ipswich Town game which has 5. Therefore, the claim that the Ipswich Town game has the lowest total score is incorrect because there are other games with lower scores.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's second part about having the lowest total score isn't correct since other games have lower totals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"score_1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim states: \"the highest score for any team be 4 and only appear thrice on the table , and be only obtain by home team.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. There are multiple rows, each representing a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance.\n\nI need to check two main points from the claim:\n1. The highest score any team achieved is 4.\n2. This score of 4 appears exactly three times in the table.\n3. This score was only achieved by the home teams.\n\nStarting with the first point: What's the highest score? Looking through each row, I see scores like 3-1, 1-0, 0-4, etc. The maximum score here is 4, which occurs when the away team scored 4 goals (e.g., row 3 and row 4). So, yes, 4 is indeed the highest score.\n\nNext, how many times does this score of 4 appear? In the table, I count two instances: once for aldershot town against coventry city (0-4) and once for brighton & hove albion against barnet (4-0). Wait, that's only two times. But row 7 has swansea city scoring 2-0; that's not a 4. So the highest score of 4 appears twice, not three times.\n\nAlso, regarding the home team: looking at where the 4 goals were scored. In row 3, coventry city is the home team but they conceded 4 goals (away team scored). Wait no\u2014row 3 shows '0 - 4', so that's away team scoring 4 against home team wycombe wanderers? No, wait: in row 3, the home team is wycombe wanderers and the score is 0-4, meaning away team scored 4. So that instance doesn't have a home team scoring 4. In row 4, the home team is brighton & hove albion, and they scored 4 against barnet. So only once did a home team achieve a 4.\n\nSo, summarizing: The highest score is 4, but it appears only twice, not three times. Additionally, while one home team achieved this score, another instance involved the away team scoring 4 against a home team, which doesn't align with the claim that the score was \"only obtain by home team.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the highest score of 4 doesn't meet all the conditions stated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"for all the game list, the attendance be never over 9293.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: tie no, home team, score 1, away team, and attendance. There are multiple rows of data.\n\nMy task is to verify if for every game listed in the table, the attendance never exceeds 9293. So, I need to check each row's attendance value against this number.\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one. \n\nRow 1: Attendance is 9293. That's exactly 9293, so it doesn't exceed it.\n\nRow 2: 6261, which is below 9293.\n\nRow 3: 2735, also well below.\n\nRow 4: 2571, same as above.\n\nRow 5: 2566, still under.\n\nRow 6: 2998. Wait, that's higher than 9293? No, wait, 2998 is less than 9293 because 3000 would be the next thousand. So 2998 is okay.\n\nThen there are rows from 7 to 18. I'll go through them:\n\nRow 7: 5366, which is under.\n\nRow 8: 2682, still below.\n\nRow 9: 6471. Hmm, that's higher than 9293? Wait, no. 6471 is less than 9293 because 6500 would be the next threshold. So it's okay.\n\nRow 10: 5574, which is under.\n\nRow 11: 3399, also below.\n\nRow 12: 5684. Again, this is less than 9293, so it's fine.\n\nRow 13: 6239, still under.\n\nRow 14: 3525, same as above.\n\nRow 15: 7230. Wait, that's higher than 9293? No, because 7200 would be just below 7300. So 7230 is still less than 9293.\n\nRow 16: 3094, which is under.\n\nRow 17: 2360, same as above.\n\nRow 18: 10477. Oh, this one's over 9293 because 10,000 is way higher. So 10477 is definitely more than 9293.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table, I see that row 6 has attendance 2998 and row 18 has 10477. That seems to be the only two rows where attendance exceeds 9293.\n\nSo, the claim says \"attendance be never over 9293,\" meaning it should never exceed this number for any game in the list. But since row 18 has 10477, which is higher than 9293, that makes the claim false.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. Each time attendance exceeds 9293, I should note their row indices and column name.\n\nIn this case, only row 18 (since it's the 19th row in a 1-based index) has an attendance over 9293. So, I'll include that cell.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we must check each game's attendance against the given threshold of 9293.\n\n1. **Row Analysis**:\n   - **Row 18**: Attendance is 10477, which exceeds 9293.\n   \n2. **Conclusion**:\n   Since there exists at least one game with attendance over 9293, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
