    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the HTML table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"in 2012, the oakland raiders lose to the kansas city chief at arrowhead stadium with a result of 15 - 0.\" So, breaking this down, we have four main pieces of information:\n\n1. **Year**: 2012\n2. **Winner**: Oakland Raiders (they should be losing, so the opponent would be the winner)\n3. **Location**: Arrowhead Stadium\n4. **Result**: 15 - 0\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the table data.\n\nStarting with the year: The claim specifies 2012, so I'll look for all rows where the \"year\" column is 2012. From the table, there are two such rows (row index 5 and 6). \n\nNext, looking at the result: The claim mentions a score of 15 - 0. In the table, the \"result\" column needs to match this. Checking both relevant rows:\n\n- Row 5 has a result of \"15 - 0\".\n- Row 6 also shows \"15 - 0\".\n\nSo, both these rows have the correct result.\n\nNow, checking who won and lost. The claim says that Oakland Raiders lose, so the Kansas City Chiefs should be the winners. Looking at the table:\n\n- In row 5, the winner is Oakland Raiders, which contradicts the claim because we're expecting them to lose.\n- In row 6, the winner is also Oakland Raiders again.\n\nWait, that's an issue. The claim states that the Raiders lost in 2012, but according to the table, in both instances in 2012, the Raiders won. So this suggests that the claim might be incorrect because it says the Raiders lost when actually they won.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misunderstanding who is supposed to lose or win. The claim says \"Oakland Raiders lose,\" so the opponent (KC Chiefs) should have won. But in both 2012 games, the Raiders were the winners. So the claim's assertion that the Raiders lost is false because they actually won.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's more than one game in 2012 between these teams. Let me check all relevant rows:\n\nLooking at the table, for year 2012:\n\n- October 28: Raiders win 26-16.\n- December 16: Raiders win 15-0.\n\nSo both games in 2012 were won by the Raiders against the Chiefs. Therefore, the claim that the Raiders lost to the Chiefs in 2012 is incorrect because they actually won both times.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions a specific game with a score of 15 - 0. From the table, row 6 (December 16) has that exact score: Raiders 15-0 over Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. So in this specific game, the Raiders won by 15-0. Therefore, the claim's assertion that the Raiders lost is false because they actually won that game.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let me check each relevant row:\n\nFor row index 5 (October 28, 2012):\n\n- Year: 2012\n- Date: October 28\n- Winner: Oakland Raiders\n- Result: 26 - 16\n- Loser: Kansas City Chiefs\n- Location: Arrowhead Stadium\n\nRow index 6 (December 16, 2012):\n\n- Year: 2012\n- Date: December 16\n- Winner: Oakland Raiders\n- Result: 15 - 0\n- Loser: Kansas City Chiefs\n- Location: Arrowhead Stadium\n\nSo both these games in 2012 were Raiders wins. Therefore, the claim stating that Raiders lost is incorrect.\n\nBut let's make sure about the location and result. The claim specifies \"Arrowhead Stadium\" which matches for both rows in 2012. And the result of 15-0 also matches row index 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Year: Correct (2012)\n- Location: Correct (Arrowhead Stadium)\n- Result: Correct (15 - 0)\n- Winners: Raiders, not Chiefs\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it asserts that the Raiders lost when in reality they won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the Oakland Raiders actually won both games against the Kansas City Chiefs in 2012 at Arrowhead Stadium, including a 15-0 victory.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
