    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"there be 1 submission of the night when Matt Wiman be the fighter.\" I need to verify if this statement holds true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. \n\nThe key elements are:\n1. There is exactly 1 submission of the night.\n2. Matt Wiman is the fighter involved in that submission.\n\nStarting with \"submission of the night.\" In mixed martial arts (MMA), a \"submission\" refers to a technique where a fighter forces an opponent to tap out or become unconscious, ending the fight. So I need to check if Matt Wiman has been involved in any submissions during his fights.\n\nNext, looking at the table provided, each row represents a fighter with their respective records. Since the claim is about Matt Wiman, I should locate his row.\n\nScrolling through the table, I find Matt Wiman's row. Let me note down his details:\n- Matt Wiman\n- Wins: 4\n- Losses: 0\n- Draws: 1\n- Submissions: 1\n\nFrom this, Matt Wiman has one submission win. That seems to support the claim that he has been involved in a submission of the night.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that there's only one such instance. From his record, it appears that he made exactly one submission during his career.\n\nAdditionally, I should cross-check if any other relevant cells might affect this. Looking at the columns: Wins, Losses, Draws, Submissions, and others like Weight Class or Last Win. Since the claim is specific to a submission, only the \"Submissions\" column is directly relevant here.\n\nThe table doesn't provide detailed fight information beyond wins, losses, draws, and submissions, so I can't verify the exact night of the submission from this data. However, based solely on his submission count, Matt Wiman has been involved in one submission.\n\nTherefore, considering all available information, the claim seems to be supported as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Submissions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2 submission of the night occur when the fighter be matt wiman",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 submission of the night occur when the fighter be matt wiman\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim. It seems to be saying that there were two submissions in a single event where the fighter was Matt Wiman. The key elements here are: two submissions by Matt Wiman.\n\nI'll start by looking for Matt Wiman's row in the table. Scanning through each row, I find Matt Wiman at row 13 (assuming rows start from 0 or 1? Wait, let me check the table structure. The table has a <tbody> with multiple rows, and looking at the data, Matt Wiman is listed as row 13 if we count from 1, but in programming terms, indexes usually start at 0. However, for the purpose of this task, I need to note each relevant cell's row index as per their position in the table.\n\nLooking at Matt Wiman's details: his record includes 4 wins and 1 loss. Wait, no submission victories; he has one submission win (I think). Let me double-check: Matt Wiman is known for having some submissions in his career, but in the given table, under the \"Wins\" column, it says 4, and \"Losses\" as 1. The other columns like \"Submissions\" might not be explicitly listed here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each row's submission details. For Matt Wiman (row 13 if starting from 0), his submission record is under the \"Wins\" column? Or is there a separate column for submissions? Wait, looking back at the table, I see columns like \"Revenue\", \"Employees\", but in this case, it seems to be a fighter stats table with columns such as Wins, Losses, Submissions, etc.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the table provided, the columns are probably not specified beyond the data shown. For each row, the columns include things like name, age, record, etc., but in this context, the user hasn't provided specific column names except for \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n\nSo perhaps I need to consider that the relevant columns are \"Wins\", \"Losses\", or \"Submissions\". Since the claim is about Matt Wiman having two submissions in a single night, we need to check if he has two submission wins.\n\nLooking at Matt Wiman's row (row 13), under \"Wins\" column it says 4, and \"Losses\" as 1. But there's no explicit mention of submissions here. Maybe the table doesn't include submission counts directly, or perhaps the data is in another column.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused because the initial table structure isn't clearly defined with column headers beyond what's shown. Let me re-examine the user's message: they provided a table with rows and columns but didn't specify all the headers. From the data, each row seems to have details like age, name, years in UFC, etc., but perhaps there's another column for submissions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Submission\" is a separate column. For Matt Wiman (row 13), looking at the data: it says \"Matt wiman\" with age 35, from Canada, 5'9\", weight 155 lbs, record 4-1 (assuming wins and losses). It might not have submission numbers unless specified elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Looking again, each row includes details like name, age, country, years in UFC, etc., but I'm not seeing columns for submissions or specific fight performance. Therefore, without explicit data on the number of submission wins Matt Wiman has had, it's hard to verify the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Submissions\" is a column that's present. Let me check Matt Wiman's row again: under \"Record\", it says 4-1 (probably 4 wins and 1 loss), but no submissions listed. So perhaps the table doesn't have submission counts for each fighter, making it impossible to verify the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look at other columns like \"Notable Wins\" or similar, but since the user hasn't provided that info, I can't check it. \n\nSo, based on this, there's no data in the table supporting two submission wins by Matt Wiman in a single event. Therefore, the claim is not supported.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"2 submission of the night occur when the fighter be matt wiman,\" we need to assess if Matt Wiman has two submission wins as per the table.\n\n1. **Identify Matt Wiman's Row**: Locate Matt Wiman in the table. His row is listed with 4 wins and 1 loss, but there\u2019s no explicit information on submissions.\n\n2. **Check for Submission Data**: The table doesn't provide columns for submissions or notable performances beyond wins and losses. Without submission numbers, we can't confirm two submission wins.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since the table lacks submission details for Matt Wiman, it's impossible to verify the claim.\n\n**Answer**: The claim is not supported by the provided data.\n\n\\boxed{FALSE}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim that \"joe lauzon have 5 fight of the night and 1 knockout of the night.\" Let me start by looking at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should locate Joe Lauzon in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see his name under \" Fighter\" when row_index is... let's check each row. Wait, actually, the table doesn't have an obvious header for the first column. The columns seem to be: 1, 2 (Fight of the Night), 3 (Knockout of the Night), etc.\n\nLooking through the table, I find Joe Lauzon in a couple of rows. For example, at row_index 24, his stats are 5 fights, but I don't see any 'Fight of the Night' there. Wait, no, looking again, perhaps the first column is something else, maybe number of fights?\n\nWait, actually, each row seems to represent a fighter with their stats in columns. The second column might be \"Fight of the Night\" and the third \"Knockout of the Night.\" Let me check.\n\nLooking for Joe Lauzon, I see his name appears multiple times. For example:\n\n- At row_index 5: His stats are 3 fights, 2 FOTN, 1 KOTN.\nWait, no, that can't be right because the claim says he has 5 FOTN and 1 KOTN.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the table structure: The first column seems to count down from 31, so it might represent something else, like his position or another metric. The second column is \"Fight of the Night,\" and the third is \"Knockout of the Night.\"\n\nSo, I need to check how many times Joe Lauzon has been awarded FOTN (second column) and KOTN (third column).\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row 5: 3 fights, 2 FOTN, 1 KOTN. That's not matching the claim.\nWait, no, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rows.\n\nWait, let me go through each row systematically.\n\nLooking for Joe Lauzon's name:\n\nRow 0: Doesn't seem to be him.\n\nRow 1: Marcus Davis... No.\n\nRow 2: Georges St-Pierre... No.\n\nRow 3: Quinton Jackson... No.\n\nRow 4: Matt Wiman... No.\n\nRow 5: Marcus Davis again... Wait, no, that's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list out all the rows where Joe Lauzon appears:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row_index 5: Fighter is Quinton Jackson.\n- Row_index 6: Marcus Davis.\n- Row 7: Georges St-Pierre.\n- ...\nWait, maybe it's better to list the rows where \"joe lauzon\" is present. Let me check.\n\nWait, I think Joe Lauzon appears in a couple of rows:\n\nFor example, row 5 might not be him, but perhaps further down.\n\nWait, looking at the table again: The rows are listed from top to bottom as 0 to 31. So each row is a fighter with their stats.\n\nLooking through all rows, I see:\n\n- Row 5: Not him.\n- Row 6: Marcus Davis.\n- Row 7: Georges St-Pierre.\n- ...\nWait, perhaps Joe Lauzon is at row_index 9? Or maybe another index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes multiple instances of fighters. Let me check for \"Joe Lauzon\" in the Fighter column.\n\nWait, the table's first column doesn't have headers, but it seems to list the fighter names. So I need to find rows where the fighter is Joe Lauzon.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- Row 0: Not him.\n- Row 1: Marcus Davis.\n- ...\nWait, perhaps at row_index 5, it's Quinton Jackson.\n\nContinuing down:\n\nAt row_index 9: Fighter name might be \"Joe Lauzon.\" Let me check the content. Wait, looking at the table, I think the fighter names are in the first column, so:\n\nLooking for Joe Lauzon in the first column (row_index 0 to 31):\n\n- Row 5: Quinton Jackson.\n- Row 6: Marcus Davis.\n- ...\n- Maybe row 17: Fighter is \"Jon Jones.\"\n- Row 24: Matt Wiman.\n- Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Alternatively, maybe the table doesn't include Joe Lauzon, which would mean the claim is false because his stats aren't present.\n\nAlternatively, if Joe Lauzon isn't in the table, then he has 0 FOTN and KOTN awards, so the claim is false.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the first column is a count down from 31, indicating something else, like his rank or number of fights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are structured differently, with more information.\n\nWait, perhaps each row has multiple stats beyond just FOTN and KOTN. For example:\n\n- Column 1: Number of fights.\n- Column 2: Fight of the Night (FOTN) awards.\n- Column 3: Knockout of the Night (KOTN) awards.\n- Maybe more columns for other awards.\n\nSo, if Joe Lauzon is in this table, his FOTN and KOTN counts would be in columns 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\nI see a row where the fighter's name might be Joe Lauzon. For example:\n\nAt row_index 5: 3 fights, 1 FOTN, 0 KOTN. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's at row_index 17: Jon Jones... No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is structured differently. Let me try another approach.\n\nAssuming that Joe Lauzon is in the table, let's check his FOTN and KOTN counts.\n\nThe claim says he has 5 FOTN and 1 KOTN. So I need to find a row where:\n\n- Number of fights is 5 (but wait, the first column might not be that; perhaps it's the number of times he was awarded FOTN or something else).\n\nWait, no, the columns are likely:\n\n- Column 1: Number of fights.\n- Column 2: Fight of the Night awards.\n- Column 3: Knockout of the Night awards.\n\nSo, for Joe Lauzon, I need to check if his column 2 is 5 and column 3 is 1.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n- At row_index 24: Matt Wiman. His stats are 19 fights, 0 FOTN, 0 KOTN.\n- Row 25: Jon Jones... No, he's at row 17 with multiple awards.\n\nWait, perhaps Joe Lauzon isn't in the table at all. That would mean he has 0 FOTN and 0 KOTN, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing his row.\n\nWait, perhaps Joe Lauzon is listed multiple times in different rows with different stats.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first column indicates something else, like his weight class or division.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to look for \"joe lauzon\" specifically.\n\nLooking through each row's Fighter name:\n\n- Row 0: Not him.\n- ...\n- Row 5: Quinton Jackson.\n- Row 6: Marcus Davis.\n- Row 7: Georges St-Pierre.\n- ...\n- Row 9: Maybe not.\n- ...\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't include Joe Lauzon at all. That would mean his FOTN and KOTN counts are zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he has 5 FOTN and 1 KOTN is false because he hasn't been awarded those in this table.\n\nAlternatively, if Joe Lauzon is present but not showing up with these stats, the claim is also false.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Perhaps column 2 is something else, like total FOTNs across his career, not per event.\n\nBut even then, 5 seems high for a fighter unless he's had multiple events.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes cumulative stats, so if Joe Lauzon has been in multiple UFC events, his FOTN and KOTN counts could add up over time.\n\nWait, but without knowing exactly how many times he's been awarded, it's hard to say. However, based on this table, I don't see Joe Lauzon with 5 FOTNs or 1 KOTN.\n\nTherefore, the claim is likely incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"joe lauzon have 5 fight of the night and 1 knockout of the night\" is **false**. Based on the provided table, there is no evidence indicating Joe Lauzon has achieved 5 Fight of the Night awards or 1 Knockout of the Night award. If Joe Lauzon were in the table, his stats would need to reflect these specific counts in their respective columns. However, upon reviewing the table, his name does not appear with such high counts for FOTN and KOTN.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because Joe Lauzon's record in the provided table does not indicate 5 Fight of the Night or 1 Knockout of the Night awards.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"joe lauzon have 4 knockout\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of this claim means.\n\nFirst off, I know Joe Lauzon is a fighter, but looking at the table, I don't immediately see his name listed. That's a bit confusing because if he's not in the table, how can we verify anything about him? Maybe the table doesn't include all fighters or perhaps I'm misunderstanding which column to look at.\n\nWait, maybe \"knockout\" refers to the number of times Joe Lauzon has been involved in a knockout fight. But again, without his name in the table, this is tricky. Let me go through each column to see what could be relevant.\n\nThe columns listed are: wins, losses, draws, knockouts, and submit. I think \"knockout\" would correspond to a column named Knockouts or something similar. Since the column names are singular after wins, like Wins, Losses, Draws, Knockouts, and Submit, that makes sense.\n\nSo I need to check if there's a row for Joe Lauzon in the Knockouts column. If he's not present, then perhaps the claim is false because he doesn't have 4 knockouts as per the table. But maybe his data is elsewhere or I'm misinterpreting something.\n\nAlternatively, could \"knockout\" refer to submission losses? That might be a stretch, but it's worth considering. However, looking at the column names, Submit is probably submissions, so Knockouts would specifically be knockout victories by the fighter, not necessarily their own submissions.\n\nSince Joe Lauzon isn't listed in any row of the table, I have to assume that there's no data supporting 4 knockouts for him. That means the claim isn't fully supported by the information given. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because without his record in the table, we can't verify the number of knockouts he has.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"joe lauzon have 4 knockout\" is not verifiable from the provided table as Joe Lauzon's name does not appear in any row. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported based on the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
