    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given HTML table. The claim says, \"jabaquara lost 14 games and have 57 against.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which parts of the claim correspond to specific columns in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe term \"lost\" in the claim refers to the number of games jabaquara lost. Looking at the table, each row represents a team's performance. The relevant column for losses is \"lost.\" Similarly, the phrase \"have 57 against\" likely refers to the points they scored against others, which would be under the \"points\" column.\n\nNow, I'll look for jabaquara in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that jabaquara is listed in row 11 (since the first row is position 1). \n\nIn row 11, let's check the values:\n- Position: 11\n- Team: jabaquara\n- Points: 8\n- Played: 20\n- Drawn: 4\n- Lost: 14\n- Against: 57\n- Difference: -35\n\nSo, for \"lost,\" it matches with the \"lost\" column value of 14. For \"have 57 against,\" that corresponds to the points column, which is indeed 57.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the relevant cells in the table, confirming that jabaquara lost 14 games and scored 57 points against others.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
