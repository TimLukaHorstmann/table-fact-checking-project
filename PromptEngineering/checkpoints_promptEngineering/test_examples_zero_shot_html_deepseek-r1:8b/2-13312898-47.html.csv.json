    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"edgerrin james be the number 4 pick in the first round and number 4 overall.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for Edgerrin James in the table. Scanning through each row's name column: row 0 has edgerrin james. So that's the relevant person.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the draft pick in the first round and overall number being 4. \n\nLooking at the 'round' column for Edgerrin James: it's 1. But the claim says \"number 4 pick in the first round.\" Wait, round 1 typically refers to the first round of the draft, but the table lists 'pick' as 4 for him. So if he was picked 4th in round 1, that would make his overall pick number 4 because it's the first round.\n\nBut wait, let me check all the details. The relevant columns are 'round', 'pick', and 'overall'. For Edgerrin James, row index 0: round is 1, pick is 4, and overall is also 4. So he was picked 4th in round 1, which makes him the 4th overall pick. \n\nSo that part seems correct. The claim says he's number 4 in first round and number 4 overall, which matches the table data.\n\nBut wait another thing: looking at the table, there are two rows with 'round' as 7. That might be a problem because usually, each draft has rounds 1 to 7, but some picks could be from later rounds if there are compensatory picks or trades. So for Edgerrin James, being in round 1 makes sense.\n\nHowever, the table also has another row with 'name' as edgerrin james? Wait no, looking again: row 0 is the only one with his name. The other rows have different names like Mike Peterson and others.\n\nWait, but there's a row where round is 7 and pick is 44 for Corey Terry, but that's another person. So Edgerrin James is in round 1, pick 4, overall 4.\n\nSo the claim seems to be TRUE based on his data. But wait, I should double-check if he was indeed picked 4th overall in that draft. Maybe I should cross-reference with actual draft history, but since I can't do that right now, I'll go by the table's data.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are Edgerrin James's row (row index 0) and specifically the 'round', 'pick', and 'overall' columns because they directly support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Edgerrin James was picked 4th in the first round and overall number 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
