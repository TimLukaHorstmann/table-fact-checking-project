The claim says that this model has a gcm (kg) technical capacity of 35000.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has several columns: model, engine make/capacity, power kw rpm, torque nm rpm, gvm (kg) technical capacity, and gcm (kg) technical capacity. Each row represents a different model with various specifications.\n\nThe task is to find out if there's any row in the table where the 'model' cell matches \"17.250e\" and the corresponding 'gcm (kg) technical capacity' cell is 35000.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one, checking for the exact model number first. \n\nLooking at row 0: The model is \"17.180\", which doesn't match. Moving to row 1: It's \"15.180\" \u2014 not our target. Next, row 2: \"15.180e\". Still not matching.\n\nContinuing down, row 3 has \"17.220\", row 4 is \"17.250e\". Ah, here we go.

The claim says that model 26.260e and 31.260e only have a maximum technical capacity of 41000. \n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the relevant rows in the table. From the table provided, I can see that models are listed with various numbers. Specifically, the models in question are 26.260e and 31.260e.\n\nNext, I need to find the 'gcm (kg) technical capacity' for these two models because that's what the claim refers to as the maximum technical capacity. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- For model 26.260e: It's in row index 8. The 'gcm' column has a value of 42000.\n- For model 31.260e: It's in row index 9 (since the rows start from 0, but I think in this context, each row is a separate entry). Wait, no, looking again, it seems that after row 8 comes row 9 which is 26.220, then row 10 is 26.250e, and so on until row 14 is 31.260e. So actually, model 31.260e is in row index 14.\n\nWait, let me recount the rows to make sure I have the correct indices:\n\n- Starting from 0: The first row is model 24.220 (row 0), then 24.250e (1), 26.220 (2), 26.250e (3?), no, wait. Let me list out all the models with their row indices as per the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: 24.220\n\nRow 1: 24.250e\n\nRow 2: 26.220\n\nRow 3: 26.260e (model 26.260e)\n\nRow 4: 26.220 again?

The first model is 24.220, which is row 0.\n\nThen 24.250e: row 1.\n\nThen 26.220: row 2.\n\n26.260e: row 3.\n\n31.260e: row 4? Wait, no, the next models after 26 are:\n\nAfter 26.260e (row 8), then comes 26.220 again at row 9?

Wait, looking back at the table, after row 3 (26.260e), comes:\n\nRow 4: 26.220\n\nRow 5: 26.250e\n\nRow 6: 26.220\n\nWait, this seems confusing because models are repeated. But for the specific models in question: 26.260e and 31.260e.\n\nLooking further down, after model 26.260e (row 3), we have:\n\nRow 4: 26.220\n\nRow 5: 26.250e\n\nRow 6: 26.220 again?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead focus on the specific models.\n\nModel 26.260e is in row index 3 (assuming rows start at 0). Then model 31.260e is in a later row, let's say row index 14.\n\nLooking for 'gcm' column in these rows:\n\n- For model 26.260e: At row index 3, the 'gcm' value is 42000.\n- For model 31.260e: At row index 14, the 'gcm' value is also 42000.\n\nWait, but the claim states that both models have a maximum technical capacity of 41000. However, in the table, their 'gcm' values are both 42000, which contradicts the claim.\n\nSo this means the claim is false because the actual 'gcm' for these models is higher than what's stated.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those corresponding to \"model 26.260e\" and \"model 31.260e\" in the 'gcm (kg) technical capacity' column, where their values are both 42000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me scan through each row's model number. \n\nLooking at the table, I see rows with model numbers like 8.120, 8.150e, up to 31.260e and 31.240r. Wait, does 31.240r exist in this table? I don't see a row with exactly \"31.240r\". The closest is 31.260e, but the model numbers after that go up to 26.220, 26.260e, and so on. So perhaps the model 31.240r isn't even present here.\n\nNext, focusing on model 26.260e, which is in row with index 18. The relevant columns for the claim are \"gvm (kg) technical capacity\" and \"gcm (kg) technical capacity.\" Looking at that row, under gvm it's 23000 and gcm is 42000.\n\nNow, the claim says both models have a maximum technical capacity of 32000. But looking at the table for model 26.260e, its gvm is 23,000 kg, which is less than 32,000. So that already contradicts the claim. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim refers to \"maximum technical capacity,\" so perhaps it's the highest value in their series. For example, model 26.260e has a gvm of 23,000 and gcm of 42,000, which might be its max. But according to the data, the maximum isn't 32,000 for either model. The closest is 31.260e with gcm 42,000, but that's higher than 32k.\n\nSo both models don't have a maximum technical capacity of exactly 32,000 kg.

The claim mentions \"17.250e\". Scanning through the rows, I see that there's a row with <td>17.250e</td>. That matches, so the model is present.\n\nNext, the claim talks about gcm (kg) technical capacity being 35000. Looking at the table columns, the last column before the end seems to be \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\". In the row for model 17.250e, I see that the cell under this column is indeed 35000.\n\nThen, the claim mentions gvm (kg) technical capacity of 16000. The second last column is \"gvm (kg) technical capacity\". Checking the same row, the value here is 16000. So that matches too.\n\nThe engine details are described as cummins interact 6.0 - euro iii (turbo intercooler). Looking at the \"Engine\" column for model 17.250e, it says \"cummins interact 6.0 - euro iii (turbo intercooler)\". That's a direct match.\n\nLastly, the power kw rpm is given as 160 2200. In the table, the \"power kw rpm\" column for this model shows 184 2500. Wait, that doesn't match 160 2200. Hmm, there might be an issue here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The model 17.250e has engine details: cummins interact 6.0 - euro iii (turbo intercooler) and power kw rpm as 184 2500. But the claim says 160 2200. That's a discrepancy.\n\nSo, the model exists in the table, gcm is correct, gvm is correct, engine type matches, but the power value doesn't. Therefore, the claim has an incorrect power figure.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me check the row again. For 17.250e, the \"power kw rpm\" cell says 184 2500. So it's not 160 2200 as stated in the claim. That would make the claim incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are multiple entries with similar data. Let me see if any other model matches all criteria except maybe the power. For instance, model 24.250e has engine cummins interact 6.0 and power 184 2500 as well. So it's not unique to 17.250e.\n\nWait, no, the claim specifically refers to model 17.250e with those parameters. Since the power doesn't match in its own row, that would make the claim incorrect. But let me double-check all cells for 17.250e.\n\nYes, in the \"power kw rpm\" column, it's 184 2500, not 160 2200. So that part of the claim is wrong.\n\nTherefore, even though most aspects match, the power figure doesn't align with the model's data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"gvm (kg) technical capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"power kw rpm\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
