    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"game 4 be on april 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the table data.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that game 4 occurred on April 25th. So I need to find the row corresponding to game 4 in the table and check the date listed there.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific game. The first column under <tbody> is labeled 'game' with values from 1 to 5. So game 4 should be the fourth row (index starting at 0 would be row 3, but I'll count starting at 1 for clarity).\n\nNow, locating game 4: it's in the fourth row (row index 3 if we start counting from 0). The 'date' column for this row is listed as \"april 25\". That matches exactly with the claim that the date was April 25.\n\nNext, I should consider if there are any other relevant cells. The claim only specifies the date, so I don't need to check other columns like team, score, etc., unless the claim is specifically about something else. Since the claim is solely about the date of game 4, the only relevant cell is the 'date' column in row 3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: sometimes claims might have multiple aspects, but here it's just the date. So yes, only the 'date' cell is needed to verify the claim.\n\nPutting this together, since the 'date' for game 4 is indeed April 25th, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells indicating row index 3 and column \"date\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"game 4 be on april 25\" is true, I need to check the 'date' for game 4 in the table.\n\n1. **Locate Game 4**: It's in the fourth row (index 3).\n2. **Check Date**: The date listed is April 25, matching the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"game 4 have a location attendance of at&t center 20491 and the series be 1 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and series.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific aspects:\n1. The location attendance for game 4 is \"at&t center\" with a value of 20491.\n2. The series for game 4 is \"1 - 1.\"\n\nSo, I need to find the relevant cells in the table that correspond to these points.\n\nStarting with game 4. Looking through the <tbody> section, there are five rows (games 1 to 5). Game 4 should be row index 3 because it's zero-indexed.\n\nIn row 3 (game 4), let me check each column:\n- game: 4\n- date: april 25\n- team: dallas\n- score: l 90 - 99 (ot)\n- high points: tony parker (43)\n- high rebounds: tim duncan (10)\n- high assists: tim duncan (7)\n- location attendance: american airlines center 20829\n- series: 1 - 3\n\nWait, the claim says the location is \"at&t center\" with a value of 20491. But in the table, for game 4, location attendance is \"american airlines center\" and the number is 20829. That's different from what the claim states.\n\nAlso, the series for game 4 is listed as \"1 - 3,\" not \"1 - 1.\" So both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the location attendance doesn't match and the series outcome isn't as stated.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check two specific columns for game 4: \"location attendance\" and \"series.\"\n\n- **Location Attendance**: The table shows \"american airlines center 20829\" for game 4, not \"at&t center 20491.\"\n- **Series Outcome**: Game 4's series is listed as \"1 - 3,\" not \"1 - 1.\"\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are not met. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table and the specific instructions provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"game 4.0 , series 1 - 4 be on april 25\". So, the claim is making two assertions:\n\n1. The game number is 4.0.\n2. The series score is 1 - 4.\n3. This particular game and series took place on April 25.\n\nMy task is to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that each row represents a specific game with details such as game number, date, team, score, etc. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and series.\n\nI need to identify which cells in the table are relevant to verify the claim. Let's address each part of the claim one by one.\n\n1. **Game Number 4.0**: The 'game' column lists game numbers as integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). I should check if there's a row where the 'game' number is 4. Looking at the table, yes, there's a row with game number 4.\n\n2. **Series Score 1 - 4**: The 'series' column shows the series score as \"1 - 1\", \"1 - 2\", etc. For game 4, the series is listed as \"1 - 3\". This doesn't match \"1 - 4\". So there's a discrepancy here.\n\n3. **Date April 25**: The 'date' for game 4 is indeed April 25.\n\nSo, while two parts of the claim are correct (game number and date), the series score part is incorrect in the table. Therefore, the overall claim should be considered FALSE because one of its assertions isn't supported by the data.\n\nNext, I need to identify the relevant cells based on each condition checked. \n\n- For game number 4.0: The relevant cell is row 3 (since it's zero-indexed) and column 'game'.\n- For series 1 - 4: Since this doesn't match, I might not include any cell here unless there's an exact mismatch. However, the instruction says to check each condition. So, looking at game 4, the series is \"1 - 3\", which is different from \"1 - 4\". Hence, it's necessary to point out that this particular assertion isn't met.\n- For the date April 25: The relevant cell is row 3 and column 'date'.\n\nWait, no\u2014row indices are zero-based. Let me recount:\n\nRows are:\n\n0: game 1\n1: game 2\n2: game 3\n3: game 4\n4: game 5\n\nSo, for game 4.0, it's row 3.\n\nPutting this together, the relevant cells are 'game' (row 3) and 'series' (row 3), as well as 'date' (row 3). But since the series doesn't match, I need to include it in the relevant cells because that condition was part of the claim. Alternatively, perhaps only the columns that actually support the claim should be included, but according to instructions, I must check each condition.\n\nWait, no\u2014the instruction says: \"check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\" So for each condition, find if there's a cell that supports it. If not, then include it as a discrepancy.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- For game number 4.0: Check 'game' column for row where game is 4 \u2192 found in row 3.\n- For series 1 - 4: Check 'series' column for April 25 (date) and see if the series is 1 - 4. But looking at row 3, series is 1 - 3. So this condition isn't met. Hence, I should include the 'series' cell in relevant cells.\n- For date April 25: Check 'date' column for row where it's April 25 \u2192 found in row 3.\n\nSo all three conditions are checked by looking at row 3 and the respective columns.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about game 4.0, series 1-4, on April 25. So each of these aspects needs to be present in the table for that specific game. Therefore, for game 4.0 (row 3), check if the date is April 25 (yes), and the series is 1 - 4. But in the table, it's 1 - 3. Hence, only two out of three are correct.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the series doesn't match.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: For each condition checked, which cells are relevant? The game number is 4, so that's row 3 and column 'game'. The series is 1 - 4, but in the table it's 1 - 3. So for the series part, I should include that cell as well because it's supposed to verify whether the series is correct. Similarly, the date is April 25, so include that.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\"\n\nEach condition is part of the claim, but for verification, you need to look at the corresponding cell. So for each part:\n\n- Game number 4.0 \u2192 find 'game' column where it's 4, so row 3.\n- Series 1 - 4 \u2192 series column for game 4 (row 3) is 1 - 3; not matching, but still need to include the cell because that's part of verifying the condition.\n- Date April 25 \u2192 'date' column in row 3 is indeed April 25.\n\nHence, all three cells are relevant: 'game', 'series', and 'date' from row 3. However, since series doesn't match, it affects the overall claim's veracity.\n\nSo in the response, I should list these cells as they are part of verifying each condition.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying each condition of the claim against the provided table. The claim consists of three conditions: checking if the game number is 4.0, if the series score is 1 - 4, and if the date is April 25.\n\n1. **Game Number Check**: In the 'game' column, there is a row where the game number is 4 (specifically, row 3). This satisfies the first condition.\n2. **Series Score Check**: For game number 4 (row 3), the series score is listed as \"1 - 3\", which does not match the claim's \"1 - 4\". Thus, this condition is not satisfied.\n3. **Date Check**: The date for game number 4 is April 25, as found in row 3 of the 'date' column. This satisfies the third condition.\n\nSince one of the conditions (series score) is not met, the overall claim is considered false. However, each relevant cell that contributed to verifying these conditions must be noted.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- **Game**: Row 3, Column \"game\"\n- **Series**: Row 3, Column \"series\"\n- **Date**: Row 3, Column \"date\"\n\nThe series score discrepancy leads to the conclusion that the claim is false.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{False}",
