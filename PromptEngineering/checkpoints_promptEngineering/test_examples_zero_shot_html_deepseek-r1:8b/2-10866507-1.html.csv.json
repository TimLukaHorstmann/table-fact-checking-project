That matches the claim. \n\nThen for round 2 (20 July), the away team is also perth glory.

The claim is: \"perth glory be the away team on 4 august 2007 and on 12 august 2007\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with headers like round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. There are five rows of data.\n\nI need to check if Perth Glory was the away team on both 4 August and 12 August 2007. \n\nLooking at the row where the date is 4 August 2007 (which is the fourth row in the table), the home team is Central Coast Mariners, and the away team is Perth Glory. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nThen, for 12 August 2007 (the fifth row), the home team is Adelaide United, and the away team is again Perth Glory. So that also checks out.\n\nTherefore, both dates have Perth Glory as the away team, making the claim TRUE. \n\nI'll need to find the relevant cells in the table that confirm this. For each of those two dates, the 'away team' column is where the information is located. The row indices for these rows are 3 (since it's zero-indexed) and 4 respectively.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n- Row index 3, column \"away team\"\n- Row index 4, column \"away team\"\n\nThat makes sense because each of those cells directly shows Perth Glory as the away team on those specific dates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the crowd sizes is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the crowd on 4 august 2007 at bluetongue central coast stadium be larger than the crowd on 20 july 2007 at hindmarsh stadium.\"\n\nI need to check the table to find the relevant data points for these two dates and venues.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like round number, date, home team, score, away team, crowd size, and stadium. The rows are numbered from 1 to 5, but I notice that row 4 has \"sf\" as the round, which might be a semi-final or some specific type of match.\n\nThe first part of the claim is about 4 August 2007 at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. So I need to find that exact entry in the table.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 0 (index 1? Wait, no, in HTML tables, rows are usually indexed starting from 0 if using zero-based indexing). But let me check the first row after the header: it's for round 1 on 14 July. Then round 2 is next, which is 20 July at Hindmarsh Stadium. Round 3 is 28 July at Darwin Football Stadium. Round sf (probably semi-final) is 4 August at Central Coast Stadium. So that would be row index 3 if starting from 0.\n\nWait, the rows are:\n\n1: first data row\n2: second\n3: third\n4: sf (fourth)\n5: gf (fifth)\n\nSo the round numbers go up to gf, which might be grand final.\n\nBut in terms of indexes, the first data row is index 0 in a programming sense but here it's numbered as 1. So perhaps I should consider that each <tr> tag corresponds to a row, starting from 0 or 1? Actually, in the HTML table, the first <tr> after <thead> is considered row 1 if we're counting from 1, but in terms of JavaScript or array indexes, it's 0. However, for this task, the user probably refers to row indices as per their position in the tbody.\n\nWait, looking at the instruction: \"relevant_cells\": a list of objects, each with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\" (string). So I think row_index is based on their order in the tbody. The first data row is index 0, next 1, etc., up to 4 for sf and 5 for gf.\n\nWait no, looking at the HTML:\n\n<tbody>\n<tr> ... </tr> x6? No, the table has 6 rows: 1,2,3,4,5, but in HTML it's 0-based or 1-based?\n\nWait, let me count the <tr> elements:\n\nLooking at the provided table:\n\nThere are six <tr> tags inside <tbody>: each for a match. So their indexes would be from 0 to 5 if considering zero-based.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, in the example given by the user, they used row indices starting at 0, as per the example JSON where relevant_cells have row_index: 0 and 1.\n\nSo I think it's safe to assume that each <tr> is numbered starting from 0.\n\nSo, for the first part of the claim:\n\n4 August 2007 at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. Looking through the table, in which row does this occur?\n\nRow 3 (index 3) has the date 4 August 2007 and stadium Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. The home team is Central Coast Mariners, away team Perth Glory, score 2-3.\n\nSo for this part, we need to find the crowd size for that row. The column is 'crowd' which is in the fifth position.\n\nSo relevant cells would be: row_index 3 and column_name \"crowd\".\n\nNext part of the claim: 20 July 2007 at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nLooking through the table, row 1 (index 1) has date 20 July 2007. The stadium is Hindmarsh, home team Adelaide United, away team Perth Glory, score 1-1.\n\nSo for this, we need to get the crowd size from that row as well. So another relevant cell: row_index 1 and column_name \"crowd\".\n\nWait, no: in the table, the first data row is round 2 (index 0?), but perhaps I should look again.\n\nWait, let's list all rows with their details:\n\nRow index 0:\n- Round: 1\n- Date: 14 July 2007\n- Stadium: Port Macquarie Regional\n\nRow index 1:\n- Round: 2\n- Date: 20 July 2007\n- Stadium: Hindmarsh\n\nRow index 2:\n- Round:3\n- Date:28 July 2007\n- Stadium:Darwin Football\n\nRow index3:\n- SF\n- 4 August 2007\n- Central Coast Stadium\n\nRow index4:\n- GF\n-12 August 2007\n- Hindmarsh Stadium\n\nWait, so the claim is about 4 August (row3) and 20 July (row1). So for row3, crowd is 5967. For row1, crowd is3513.\n\nSo 5967 >3513? Yes, that's true.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the crowd on 4 August was larger than that on 20 July.\n\nNow, to structure the relevant_cells: we need to get the cells for each of these two dates. So for row_index 1 (20 July), column \"crowd\" and for row_index3 (4 August), column \"crowd\".\n\nWait, but in the table, the rows are:\n\nRow0: round1\nRow1:round2\nRow2:round3\nRow3:sf (round sf)\nRow4:gf\n\nSo 20 July is row1, 4 August is row3.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For 20 July: row1, column \"crowd\"\n- For 4 August: row3, column \"crowd\"\n\nHence, in JSON format, it's an array of two objects: {row_index:1, column_name:\"crowd\"}, {row_index:3, column_name:\"crowd\"}\n\nWait no, but the user might be expecting row indices as per their order in the table. But from the example given, like [ {row_index:0, ...}, ...], which probably refers to the first data row.\n\nSo yes, 20 July is row1 (index1), and 4 August is row3 (index3).\n\nHence, I should include both of these.\n</think>\n\nThe crowd size on 4 August was indeed larger than that on 20 July. Therefore, the claim is true, and the relevant cells are as specified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

So I'll need to check the 'date' column for those exact dates in the table.\n\nNext, the home team is said to be Adelaide Unite on both these dates. Wait, I should check if it's spelled correctly. In the table, the team names are written as \"adelaide united\" (without a space after the 'e'). So perhaps there's a typo in the claim? Or maybe the correct name in the table is different. I need to confirm that.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor row 1 (20 July 2007), the home team is Adelaide United, but wait, no, actually looking again: row 2 is 20 July 2007. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 0: date 14 July 2007, home team Newcastle Jets.\nRow 1: date 20 July 2007, home team Adelaide United.\nRow 2: 28 July 2007, home team Perth Glory.\nRow 3: sf (probably a typo for round?), but the important thing is the date is 4 August 2007, home team Central Coast Mariners.\nRow 4: gf, date 12 August 2007, home team Adelaide United.\n\nWait, so on 20 July and 12 August, the home teams are Adelaide United both times. That matches the claim because the claim says \"adelaide unite\" but the table shows \"adelaide united.\" Hmm, that's a discrepancy in spelling. So is \"unite\" correct or should it be \"united\"? If the claim uses \"unite,\" does that mean it's incorrect? Or maybe it's just a different spelling variant.\n\nBut the key point is whether on both those dates, the home team was Adelaide United. From the table, yes: row 1 and row 4 have home teams as Adelaide United on those two dates.\n\nWait, no.

Looking through the table, the first row (row index 0) has the date \"14 july 2007\". The away team listed there is \"perth glory,\" not \"melbourne victory.\" So that's a discrepancy right there.\n\nNext, checking 20 July 2007. That date is in row index 1. The away team for this game is also \"perth glory,\" again not \"melbourne victory.\"\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"the away team for both... be melbourne victory.\" So both those dates should have Melbourne Victory as the away team.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- For 14 July (row 0), away team is Perth Glory.\n- For 20 July (row 1), same thing\u2014Perth Glory.\n\nNeither of these matches has Melbourne Victory as the away team. In fact, looking further into the table, on 28 July (row 2), Melbourne Victory is the home team against Perth Glory, but that's a different date.\n\nSo both specified dates have Perth Glory as the away team, not Melbourne Victory.

Each row represents a different match.\n\nI should identify the relevant rows based on the dates mentioned in the claim. The first date is 20 July 2007, so I'll look for that exact date in the 'date' column. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: 14 July 2007\n- Row 2: 20 July 2007 \u2192 This is our first relevant row.\n- Row 3: 28 July 2007\n- Row 4: 4 August 2007\n- Row 5: 12 August 2007 \u2192 This is the second date in the claim.\n\nSo, I need to check the stadium for both these rows. For row 2 (20 July), the stadium is 'hindmarsh stadium'. For row 5 (12 August), it's also 'hindmarsh stadium'.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to match. But wait, looking at the table again, the round numbers are 1 through 3 and then sf and gf for some matches. So I should make sure I'm not mixing up rows incorrectly.\n\nRow 2 is round 2, date 20 July, away team perth glory, and stadium hindmarsh. Row 5 is labeled as 'gf', which probably stands for Grand Final, but the important thing is the date is 12 August, and the stadium is again hindmarsh.\n\nSo both games were at hindmarsh stadium. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I think I might have misread the table earlier. Let me check each row again to confirm:\n\n- Row 0: 14 July \u2192 port macquarie\n- Row 1: 20 July \u2192 hindmarsh\n- Row 2: 28 July \u2192 darwin\n- Row 3: sf, 4 August \u2192 bluetongue central coast\n- Row 4: gf, 12 August \u2192 hindmarsh\n\nYes, so both games on the specified dates are at hindmarsh stadium.

The claim is: \"adelaide unite be the away team on 4 august 2007 and on 12 august 2007.\" Hmm, first off, I notice that \"unite\" is misspelled as \"united\" in the claim. Wait, no, actually, the user wrote \"adelaide unite,\" which seems like a typo. The correct name should be \"Adelaide United,\" right? So maybe that's an issue already.\n\nBut before getting bogged down by that, let me look at the table provided. The table has several rounds, dates, home teams, scores, away teams, crowd numbers, and stadiums. My goal is to check if Adelaide United was indeed the away team on both 4 August 2007 and 12 August 2007.\n\nFirst, I'll need to identify which rows correspond to those dates. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: 14 July 2007\n- Row 2: 20 July 2007\n- Row 3: 28 July 2007\n- Row 4: 4 August 2007\n- Row 5: 12 August 2007\n\nSo rows 4 and 5 are the ones for 4 August and 12 August. Now, let's check what the away teams were on those dates.\n\nLooking at row 4 (4 August 2007), the away team is listed as \"perth glory.\" The home team is \"central coast mariners.\" So Adelaide United isn't mentioned here. Wait, but the claim says they were the away team. That would be incorrect for this date because it's Perth Glory who is the away team.\n\nNow row 5 (12 August 2007), the away team is also listed as \"perth glory,\" and the home team is \"adelaide united.\" So on this date, Adelaide United is indeed the home team, not the away. Therefore, the claim that they were the away team on both dates is incorrect for both instances.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says Adelaide Unite (probably a typo) was the away team on both 4 August and 12 August. In reality, on 4 August, the away team was Perth Glory, and on 12 August, the home team was Adelaide United. So neither of these dates have Adelaide United as the away team. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, to structure this properly, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. Each row that's relevant is rows 4 and 5 because they're the ones with the specific dates mentioned. For each of those rows, the column \"away team\" needs to be checked. So for row 4 (index 3), column \"away team\" has Perth Glory. For row 5 (index 4), column \"home team\" is Adelaide United. Therefore, the relevant cells are these two.\n\nWait a second, but in row 5, it's the home team that's Adelaide United. So if the claim says they were away on 12 August, that's incorrect. So all in all, the claim is false because Adelaide United wasn't the away team on either of those dates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the crowd on 4 august 2007 at hindmarsh stadium be larger than any other crowd.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table and identify which rows and columns are relevant. Let's go step by step.\n\nThe table has several columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. The claim mentions a specific date (4 August 2007) and a specific stadium (Hindmarsh Stadium). So I need to find the row where the date is 4 August 2007 and the stadium is Hindmarsh.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Date is 14 July 2007, stadium is Port Macquarie Regional Stadium.\n- Row 1: Date is 20 July 2007, stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n- Row 2: Date is 28 July 2007, stadium is Darwin Football Stadium.\n- Row 3: Date is 4 August 2007, stadium is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium.\n- Row 4: Date is 12 August 2007, stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nWait, the row numbers might be off because sometimes people start counting from 0 or 1. In this table, the first row after <tbody> is row 1 (as per the user's numbering), but in the HTML code, it's actually the first <tr> element, which would be index 0 if we count from 0. However, the user mentioned that row sf is at index 3 and gf at index 4. So I think the rows are numbered starting from 1 as per their identifiers (rows 1,2,3,4,5), but for our purposes, perhaps it's better to look at each <tr> and see which one matches.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe first row after <tbody> is:\n\n<tr>\n  <td>1</td>\n  ... etc. So that's the first game (round 1). Then next row is round 2, then 3, then sf, then gf. So perhaps the rows are identified by their \"round\" number or 'sf' and 'gf'. \n\nSo for the claim, we need to find the crowd at Hindmarsh Stadium on 4 August 2007.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: date is 20 July, not matching.\n- Row 2: 28 July, nope.\n- Row 3: 4 August 2007. Let's see, date is 4 August 2007, and stadium is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. So that's a match for the date but not the stadium.\n\nRow 4: date is 12 August, which is after 4 August, so no.

Round 2, 20 July, Adelaide United vs Perth Glory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n3. Round 3, 28 July, Perth Glory vs Melbourne Victory at Darwin Football Stadium.\n4. sf (semi-finals?), 4 August, Central Coast Mariners vs Perth Glory at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium.\n5. gf (grand final?), 12 August, Adelaide United vs Perth Glory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nSo the row with date 4 August is row 4 (sf), and the stadium there is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, not Hindmarsh. The next row is round 5 (gf) on 12 August at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"on 4 August 2007 at Hindmarsh Stadium.\" So looking for a row where date is 4 August and stadium is Hindmarsh. From the table, the only match for 4 August is row sf with Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, and the next row (gf) on 12 August is Hindmarsh.\n\nSo there's no row in the table where both date is 4 August and stadium is Hindmarsh. Therefore, the crowd at that specific game doesn't exist in the table. So the claim might be false because such a crowd does not occur in the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rows. Maybe the \"sf\" and \"gf\" are different rounds, but regardless, the stadium for 4 August is Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, not Hindmarsh. Therefore, the crowd on that date at Hindmarsh doesn't exist in the table, meaning the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all rows to see if any have both 4 August and Hindmarsh. From the data:\n\n- Only row sf has 4 August: stadium Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium.\n- gf row (12 August) at Hindmarsh, but that's a different date.\n\nSo no, there is no crowd on 4 August at Hindmarsh in this table. Therefore, the claim's assertion can't be verified because such data isn't present. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: which cells are needed to verify this? Well, we need to check if any row has both date as 4 August and stadium as Hindmarsh. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: 14 July, not.\n- Row 2: 20 July, nope.\n- Row 3: 28 July, Darwin Stadium.\n- Row sf (row 4): 4 Aug, Bluetongue.\n- Row gf (row5): 12 Aug, Hindmarsh.\n\nSo none of the rows match both 4 Aug and Hindmarsh. Therefore, to check this claim, we need to look at any row where date is 4 August and stadium is Hindmarsh. However, since there's no such row in the table, the data doesn't support the claim.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are the rows for 4 August (row sf) and Hindmarsh Stadium (rows 2 and gf). So we need to point out those two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"the home team on both 20 july 2007 and 12 august 2007 be newcastle jet\". So, the claim is stating that on two specific dates\u201420 July 2007 and 12 August 2007\u2014the home team was Newcastle Jets.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows for these dates. The table has a column called \"date,\" so I'll check each row's date against the claim's dates.\n\nStarting with 20 July 2007: Scanning through the table, I see that the second row (row index 1) has this date. The home team listed there is Adelaide United. That doesn't match Newcastle Jets, so this row isn't relevant to the claim.\n\nNext, checking for 12 August 2007: The fifth row (row index 4) has this date. The home team here is Central Coast Mariners. Again, not matching Newcastle Jets either.\n\nWait, actually, looking again\u2014no row for 12 August has Newcastle Jets as the home team. The last relevant row with Adelaide United on 12 August is row index 5, but that's already been checked. So both dates don't have Newcastle Jets as the home team.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the home teams on those dates aren't Newcastle Jets.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that the stadium used for the game on August 12, 2007 was the same as the one used on July 28, 2007.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, and stadium. The rows correspond to different matches.\n\nI need to find the specific games that took place on those two dates mentioned in the claim. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are five matches listed. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: July 14, 2007. Not relevant since it's not August 12 or July 28.\n2. Row 2: July 20, 2007. Again, not one of the dates in question.\n3. Row 3: July 28, 2007. This is one of the dates we're interested in. The stadium for this game is Darwin Football Stadium.\n4. Row 4: August 4, 2007. Not August 12, so not relevant.\n5. Row 5: August 12, 2007. This is the other date we're looking at. The stadium here is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nNow, I need to check if both of these games were played in the same stadium. From the table, on July 28, the game was at Darwin Football Stadium, while on August 12, it was at Hindmarsh Stadium. These are two different stadiums.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the stadium used on August 12 was the same as on July 28 is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
