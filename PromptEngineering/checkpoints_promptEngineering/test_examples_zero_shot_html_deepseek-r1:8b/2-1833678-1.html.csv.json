The claim says: \"evita be nominate for a tony award and a drama desk award in 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. I see that there's a row where the year is 2012. In that same row, under the \"nominated work\" column, it says \"evita.\" Now, I need to check if evita was nominated for both a Tony award and a Drama Desk award in 2012.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different award. The relevant columns are 'award', which tells us what award it's for, and 'result', which shows whether it was won or just nominated. \n\nIn the 2012 rows, I see two instances related to evita:\n1. It was nominated for a Tony Award.\n2. It was also nominated for a Drama Desk Award.\n\nSo both the claim points are supported by the table. The result column says 'nominated' for both awards in that year. Therefore, the claim is true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"in 2012 evita be nominate for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components. The claim mentions the year 2012, the work \"evita,\" and being nominated for \"outstanding featured actor in a musical.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I should focus on rows where the year is 2012. Scanning through the table, I see that there are two rows for 2012.\n\nThe first row for 2012 lists:\n- Award: tony award\n- Category: best performance by a featured actor in a musical\n- Nominated work: evita\n- Result: nominated\n\nThe second row for 2012 also mentions:\n- Award: drama desk award\n- Category: outstanding featured actor in a musical\n- Nominated work: evita\n- Result: nominated\n\nWait, but the claim says \"evita be nominate for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" The category mentioned is \"outstanding featured actor in a musical,\" which matches one of the columns in the 2012 rows. \n\nIn the first relevant row (row index 10), the award is Tony Award with category best performance by a featured actor, but that's not exactly what the claim states. However, in the second relevant row (row index 11), the award is Drama Desk Award and the category matches \"outstanding featured actor in a musical,\" which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSo, both rows for 2012 show that evita was nominated by different awards. The claim specifically refers to the Drama Desk Award's category. Since it was indeed nominated, this supports the claim being TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street be nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The key elements are:\n- Nominee: Sweeney Todd\n- Award: Drama League Award\n- Year: 2006\n\nI should check each row of the table to see if there's a match for these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that rows are organized by year, award, category, nominated work, and result. Let me scan through the rows for 2006.\n\nIn 2006, there are several entries:\n- One row mentions the Drama League Award with the category \"distinguished performance\" and the nominated work is Sweeney Todd.\n- Another row has the same Drama League Award but again with Sweeney Todd, same details.\n\nSo, in both cases, for the year 2006, Sweeney Todd was indeed nominated for the Drama League Award. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should also check if there are any discrepancies or multiple entries that might affect the result. Since all relevant rows confirm the nomination, there's no inconsistency here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I identified the relevant cells in the table where \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"evita be nominate work after 2006 , that be award the outer critic circle award and the outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" \n\nBreaking this down, I need to check if there's an entry for \"evita\" as a nominated work after the year 2006. Specifically, it should have been awarded both the Outer Critics Circle Award and Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.\n\nLooking at the table, let me search for rows where the \"nominated work\" is \"evita.\" \n\nScrolling through the table, I see that in 2012, there are two entries related to \"evita\":\n\n1. For the Tony Award, nominated as Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical.\n2. For the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.\n\nBoth of these are nominations, not awards. The claim mentions that evita was awarded both the Outer Critics Circle Award and Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical. \n\nChecking for any entries where \"evita\" won an award in those categories after 2006. From the table, I don't see any such entries. Both times, it's only nominated.\n\nSo, the claim seems to suggest that evita was awarded both awards, but according to the table, it wasn't; it was just nominated. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"evita\" received two specific awards after 2006, but based on the table, these were only nominations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the year be 2007 when evita nominate for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Year**: 2007\n2. **Awards/Nominations**: Evita was nominated for \"outstanding featured actor in a musical.\"\n3. **Category**: It's about a musical performance.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check if there's an entry in 2007 where Evita is nominated for that specific award category.\n\nI'll start by examining the rows for the year 2007. Scanning through the table:\n\n- **Row 19**: Year 2007, Drama League Award, Distinguished Performance, LoveMusik, Nominated.\n- **Row 20**: Year 2007, Tony Award, Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical, LoveMusik, Nominated.\n- **Row 21**: Year 2007, Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical, LoveMusik, Nominated.\n- **Row 22**: Year 2007, Drama League Award, Distinguished Performance, LoveMusik, Nominated.\n- **Row 23**: Year 2007, Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical, LoveMusik, Nominated.\n\nWait, but where is Evita mentioned? I don't see Evita listed for the year 2007. Let me double-check each row:\n\nLooking at all rows for 2007, the nominated works are either \"loveMusik\" or \"king lear.\" There's no mention of \"Evita\" in 2007.\n\nNext, checking other years for Evita:\n\n- **Row 24**: Year 2012, Tony Award, Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical, Evita, Nominated.\n- **Row 25**: Year 2012, Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical, Evita, Nominated.\n\nSo, Evita was nominated for \"outstanding featured actor in a musical\" in 2012, not 2007. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it specifies 2007 when actually it happened two years later.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that the award category matches exactly. In 2012, it's \"best performance by a featured actor,\" which aligns with the claim's description of \"outstanding featured actor.\" However, the year in the claim is wrong.\n\nSo, putting this together, since there's no Evita nomination for that specific award in 2007, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are all the rows for 2007 where LoveMusik is mentioned because they show that in 2007, Evita wasn't nominated, but another work was.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominated work\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first: \"the who 's tommy / sweeney todd : the demon barber of fleet street be the nominated work , nominate for the drama league award after 2007.\" \n\nSo, the claim mentions two specific works: \"The Who's Tommy\" and \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. It says that these works were nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007. My task is to check if this is true based on the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find entries where either of these two works was nominated for the Drama League Award and the year is after 2007. \n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant columns: 'year', 'nominated work', 'award', and 'result'. The award in question is 'drama league award'.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if either \"The Who's Tommy\" or \"Sweeney Todd...\" was nominated for this award after 2007.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- 1993 rows: These are all about \"The Who's Tommy\", but the years are before 2007. So, even though they were nominated, it's not after 2007.\n  \n- 2004 row: Nominated work is \"Assassins\" for Drama League Award, so that's not relevant.\n\n- 2006 rows: These mention \"Sweeney Todd...\", but the result is 'nominated' for Drama League Award. However, the year is 2006, which is before 2007. So it doesn't satisfy the after 2007 condition.\n\n- 2007 rows: The first one is about \"The Who's Tommy\" again in 1993, so that's not relevant. Wait, actually, looking at the rows, in 2007, there are three mentions of \"lovemusik\" for Drama League Award with 'nominated' results. None of these mention \"Sweeney Todd\".\n\n- After 2007: Looking at 2012, there are two rows about \"evita\". So, none of them refer to either \"The Who's Tommy\" or \"Sweeney Todd\".\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for the exact titles:\n\n\"The Who 's tommy\" is referred to as \"the who 's tommy\" in the table, which seems to be \"The Who's Tommy\". So, I'm looking for any row where either this or \"Sweeney Todd...\" is the nominated work and the award is Drama League, with year after 2007.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nIn 1993: Both \"the who 's tommy\" and others. Not relevant as they are in 1993.\n\nIn 2004: \"assassins\", no relevance.\n\nIn 2006: \"sweeney todd...\" is nominated for Drama League, but it's in 2006.\n\nIn 2007: The first row is about \"the who 's tommy\" again, so that's not relevant. Then, the other rows are about \"lovemusik\".\n\nLooking for \"drama league award\" after 2007:\n\nIn 2007: Rows 4 and onward (since it's a long table), but in 2007, the Drama League Award is mentioned for \"evita\" only in 2012. Wait no, in 2007, rows are as follows:\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\nRow 13: 2012, evita.\n\nSo after 2007, there's no entry where either of the two works was nominated for the Drama League Award.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because neither work was nominated by the Drama League Award after 2007.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are no entries in the table where \"The Who's Tommy\" or \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" were nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
