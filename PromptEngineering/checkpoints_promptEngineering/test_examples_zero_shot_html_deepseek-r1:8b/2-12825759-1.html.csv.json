    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the user provided a table with various matches, each having details like the date, venue, teams, and scores. The claim they want to verify is: \"when Twickenham Stoop be the venue on 28 March 2009, the score be 22 - 12.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly needs to be checked. The claim mentions two specific things: the venue and the score. So, I should look for a match in the table that was played at Twickenham Stoop on 28 March 2009, and check if the score was indeed 22-12.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns are: Date, Venue, Team A, Score, Team B, etc. I'll go through each row one by one to find the one that matches both the date and venue.\n\nStarting from row 0, I see the date is 12 February 2010 at KC Stadium. That's not matching. Moving on, row 1 is 26 February 2010, also at KC Stadium. Still no match. Next, row 2 is 5 March 2010, venue KC Stadium again.\n\nI'll keep going until I find a match where the date is 28 March 2009 and the venue is Twickenham Stoop. Scanning further down, I see row 8 with date 4 April 2010 at KC Stadium. Not it. Row 9: 11 April 2010, Headingley Carnegie.\n\nWait, let's look for the exact date of 28 March 2009. Checking each row, I find that row 13 has a date of 12 March 2010, which is too recent and not the same date as 28 March 2009.\n\nThen, row 14: 5 April 2010 at KC Stadium. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row earlier on. Let me recount. The table seems to have dates ranging from February 2010 to March 2011. So, the 28 March 2009 would be much earlier. However, looking back, none of the rows seem to match that exact date and venue.\n\nWait, but in the table provided by the user, the earliest dates are around 2010, so I might have miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the claim refers to a match on 28 March 2009, but looking at the table, there's no such row with that date and venue. Therefore, there is no match in the table that matches both the date and venue specified in the claim.\n\nSo, since there's no data in the table supporting the claim, it would be false. Also, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be 'Date' and 'Venue,' as those two specifics are part of the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a match on 28 March 2009 at Twickenham Stoop with a score of 22-12. However, upon reviewing the table, there is no such match recorded. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007 , where the score be 22 - 12\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The venue is twickenham stoop, and the date is April 6, 2007. There should be a match at this venue with a score of 22-12 in favor of one team.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different game with specific details like the date, venue, teams involved, and the score. The columns are: Date, Venue, Team A, Score, Team B, etc.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for matches where the venue is Twickenham Stoop on April 6, 2007, with a score of 22-12.\n\nStarting from row 0, the date is February 12, 2010, which is much later than April 2007. Venue is KC Stadium, so not relevant.\n\nNext, row 1: March 26, 2010, venue KC Stadium again, no match.\n\nRow 2: March 5, 2010, same venue, irrelevant.\n\nThen, row 3: March 12, 2010, venue JJB Stadium. Not the one.\n\nRow 4: April 5, 2010, venue KC Stadium, but date is April 2010, not 2007.\n\nRow 5: April 11, 2010, venue Headingley Carnegie. Not relevant.\n\nContinuing down, row 6: June 11, 2010, venue KC Stadium. No match.\n\nRow 7: July 4, 2010, venue Odsal. Not the one.\n\nMoving to 2011, rows 8 and 9 are March 7 and 18, 2011, not relevant dates or venues.\n\nRow 10: June 12, 2011, Headingley Carnegie again, irrelevant.\n\nWait, I might have skipped some earlier rows. Let me check from the top again but faster. Maybe I missed a row where the date is April 6, 2007.\n\nLooking at the table, all dates after 2009 are later than 2007. So there's no row with the date April 6, 2007. That means there's no game listed in the table that matches this specific date and venue.\n\nAdditionally, even if I look for a score of 22-12 at Twickenham Stoop on any date, from scanning the table, I don't see such a match either. The closest is row 9 where Harlequins scored 28-4 against Huddersfield Giants, but that's not the same.\n\nSo the claim has no support in the table provided. Therefore, it must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
