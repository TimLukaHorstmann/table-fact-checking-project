Found him here.\n\nSo, Ashley Baker is indeed a player in the table. Now, the claim says he's the player of the Ballarat Football League. I need to check if his 'competition' or any other relevant column matches this.\n\nLooking at the 'competition' column for Ashley Baker's row: It says \"ballarat football league\". That matches exactly with what the claim states. There's no need to look further; both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are where Ashley Baker is listed as the player and the competition is Ballarat Football League.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim in question is: \"the player for east perth be adam prior.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly needs to be verified here. The claim mentions two things: the player's name and their team (east perth). So, I should check both aspects against the table.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, each row represents a different match or game, with columns for player, competition, team, opponent, year, and score. My focus is on the \"player\" and \"team\" columns specifically.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find any entry where the player is named \"adam prior.\" Let's go row by row:\n\n1. **Row 8**: The player listed here is \"adam prior.\" That matches the name in the claim.\n2. **Column for Team**: In the same row, under the \"team\" column, it says \"east perth.\"\n\nSo, both conditions are met in this single row (row_index 8). There's no other occurrence of \"adam prior\" in any other row that I can see. Therefore, this seems to fully support the claim.\n\nI should also make sure there aren't any discrepancies or typos. For example, sometimes names might be slightly misspelled, but here both the player and the team match exactly as per the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I'll consider if there's any other relevant information that could affect the claim. The competition, opponent, year, and score are provided, but since the claim only concerns the player and their team, those details aren't necessary for this verification.\n\nIn conclusion, all relevant cells support the claim, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided. The table has several columns: player, competition, team, opponent, year, and score. Each row represents a different player's performance in their respective competitions.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the score for waaia be 114 - 113.\" So my first task is to find the row where the team is \"waaia.\" I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Player langley, competition victorian football association, team carlton. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Jim thoms, SAFL, west torrens vs north adelaide. No.\nRow 3: Darrel baldock, NWCU, east devonport vs devonport. No.\nRow 4: Kerry good, Night series, north melbourne vs collingwood. Not waaia.\nRow 5: Mick cleeland, Picola & district football league, WAAIA vs blighty. Oh, here we go! The team is \"waaia.\"\n\nNow that I found the relevant row, I need to check the score for this game. According to the table, the score is \"114 - 113.\" That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other entries for WAAIA. Looking at the rest of the rows: Adam Prior, David Rodan, Haydn Kiel, Jack Riewoldt\u2014none have WAAIA as their team. So only Row 5 is relevant.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this row's score column.

It has headers: player, competition, team, opponent, year, score. Each row represents a different player with their details.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: \"victorian football league\" and \"williamstown.\" So, I need to find rows where the competition is the Victorian Football League and the team is Williamstown.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has the competition as \"victorian football association,\" which isn't the same as the Victorian Football League. So that's out.\n2. The second row is the South Australian National Football League, not relevant here.\n3. Third row: North West Football Union, nope.\n4. Fourth row: Night Series, no match.\n5. Fifth row: Picola & District Football League, irrelevant.\n6. Sixth row: Australian Football International Cup, not Victorian FL.\n7. Seventh row: Ballarat Football League, not Victorian FL.\n8. Eighth row: Victorian Football League \u2013 this is a match for the competition part. Now check the team column: Williamstown. Yes, it says \"ballarat swans\" here. Wait, that's not Williamstown. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, in the eighth row, the team is \"ballarat swans,\" which isn't Williamstown. So maybe there's another row. Let me continue.\n\nNinth row: West Australian Football League, nope.\nTenth row: South Australian National Football League again, not relevant.\nEleventh row: North East Australian Football League, no.\nTwelfth row: Nab Cup (AFL Pre-Season Game), that's a competition name, but the team is Richmond vs Hawthorn. Not Williamstown.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Let me go through each row carefully again.\n\nLooking at row 7: Ballarat Football League, team is \"ballarat swans\" and opponent is darley. Not Victorian FL yet. Row 8 is Victorian Football League, but the team is Williamstown? Wait, let's check that again. The eighth row has:\n\n<td>jarrad grant</td>\n<td>victorian football league</td>\n<td>williamstown</td>\n<td>coburg</td>\n<td>2009</td>\n<td>119 - 116</td>\n\nYes! So here, the competition is Victorian Football League and the team is Williamstown. That matches the claim.\n\nSo there's at least one row that fits both conditions: competition is Victorian Football League and team is Williamstown.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there exists a player named Jarrad Grant who plays for Williamstown in the Victorian Football League.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as there is an entry matching the conditions specified.

The claim states that Ashley Baker is the player for this particular team.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table to find relevant information. The table has several columns: player, competition, team, opponent, year, and score. Since the claim mentions \"victorian football association\" as the team, I should focus on the rows where the competition column matches this.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row has a player named langley with a competition of \"victorian football association.\" So Ashley Baker isn't in this row.\n2. Continuing down the list, I find several players and competitions, but none of them mention \"victorian football association\" except for the first row.\n\nNow, focusing on the relevant columns: player (which is Ashley Baker) and competition (which should be \"victorian football association\"). However, in the table, there's no entry where Ashley Baker is associated with \"victorian football association.\" Instead, other players like jarrad grant and adam prior are listed under different competitions.\n\nI also notice that the claim uses the phrase \"the player,\" implying that Ashley Baker is specifically linked to \"victorian football association.\" Since this isn't supported by the table data, the claim must be false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check for any rows where Ashley Baker is a player and the competition is \"victorian football association.\" Scanning each row, I see that Ashley Baker is indeed listed in one of the rows (row 7) with his team as \"ballarat swans\" under the ballarat football league. There's no mention of him being part of the \"victorian football association.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold up because Ashley Baker isn't playing for the Victorian Football Association based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"the player for north melbourne be adam prior\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. The claim specifies that the player named Adam Prior plays for the team North Melbourne. So, my task is to verify if this information matches any entry in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different player with details such as their name, competition, team, opponent, year, and score. My focus should be on the \"player\" column and the \"team\" column for each row to check if Adam Prior is listed as a player for North Melbourne.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the table:\n\n1. The first player is Langley, but their team is Carlton, so that's not relevant.\n2. Jim Thoms plays for West Torrens, which isn't North Melbourne.\n3. Darrel Baldock's team is East Devonport, again not matching.\n4. Kerry Good is with North Melbourne, but the claim is about Adam Prior.\n5. Mick Cleeland is with WAAIA, so no match.\n6. Simphiwe Mbhalo represents South Africa, not relevant here.\n7. Ashley Baker plays for Ballarat Swans, which isn't North Melbourne.\n8. Jarrad Grant's team is Williamstown, still not matching.\n9. Adam Prior is listed as the player, and his team is East Perth, so this isn't North Melbourne.\n10. David Rodan is with Norwood, not relevant.\n11. Haydn Kiel plays for Southport, no match.\n12. Jack Riewoldt is with Richmond, again not North Melbourne.\n\nAfter reviewing each row, I notice that none of the players are named Adam Prior who also play for North Melbourne. The player Adam Prior is listed in the 2009 row (row index 8), but his team is East Perth, not North Melbourne. \n\nTherefore, the claim \"the player for north melbourne be adam prior\" is FALSE because there's no entry in the table where Adam Prior plays for North Melbourne.\n\nAdditionally, I'll identify the relevant cells that confirm this. The columns to look at are \"player\" and \"team\". For each row where either the player is Adam Prior or the team is North Melbourne, those cells are relevant.\n\nIn the table:\n- The player column has \"adam prior\" as the ninth entry (row index 8).\n- The team column for North Melbourne appears in rows where the team name is \"north melbourne\". Checking each row, it's present in rows where the player is Kerry Good and Mick Cleeland, etc. But since none of them are Adam Prior, those cells don't directly support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n1. The row where the player is Adam Prior (row 8) for both \"player\" and \"team\".\n2. Any rows where North Melbourne is the team, but since none of those players are Adam Prior, they don't support the claim.\n\nHence, I'll list these as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Second: \"jim thoms.\"\n3. Third: \"darrel baldock.\"\n4. Fourth: \"kerry good.\"\n5. Fifth: \"mick cleeland\" \u2013 wait, his team is \"waaia.\" So that's the one.\n\nNow, focusing on Mick Cleeland's row. The relevant columns are \"score,\" which is the fifth column (index 5 in 0-based or 5th in 1-based). Let me check the score: it's written as \"114 - 113.\" Hmm, wait \u2013 the score might be presented differently. I need to parse this correctly.\n\nThe claim says \"score over 120.\" So I should look at whether any of the scores in the table exceed 120 for Waaia's team.\n\nIn Mick Cleeland's game, the score is 114-113. That's a total of 227 points (114+113), but each team's individual score is under 120? Wait, no. The claim says \"the team of waaia score over 120.\" So it refers to whether Waaia scored more than 120 points in that game.\n\nLooking at the score for Waaia: 114. That's less than 120. So, in this case, the claim would be FALSE because Waaia didn't score over 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the score. In some contexts, \"score\" can refer to the total points or the margin. But here, it's more likely referring to the team's own score, which is 114. So 114 is less than 120, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"score over 120\" meant a win by more than 20 points, but that's not what the claim says.

The claim is: \"the ballarat football league 's team with williamstown\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim means. It seems like it's saying that in the Ballarat Football League, there's a team named Williamstown. So, I should look for any row in the table where the competition is the Ballarat Football League and the team is Williamstown.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details about their match. The columns are: player, competition, team, opponent, year, score. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. First row: Player langley, competition Victorian Football Association, team Carlton. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: Jim Thoms, South Australian National Football League, West Torrens vs North Adelaide. No.\n3. Third row: Darrel Baldock, North West Football Union, East Devonport vs Devonport. No.\n4. Fourth row: Kerry Good, Night Series, North Melbourne vs Collingwood. No.\n5.

Seventh row: Ashley Baker, Ballarat Football League, Ballarat Swans vs Darley. Here, the competition is Ballarat Football League and the team is Ballarat Swans. Not Williamstown.\n8. Eighth row: Jarrad Grant, Victorian Football League, Williamstown vs Coburg. Ah, here we go. The competition is Victorian Football League, not Ballarat, so this might be a distraction. The team listed is Williamstown, but the competition is different.\n9. Ninth row: Adam Prior, West Australian Football League, East Perth vs Claremont. No.\n10. Tenth row: David Rodan, South Australian National Football League, Norwood vs West Adelaide. No.\n11. Eleventh row: Haydn Kiel, North East Australian Football League, Southport vs Redland. No.\n12. Twelfth row: Jack Riewoldt, NAB Cup (AFL Pre-Season Game), Richmond vs Hawthorn. No.\n\nWait, in the 8th row, the team is Williamstown, but the competition is Victorian Football League, not Ballarat. So does that mean there's a Williamstown team in the Ballarat Football League? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at row 7: Ashley Baker's match is Ballarat Swans vs Darley for Ballarat Football League. No mention of Williamstown here.\n\nSo perhaps I need to look specifically for a row where the competition is \"Ballarat Football League\" and the team is \"Williamstown\".\n\nWait, but looking through all rows, none have both the competition as Ballarat Football League and the team as Williamstown. The closest is Ashley Baker's row, which is Ballarat Swans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. Let me check each row:\n\n- 7th row: Team is Ballarat Swans\n- 8th row: Competition is Victorian Football League, so not Ballarat\n\nSo there's no entry where both competition is Ballarat Football League and team is Williamstown.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the ballarat football league 's team with williamstown\". So it's about a specific team in the Ballarat Football League named Williamstown. If such a team doesn't exist in the table, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could mean that there's a team associated with the Ballarat Football League called Williamstown. But in the table, under \"team\", for Ashley Baker, it's Ballarat Swans, and others have different teams. There's no row where both competition is Ballarat Football League and team is Williamstown.\n\nWait, but looking again: The 7th row has competition as Ballarat Football League, team as Ballarat Swans. So if the claim was about a team named Ballarat Swans, it would be TRUE. But the claim says Williamstown. Therefore, since there's no entry with both Ballarat Football League and Williamstown, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but in row 8, the team is Williamstown, but competition is Victorian Football League. So that's a different league. So perhaps the Ballarat Football League doesn't have a Williamstown team. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
