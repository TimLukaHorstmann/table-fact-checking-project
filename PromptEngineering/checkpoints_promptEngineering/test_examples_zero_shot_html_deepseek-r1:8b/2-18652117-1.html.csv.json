    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tony lorick be the running back for oakland\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking at the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, the table has several columns: pick, team, player, position, college. The rows each represent a different player with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tony lorick,\" so I should look for that name in the player column. Scanning through the players:\n\n1. jack concannon\n2. pete beathard\n3. matt snell\n4. bob brown\n5. carl eller\n6. scott appleton\n7. tony lorick\n8. ted davis\n\nAh, I see \"tony lorick\" in row 7. Now, the claim also says he's a running back for Oakland. Let me check his position and team.\n\nIn row 7, the player is tony lorick, position is rb, and team is oakland. So that matches both aspects of the claim: he plays as a running back (rb) and is with the oakland team.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure there's no other entry for tony lorick in case it's duplicated or something. Looking through all the players again, tony lorick only appears once in row 7. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be fully supported by the table. The relevant cells are the ones in row 7 for team and position.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about the given HTML table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"the player from ohio state play for new york.\" \n\nFirst, I need to carefully check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim has two parts: one about the player and their position, and another about which team they played for.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: pick, team, player, position, college. Each row represents a different player with details about their team, position, and college.\n\nThe claim says that there's a player from Ohio State who plays for New York. So, I need to look for players from Ohio State and check if any of them are listed as playing for the New York team.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 3: Player is Matt Snell from Ohio State, position RB, team New York.\n2. Row 7: Player is Tony Lorick from Arizona State, position RB, team Oakland.\n3. Other players are from different colleges like Boston College, USC, Nebraska, Minnesota, Texas, Arizona State, Georgia Tech.\n\nWait, row 3 catches my attention because the player is Matt Snell from Ohio State and his team is New York. That seems to directly match the claim. \n\nBut I should double-check if there's another player from Ohio State who plays for New York or any other details I might have missed. Scanning through all rows again, only row 3 has a player from Ohio State (Matt Snell), and his team is indeed New York.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim appears to be TRUE because Matt Snell from Ohio State plays for New York.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a player from Ohio State plays for New York. Examining the table, we find that Matt Snell from Ohio State is listed with the team \"new york.\" This directly supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"tony lorick , , be the player who be pick number 7 , by denver.\"\n\nI notice there might be some punctuation issues in the claim. It seems to say that Tony Lorick is the player picked by Denver as the 7th pick. So I need to check if Tony Lorick is indeed the player with pick number 7, and whether his team is Denver.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'pick' number, 'team', 'player', etc. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Pick 1, Team Boston, Player Jack Cannon...\nWait, but the claim mentions Tony Lorick. So let's look for him in the player column.\n\nChecking the players: \n- Row 7 has \"tony lorick\" as the player.\n- His pick number is 7.\n- His team is Oakland (row 7 shows 'oakland' under 'team').\n\nWait, that doesn't match. The claim says he was picked by Denver, but in the table, he's with Oakland. That would mean the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow indexes are 0-based or 1-based? In the problem, the first row is probably index 0 or 1. Wait, looking at the HTML, the first tr has 'pick' 1, so row indices start from 1 as per the table.\n\nSo in the table:\n- Row 7 (the seventh tr) corresponds to pick number 7.\nLooking at that row:\n\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>oakland</td>\n<td>tony lorick</td>\n... etc.\n\nSo yes, Tony Lorick is with Oakland as his team, not Denver. Therefore, the claim that he was picked by Denver is incorrect.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says: \"new york be the team for the player from minnesota who's position be qb.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be checked.\n\n1. **Team**: new york\n2. **Player**: from minnesota\n3. **Position**: qb\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find a row where the team is \"new york\" and the player comes from \"minnesota,\" and their position is \"qb.\"\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\n- Row 0: Team is boston, player is jack concannon from boston college. Position is qb.\n- Row 1: Team is kansas city, player is pete beathard from usc. Position is qb.\n- Row 2: Team is new york, player is matt snell from ohio state. Position is rb.\n- Row 3: Team is denver, player is bob brown from nebraska. Position is ot.\n- Row 4: Team is buffalo, player is carl eller from minnesota. Position is de.\n- Row 5: Team is houston, player is scott appleton from texas. Position is dt.\n- Row 6: Team is oakland, player is tony lorick from arizona state. Position is rb.\n- Row 7: Team is san diego, player is ted davis from georgia tech. Position is lb.\n\nFrom this, I notice that the team \"new york\" is in row 2. However, in row 2, the position is \"rb,\" not \"qb.\" So, looking for a qb position with team new york, it's not found here or anywhere else in the table.\n\nNow, checking if any player from minnesota has the position qb. Looking at row 4: player carl eller is from minnesota, but his position is de, not qb. There's no other player from minnesota with a qb position in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold because there's no player from minnesota with the position qb who is on the new york team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there is no player from Minnesota listed with the position QB in the table. Relevant cells are row 4 (Carl Eller) and row 2 (Matt Snell), but they don't meet the criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
