    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Steve Sumner and Shane Smeltz is true based on the given table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Steve Sumner scored only 1 less goal than Shane Smelz for the New Zealand national football team.\" So, I'm looking at their goals compared to each other.\n\nLooking at the table, Steve Sumner's row is under \"steve sumner\" and his goals are listed as 22. Shane Smeltz's row has 23 goals. The claim suggests that Steve had only one less goal than Shane, which would mean Steve scored 22 and Shane scored 23, a difference of 1.\n\nI need to check the relevant columns for both players. For each player, I should look at the \"goals\" column because that's what the comparison is about. So, Steve Sumner's goals are in row 2, column \"goals\". Shane Smeltz's goals are in row 1, same column.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rows. The table starts with Vaughn Coveny as row 0, then Shane Smeltz as row 1, Steve Sumner as row 2. So yes, Steve is row 2, Shane is row 1.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For Steve: row_index 2, column \"goals\"\n- For Shane: row_index 1, column \"goals\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because 22 (Steve) is indeed one less than 23 (Shane). So I'll mark it as TRUE and list these two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim about Chris Wood, Chris Killen, and Shane Smeltz is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It states that these three players are the only current New Zealand national football team players who are in the top 20 highest goal scorers for the team.\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant columns in the table. The key columns here are \"name,\" \"goals,\" and possibly \"current\" status, but the table doesn't have a column explicitly indicating if they're current. However, since the claim mentions \"current,\" I need to infer this based on their career years.\n\nLooking at each player:\n\n1. **Chris Wood**: His row shows \"2009 -\" as his career, which suggests he's still active as of 2023. His goals are 10.\n\n2. **Chris Killen**: Career listed as \"2000 -,\" so he's also current. His goals are 16.\n\n3. **Shane Smeltz**: Career starts in 2003 and is ongoing, making him current. His goals are 23.\n\nNow, I need to check if these three are the only top 20 goal scorers who are currently on the team.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- **Chris Wood** has 10 goals.\n- **Chris Killen** has 16 goals.\n- **Shane Smeltz** has 23 goals.\n  \nNext, I'll scan other players to see if any others with high goals are still active. \n\nFor example:\n- **Grant Turner**: Retired in 1988, so not current.\n- **Darren McClennan**: Retired in 1997.\n- **Michael McGarry**: Retired in 1997.\n- **Wynton Rufer**: Retired in 1997.\n- **Steve Wooddin**: Retired in 1984.\n- **Roy Coxon**: Retired in 1952.\n- **Chris Jackson**: Retired in 2003.\n- **Dave Taylor**: Retired in 1981.\n- **Colin Walker**: Retired in 1988.\n\nLooking further, I don't see any other players with goals in the top 20 who are still active besides Chris Wood, Chris Killen, and Shane Smeltz. However, I should also check if there are others not listed in the table or if some have higher goal counts but aren't current. \n\nWait, the table might list all relevant players up to a certain year, but perhaps more recent players not included here? The claim specifies \"current,\" so I'm limited to those whose careers are ongoing as of 2023.\n\nLooking again, the only other active player is Chris Wood, Chris Killen, and Shane Smeltz. Therefore, they might indeed be the top three in terms of goals among current players.\n\nHowever, I notice that the claim says \"the only,\" implying no others. But looking at the table, some players like Alex Tane (not listed) or current international players not shown here might have higher goal counts. Since the table doesn't include all possible current players, it's a limitation. Still, based on the table, these three seem to be high goal scorers.\n\nBut wait, Shane Smeltz has 23 goals, which is quite high. Are there others with similar or higher? Checking the table, none of the other active players have as many as 23. Therefore, perhaps the claim is supported.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit uncertain because the table might not list all current players, and maybe there are others not included who also have high goals. But without that data, based solely on the table, Chris Wood, Chris Killen, and Shane Smeltz seem to be in the top 20.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Vaughan Coveny and Shane Smeltz is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states that Vaughan Coveny holds the record for both the most goals and the most caps in the New Zealand national football team, while Shane Smeltz is second.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the relevant data for these two players.\n\nStarting with Vaughan Coveny:\n- His row is the first one. Looking at the 'goals' column, it shows 28 goals.\n- The 'caps' column has 64 caps.\n\nNow, checking if there's any other player in the table who has more than 28 goals or more than 64 caps. I'll scan through each row:\n\nFor goals:\n- Other players like Chris Killen have 16 goals, which is less than 28.\n- Shane Smeltz has 23 goals, also less.\n- Most others are in single digits or low double digits.\n\nFor caps:\n- The highest number of caps is 64 by Vaughan Coveny. Others like Grant Turner have 42, Chris Killen 48, Michael McGarry 54, Darren McClennan 43, etc., all below 64.\n\nSo, Vaughan Coveny indeed holds the top spot for both goals and caps.\n\nNow, checking Shane Smeltz:\n- He has 23 goals and 49 caps.\n- I need to see if anyone else has more than him in these stats. Looking at other players:\n\nFor goals higher than 23: Only a few like Grant Turner (15), Colin Walker (10), Chris Jackson (10), etc., but none exceed 28, so Shane is second in goals? Wait, no, because others have fewer, but I need to check if anyone has more.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: The highest goal count is 28 by Vaughan. Others like Chris Killen have 16, Michael McGarry 12, Darren McClennan 12, etc. So Shane Smeltz with 23 goals doesn't necessarily mean he's second; the ranking would be first, second, etc., but since no one else has more than 20 except maybe Dave Taylor? Wait, checking again:\n\nDave Taylor has 10 goals, Colin Walker 10, Chris Jackson 10, others even lower. So Shane Smeltz with 23 is higher than all except Vaughan.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the claim says \"second.\" So if the highest is 28, then second would be someone with the next highest number of goals. Looking for the next highest after 28: The next highest is probably lower, like maybe 23 by Shane Smeltz. But wait, other players might have more than that.\n\nWait, let's list out all goal counts:\n- Vaughan Coveny: 28\n- Chris Killen:16\n- Shane Smeltz:23\n- Michael McGarry:12\n- Darren McClennan:12\n- Grant Turner:10\n- Colin Walker:10\n- Chris Jackson:10\n- Dave Taylor:10\n- Roy Coxon:10\n- Chris Wood:10\n\nSo the order is Vaughan (28), then Shane Smeltz (23). So if the claim says that Shane is second, he's actually in second place for goals. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding; perhaps the claim is about being the record holder and someone else being second.\n\nWait, the claim says \"vaughan coveny be the record holder for the most goal and the most cap from the new zealand national football team , while shane smeltz be second.\"\n\nSo in terms of goals, Vaughan has 28, which is more than anyone else. Shane Smeltz has 23, which is next highest. So yes, he's second.\n\nNow, for caps: Vaughan has 64, which is the highest. Next, looking at the 'caps' column:\n\n- Michael McGarry:54\n- Darren McClennan:43\n- Grant Turner:42\n- Chris Killen:31\n- Colin Walker:15\n- etc.\n\nSo the order is Vaughan (64), then Michael McGarry (54). So Shane Smeltz has 49 caps, which places him lower than Michael McGarry. Therefore, Shane Smeltz isn't second in caps; he's fourth or so.\n\nWait, but the claim says that Shane is second overall in both stats. Wait no, the claim doesn't specify whether it's for goals and caps separately. So maybe I need to check if he's second in either.\n\nWait, the original claim is: \"vaughan coveny be the record holder for the most goal and the most cap from the new zealand national football team , while shane smeltz be second.\" It seems like it's saying both in goals and caps. So for goals, Shane is second, but for caps, he isn't.\n\nBut wait, let me clarify: The claim says Vaughan is the record holder for both most goals and most caps, and Shane Smeltz is second. It doesn't specify if it's both in goals and caps. So perhaps it's saying that in terms of both stats, Shane is second to Vaughan. But looking at the table:\n\n- In goals: Vaughan 28, Shane 23. So Shane is second.\n- In caps: Vaughan 64, Michael McGarry 54, Darren McClennan 43, Grant Turner 42, Chris Killen 31, etc. So Shane has 49 caps, which would place him behind Michael McGarry (54), Darren McClennan (43), and others.\n\nSo in caps, Shane isn't second; he's fourth or so.\n\nTherefore, the claim is only true regarding goals where Shane is second, but not for caps. Since the claim says \"while shane smeltz be second,\" it might mean that he's second overall in both categories, which isn't accurate because in caps, he's not second. So the entire statement would be FALSE.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim could be saying that Vaughan is the record holder for both goals and caps, and Shane is the second place in both. But looking at the table:\n\nIn goals: 28 (Vaughan), then others like Chris Killen with 16, etc., but actually, wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking again, each row's 'goals' and 'caps':\n\n- Vaughan Coveny: Goals=28, Caps=64\n- Shane Smeltz: Goals=23, Caps=49\n\nNow, checking other players for higher goal counts:\n\n- Michael McGarry: 12 goals, Chris Killen:16, Darren McClennan:12, Grant Turner:10, etc. No one else has more than 28 except Vaughan.\n\nSo in goals, Shane is second with 23, as no one else has higher than that after Vaughan.\n\nIn caps:\n\n- Michael McGarry:54\n- Darren McClennan:43\n- Grant Turner:42\n- Chris Killen:31\n- etc. So Michael has 54, which is next highest after 64. Shane has 49, so he's fifth or sixth in the list.\n\nTherefore, in caps, Shane isn't second; he's lower than Michael McGarry, Darren McClennan, and Grant Turner.\n\nSo the claim that \"shane smeltz be second\" applies only to goals, not to caps. Since the statement says both (most goal and most cap), then it would imply that in both categories, Shane is second, which isn't true for caps.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement is incorrect because in caps, Shane is not second. So the task was to determine if this claim is correct. Therefore, the answer should be False.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made is that Vaughan Coveny is the record holder for both the most goals and the most caps in the New Zealand national football team, while Shane Smeltz is the second in both categories. \n\n- **For Goals**: \n  - Vaughan has 28 goals, which is the highest. \n  - Shane Smeltz has 23 goals, making him second in this category.\n\n- **For Caps**:\n  - Vaughan leads with 64 caps.\n  - The next highest is Michael McGarry with 54 caps, followed by Darren McClennan (43), Grant Turner (42), Chris Killen (31), etc. \n  - Shane Smeltz has 49 caps, placing him fifth or sixth.\n\nSince the claim asserts that Shane is second in both categories, it only holds true for goals but not for caps. Therefore, the statement is **False**.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is False.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"If Shane Smeltz scores 5 more goals throughout his time with the New Zealand national football team, he will be the highest scoring athlete for the team.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the information in the table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\n1. **Current Goals**: The claim refers to Shane Smeltz's current number of goals. Looking at the table, under the \"goals\" column for Shane Smeltz, I see that his goal count is 23. So, if he scores 5 more, that would bring his total to 28.\n\n2. **Highest Scoring Athlete**: The claim states that with this additional 5 goals, Shane would be the highest scorer. To verify this, I need to check all other players' current and potential maximum goals in their careers or current status.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Career and Goals Range**: Each player's career is listed with a start and end year (some are ongoing, like \"2003 -\"). The \"goals\" column shows their total goals. For example, Vaughan Covency has 28 goals, Chris Killen has 16, Darren McClennan has 12, etc.\n\n- **Shane Smeltz's Potential**: With an additional 5 goals, he'd have 23 + 5 = 28 goals.\n\nNow, I need to check other players' maximum possible or current goals. Let's see:\n\n- **Vaughan Covency** has 28 goals. If Shane gets 28, that would tie him with Covency.\n- **Colin Walker** has 10 goals, which is lower.\n- **Chris Jackson** also has 10 goals.\n- **Dave Taylor** has 10 goals.\n- **Wynton Rufer** has 12 goals.\n- **Michael McGarry** and others have fewer.\n\nHowever, the table doesn't specify whether these goal counts are career totals or current standings. If they're career totals, then Shane's 28 would tie Covency but not surpass him. However, if Covency is no longer active or his career total is higher, Shane could potentially be the highest scorer.\n\nWait, looking back, the table shows that Covency has a higher goal count than Smeltz. So, even after adding 5 goals, Shane's 28 would tie with Covency but not surpass him. Unless Covency has left the team or his goals are counted differently.\n\nBut according to the table, Covency has 28 goals, which is already higher than Shane's current 23. So, unless there's a way for Shane to surpass that number, he wouldn't be the highest scorer.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"throughout his time with the team,\" so if Shane's career is still ongoing and Covency's career has ended, then maybe Shane could surpass him in future goals. But as per the current data, Covency already has more goals.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't mention anything about when their careers ended. If Covency is no longer active, and Shane's career is still going on, he might eventually surpass Covency. But based solely on the numbers given, Covency is higher.\n\nTherefore, if Shane scores 5 more goals, making it 28, Covency already has 28, so he wouldn't be the highest scorer. Unless the claim assumes that Covency's total is not included or that Covency isn't part of the team anymore, which we don't have information on.\n\nSo, considering all this, the claim would be FALSE because even with 5 more goals, Shane can't surpass Vaughan Covency.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis reveals that even if Shane Smeltz scores 5 more goals, he won't surpass Vaughan Covency's current total of 28. Therefore, the claim is not supported.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Vaughn Coveney is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"Vaughn Coveney have a cap during his first year and during his last year of the team , overall he have 64 cap throughout his year with the team.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate Vaughn Coveney in the table. Looking at the 'name' column, row index 0 is \"vaughan coveny\". So that's the relevant row.\n\nNext, the claim makes several points:\n\n1. Vaughn had caps during his first and last years with the team.\n2. Overall, he has 64 caps in those years.\n\nI need to check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the 'career' column for Vaughn Coveney: 1992 - 2006. So his first year is 1992 and his last year is 2006.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many caps he had in those years. The 'caps' column shows a total of 64. But the claim mentions caps during his first and last years, not the total.\n\nWait, actually, the 'goals' column is 28, which doesn't directly relate to caps, but the 'caps' column for Vaughn is 64. So maybe the claim is about having 64 caps in total, including all years, not just the first and last. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no. The claim says he has a cap during his first year and last year, and overall he has 64 caps. Maybe it's implying that during each of those two years (first and last), he had at least one cap, and in total, across all his years, he had 64 caps.\n\nBut looking at the table, for Vaughn Coveney:\n\n- First cap: 7 June 1992\n- Last cap: 4 June 2006\n\nSo during his first year (1992), he did have a cap on 7 June. During his last year (2006), he had a cap on 4 June.\n\nNow, the 'caps' column shows a total of 64 caps throughout his career. So that part is correct.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"during his first year and during his last year\", so it's about having at least one cap each in those years, which is true based on the first and last cap dates being within their respective years.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Vaughn Coveney (row index 0), we need to check:\n   - First cap date: confirms he had a cap in his first year.\n   - Last cap date: confirms he had a cap in his last year.\n   - Total caps: 64, which is the total across all years.\n\nSo the relevant columns are 'first cap' and 'last cap', as well as 'caps'.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't have separate columns for first and last cap. It only has 'first cap' and 'last cap' in the same column? No, looking at the table, each row has a single 'first cap' and 'last cap' date.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, we need to check that he had caps during his first year (column: First Cap), during his last year (column: Last Cap), and the total caps (column: Caps).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Vaughn Coveney's row (row_index 0)\n   - 'First Cap'\n   - 'Last Cap'\n   - 'Caps'\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has columns like name, goals, caps, first cap, last cap. So for Vaughn Coveney, row index 0:\n\n- First Cap: 7 June 1992 (which is during his first year)\n- Last Cap: 4 June 2006 (during his last year)\n- Caps: 64\n\nSo all these three pieces of information are needed to verify the claim.\n\nBut let me check again. The claim states that he had caps during his first and last years, which is confirmed by the First Cap and Last Cap dates being in those respective years. It also says he has 64 caps overall, which matches the 'caps' column.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are for row index 0 (Vaughn Coveney) for columns: First Cap, Last Cap, and Caps.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Vaughn Coveney had at least one cap during his first year and last year, and he accumulated a total of 64 caps throughout his career.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"First Cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Last Cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Caps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Chris Wood and Dave Taylor is true or false based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Chris Wood be the record holder for the most goal and the most cap from the new zealand national football team , Dave taylor be second.\" So, according to the claim, Chris Wood is the top in both goals and caps, and Dave Taylor comes right after him, presumably as the second highest.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows for both Chris Wood and Dave Taylor. \n\nStarting with Chris Wood: I'll search through each row until I find his name. Scanning down, there's a row where the first cell is \"chris wood\". That's the one. So, Chris Wood is in row 18 (if we start counting from 0). Now, for each of his stats, I need to see if he holds the highest number in both goals and caps.\n\nLooking at his 'goals' column: it says 10. Now, I'll check other players to see if any have a higher number. Scanning through, players like Vaughan Coveny has 28 goals, which is much higher than Chris Wood's 10. Shane Smeltz has 23, Steve Sumner 22, Brian Turner 21, Jock Newall 17, Keith Nelson 16, Chris Killen 16, Grant Turner 15, Darren McClennan 12, Michael McGarry 12, Wynton Rufer 12, Steve Wooddin 11, Roy Coxon 10, Chris Jackson 10, Dave Taylor 10, Colin Walker 10, and Chris Wood 10. So, clearly, Chris Wood is not the record holder for goals; someone else like Vaughan Coveny has a much higher number. Therefore, the claim about him being the top in goals is false.\n\nNow, moving on to caps. Chris Wood's cap count is 31. I'll check other players: Shane Smeltz has 49, Steve Sumner 38, Brian Turner 35, Jock Newall 29, Keith Nelson 28, Chris Killen 27, Grant Turner 24, Darren McClennan 21, Michael McGarry 19, Wynton Rufer 25, Steve Wooddin 22, Roy Coxon 8, Chris Jackson 60, Dave Taylor 47, Colin Walker 15, and others. So the highest cap count is Shane Smeltz with 49, then maybe Steve Sumner with 38, then Brian Turner, etc. Since Chris Wood has 31, he's not the record holder here either. Therefore, his cap count isn't the highest.\n\nSo the claim that Chris Wood is the top in both goals and caps is incorrect because someone else holds the record in each category.\n\nNow, looking at Dave Taylor. The claim says he is second. So I need to check if he's the second highest in both goals and caps behind Chris Wood.\n\nFirst, goals: Dave Taylor has 10. Let's see who else has 10. Looking through the table, there are several players with 10 goals: Roy Coxon, Chris Jackson, Colin Walker, and Chris Wood. So it's not just two people; there are multiple with 10. Therefore, Dave Taylor being second in goals isn't necessarily accurate because others tie or surpass him.\n\nNext, caps: Dave Taylor has 47. Looking for who has more than that: Shane Smeltz has 49, Steve Sumner has 38, Brian Turner 35, etc. So Dave is third after Shane and Steve. Therefore, he's not second overall in caps either.\n\nSo both parts of the claim about Chris Wood being first and Dave Taylor being second are incorrect because there are other players with higher stats.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"grant turner , colin walker , and steve sumner be the only current new zealand national football team player who be also in the top 20 of highest goal score for the team.\"\n\nI need to verify if these three players are the only ones on the New Zealand national team who have scored in the top 20 goals. To do this, I should look at each relevant column in the table and check their goal scores.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns related to goals are \"goals.\" The claim specifically mentions the highest goal score, so I need to focus on that. Additionally, the players mentioned must be current national team players, which implies they might still be active as of the latest data provided in the table.\n\nLet me go through each player mentioned and check their goal counts:\n\n1. **Grant Turner**: His row shows \"goals\" as 15.\n2. **Colin Walker**: His row also shows \"goals\" as 10.\n3. **Steve Sumner**: His row shows \"goals\" as 22.\n\nNow, I need to see if there are any other current national team players with goals in the top 20. The top 20 would include scores from 20 downwards. So, any player with >=20 goals would be considered. Let's check all players:\n\nLooking at each row for the \"goals\" column:\n\n- **Brian Turner**: 21\n- **Wynton Rufer**: 12\n- **Steve Wooddin**: 11\n- **Roy Coxon**: 10\n- **Chris Jackson**: 10\n- **Dave Taylor**: 10\n- **Colin Walker**: 10 (already counted)\n- **Chris Wood**: 10\n\nWait, but I need to make sure these players are still current. The table might not reflect the latest data as of the user's instruction. For example, some players like Chris Wood have a status that's possibly active, but others might have retired.\n\nLooking at each player:\n\n- Grant Turner: His last known activity was up until 1988, which is quite old.\n- Colin Walker: Last mentioned in 1988, so likely retired.\n- Steve Sumner: Last mentioned in 1995, also retired.\n\nSo, if the claim refers to current players, these three might not be active anymore. However, the table doesn't specify their current status beyond the years listed.\n\nAdditionally, other players like Chris Wood have 10 goals, which is below the top 20. Brian Turner has 21, but he's probably retired as well. Wait, no\u2014Brian Turner's row shows \"goals\" as 21, but I don't see his current status. If he's still active and in the top 20 (since 21 is above 20), that would disprove the claim.\n\nWait, the claim says they are the only ones in the top 20. So, if Brian Turner has 21 goals and is still current, that would make the claim false because he's also in the top 20.\n\nBut I need to confirm Brian Turner's status. Looking at his row: \"dave taylor\" has a date range up to 1981, so Brian Turner might have retired before that.\n\nAssuming all players mentioned are no longer active, then among the current team, do any others have >=20 goals? From the table, only Grant Turner (15), Colin Walker (10), and Steve Sumner (22) are listed. But if they're not current, there might be others with higher scores who are still active.\n\nWait, the claim says \"current\" players, so I need to check if any other current players have >=20 goals. From the table, only Grant Turner has 15, which is below 20. Steve Sumner's 22 would be top 20, but he might not be current.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are no other current players in the top 20 besides these three if they're active. But since Steve Sumner and Colin Walker are likely retired, maybe Brian Turner is also retired, so the only possible current player is Grant Turner with 15 goals, which is below 20.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express:\n\nThe claim is that Grant, Colin, and Steve are the only CURRENT players in the top 20 goal scorers. So, their goal counts must be in the top 20 and they must be current.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n- Grant Turner: 15 goals (if he's current)\n- Colin Walker: 10 goals (if he's current)\n- Steve Sumner: 22 goals (if he's current)\n\nIf all three are still active, their goal counts are 15,10, and 22. So among them, Steve has the highest at 22.\n\nNow, checking other players who might be current:\n\nLooking through the table, I see Chris Wood with 31 goals. If Chris is current, he would have 31, which is in the top 20, making the claim false because there's at least another player (Chris) in the top 20 besides Grant, Colin, and Steve.\n\nWait, but Chris Wood's last activity was up to 2013, so perhaps he's still active as of now. His goals are 31, which is definitely in the top 20. So if he's current, then the claim that Grant, Colin, and Steve are the only ones is false because Chris Wood is also a current player with higher goals.\n\nAdditionally, looking back at Brian Turner: He has 21 goals but likely retired before 1988, so not current anymore.\n\nTherefore, Chris Wood would be another current player in the top 20, making the claim FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if Chris Wood isn't considered current for whatever reason, maybe the claim holds. But based on the table data, it's more accurate to consider him active since his last match was in 2013, which is recent compared to others who stopped by 1995 or earlier.\n\nSo, the presence of Chris Wood with 31 goals and likely still active would mean the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells to verify are the goal counts for Grant Turner (15), Colin Walker (10), Steve Sumner (22), and Chris Wood (31). Since Chris Wood's goals are higher than 20 and he is likely current, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim about Chris Wood is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"If Chris Wood scores 5 more goals throughout his time with the New Zealand national football team, he will be the highest scoring athlete for the team.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant information about Chris Wood. Scanning each row, I spot his name in one of the rows. Let's see which one it is.\n\nLooking at the 'name' column: there's a row with \"chris wood\". So that's the one. Now, let me check the other columns for his data.\n\nFrom the table, Chris Wood has:\n- Career: 2009 -\n- Goals: 10\n- Caps: 31\n- First cap: 3 June 2009\n- Most recent cap: 5 September 2013\n\nThe claim is about him scoring 5 more goals. So his current total is 10 goals, and adding 5 would make it 15.\n\nNow, I need to check if he would be the highest-scoring athlete for New Zealand. To do this, I should look at all other players in the table to see their goal counts.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. vaughan coveny: 28 goals\n2. shane smeltz: 23\n3. steve sumner: 22\n4. brian turner: 21\n5. jock newall:17\n6. keith nelson:16\n7. chris killen:16\n8. grant turner:15\n9. darren mcclennan:12\n10. michael mcgarry:12\n11. wynton rufer:12\n12. steve wooddin:11\n13. roy coxon:10\n14. chris jackson:10\n15. dave taylor:10\n16. colin walker:10\n17. chris wood:10\n\nLooking at this list, Chris Wood has 10 goals. The highest so far is Vaughan Coveny with 28, followed by Shane Smeltz with 23, Steve Sumner with 22, Brian Turner with 21. \n\nIf Chris Wood scores 5 more goals, he would have 15. Now, I need to check if anyone else has more than 15. From the data above, no one besides the top four has that high of a goal count.\n\nWait, but looking again, after adding 5, Chris would have 15. The next highest is Grant Turner with 15 as well. So he would tie with Grant Turner for the second place. But the claim says \"he will be the highest scoring athlete\". So if there's someone else with the same number of goals, that might mean he isn't the sole highest.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data again: after Chris Wood (10), Grant Turner has 15. Wait no, Grant Turner is in the list as having 10? No, let me check again. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the table, the row for Grant Turner says Goals: 10, and Colin Walker also has 10. So when Chris Wood adds 5, he goes to 15. Is there anyone else with 15 or more? From the list, after adding 5, Chris would have 15. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny:28\n- Shane Smeltz:23\n- Steve Sumner:22\n- Brian Turner:21\n- Then several with lower numbers, including Grant Turner at 10 and Colin Walker at 10.\n\nWait, no one else has more than 15. So if Chris adds 5, he'd have 15, which is higher than Grant Turner's 10. So he would be the highest. But wait, in the table, Grant Turner has Goals:10? Or did I misread it?\n\nWait no, looking back: The row for Grant Turner says Career:1984-1988, Goals:10. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo if Chris adds 5, his total is 15, which would make him higher than all others except the top four. Wait, but in the table, the highest is Vaughan Coveny with 28, Shane Smeltz 23, Steve Sumner 22, Brian Turner 21. So even after adding 5, Chris would only have 15, which is still lower than those four.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the table. The claim says that if Chris scores 5 more goals, he will be the highest. But looking at the data, others have much higher numbers.\n\nSo, let's recast this: Chris Wood currently has 10 goals. If he adds 5, he'll have 15. Looking through all players:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny:28\n- Shane Smeltz:23\n- Steve Sumner:22\n- Brian Turner:21\n- Colin Walker:10\n- Grant Turner:10\n- Chris Wood:10 +5=15\n\nSo, even after adding 5, he's still behind the top four. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because others have higher goal counts than what Chris would achieve with an additional 5 goals.\n\nWait, but wait again. The claim says \"the highest scoring athlete for the team.\" So if Chris adds 5, he has 15, and no one else in the table has more than 28. But that doesn't make him the highest; others are higher. Therefore, the claim is false because there are players with higher goals.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check again: if Chris Wood's total after adding 5 is 15, and no one else in the table has more than 28, then he wouldn't be the highest. So the claim is incorrect, so the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps the table doesn't include all players, only the ones listed. If the claim is that with 5 more goals, Chris would be the highest among those listed, but in reality, others have higher numbers. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that if Chris Wood scores 5 more goals, he will be the highest-scoring athlete for New Zealand. However, upon reviewing the table, several players have significantly higher goal counts than what Chris would achieve with an additional 5 goals (he'd reach 15, but others like Vaughan Coveny have 28). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Vaughn Coveney have a cap during his second year and during his third year of the team, overall he have 19 cap throughout his year with the team.\"\n\nFirst, I'll locate Vaughn Coveney in the table. Looking at the 'name' column, I find him as the first row (row_index: 0). Now, I need to check the relevant columns for his career and caps.\n\nThe claim mentions his second and third years. The 'career' column shows his tenure from 1992 - 2006. That's a span of 15 years, but it's unclear how his second and third years align within this timeframe. However, more importantly, I need to look at the 'caps' column.\n\nThe table lists Vaughn Coveney with 28 caps. The claim says he has 19 caps throughout his time with the team. Wait, that doesn't add up. If the total is 28, then 19 would be less than that, but the claim seems to suggest only 19, which contradicts the table. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to a specific period, like his second and third years. But according to the table, he has 64 caps. That's a lot more than 19. So if the claim says he had 19 caps in those two years, but the table shows he actually had 28 overall, then that doesn't align.\n\nWait, no, the 'goals' and 'caps' columns are separate. The 'caps' column for Vaughn is 64. The claim refers to \"19 cap throughout his year.\" That seems incorrect because 64 is much higher than 19. Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how caps are counted per year.\n\nWait, maybe the user meant 19 caps in total, but that doesn't fit either because he has 28 goals and 64 caps. So if the claim says he had 19 caps during his second and third years, but according to the table, he actually had more than that overall, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.
