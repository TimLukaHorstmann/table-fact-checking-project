    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey have win 2 fight by tko between 2005 and 2009\" is true based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. The key points are:\n- Muhsin Corbbrey\n- Has won 2 fights\n- By TKO (Technical Knockout)\n- Between the years 2005 and 2009\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. Each row represents a fight with columns for date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, time, and record.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if Muhsin Corbbrey is listed as the fighter who won by TKO within that timeframe.\n\nStarting from 2005 onwards:\n\n1. **2005 - 11 - 26**: Result is 'win', Opponent is 'Ben Lock'. Method isn't specified, but it's a 'decision (unanimous)'. So not a TKO.\n2. **2005 - 04 - 26**: He has a loss to Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez via decision. Not relevant.\n3. **2005 - 04 - 08**: It's a draw against Ricardo Planter, so no win by TKO.\n4. Moving to 2006:\n   - **2006 - 09 - 15**: Result is 'win', Opponent is 'Ryan Rayonec'. Method is 'tko'. Round 4, Time 0:54. So that's a TKO win.\n5. **2006 - 06 - 15**: He loses to Tim Coleman via decision. Not relevant.\n6. **2006 - 04 - 21**: Win against Shelton Barnes by Tko in round 1. That's another TKO win.\n7. **2006 - 03 - 09**: Win against Kareem Robinson by decision (unanimous). Not a TKO.\n8. **2006 - 01 - 26**: Win against Anthony Abrams by decision (unanimous). Again, not a TKO.\n9. In 2005 and earlier, there are no other rows for Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\nFrom the table, it looks like Muhsin Corbbrey has two wins by TKO: one on September 15, 2006, against Ryan Rayonec (round 4), and another on April 21, 2006, against Shelton Barnes (round 1). Both falls within the years 2005-2009.\n\nI don't see any other relevant rows for him in that timeframe with TKO wins. So the claim seems to be supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"muhsin corbbrey fight 2 fight in florida in 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions Muhsin Corbbrey fighting twice in Florida during 2005. So I need to check if there are two fights by him in Florida in that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with columns like date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, and time. The location is specified as a city and state, so \"Florida\" would be relevant.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if Muhsin Corbbrey fought in Florida in 2005.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- 2009: Not 2005.\n- 2006: Not 2005.\n- 2006 again: Still 2006.\n- 2006, April and March: All before 2005.\n- 2005: November, which is after April but still in 2005. Let's check the location.\n\nRow for November 26, 2005:\n- Opponent: Ben Lock\n- Venue: Show Place Arena\n- Location: Upper Marlboro, Maryland, USA. So not Florida.\n\nAnother row for 2005 is April 26:\n- Opponent: Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez\n- Location: Miami, Florida, USA. That's in Florida.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"fight 2 fight,\" meaning two fights. So I need to check if there are two entries where Muhsin Corbbrey fought in Florida in 2005.\n\nLooking again, only one row (April 26, 2005) has Florida as the location and is from 2005. The other 2005 entry is November but not in Florida. So only one fight.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if his name is spelled correctly. In the table, the opponents' names are like \"Ben Lock\" and \"Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez.\" There's no mention of Muhsin Corbbrey anywhere, which suggests he isn't listed here. Therefore, there might be a mistake in assuming these are his fights.\n\nSo, the claim seems to have two issues:\n1. The table doesn't show Muhsin Corbbrey as having any fights.\n2. Even if it did, only one fight is in Florida in 2005.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of two such fights by him in Florida during 2005.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"muhsin corbbrey have never lose a fight in south carolina\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has several columns: date, result, opponent, venue, location, method, round, and time. The claim is about whether Muhsin Corbbrey has ever lost a fight in South Carolina. \n\nI need to check if there's any evidence in the table that supports or contradicts this claim. So, I'll go through each row of the table and see if any relevant information is present.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row (row 0) has a date in 2009, venue Shoreline Ball Room, location Hilton Head, SC, USA. The result is a win. So, this isn't about a loss by Muhsin, but he won the fight.\n\n2. Row 1: Date 2006-09-15, venue Omar Shrine Temple, location Mount Pleasant, SC. Result is win again. No loss here.\n\n3. Row 2: 2006-06-15, opponent Tim Coleman, venue Michael's Eighth Avenue, location Glen Burnie, MD. The result is a loss, but the location is in Maryland, not South Carolina. So this isn't relevant for fights in SC.\n\n4. Row 3: 2006-04-21, venue Omar Shrine Temple, Mount Pleasant, SC. Result is win.\n\n5. Row 4: 2006-03-09, opponent Kareem Robinson, venue Michael's Eighth Avenue, Glen Burnie, MD. Result is a loss, but again, location is Maryland, not SC.\n\n6. Row 5: 2006-01-26, same venue and location as row 4, result loss, but location is MD.\n\n7. Row 6: 2005-11-26, opponent Ben Lock, venue Show Place Arena, Upper Marlboro, MD. Result is a loss, but again in Maryland.\n\n8. Row 7: 2005-04-26, opponent Emanuel Gonzalez, venue Radisson Hotel, location Miami, FL. Result is loss, but not in SC.\n\n9. Row 8: 2005-04-08, opponent Ricardo Planter, venue Club Med Sandpiper, Port St Lucie, FL. Result is a draw, and the location is Florida, so not relevant.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of these losses occurred in South Carolina. From the table, all the losses are either in Maryland or other states like Florida, but none in South Carolina. Therefore, there's no evidence that Muhsin Corbbrey lost a fight in SC based on this data.\n\nSo, the claim is that he has never lost a fight in SC.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against muhsin corbbrey in 2006.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts. The main elements are Tim Coleman, losing a fight, fighting against Muhsin Corbbrey, and the year 2006.\n\nLooking at the table, I'm searching for rows where the fighter is Tim Coleman and the opponent might be Muhsin Corbbrey around 2006. But wait, in the table provided, I don't see an opponent named \"Muhsin Corbbrey.\" The opponents listed are Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, Shelton Barnes, Kareem Robinson, Anthony Abrams, Ben Lock, and Emanuel Gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez. There's no mention of Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\nNext, I'll check if Tim Coleman lost any fights in 2006 against anyone. In the table, there's a row where the fighter is Tim Coleman with a result of \"loss\" on 2006-06-15 against Tim Coleman vs Tim Coleman? Wait, no, looking again: no, the opponent in that row is Tim Coleman's name? Let me check:\n\nWait, no, the rows are for Tim Coleman's fights. For example, one row has:\n<td>2006 - 06 - 15</td>\n<td>loss</td>\n<td>tim coleman</td>\nSo, Tim Coleman fighting against someone else, and he lost. But the claim is about him not losing against Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006.\n\nSince there's no row with Muhsin Corbbrey as the opponent in 2006, I need to check if such a fight exists. If it doesn't exist, then Tim Coleman didn't lose against him, making the claim true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only lists certain fights and doesn't include all possible opponents. So, without any evidence of a fight between Tim Coleman and Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006 where Tim lost, the claim holds as true because he didn't have such a loss.\n\nWait, but looking at the table again, I see that Tim Coleman has several losses in 2006 against different opponents. For example:\n- On 2006-06-15, he lost to Tim Coleman? Wait, no: looking at the row, the opponent is 'tim coleman' and the result is loss. That seems odd because if it's the same name, perhaps it's a typo or an internal fight? Or maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, that might be a mistake because if the fighter is Tim Coleman and the opponent is also Tim Coleman, that would imply he lost to himself, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's an error in the table, but I should proceed with what's given.\n\nHowever, regardless of that, the key point is whether Tim Coleman lost against Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006. Since there's no such row in the table, it suggests he didn't lose against him, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

The claim states: \"muhsin corbbrey fight in 2 fight that last more than 5 round between 2006 and 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify if Muhsin Corbrey is in the table. Looking at the 'opponent' column, I see names like Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, etc. I don't see \"Muhsin Corbrey\" listed as an opponent in any row.\n\nIf he isn't in the opponents list, then perhaps he's the fighter. But since his name isn't there, maybe the claim is about someone else's fights. Alternatively, it could be a typo and they meant another fighter, but I have to go by what's given.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"2 fight that last more than 5 rounds.\" So I need to check each relevant row for the number of rounds in the 'round' column between 2006 and 2009.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- 2009-02-28: round=6\n- 2006-09-15: round=4\n- 2006-06-15: round=6\n- 2006-04-21: round=1\n- 2006-03-09: round=4\n- 2006-01-26: round=4\n- 2005-11-26: round=4\n- 2005-04-26: round=4\n- 2005-04-08: round=4\n\nWait, the claim says \"more than 5 rounds.\" But in all these rows, the 'round' column only goes up to 6. So a fight lasting more than 5 rounds would be 6 or more. Looking at row 0 (2009-02-28), the round is 6.\n\nBut since Muhsin Corbrey isn't listed as an opponent, maybe he's not involved in these fights. Alternatively, perhaps the claim refers to him fighting two times, each lasting more than 5 rounds. But without his name in the table, I can't confirm that.\n\nAdditionally, some rows have 'round' as 6, which is more than 5. For example, row 0 (2009) and row 2 (2006). So there are fights with more than 5 rounds in the time frame specified.\n\nBut since Muhsin Corbrey isn't in the table, I can't link him to these fights. The claim mentions \"muhsin corbbrey,\" so if his name isn't present, it's not supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of Muhsin Corbrey fighting in two matches between 2006 and 2009 with more than five rounds each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the claim. It mentions \"muhsin corbbrey,\" who is likely a fighter, having 3 wins by TKO (Technical Knockout) within the years 2005 to 2009. So, I need to check if there are any fights in the table where Muhsin Corbbrey won via TKO during those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with columns like date, result, opponent, etc. The 'result' column can be win, loss, draw, or specific methods like decision (unanimous) or TKO.\n\nI'll start by searching for any rows where the fighter's name is \"muhsin corbbrey.\" Scanning through the table, I notice that none of the opponents are named Muhsin Corbbrey. The opponents listed are names like Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, etc., but not Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\nSince there's no row with Muhsin Corbbrey as the fighter, it seems he isn't present in the table. Therefore, there's no data to support the claim that he has 3 TKO wins between 2005 and 2009.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if \"muhsin corbbrey\" is a different spelling or variant, like \"muhsin corbry\" or something similar? But in the table, all opponents are clearly spelled out, and none match that name. So it's unlikely that there's an error in spelling.\n\nAlso, considering the time frame: the table includes dates from 2005 to 2009, which is exactly the period mentioned in the claim. However, without any fights by Muhsin Corbbrey in those years, the claim isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be FALSE because there's no evidence of Muhsin Corbbrey having 3 TKO wins during that time.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if Muhsin Corbbrey has any fights resulting in a win by TKO between 2005 and 2009.

Venue is Omar Shrine Temple, which is in SC, not Florida. So, no match here.\n3. **2006 - Jun 15**: Tim Coleman fight. Venue is Glen Burnie, MD. Not FL.\n4. **2006 - Apr 21**: Shelton Barnes opponent. Venue again in SC. No.\n5. **2006 - Mar 09**: Kareem Robinson. Venue in MD. Still not FL.\n6. **2006 - Jan 26**: Anthony Abrams fight.

The claim mentions \"in 2006\", so this doesn't fit.\n9. **2005 Apr 08**: Ricardo Planter draw.

The only Florida fight is Emanuel Gonzalez in Miami (FL) in April 2005 and Ricardo Planter also in FL but in April 2005 as a draw.

So my task is to check all the fights listed in the table and see if any of them are losses by Corbbrey in Maryland.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns relevant here are 'date', 'result', 'opponent', 'venue', and 'location'. Since the claim is about losing in Maryland, I need to focus on rows where the location is Maryland and the result is a loss for Muhsin Corbbrey.\n\nNow, let's examine each row:\n\n1. The first row (row 0) has a date of February 28, 2009. It's a win against Troy Nelson in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Not relevant since it's not in Maryland and the result is a win.\n\n2. The second row (row 1) is September 15, 2006, also in South Carolina. A win, so no loss here either.\n\n3. Row 2 is June 15, 2006, in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The result is a loss against Tim Coleman. Wait, this might be relevant because it's in Maryland and the result is a loss. But wait, I need to confirm if the name is Muhsin Corbbrey or not.\n\nHold on, looking at the table, the opponents' names are Troy Nelson, Ryan Rayonec, Tim Coleman, Shelton Barnes, Kareem Robinson, Anthony Abrams, Ben Lock, Emanuel Gonz\u00e3\u00a1lez, Ricardo Planter. I don't see Muhsin Corbbrey listed as an opponent in any row. So maybe this loss isn't against him.\n\nWait, the claim is about Corbbrey's losses, not opponents. So if Corbbrey lost a fight in Maryland, we need to find rows where 'location' is Maryland and 'result' is loss, but the opponent would be someone else. Wait, no, actually, the result column shows whether he won or lost each fight. So in row 2, 'result' is loss. But the claim is about Corbbrey losing, so that's a potential relevant cell.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The claim is \"Muhsin Corbbrey have never lose a fight in Maryland.\" So we need to check if there are any entries where location is Maryland and result is loss for Corbbrey.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 2: Location is Glen Burnie, Maryland, result is loss. Opponent is Tim Coleman. So this row shows that Corbbrey lost in Maryland. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because he did lose a fight in Maryland.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains an entry where Muhsin Corbbrey lost a fight in Maryland (row 2). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against ben lock in 2006\" is true or false by checking the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look for fights involving Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006. The table has several rows with dates in 2005 and 2006, so I need to focus on 2006 data.\n\nI'll go through each row where the date is in 2006:\n\n1. **Row 2**: Date is 2006-09-15. Opponent is Ryan Rayonec. Result is win. So Tim Coleman won this fight.\n2. **Row 3**: Date is 2006-06-15. Opponent is Tim Coleman? Wait, no, the opponent here is Tim Coleman's name, but wait, the claim is about Tim Coleman vs Ben Lock. Let me check: The row shows \"tim coleman\" as the result and opponent is Tim Coleman? No, looking again: the row has \"result\" as loss and \"opponent\" as Tim Coleman. Wait, that can't be right because it's the same name. Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, in Row 3, the date is 2006-06-15, result is loss, opponent is Tim Coleman? That doesn't make sense if the claim is about Ben Lock. So perhaps this row isn't relevant because it's a fight against someone else, not Ben Lock.\n\nContinuing:\n\n3. **Row 4**: Date is 2006-04-21. Opponent is Shelton Barnes. Result is win.\n4. **Row 5**: Date is 2006-03-09. Opponent is Kareem Robinson. Result is win.\n5. **Row 6**: Date is 2006-01-26. Opponent is Anthony Abrams. Result is win.\n\nNow, looking for any fights where Tim Coleman lost against Ben Lock in 2006. From the table, I don't see any such entries. All the fights Tim Coleman had in 2006 are wins or losses against other opponents, not Ben Lock.\n\nWait, let me double-check if there's a fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006. The claim says Tim didn't lose against Ben in 2006. From the table, I see that Tim Coleman fought on 2006-06-15, which was a loss, but the opponent there is Tim Coleman? That seems off because it's the same name. Maybe that's a typo or mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at Row 3: date 2006-06-15, result loss, opponent Tim Coleman. That can't be correct because fighting yourself doesn't make sense. So this might be an error in the data. Or perhaps it's an opponent with a similar name, but not Ben Lock.\n\nSo in the table, there is no row where Tim Coleman lost against Ben Lock in 2006. Therefore, the claim that \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against ben lock in 2006\" would be true because there's no evidence in the table of such a loss.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows no fights between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006 where Tim Coleman lost.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"muhsin corbbrey fight in 4 fight that last more than 5 round between 2006 and 2009.\"\n\nI need to parse this sentence into key components:\n\n1. **Fighter Name**: muhsin corbbrey\n2. **Number of Fights**: 4 fights\n3. **Fighting Opponents**: \"that last more than 5 round\" \u2014 This seems a bit unclear, but I think it refers to fighting opponents who have had more than 5 rounds in their last fight.\n4. **Timeframe**: between 2006 and 2009\n\nSo, the goal is to check if muhsin corbbrey has fought 4 opponents within this timeframe where each of those opponents' last fights lasted more than 5 rounds.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify any rows where \"muhsin corbbrey\" is listed as the opponent. Wait, no\u2014wait, in the table, the 'opponent' column lists the fighters muhsin corbbrey has fought against. So each row represents a fight that muhsin corbbrey participated in.\n\nNow, I need to look for all rows where:\n\n- The date is between 2006 and 2009.\n- The result is a win (since the claim says \"fight in 4 fight that last more than 5 round\"\u2014assuming he won these fights)\n- The method of the fight is such that it lasted more than 5 rounds. Wait, looking at the 'method' column, which includes terms like 'decision', 'tko', etc. Maybe I need to check if the round number is higher than 5? But in the table, the 'round' column has values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. So rounds 6 and above are more than 5.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, looking at the table:\n\nFor example, the first row: round is 6, which is more than 5.\n\nSecond row: round is 4.\n\nThird row: round is 6.\n\nFourth row: round is 1.\n\nFifth row: round is 4.\n\nSixth row: round is 4.\n\nSeventh row: round is 4.\n\nEighth row: round is 4.\n\nNinth row: round is 4.\n\nTenth row: round is 4.\n\nEleventh row: round is 4.\n\nTwelfth row: round is 4.\n\nSo, in the table, most of the rounds are 4 or 6. So a fight lasting more than 5 rounds would be when the round is 6.\n\nNow, for muhsin corbbrey's fights between 2006 and 2009 where he won, with opponents having last fights that lasted more than 5 rounds (i.e., round=6). Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"fight in 4 fight that last more than 5 round\". So perhaps it's about the opponent's last fight lasting more than 5 rounds. Or maybe it's about the total number of rounds in the fight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that muhsin corbbrey fought 4 opponents in this timeframe, and each of those 4 fights lasted more than 5 rounds.\n\nLooking at the table, let's see how many times muhsin corbbrey fought between 2006 and 2009 with a round count greater than 5 (i.e., 6 rounds).\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is someone, method is 'draw', so not relevant if we're looking for wins.\n\nWait, in the table, each row is a fight that muhsin corbbrey participated in? Or is it the opponent's previous fight?\n\nWait, no\u2014the table lists fights where the opponent is muhsin corbbrey? Or does it list all the opponents that muhsin corbbrey has fought against.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The 'opponent' column in the table refers to who muhsin corbbrey fought against in each fight. So each row represents a fight that muhsin corbbrey had against an opponent, with details like date, rounds, etc.\n\nSo, for each of muhsin corbbrey's fights between 2006 and 2009 where he won, I need to check if the opponent's last fight (before fighting muhsin) lasted more than 5 rounds. Or maybe it's about the duration of the fight itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that muhsin corbbrey fought in 4 fights between 2006 and 2009 where each of those 4 fights lasted more than 5 rounds.\n\nSo, focusing on muhsin corbbrey's own fights, checking if he had 4 wins within 2006-2009 with each fight lasting over 5 rounds.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nLet me scan through each row and see which ones are muhsin corbbrey's fights where he won and the round count is >5.\n\nRow 0: Opponent is someone, result is 'draw'\u2014not a win.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Ricardo Planter, method is 'draw (majority)', not a win.\n\nRow 2: Opponent is Ricardo Planter again? Or maybe different. Wait, in the table, it's hard to tell which rows are muhsin corbbrey's fights unless we know the opponent names.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to identify all rows where the opponent is muhsin corbbrey. No, that would mean looking at the 'opponent' column for his name. But in the table provided, the opponents listed are:\n\n- (I think) The first row: Opponent's name isn't clear, but result is draw.\n- Row 1: Ricardo Planter\n- Row 2: Ricardo Planter again?\nWait, no\u2014looking at the table:\n\nActually, I'm getting confused because the table might be structured differently. Let me list out each row with details:\n\nRow 0:\n- Date: 2006-04-08\n- Opponent: Ricardo Planter\n- Result: draw (majority)\n- Method: draw (majority)\n- Rounds: 4\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the table again, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me reconstruct:\n\nLooking back, the table has 12 rows from index 0 to 11.\n\nEach row has:\n\n- Date\n- Opponent\n- Result\n- Method\n- Rounds\n\nNow, let's list them with their details:\n\nRow 0:\nDate: 2006-04-08\nOpponent: Ricardo Planter\nResult: draw\nMethod: draw (majority)\nRounds: 4\n\nRow 1:\nDate: 2005-04-08\nOpponent: Ricardo Planter?\nWait, no\u2014looking at the table, the first row after 2005 is:\n\nRow 0: 2006-04-08, Opponent: Ricardo Planter, Result: draw, Method: draw (majority), Rounds:4\n\nRow 1: 2005-04-08, Opponent: club med sandpiper? No, wait\u2014the opponent is Ricardo Planter.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to find all muhsin corbbrey's fights between 2006 and 2009 where he won and the fight lasted more than 5 rounds (i.e., 6 rounds).\n\nSo, looking through each row:\n\nLooking for rows where:\n\n- Date between 2006 and 2009\n- Result is 'win'\n- Rounds >5\n\nWait, in the table, I don't see any rows where result is 'win'. Most are draws or other results. Let me check:\n\nRow 0: draw\nRow 1: draw (majority)\nRow 2: Not sure\u2014opponent is muhsin corbbrey? Or no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Maybe each row represents a fight that muhsin corbbrey had, with details of the opponent in that fight.\n\nBut looking at the opponents:\n\n- Some are Ricardo Planter\n- Others might be muhsin corbbrey himself?\n\nNo, wait\u2014probably not. The 'opponent' column lists who muhsin corbbrey fought against in each fight. So if we can find how many times he fought and won between 2006-2009 with fights lasting more than 5 rounds.\n\nBut from the table:\n\nLooking at all rows where result is 'win', but I don't see any such results. All results are either draw, or someone else's previous fight?\n\nWait, perhaps the table is structured differently\u2014each row represents an opponent's fight against muhsin corbbrey, detailing their last fight.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 0: Opponent fought on 2006-04-08, vs muhsin corbbrey, result was draw (majority), method draw, rounds=4\n\nSimilarly, Row 1: Opponent fought on 2005-04-08, vs muhsin corbbrey, opponent's name is Ricardo Planter, etc.\n\nSo in this case, the rows are about opponents' previous fights against muhsin corbbrey. So each row represents an individual fight between an opponent and muhsin corbbrey.\n\nIn that case, to check how many times muhsin corbbrey fought and won between 2006-2009 with the fight lasting more than 5 rounds.\n\nBut in this table, I don't see any rows where muhsin corbbrey is listed as having a win. All results are draws or other outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a fight that muhsin corbbrey had, so we can check how many times he fought and won between 2006-2009 with the rounds over 5.\n\nBut without knowing all opponents, it's difficult.\n\nWait, but in the table provided:\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column:\n\nRow 0: Ricardo Planter\nRow 1: Ricardo Planter\n\nSo perhaps muhsin corbbrey fought against Ricardo Planter twice, and both times it was a draw.\n\nIn that case, he didn't win any fights between 2006-2009. So the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps each row is a fight that someone else had, not necessarily muhsin corbbrey.\n\nWait, perhaps the table lists all opponents who have fought against muhsin corbbrey, with details of their fights.\n\nSo in Row 0: Opponent (Ricardo Planter) fought on 2006-04-08 vs muhsin corbbrey, result draw.\n\nRow 1: Another opponent fought on 2005-04-08 vs muhsin corbbrey, same as above.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the better approach is to count how many times muhsin corbbrey fought and won between 2006-2009 with each fight lasting more than 5 rounds.\n\nBut from the table, I don't see any wins by him. All results are either draws or other outcomes.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is that he fought in 4 such fights, it would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists his opponents' records, and we need to check muhsin corbbrey's own fights.\n\nBut without clear information on his wins, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe claim is: \"You are tasked with proving that between 2006-2009, the fighter known as [name] fought in four matches where each match lasted more than five rounds and he won all of them.\"\n\nSo to prove this, we need to check if there are at least four such fights by [name] within that timeframe.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nAssuming each row represents a fight that [name] had:\n\nCheck each row for date between 2006-2009, result is win, and rounds >5.\n\nBut in the table provided, I don't see any rows where he won. Most are draws or other results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes opponents' information, not his own fights.\n\nWait, without clear data on [name]'s wins, it's difficult to confirm.\n\nBut assuming that the table is a list of his fights:\n\nLooking for four rows where date between 2006-2009, result=win, rounds>5.\n\nBut in the given data, there are no such rows. All results are either draws or losses, I think.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is misaligned, and each row represents a different fighter's record, not [name]'s.\n\nIn that case, it's impossible to determine based on this information.\n\nBut given the task is to prove whether he fought four times with wins over five rounds between 2006-2009, I would say no, because there are no such fights listed in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the table:\n\nRows:\n1. Opponent: Ricardo Planter, Date: 2006-04-08, Result: draw (majority), Method: Draw, Rounds: 4\n2. Opponent: Ricardo Planter, Date: 2005-04-08, Result: draw (majority), Method: Draw, Rounds: 4\n\nSo both times against Ricardo Planter, it was a draw.\n\nNo wins by [name] are shown.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he fought four such matches is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining whether the fighter in question, referred to as [name], fought four matches between 2006 and 2009 where each match lasted more than five rounds and he won all of them. \n\nBased on the provided data:\n\n- **Analysis of Fights**: The table lists two fights involving Ricardo Planter against what appears to be [name]. Both encounters resulted in draws, with the final round count being four for each fight.\n  \n- **Conclusion on Wins**: There are no wins recorded for [name] in the specified timeframe. All listed results are draws, indicating he did not win any matches during this period.\n\n**Final Determination**: The claim that [name] fought four such matches and won all of them is false based on the provided data.",
