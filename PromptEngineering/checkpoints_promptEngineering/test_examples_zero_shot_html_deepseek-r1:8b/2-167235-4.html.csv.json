    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. The claim states: \"Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived to be the oldest prime minister, 1872 - 1963.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row represents a different prime minister with their respective terms.\n\nI need to find Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri in the table. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see that he appears in the fourth row: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\". That's row index 3.\n\nLooking at his 'born - died' cell, it says 1872 - 1963. The claim mentions this exact timeframe, so that matches.\n\nNext, I'll check if he is listed as the oldest prime minister. The table doesn't provide information about the age of each prime minister when they served, nor does it rank them by age. It only gives their terms and the years they were born and died. \n\nThe claim refers to him being \"the oldest,\" implying that his lifespan was the longest among all listed prime ministers. However, without data on the ages at the time of their service or a comparison with others, I can't confirm this from the table.\n\nThus, while the timeframe matches, there's no information in the table supporting the claim that he was the oldest based on age during his term. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we first locate Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri in the table and verify his birth and death years match the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Locate Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri**: Found in row index 3 of the 'name' column.\n2. **Check Birth and Death Years**: His 'born - died' cell shows 1872 - 1963, which matches the claim.\n3. **Assess Oldest Prime Minister Claim**: The table lacks info on his age during service or comparison with others, so we can't confirm he was the oldest.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim's statement about his lifespan is true, but the assertion of being \"the oldest\" isn't verifiable from the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota 's leadership.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about the earliest term start date for someone named Kostaq Kota, specifically on September 5, 1928. So I need to look into the table and find any relevant information related to this.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns like name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. The rows are individual entries, each representing a different entity, mostly prime ministers with their terms.\n\nI should focus on the row where Kostaq Kota is mentioned. Scanning through the 'name' column, I see \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" in row 1, and another entry in row 4 also mentioning \"kostaq kota (2nd time).\" So there are two instances of Kostaq Kota in the table.\n\nNow, for each instance, I'll check their term start dates. The first occurrence is \"5 september 1928\" in row 1, under 'term start.' The second occurrence is on \"9 november 1936,\" which is later than September 1928. \n\nThe claim says that the earliest term start was on 5 September 1928 under Kostaq Kota's leadership. Since the first instance of Kostaq Kota started his term on that exact date, this aligns with the claim. The second term is a subsequent one, so it doesn't affect the earliest date.\n\nI also need to make sure there are no other entries for Kostaq Kota earlier than September 1928. From the table, the 'born - died' column shows his dates as 1889-1949, but that's just his birth and death, not related to term starts. His first term is indeed in 1928.\n\nSo, the claim seems to be supported by the data in row 1 of the table under the 'term start' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table, specifically in row 1 for Kostaq Kota's term start on 5 September 1928.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all prime minister on the list have no political party\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has five columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. The rows are data about different prime ministers and their terms.\n\nThe claim is that all listed prime ministers have no political party. To check this, I need to see if any of them belong to a political party as per the 'political party' column.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row after the header is labeled \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\". It seems like this might be a general category rather than an individual person's name, so I'm not sure if it should be considered. Maybe it's just indicating the time period, but since there's no specific name, perhaps we don't need to consider this row for individual party affiliations.\n\n2. The second row has \"kostaq kota (1st time)\". His political party is listed as \"non - party\". So he doesn't belong to any party.\n\n3. Third row: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" also lists his political party as \"non - party\".\n\n4. Fourth row: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\". His political party is \"non - party\" again.\n\n5. Fifth row: \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\". Same as the second row, he's non-party.\n\nSo, all individual prime ministers listed in the table have their political party as 'non - party', meaning they don't belong to any party. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the data provided.\n\nWait a minute\u2014should I consider the first row? It says \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" repeated in all columns except name. Since it's not an individual person, maybe we shouldn't include this in our relevant cells because the claim is about each prime minister, not a general category. So, perhaps only rows 2 to 5 are relevant.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there are no exceptions among these five. They all have 'non - party' as their political affiliation. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all listed prime ministers have no political party. By examining each row, we see that each individual prime minister (rows 2-5) is marked as \"non - party\". The first row refers to a general time period and isn't an individual, so it doesn't affect the claim.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"kostaq kota's term start on 9 november 1936, after mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's term end.\" So I need to verify if Kostaq Kota started his term on that specific date and whether this was indeed after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term ended.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the relevant columns: 'term start' and 'term end'. The rows are from index 0 to 4. \n\nI see two individuals mentioned in the claim: Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri. Scanning through the table:\n\n- In row 3 (Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri, 1st time), his term end is on 9 November 1936.\n- In row 4 (Kostaq Kota, 2nd time), his term start is also on 9 November 1936.\n\nWait, that seems off. If both events are on the same date, then Kostaq's term didn't start after Mehdi's ended; they ended and started on the same day. So the claim might be incorrect.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I'm not missing any details. Is there another occurrence of either name? Let me check all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Prime ministers, so irrelevant for individual names.\n- Row 1: Pandeli Evangjeli, non-related.\n- Row 2: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (2nd time), term end on 16 October 1935.\n- Row 3: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time), term end on 9 November 1936.\n- Row 4: Kostaq Kota (2nd time), term start on 9 November 1936.\n\nSo, in row 4, Kostaq's term starts on 9 November 1936. In row 3, Mehdi's term ends on the same date. Therefore, Kostaq's term started exactly when Mehdi's ended, not after. So the claim that it started after is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kostaq Kota's term started on 9 November 1936 after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term ended.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim says: \"Albania's first prime minister began their term in 1927.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify who Albania's first prime minister was. Looking at the table, I see that it lists prime ministers from 1928 onwards. However, the first row seems to be a header or perhaps a placeholder since all its cells say \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\". That might not be relevant.\n\nNext, looking at the rows below, there's an entry for \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" with term start as \"5 september 1928\" and term end as \"5 march 1930.\" So, his first term started in 1928. Another row mentions \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" starting on \"6 march 1930,\" which is later than 1927.\n\nThe claim says the first PM began their term in 1927, but according to the table, the first PM after 1928 started in September 1928. Therefore, there's no PM who started in 1927. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to find which ones relate to this. The term start and end years are under \"term start\" and \"term end.\" Since the first PM started in 1928, perhaps that row (row index 1) is relevant because it shows when he began his term.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in HTML format and contains information about various people along with their term details as prime ministers of Albania. \n\nThe claim is: \"kostaq kota mehdi bej frash\u00ebri be both 1st time prime minister of albania.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The table has headers: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row represents a person with their respective details.\n\nLooking at the claim, it's saying that both \"kostaq kota\" and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" were 1st time prime ministers of Albania. So, I need to check if these two individuals had a first term as prime ministers according to the table.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row in the table to see who these people are.\n\nThe first row seems to be a header or a summary: \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" repeated across all columns. That might not be a specific person, so I can skip that.\n\nNext, looking at the second row:\n- The name is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\".\n- Born - died: 1889 - 1949\n- Term start: 5 September 1928\n- Term end: 5 March 1930\n- Political party: non - party\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"kostaq kota\" as a 1st time prime minister. In this row, it's explicitly stated as (1st time), so that aligns with the claim.\n\nNow, moving to the third row:\n- Name: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\"\n- Born - died: 1859 - 1939\n- Term start: 6 March 1930\n- Term end: 16 October 1935\n- Political party: non - party\n\nNot relevant to the claim, so I can skip this.\n\nFourth row:\n- Name: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\"\n- Born - died: 1872 - 1963\n- Term start: 22 October 1935\n- Term end: 9 November 1936\n- Political party: non - party\n\nHere, \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" is noted as the (1st time), so this seems to support that he was a first-time prime minister. That matches part of the claim.\n\nFifth row:\n- Name: \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\"\n- Born - died: 1889 - 1949\n- Term start: 9 November 1936\n- Term end: 8 April 1939\n- Political party: non - party\n\nSo, this is his second term. The claim mentions him as a 1st time prime minister, but in the table, he's already in his second term here. That might be a problem because if the first occurrence was when he was (1st time), then later becoming (2nd time), that would mean the initial statement about being 1st time might not hold.\n\nWait, looking back at the claim: It says both \"kostaq kota\" and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" are both 1st time prime ministers. So, in the table, \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" is correct, but later he becomes (2nd time). That might mean that at some point, yes, he was a first-time PM, but when the claim refers to him as a current or specific instance, it's not accurate anymore because he served twice.\n\nHowever, in the table, each row represents their term. So, if the claim is stating that both of them were 1st time PMs, then I need to check if that's correct based on the table data.\n\nLooking at \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\" in the fifth row, it seems he served twice: first as (1st time) and then again as (2nd time). So, when the claim says he was a 1st time PM, that is supported by the second row. But wait, does the second row's \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" mean that in that particular term, he was first? Or is each occurrence of his name indicating a different term?\n\nWait, the table lists multiple terms for each person. For example, \"kostaq kota\" appears twice: once as (1st time) and then as (2nd time). So, in the second row, it's his first term, and in the fifth row, it's his second term.\n\nSo, when the claim says he was a 1st time PM, that's correct because in the second row, he is listed as (1st time). However, in the fifth row, he's (2nd time), which would mean he served again later. But the claim is making a general statement about both being 1st time PMs.\n\nWait, no, the claim specifically refers to them as both being 1st time PMs. So, for \"kostaq kota\", in one of his terms (second row), it's noted as 1st time. But then he serves again, so perhaps the term when he was first is correct, but the claim might not be accurate because he did serve again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each occurrence is a separate term, so he had two terms: first in 1928-1930 and second in 1936-1939. So, as of those terms, he served twice. Therefore, when the claim says he was a 1st time PM, that's true for his first term, but it's also correct because in another context, he became a second-time PM.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe claim is stating that both \"kostaq kota\" and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" were 1st time prime ministers of Albania. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- For \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", his term was from September 1928 to March 1930.\n- Later, he is listed again as \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\" with a term from November 1936 to April 1939.\n\nSo, during the first occurrence, he's a 1st time PM, and then in his next term, it's marked as 2nd time. Therefore, at some point, he did serve as a 1st time PM.\n\nHowever, for \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\", his term is from October 1935 to November 1936, so that would make him the first-time PM during that period.\n\nSo, both of them indeed served as 1st time PMs in their respective terms. Therefore, the claim might be correct.\n\nWait, but the fifth row's \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\" is after the fourth row's \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\". So, the timeline would make sense: first, \"pandeli evangjeli\" served in 1930-35, then \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" in 1935-36, and then \"kostaq kota\" again in 1936-39.\n\nSo, if both \"kostaq kota\" (1st time) and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" (1st time) served at the same time or overlapping periods, does that make sense?\n\nLooking at their terms:\n- pandeli evangjeli: 1930-35\n- mehdi bej frash\u00ebri: 1935-36\n- kostaq kota (2nd time): 1936-39\n\nWait, so in 1935, both \"pandeli evangjeli\" and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" were serving? That might not make sense because there can only be one PM at a time. So perhaps the table is listing them as separate terms, but their actual periods overlapped.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but I think the main point is that in the table, \"kostaq kota\" is marked as (1st time) and later as (2nd time), so he did serve twice, making the claim correct because at some point he was a 1st time PM. Similarly, \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" is only listed once as (1st time). \n\nTherefore, both of them were indeed 1st time PMs in their respective terms.\n\nWait, but another angle: If the claim is that they are currently both serving as 1st time PMs, then it might not hold because \"kostaq kota\" had already served twice before. But if it's a general statement about them having been 1st time PMs at some point in their careers, then yes.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell the exact meaning of the claim. However, based on the information given, both \"kostaq kota\" (as 1st time) and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" (also as 1st time) are present in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that both were indeed first-time PMs at some point. Hence, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that both \"kostaq kota\" and \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" were 1st time Prime Ministers of Albania holds true based on the information provided in the table. Each served as a first-time Prime Minister during their respective terms:\n\n- **Kostaq Kota** served his first term from September 1928 to March 1930, marked as (1st time).\n- **Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri** served his first term from October 1935 to November 1936, also marked as (1st time).\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the second oldest prime minister after pandeli evangjeli.\" So, it's stating that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the second oldest among the two, with Pandeli Evangjeli being older.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows and columns. The key elements here are \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri\" and \"pandeli evangjeli\". They should be in the 'name' column since that's where the prime ministers are listed.\n\nSo, let me check each row:\n\n- Row 1: It says \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\", which is a general term, not specific to an individual. So this isn't relevant.\n- Row 2: \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" \u2013 not the person in question.\n- Row 3: \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" \u2013 this is one of the individuals mentioned in the claim.\n- Row 4: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\" \u2013 this is the other individual in the claim.\n- Row 5: \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\" \u2013 again, not relevant.\n\nNext, I need to look at their lifespan. The 'born - died' column provides that information. For Pandeli Evangjeli, it's 1859 - 1939, so he lived until 1939. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is born in 1872 and died in 1963, so he lived longer than Pandeli.\n\nNow, the claim says Mehdi was the second oldest after Pandeli. So we need to determine who was older between the two. Since Pandeli was born in 1859 and Mehdi in 1872, Pandeli is older by about 7 years. Therefore, Mehdi would be the younger one, making the statement incorrect because he's not the second oldest; he's actually the younger.\n\nWait, but the claim says Mehdi was the \"second oldest\", implying that there was someone else older. But looking at the table, both are prime ministers during those terms. So maybe the claim is trying to say that among all the prime ministers listed in the table, Mehdi is second oldest after Pandeli. \n\nWait another angle: perhaps the 'born - died' dates determine their age when they held office or their lifespan. Since Pandeli died in 1939 and Mehdi died in 1963, Mehdi lived longer but was born later.\n\nSo, in terms of age at death, Pandeli would have been older than Mehdi, as he died earlier. So if the claim is about their age, Mehdi is younger. But perhaps it's about the order in which they served. Let me check the 'term start' and 'term end' columns.\n\nMehdi's first term started on October 22, 1935, and ended on November 9, 1936. Pandeli's second term started March 6, 1930, and ended October 16, 1935. So Pandeli served earlier than Mehdi. Therefore, Mehdi came later.\n\nIn terms of age when they became prime minister: Pandeli was born in 1859, so by 1930, he would be around 71 years old. Mehdi was born in 1872, so by 1935, he'd be about 63. So Pandeli was older when he served.\n\nSo the claim says Mehdi is the second oldest after Pandeli, implying that there's someone else older than him. But looking at the table, both are listed as prime ministers, and Mehdi's lifespan is longer but he was born later. Therefore, if the \"oldest\" refers to who lived longest, Mehdi would be older than Pandeli, making the claim incorrect because it states he's the second oldest after Pandeli, which would mean there's someone older than him.\n\nWait, no, that's conflicting. Let me clarify: the claim is about their age, not lifespan. So if we consider their age when they served or their birth order.\n\nIf considering their lifespan, Pandeli died in 1939 at 80 years old, and Mehdi lived until 1963. But the claim is about being the second oldest prime minister after Pandeli, implying that among all the prime ministers listed, Mehdi is the second oldest. So perhaps there's a third person older than both.\n\nLooking back, the 'name' column includes general terms like \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" and specific individuals. If we consider the term 'oldest', maybe it refers to who served first or longest.\n\nAlternatively, if considering their age at death: Pandeli was born in 1859, Mehdi in 1872, so Pandeli is older by about 7 years. Therefore, Mehdi is younger and would not be the second oldest after Pandeli.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"second oldest\", implying there's someone older than Mehdi but after Pandeli. If that someone exists in the table, then it could make the claim true. But looking at the table, besides the two named individuals, the other rows are either general terms or other prime ministers (like Kostaq Kota) who served during the same period.\n\nSo perhaps Kostaq Kota is older than both? Let me check his 'born - died' column: 1889 - 1949. So he was born in 1889, making him younger than Pandeli (1859) but older than Mehdi (1872). Wait no, 1889 is later than 1859 and 1872. So Kostaq is actually younger than both Pandeli and Mehdi.\n\nWait, no: 1859 is earlier, so someone born in 1859 is older than someone born in 1872 or 1889. Therefore, the order from oldest to youngest would be Pandeli (1859), Mehdi (1872), Kostaq (1889). So if the claim is that Mehdi is second oldest after Pandeli, it's correct because he is younger than Pandeli but older than others.\n\nWait, no: the claim says \"mehdi... live to be the second oldest after pandeli\", meaning among all prime ministers in the table. If Kostaq is also a prime minister and born later (1889), then Mehdi is older than him but younger than Pandeli. So perhaps the order is Pandeli, Mehdi, Kostaq. Therefore, Mehdi would be second oldest after Pandeli.\n\nSo in that case, the claim would be correct. Because Pandeli is the oldest, Mehdi is next, and Kostaq is the youngest. But I'm not entirely sure because the table includes \"prime ministers 1928-1939\" which might refer to multiple individuals or terms, but it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, if considering their lifespan, since Mehdi lived longer than Pandeli, he could be considered older in that sense. So perhaps the claim is correct, depending on interpretation.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this:\n\n- Pandeli Evangeli: Born 1859, died 1939. Age when he served: around 71.\n- Mehdi Frash: Born 1872, died 1963. Age when he served: around 63 in 1935.\n- Kostaq Kota: Born 1889, died 1949. Served earlier than Mehdi, so age when he became PM might have been around 36 in the early 1920s.\n\nSo if we rank them by birth year:\n\n1. Pandeli (1859)\n2. Mehdi (1872)\n3. Kostaq (1889)\n\nTherefore, in terms of who was born first, Mehdi is second oldest after Pandeli. So the claim that Mehdi is the second oldest after Pandeli would be accurate because he was born later than Pandeli but earlier than Kostaq.\n\nAlternatively, if considering their lifespan, Mehdi lived longer, so he might be considered older in that sense. But typically, age refers to birth order rather than lifespan unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, considering birth years, the claim is correct: Mehdi is the second oldest after Pandeli.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Mehdi Frash was the \"second oldest\" after Pandeli Evangeli is accurate based on their birth years. Pandeli, born in 1859, holds the distinction of being the oldest, followed by Mehdi, who was born in 1872. Kostaq Kota, born in 1889, is the youngest among them.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct. Mehdi Frash was the second oldest after Pandeli Evangeli based on their birth years.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"albania have be see prime minister come from a political party\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that Albania's prime ministers are coming from political parties.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different prime minister with details like name, birth and death years, term start and end dates, and their political party affiliation. The relevant columns here are \"name\" (which might not be necessary) and \"political party.\"\n\nI should go through each row to check if any of the prime ministers listed are from a political party. From the table:\n\n1. The first data row seems to list 'prime ministers 1928 - 1939' which is probably the title, but it's under 'name.' This might be more about the term than an individual.\n2. The second row is for \"kostaq kota (1st time).\" His political party is listed as \"non - party.\" So he doesn't belong to any party.\n3. The third row is \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time),\" also marked as \"non - party.\"\n4. The fourth row is \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time),\" again \"non - party.\"\n5. The fifth row is \"kostaq kota (2nd time),\" still \"non - party.\"\n\nNone of these prime ministers are from a political party; they're all marked as non-party. Therefore, the claim that Albania's prime ministers come from political parties isn't supported by this table.\n\nSo, I need to check which cells are relevant. The 'political party' column is definitely relevant because it shows whether each minister comes from a party or not. Each row has this information in the fifth cell of their respective rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"kostaq kota's term start on 9 november 1936, after pandeli evangjeli's term end.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. There are several rows, each representing different people with their terms. Each row has a name, born-died years, term start and end dates, and political party.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two individuals: kostaq kota and pandeli evangjeli. Let me locate them in the table.\n\nLooking at the second row, I see that it's about \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", born from 1889 to 1949. His term started on September 5, 1928, and ended on March 5, 1930. Then there's another entry for \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" in the third row, with his term starting on March 6, 1930, and ending on October 16, 1935.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to match up because kostaq kota started earlier than pandeli. But the claim says that kostaq's term start was after pandeli's term end. So I need to check their terms' dates.\n\nLooking again, pandeli evangjeli (2nd time) ended on October 16, 1935. Then in the fourth row, there's \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\" who started on October 22, 1935, and ended on November 9, 1936. So between pandeli's term end and mehdi's start is a period.\n\nBut kostaq kota's second term started on November 9, 1936, right after mehdi's term ended. However, the claim specifically mentions pandeli, not mehdi. \n\nWait, the claim says \"pandeli evangjeli's term end.\" Pandeli's term ended in 1935. So kostaq's second term started on November 9, 1936, which is after pandeli's term ended in 1935. Therefore, yes, kostaq's start was after pandeli's end.\n\nBut wait, the table shows that after pandeli, it's mehdi who starts and ends before kostaq. So the claim might be correct because kostaq started after pandeli's end. But let me check if there are any terms in between that might affect this.\n\nWait, no, the claim is only comparing pandeli and kostaq. Pandeli ended on October 16, 1935, and kostaq started on November 9, 1936. So yes, 1936 comes after 1935. Therefore, the statement seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that there are no overlapping or conflicting terms. Let me check the exact dates again.\n\nPandeli evangjeli (2nd time) ended on October 16, 1935. The next term started by mehdi bej frash\u00ebri on October 22, 1935, and he ended on November 9, 1936. Then kostaq kota (2nd time) started on November 9, 1936.\n\nSo the claim is about kostaq's start being after pandeli's end. Since 1936 is after 1935, that's correct. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that kostaq kota's term started on November 9, 1936, which occurs after pandeli evangjeli's term ended in 1935. Checking the table confirms this sequence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term end\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the only 1st time minister of albania be pandeli evangjeli\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only person who served as Albania's Prime Minister for the first time. So, I should look into the 'name' and possibly other columns related to their first term in office.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different prime minister or period. The second row is about \"kostaq kota (1st time)\", the third is \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\", etc. This notation suggests that sometimes individuals are listed with their position in parentheses, indicating if it's their first, second, etc., term.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the \"1st time minister,\" so I should focus on any entries where the person has a first time as Prime Minister. The table's 'name' column lists each individual, and the 'born - died' and other columns provide more details about their terms.\n\nIn the second row, the name is \"kostaq kota (1st time),\" which indicates that Kostaq Kota served once before. Then, in the fourth row, it's \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time),\" meaning Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri also had a first term.\n\nThe third row is about Pandeli Evangjeli, but it notes \"(2nd time),\" which means he served as Prime Minister before this. The fifth row mentions Kostaq Kota again, this time as the \"2nd time.\"\n\nSo, looking for the first instance where someone held office, we see both Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri listed with (1st time). This indicates that there were at least two individuals who served as Prime Minister of Albania for their first term. Pandeli Evangjeli is noted as having a second term, so he wasn't the only one to have a first term.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only 1st time minister isn't accurate because Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri are also listed as having their first terms.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I'll check the table for entries where someone served as Prime Minister of Albania for the first time. \n\n- **Row 2**: Kostaq Kota (1st time)\n- **Row 4**: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time)\n\nThese entries indicate that there were others who served their first term, contradicting the claim that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only one.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
