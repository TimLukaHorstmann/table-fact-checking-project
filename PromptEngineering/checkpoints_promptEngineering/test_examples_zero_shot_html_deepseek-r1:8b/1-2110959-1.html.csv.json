    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 1948 - 49 season have a win % of 0.552\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure to identify the relevant columns and rows. The table has several headers: season, games, won, lost, tied, points, pct %, goals for, goals against, standing. The claim specifically mentions a win percentage, so I should focus on the \"won\" and \"pct %\" columns.\n\nThe claim refers to the 1948 - 49 season. Looking at the table rows, I need to find which row corresponds to this season. Scanning through each <td> in the season column: \n\n- The first row is 1947 - 48\n- Next is 1948 - 49 (row index 1)\n- Then continues up to 1960 - 61.\n\nSo, the relevant row is the second one (row_index: 1).\n\nWithin this row, I need to check two columns: \"won\" and \"pct %\". The value for \"won\" in row 1 is 25. To calculate the win percentage, it's (Won / Games) * 100. \n\nLooking at the table cell, the pct % for 1948 - 49 is given as 0.552. Calculating manually: 25 wins out of 48 games is indeed 25/48 \u2248 0.5208 or 52.08%, which doesn't exactly match 0.552. However, in the table, it's directly stated as 0.552, so I should rely on that value.\n\nTherefore, the claim matches the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pct%\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the team finish 1st oha in the season they have a win % of 0.769.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. \"Finish 1st oha\" refers to the team being first in the league standings for that season. The \"win %\" refers to their winning percentage for that season.\n\nSo, I need to look for a season where the win% is exactly 0.769 and check if they finished first in the standings for that season.\n\nLooking through the table, each row represents a different season from 1947-48 to 1960-61. I'll go through each row and see which ones have a win percentage of 0.769.\n\nChecking each row:\n- 1947-48: 0.528\n- 1948-49: 0.552\n- 1949-50: 0.604\n- 1950-51: 0.491\n- 1951-52: 0.565\n- 1952-53: 0.598\n- 1953-54: 0.729 \u2192 This is the only season with a win% of 0.769.\n- 1954-55: 0.673\n- 1955-56: 0.615\n- 1956-57: 0.500\n- 1957-58: 0.673\n- 1958-59: 0.769 \u2192 Wait, this also has 0.769.\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table, the \"win %\" column for each season:\n- 1947-48: 0.528\n- 1948-49: 0.552\n- 1949-50: 0.604\n- 1950-51: 0.491\n- 1951-52: 0.565\n- 1952-53: 0.598\n- 1953-54: 0.729\n- 1954-55: 0.673\n- 1955-56: 0.615\n- 1956-57: 0.500\n- 1957-58: 0.673\n- 1958-59: 0.769\n- 1959-60: 0.562\n- 1960-61: 0.438\n\nSo, two seasons have a win% of 0.769: 1953-54 and 1958-59.\n\nNow, for each of these seasons, I need to check their standings. The \"finish\" is determined by the \"position\" in the league, which is indicated by the last part of the row, e.g., \"1st oha\".\n\nLooking at the table's \"position\" column:\n\n1953-54: 1st oha\n1958-59: 1st oha\n\nSo both these seasons have a win% of 0.769 and finished first in the standings.\n\nBut the claim says \"the team finish 1st oha in the season they have a win % of 0.769.\" The use of \"they\" might imply any season where this condition is met, but in reality, there are two such seasons. However, the claim doesn't specify which season, so as long as at least one season satisfies both conditions, the claim could be true.\n\nWait, but actually, the claim seems to link the finish position with a specific win%. It's asserting that whenever the team has a 0.769 win%, they finish first. But in this case, there are multiple seasons where both conditions are met. So the claim isn't false because it's not stating that only one season does so but rather that whenever the condition applies, the result follows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is intended to say that if a season has 0.769 win%, then they finished first. Since in all such cases (1953-54 and 1958-59) the team did finish first, the statement holds true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being the rows for 1953-54 and 1958-59, checking the \"position\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each season where the win% is exactly 0.769 and confirm that the team finished first in those seasons.\n\n1. **Season 1953-54**: Win% = 0.729 (Wait, correction: It's 0.729? Wait no, looking back, 1953-54 has a win% of 0.729. No, wait, I think I made an error earlier. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table again, each row's \"win %\" and their positions:\n\n- 1947-48: Win% 0.528, Position 2nd\n- 1948-49: 0.552, 3rd\n- 1949-50: 0.604, 1st\n- 1950-51: 0.491, 5th\n- 1951-52: 0.565, 2nd\n- 1952-53: 0.598, 3rd\n- 1953-54: 0.729, 1st\n- 1954-55: 0.673, 1st\n- 1955-56: 0.615, 3rd\n- 1956-57: 0.500, 3rd\n- 1957-58: 0.673, 1st\n- 1958-59: 0.769, 1st\n- 1959-60: 0.562, 2nd\n- 1960-61: 0.438, 5th\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The season 1953-54 has a win% of 0.729, not 0.769. Then, the only season with 0.769 is 1958-59.\n\nTherefore, for 1958-59:\n\n- Win% = 0.769\n- Position = 1st oha\n\nThus, the claim is true because in the season they had a win% of 0.769, they finished first.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought two seasons, but actually only one: 1958-59 has both 0.769 and 1st place.\n\nTherefore, the correct relevant cells are for 1958-59, checking \"position\" (1st) and \"win %\" (0.769).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"Identify if the statement is true or false.\",\n  \"statement\": \"You are tasked with verifying whether the following statement is true: 'In every season where the team has a win percentage of 0.769, they finish first in the league.'\",\n  \"steps\": [\n    {\n      \"step_num\": 1,\n      \"task\": \"Identify all seasons with a win% of 0.769.\",\n      \"findings\": \"After reviewing the data, only one season (1958-59) has a win percentage of exactly 0.769.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_num\": 2,\n      \"task\": \"Check the position for that season.\",\n      \"findings\": \"In 1958-59, the team finished first in the league.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"conclusion\": \"The statement is true because every season where the team had a win percentage of 0.769 (which is only one season: 1958-59), they indeed finished first.\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": \"1958-59\",\n      \"position\": \"1st oha\",\n      \"win_percent\": \"0.769\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify where each season's data is located. The table has a header row followed by multiple data rows. Each data row represents a specific season and includes various statistics like games won, lost, tied, points, etc.\n\nThe claim in question is about the 1958-59 season having a point total of 84. So my first task is to find the corresponding row in the table for that season. Scanning through the 'season' column, I see entries from 1947-48 up to 1960-61. The 1958-59 season is one of them.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'points' column for that specific season. Points are denoted by the cell labeled 'points'. In the row corresponding to 1958-59, I look at each data cell. The 'season' cell confirms it's about 1958-59. Then, moving through each column: games, won, lost, tied, points... yes, there it is: the points for that season are listed as 84.\n\nNow, to verify the claim, I need to see if any relevant cells support it. The 'points' cell is directly related because it's the figure being claimed. So this cell is definitely relevant. There might be other columns like 'goals for' or 'against', but those aren't part of the point total calculation in this context.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include only the 'points' column from that row.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the 1958-59 season's points being 84, I'll locate the relevant data in the table.\n\nThe 1958-59 season is found in the last data row before the 1960-61 entry. Within this row, the 'points' column clearly shows 84 as the point total for that season.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Identify the season in question by scanning the 'season' column.\n2. Find the corresponding row for 1958-59.\n3. Look at the 'points' column within this row to confirm the total points.\n\nThe data confirms that the point total is indeed 84, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a specific season in an HTML table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"for the 1950 - 51 season , there be 54 game play , with 30 won and 24 lost and 0 tie , for a standing of 1st oha\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"1950 - 51 season.\" Looking at the HTML table provided, I should search for the row corresponding to this season. Scanning through the table's <tbody> section:\n\n1. 1947-48\n2. 1948-49\n3. 1949-50\n4. 1950-51\n5. 1951-52\n6. 1952-53\n7. 1953-54\n8. 1954-55\n9. 1955-56\n10. 1956-57\n11. 1957-58\n12. 1958-59\n13. 1959-60\n14. 1960-61\n\nSo, the fourth row (index 3) is for the 1950-51 season.\n\nNext, the claim states there are \"54 game play.\" Looking at the 'games' column in that row, the value is indeed 54. That matches, so this part of the claim is accurate.\n\nThe claim then specifies: \"with 30 won and 24 lost and 0 tie.\" So, I need to check the 'won', 'lost', and 'tie' columns for the 1950-51 season.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- 'won': 30\n- 'lost': 24\n- 'tie': 0\n\nAll these numbers align perfectly with the claim. So, the win-loss-tie record as stated is correct.\n\nFinally, the claim mentions \"for a standing of 1st oha.\" The 'standing' column shows \"5th oha\" for that season. This is conflicting because the claim says 1st place, but according to the table, they finished 5th.\n\nSo, there's an inconsistency here. The claimed standing doesn't match what's in the table. This discrepancy means that while most of the specifics about games played and results are accurate, the standing part is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim isn't fully supported because the standings don't align with the provided data. Hence, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant:\n\n- The row index for 1950-51 is 3.\n- The columns to check are 'games', 'won', 'lost', and 'tie' for accuracy, as well as 'standing' to confirm the discrepancy.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the ones corresponding to each of these columns in that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tie\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"standing\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given HTML table and then identify the relevant cells that support my answer.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the season with the lowest pct % be 1958 - 59 with 769\". Wait, that seems a bit confusing. The season is 1958-59, and the percentage is 0.769? Or maybe there's a typo because I see in the table that for 1958-59, the pct% is 0.769.\n\nNow, the claim says \"the lowest pct % be 1958 - 59 with 769\". Hmm, does it mean that 1958-59 has the lowest percentage and maybe the points? Let me check the column names in the table. The columns are season, games, won, lost, tied, points, pct %, goals for, goals against, standing.\n\nSo, to verify this claim, I need to look at each season's pct% and find which one is the lowest. Then, check if that season is 1958-59 with the given pct%.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- 1947-48: 0.528\n- 1948-49: 0.552\n- 1949-50: 0.604\n- 1950-51: 0.491\n- 1951-52: 0.565\n- 1952-53: 0.598\n- 1953-54: 0.729\n- 1954-55: 0.673\n- 1955-56: 0.769\n- 1956-57: 0.500\n- 1957-58: 0.673\n- 1958-59: 0.769\n- 1959-60: 0.562\n- 1960-61: 0.438\n\nWait, so the lowest pct% is actually 0.438 in 1960-61. But the claim says it's 1958-59 with 0.769, which isn't even the lowest. So that makes me think the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. The lowest pct% would be the smallest value. Looking at all percentages:\n\nThe lowest is indeed 0.438 in 1960-61. Next is 0.438, then 0.562, then 0.673 (appearing a couple of times), 0.769, etc.\n\nSo 1958-59 has 0.769, which isn't the lowest. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not the season with the lowest pct%.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user meant something else. Maybe they're confusing points and percentages? Let me check the 'points' column for each season.\n\nPoints:\n\n1947-48: 52\n1948-49: 56\n1949-50: 60\n1950-51: 47\n1951-52: 63\n1952-53: 59\n1953-54: 74\n1954-55: 67\n1955-56: 84\n1956-57: 52\n1957-58:70\n1958-59:84\n1959-60:54\n1960-61:42\n\nSo the points in 1960-61 are the lowest at 42. But that's separate from the pct%.\n\nThe claim is specifically about pct%, so I think it's about the percentage, not the points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because 1958-59 doesn't have the lowest pct%. Instead, 1960-61 has the lowest pct% of 0.438.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells would be those that show the lowest pct% is 1960-61 with 0.438, and perhaps identify which season is actually the highest or something else? Wait, no, just need to verify if the claim is correct. So for the claim, I need to check where it claims: does 1958-59 have the lowest pct% of 0.769.\n\nIn the table, 1958-59's pct is 0.769, but that's not the lowest. The lowest is elsewhere. So in terms of relevant cells, perhaps the cell for 1960-61 with 0.438 to show it's lower than 1958-59's 0.769.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"the season with the lowest pct % be 1958 - 59 with 769\". That would require that 1958-59 has the lowest pct%, which is not true. So I need to identify which cell(s) are relevant for this check.\n\nThe relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The 'pct%' column for each season, because we're checking if any season lower than others exists before or after 1958-59.\n2. For the season in question (1958-59), the pct% is 0.769. But since there's a lower value elsewhere, that's why it's not the lowest.\n\nBut wait, perhaps more specifically, to verify the claim, I need to check if any other season has a lower pct%. So for each row, check if their pct% is less than 1958-59's.\n\nAlternatively, find the row with the minimum pct%, and see if that's 1958-59. If not, then the claim is false.\n\nSo in terms of relevant cells:\n\n- The 'pct%' column for each season.\n- For 1958-59: row index, column name.\n- For the season with the lowest pct%: its row index and column name.\n\nBut since the claim states it's 1958-59, I can check against that.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The cell for 1958-59 in the 'pct%' column to confirm it's 0.769.\n2. Other cells in the 'pct%' column to find a lower value than 0.769, which is 1960-61 with 0.438.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the season with the lowest pct% be 1958 - 59 with 769\". So I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- For 1958-59: row index (probably 13) and 'pct%' column.\n- For any other season that has a lower pct% than 0.769, like 1960-61 at 0.438.\n\nSo to verify the claim, you need to check if there's another season with a lower value, which there is, making the claim incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The 'pct%' cell for 1958-59 (to see it's not the lowest).\n- The 'pct%' cell for 1960-61 (which is lower).\n\nSo in terms of indices, assuming rows start at 0:\n\n1958-59 would be row 13.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the absolute cells, regardless of index.\n\nSo to sum up, the claim is false because another season has a lower pct%. So the answer is: FALSE. And the relevant cells are 1960-61's pct% being lower than 1958-59's.\n\nBut since the question asks for the task, perhaps I need to write that the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect. The lowest percentage is actually found in the season 1960-61 with a value of 0.438, not in 1958-59. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{False}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the point in the 1958 - 59 season be more than 85.0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to the 1958-59 season. Scanning through the rows, I see that the fifth row (index 5) has \"1958 - 59\" as the season. Wait, no, actually, starting from zero, the first row is 1947-48, so the sixth row would be 1958-59. Let me count: 0:1947-48, 1:1948-49,... up to 5:1957-58 and 6:1958-59? Wait, looking again, no, each season is listed one by one. So 1947-48 is row 0, 1948-49 row 1, ..., 1958-59 would be row 11? Wait no, let me check.\n\nWait the table has 14 rows, from 1947-48 to 1960-61. Each season is listed one per row. So 1947-48 is row 0, 1948-49 row1,... up to 1958-59 would be row11 (since 1947+11=1958). Wait no: 1947-48 is first, so 1958-59 is the 12th season. So row index 11? Let me count:\n\nRow 0:1947-48\n\nRow1:1948-49\n\nRow2:1949-50\n\nRow3:1950-51?\n\nWait no, looking at the table, each row increments by one year after the previous. Wait the first season is 1947-48 (row0), next is 1948-49 (row1), so each row corresponds to the next season. So the 1958-59 season would be in row11 because:\n\nFrom 1947-48 as row0, adding 11 years gets us to 1958-59.\n\nSo the relevant row is row11.\n\nNow, looking at that row (row11), what's the points column? The columns are: point, maybe, but looking at the table headers, I don't see a \"point\" column. Wait, in the given table, the columns are not all specified, but from the data, it seems like each row has the season, followed by points.\n\nWait no, the table shows for each season, the points might be under the 'Points' column. Looking at the first few rows: for example, 1947-48, points are 42? Wait, in the last row of the given table (1960-61), it's 42 points. So perhaps the 'points' are in a specific column.\n\nLooking back, each row seems to have the season, then some other data, and then at the end, points. For example:\n\nIn row0:1947-48: ..., points are 42.\n\nSo, the columns after the season are probably 'point', but perhaps 'Pts' or something else. Wait, in the given table, I can't see headers, so maybe each cell after the season is a different stat. But the claim refers to \"points\" specifically for the 1958-59 season.\n\nLooking at row11 (1958-59), the points are listed as 84. So the claim is whether this is more than 85.0.\n\nSo 84 is less than 85.0, so the claim would be FALSE.\n\nNow, to find which cells are relevant: the points column for that season.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row after the season has various stats, and I think 'Pts' or similar would be the points column. So in the 1958-59 row (row11), the points are in a specific cell.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include the row index 11 and the column name \"Points\" or whatever it's labeled as. Since the exact headers aren't provided, but from context, it's likely 'Pts' or 'Points'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are row11 and the Points column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
