    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I think it means that in 1986, the value for 'us dance' is 6 and the value for 'us r&b' is 9.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents a different year. The columns are: year, title, us, us r&amp;b, and us dance. So I need to look at the rows from 1984 onwards and check if in any of them, for 1986, 'us dance' is 6 when 'us r&b' is 9.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nFirst row: year 1984, title \"pretty mess\". The us column has 75, us r&b is 15. So that's not 1986, and the numbers don't match.\n\nSecond row: 1985, \"mechanical emotion\". US is 107, us r&b is 23. Again, not 1986.\n\nThird row: 1986, \"under the influence\". Here, 'us' is 56, 'us r&b' is 9, and 'us dance' is 6. So in this row, for 1986, us dance is 6 when us r&b is 9. That seems to match the claim.\n\nWait, but there's another 1986 entry. The fourth row: same year 1986, title \"animals\". US is '-', which probably means no data or not applicable. So this doesn't count because 'us' and 'us r&b' are '-' instead of numbers.\n\nFifth row: 1988, \"undress\". US is '-', again no relevant data for that year.\n\nSo the only relevant row is the third one in 1986 where us dance is 6 and us r&b is 9. That supports the claim.\n\nI think I should also check if there's any other row for 1986, but the table shows two entries for 1986: one with numbers and another without. The second one doesn't have the required values, so only the first 1986 entry matters here.\n\nTherefore, since in 1986 there is a row where us dance is 6 when us r&b is 9, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&amp;b\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and then find which cells in the table support that claim. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\". Hmm, I think the user is referring to a specific data point in the table related to the US sales (\"us\") for the song \"Under the Influence\" in both 1985 and 1986. \n\nLooking at the table structure: The columns are year, title, us, us r&b, and us dance. Each row represents a different year and provides data for each of these categories.\n\nSo, I need to find rows where the title is \"Under the Influence\" and check if there's a value in the 'us' column for both 1985 and 1986.\n\nLet me scan through the table:\n\n1. **1984**: Title is \"pretty mess\". Doesn't match.\n2. **1985**: Title is \"mechanical emotion\". Not \"Under the Influence\".\n3. **1986**: The first row here has title \"under the influence\" (note that it's all lowercase in the table, but it should still match regardless of case). The 'us' column for this row shows 56.\n4. **1986**: Next row is \"animals\", which doesn't match.\n5. **1988**: Title is \"undress\". Not relevant.\n\nWait, so there are two entries for 1986? Or is that a typo? Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n- The first entry in 1986: \"under the influence\" with 'us' as 56.\n- Second row under 1986: \"animals\", which might be an error because there are two entries for 1986, but only one is relevant.\n\nNow, checking the claim: It mentions both 1985 and 1986. From the table, in 1985, is there a \"under the influence\" song? No, the 1985 row has \"mechanical emotion\". So the claim might be incorrect because there's no 'Under the Influence' entry for 1985.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread it. Let me double-check each year:\n\n- **1984**: Not relevant.\n- **1985**: No \"under the influence\" here.\n- **1986**: Yes, one entry with us=56.\n- The second row in 1986 is about \"animals\", which doesn't match, so maybe that's a different song.\n\nSo, does the claim mention both years 1985 and 1986? It says \"at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\". That suggests that for each year, there was an 'under the influence' charting at 56 US. But from the table, only 1986 has this data point.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's referring to two different entries: one in 1985 and another in 1986, both with us=56. But looking at the table:\n\n- In 1985, no \"under the influence\" song.\n- In 1986, yes, us=56.\n\nSo if the claim says it was present in both 1985 and 1986, that's incorrect because 1985 doesn't have that entry. However, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row for 'us' column where title is \"under the influence\":\n\n- 1984: No.\n- 1985: No.\n- 1986: Yes, 56.\nSo only one instance in 1986.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it was present in both 1985 and 1986 is FALSE because there's no data for 1985. However, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"chart at 56 in the us\". Maybe it refers to a specific position like number 56 on the chart. But according to the table, only 1986 has that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about both entries (including the one with 'animals'?), but that doesn't make sense because they have different titles and years.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in 1985, there's no \"under the influence\" song, so the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut let me think again: The user said \"chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\". So for both years, there was a chart entry of 56 in US sales. From the table:\n\n- 1985: No.\n- 1986: Yes (us=56).\n\nThus, it's only true for 1986, not 1985. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: The user needs to point out which cells are checked. So I need to find in the table the rows where \"under the influence\" appears and their 'us' column values.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 1986, the first row has title \"under the influence\", us=56.\nSo, that's row index 2 (since it's zero-based: first row is 0, second is 1, etc.? Wait no. Let me count the rows starting from 0.\n\nWait, the tbody has:\n\nRow 0: 1984\nRow 1: 1985\nRow 2: 1986 (\"under the influence\")\nRow 3: 1986 (\"animals\")\nRow 4: 1988\n\nSo row indices are 0 to 4. The \"under the influence\" is at row index 2, column 'us' which is column 2 (since columns are year(0), title(1), us(2), etc.).\n\nThus, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row index: 2\n- Column name: 'us'\n\nSo in the JSON, it should list this cell.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions both 1985 and 1986. However, in 1985, there's no such row. So the only relevant cell is for 1986, us=56.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because the claim implies data exists for both 1985 and 1986, which isn't true\u2014only 1986 has it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\" Checking the table, there's no entry for \"under the influence\" in 1985. Only one entry exists for 1986 with a US value of 56. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Title \"Under the Influence\":**\n   - Found only in 1986 (row index 2).\n\n2. **Check for Data in 'us' Column:**\n   - For row 2, 'us' column has value 56.\n\n3. **Verify Year Mentioned in Claim:**\n   - 1985 does not have an entry for \"under the influence.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim incorrectly states data exists for both 1985 and 1986; only 1986 is accurate.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- **Row Index:** 2\n- **Column Name:** 'us'\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"us\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
