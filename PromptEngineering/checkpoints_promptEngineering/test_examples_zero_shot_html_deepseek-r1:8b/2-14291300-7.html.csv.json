    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the Toronto Maple Leaf be the only opponent with 63 points\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the Toronto Maple Leafs are the sole opponents who have scored 63 points in a game listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several rows, each representing a different game. Each row has the game number, march (which I think refers to the month, but maybe it's a placeholder for something else), opponent, score, record, and points. The points column seems to show the total points scored by one team in that particular game.\n\nI need to check if any other opponents besides the Toronto Maple Leafs have 63 points in their respective games. So I'll go through each row, look at the opponent name, and see what their points were for that game.\n\nStarting with game 63: Opponent is Detroit Red Wings, points are 59.\nGame 64: California Golden Seals, 60 points.\nGame 65: Minnesota North Stars, 60 points.\nGame 66: Pittsburgh Penguins, 61 points.\nGame 67: New York Rangers, 61 points.\nGame 68: Toronto Maple Leafs, 63 points. Wait, but this is the opponent we're focusing on. So in game 68, their score is 63, which matches our claim.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if they are the only ones with 63. Next, game 69: New York Rangers scored 65.\nGame 70: Boston Bruins, 65 points.\nGame 71: Toronto Maple Leafs again, but their points were 66.\nGame 72: Montreal Canadiens, 66 points.\nGame 73: Minnesota North Stars, 67 points.\nGame 74: Chicago Black Hawks, 67 points.\nGame 75: Pittsburgh Penguins, 69 points.\n\nFrom this, I notice that only the Toronto Maple Leafs have exactly 63 points in any of their games listed here. Wait, no, actually looking again: in game 68, the opponent is the Toronto Maple Leafs and they scored 63. Are there any other opponents with 63? Let me double-check each row.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I don't see any other opponents besides the Toronto Maple Leafs scoring exactly 63 points. For example, game 71: Toronto Maple Leafs scored 66. Game 73: same team scored 67. So it seems that only in game 68 did they score 63, and no other opponent has that number.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the Toronto Maple Leaf be the only opponent with 63 point.\" Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the table columns. The 'score' column is \"2 - 2\" or similar, which probably refers to the game's score, not the points. But then there's a separate 'points' column, which shows numbers like 59, 60, etc.\n\nWait, in each row, I have to check the 'opponent' and their corresponding 'points'. So for example:\n\n- Game 63: Opponent Detroit Red Wings, points 59.\n- Game 64: California Golden Seals, 60.\n- Game 65: Minnesota North Stars, 60.\n- Game 66: Pittsburgh Penguins, 61.\n- Game 67: NY Rangers, 61.\n- Game 68: Toronto Maple Leafs, 63. That's one occurrence.\n- Game 69: NY Rangers, 65.\n- Game 70: Boston Bruins, 65.\n- Game 71: Toronto Maple Leafs, 66.\n- Game 72: Montreal Canadiens, 66.\n- Game 73: Minnesota North Stars, 67.\n- Game 74: Chicago Black Hawks, 67.\n- Game 75: Pittsburgh Penguins, 69.\n\nSo in the entire table, only the Toronto Maple Leafs have a game where they scored exactly 63 points. No other opponent has that number. Therefore, the claim is true because they are indeed the only ones with 63 points in their respective games listed here.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake. The 'points' column shows the total points for each game, so if another team had 63 points in any of their games, that would make the claim false. But from the table, it seems only Toronto Maple Leafs scored 63 in game 68.\n\nI don't see any other opponent with 63 points. So yes, they are the sole ones with that number.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are those where the opponent is \"Toronto Maple Leaf\" and their points equal 63. From the table, only one such cell exists in row 68.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. The claim is: \"during march 13 , the toronto maple leaf be the opponent with 63 point\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions March 13th and specifies that Toronto Maple Leaf was the opponent with 63 points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game, with the 'march' column indicating the date. The 'opponent' column lists who they played against, and the 'points' column shows the total points scored by their team in that game.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where March 13th occurred. Since the 'march' values are numbers without the day specified, I need to infer which number corresponds to March 13th. Typically, games are numbered sequentially within a month, so March would start after February. Let's see the sequence of 'march' numbers:\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: march=4\n- Row 1: march=6\n- ...\n- Continuing up to row 12 (index 13?), wait no. Wait, the rows are numbered starting from 63 as game number, so each row corresponds to a specific game.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The 'march' column has values like 4,6,7,... etc., which might be day numbers in March. So March 1st would be 1, March 2nd is 2, up to March 13th being 13.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nI'll check each row's 'march' value until I find one that is 13. Scanning down:\n\nRow 0: march=4\nRow 1: 6\nRow 2:7\n...\nWait, but let me count properly. The first few rows are:\n\n63: march=4\n64:6\n65:7\n66:10\n67:12\n68:13\n\nAh, so row index 68 (since it starts at 0) has 'march' as 13? Wait no, the table shows row numbers from 63 to 74, but each row corresponds to game number starting at 63. So the first row is game 63, second is 64, etc., up to game 74.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently: Each 'march' value might correspond to the date in March. So looking for a row where 'march' is 13, which would be March 13th.\n\nLooking through the 'march' column:\n\nI see row with march=13 is game number 68 (since game numbers go from 63 up). Let me confirm: Game 68's 'march' is 13. So that's the row we need.\n\nIn row 68, the opponent is Toronto Maple Leaf, and points are 63.\n\nSo according to the table, on March 13th, Toronto Maple Leaf was the opponent, and their team scored 63 points in that game.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that on March 13, the opponent (Toronto) had 63 points. The table supports this because row 68 has march=13, opponent=Toronto Maple Leaf, and points=63.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the chicago black hawk be the only opponent with 63 point\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"chicago black hawk\" as the opponent. So I'll look for rows where the 'opponent' column has this team. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 74: Opponent is chicago black hawks.\n- No other rows have chicago black hawks in the opponent column.\n\nNext, the claim says they are \"the only opponent with 63 points.\" So I need to check if any other opponents have a 'points' value of 63. The 'points' column shows:\n\nLooking at each row's points:\n- Row 63: 59\n- Row 64: 60\n- Row 65: 60\n- Row 66: 61\n- Row 67: 61\n- Row 68: 63 (this is the chicago black hawks)\n- Row 69: 65\n- Row 70: 65\n- Row 71: 66\n- Row 72: 66\n- Row 73: 67\n- Row 74: 67\n- Row 75: 69\n\nSo only row 68 has points equal to 63, and that's for the chicago black hawks. No other opponents have 63 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's only one instance where the opponent (chicago black hawks) has 63 points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about the Toronto Maple Leaf being the opponent with games 63, 66, and 69 is true by checking the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the claim says that \"the toronto maple leaf be the opponent list with 63, 66, and 69 point\". I think there might be a typo here, probably meant \"opponent\" instead of \"point.\" So, it's likely stating that Toronto Maple Leaf is the opponent in games 63, 66, and 69.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns include 'game', 'march' (probably a date or sequence), 'opponent', 'score', 'record', and 'points'. So, I need to check which rows have Toronto Maple Leaf as the opponent and whether their game numbers are 63, 66, and 69.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\n- Game 63: Opponent is Detroit Red Wings. Not Toronto.\n- Game 64: California Golden Seals. No.\n- Game 65: Minnesota North Stars. No.\n- Game 66: Pittsburgh Penguins. Wait, no\u2014opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins here. So that's not Toronto either.\nWait, no, looking again, game 66 has opponent as Pittsburgh Penguins? Or did I misread. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the provided HTML table, the rows are:\n\n- Game 63: Detroit Red Wings\n- Game 64: California Golden Seals\n- Game 65: Minnesota North Stars\n- Game 66: Pittsburgh Penguins\n- Game 67: New York Rangers\n- Game 68: Toronto Maple Leafs (opponent)\n- Game 69: New York Rangers again.\n\nWait, game 68 has the opponent as Toronto Maple Leaf. So that's one. Then, where are games 63, 66, and 69?\n\nGame 63 is Detroit Red Wings\u2014so not relevant for the claim about Toronto being opponents in those games.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n- Game 63: Not Toronto\n- Game 64: No\n- Game 65: No\n- Game 66: Opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins (from the table, game 66's opponent is pittsburgh penguins)\nWait no, let me look at each row correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me list out all opponents:\n\nRow 63: detroit red wings\n\n64: california golden seals\n\n65: minnesota north stars\n\n66: pittsburgh penguins\n\n67: new york rangers\n\n68: toronto maple leafs\n\n69: new york rangers again.\n\n70: boston bruins\n\n71: toronto maple leafs\n\n72: montreal canadiens\n\n73: minnesota north stars\n\n74: chicago black hawks\n\n75: pittsburgh penguins\n\nSo, in the table, the opponents are:\n\n- Game 68: Toronto Maple Leaf\n- Game 71: Toronto Maple Leaf\n\nWait, so only two games where Toronto is the opponent. The claim mentions three games: 63, 66, and 69.\n\nLooking at those game numbers:\n\n- Game 63: Not Toronto.\n- Game 66: Opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins (so not Toronto)\n- Game 69: Opponent is New York Rangers (not Toronto)\n\nSo, only Games 68 and 71 have Toronto as opponents. Therefore, the claim that Toronto Maple Leaf is the opponent in games 63, 66, and 69 is incorrect because only two of those games have Toronto.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the points column for these games:\n\n- Game 68: Points are 63\n- Game 71: Points are 66\n\nSo, even if I consider 'points' as part of the claim, they don't match the given numbers (63, 66, 69). So that doesn't add anything.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Toronto Maple Leaf is only the opponent in two games, not three. Also, the points for those games are different from what's stated.\n\nSo, I need to find which cells support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be the ones where the opponent is Toronto Maple Leaf (games 68 and 71) and perhaps the game numbers columns to check if they match. But since the claim specifically mentions 63,66,69, but in reality it's 68 and 71, those rows are the relevant ones.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the opponent isn't Toronto in all three games mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
