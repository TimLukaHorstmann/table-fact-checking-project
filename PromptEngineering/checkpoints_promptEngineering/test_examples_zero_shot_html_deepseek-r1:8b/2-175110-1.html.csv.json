    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim about Rhodesia's medals is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal , 5 silver medal , and 10 gold medal.\" So, the claim is asserting specific numbers of each medal type that Rhodesia won.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to Rhodesia. Scanning through the 'nation' column, I see the entry for Rhodesia is in row 5 (since it's the fifth <tr> element after the headers). Now, focusing on row 5, let me check each medal count.\n\nFor gold medals: The table shows 10 for Rhodesia. That matches the claim exactly. So that's one check passed.\n\nNext, silver medals: The claim says 5. Looking at the 'silver' column in row 5, it indeed reads 5. That's another point met.\n\nThen, bronze medals: The claim mentions 2. In the 'bronze' column of row 5, I see the number is 2 as well. All three counts align with the claim.\n\nSince all the specified medal numbers for Rhodesia are accurately reflected in the table, there doesn't seem to be any discrepancy. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
