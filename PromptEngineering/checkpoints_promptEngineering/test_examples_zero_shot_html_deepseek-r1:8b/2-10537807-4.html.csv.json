The claim states: \"there be 3 songs that were released in 2000, while only 1 song was released in 1999.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to identify the relevant information. Each row represents a song with its release date and other details.\n\nI'll start by checking for songs released in 1999. Looking at the 'release date' column:\n\n- The first song is \"here it comes\" from August 2, 1999.\n- Next, I check subsequent rows: all others are from 2000 onwards except for some later ones like 2002, 2005, 2009, etc. None of them have a release date in 1999 after the first song.\n\nSo there's only one song (\"here it comes\") released in 1999. That part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNow, checking for songs released in 2000. I'll go through each row:\n\n1. \"the cedar room\" on March 20, 2000.\n2. \"catch the sun\" on May 29, 2000.\n3. \"the man who told everything\" on October 30, 2000.\n\nThat's three songs released in 2000. So that part also checks out.\n\nI should also ensure there are no more than these three and only one from 1999. Scanning the rest of the table confirms that all other release dates are after 2000 or in 2002, 2005, etc., which don't affect the count for 2000 or 1999.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data presented.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there were 3 songs released in 2000 and only 1 in 1999. The table confirms three 2000 releases and one 1999 release, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the most song release in a year be 3 , which happen in 3 different year.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It seems to say that there was a year where three song releases occurred, and this situation happened in three separate years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song release with details like the song title, release date, etc. The 'release info' column includes things like formats available (CDs, vinyl, etc.) but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. The 'album' column might indicate different albums, which could be another way to categorize releases.\n\nI think the key is to count how many times each year had three or more song releases. Then, check if there are exactly three years where this maximum of three releases occurred.\n\nSo I'll start by listing out all the songs with their release dates:\n\n1. here it comes - 2 Aug 1999\n2. the cedar room - 20 Mar 2000\n3. catch the sun - 29 May 2000\n4. the man who told everything - 30 Oct 2000\n5. there goes the fear - 15 Apr 2002\n6. pounding - 22 Jul 2002\n7. caught by the river - 14 Oct 2002\n8. black and white town - 7 Feb 2005\n9. snowden - 9 May 2005\n10. sky starts falling - 12 Sep 2005\n11. kingdom of rust - 30 Mar 2009\n12. winter hill - 20 Jul 2009\n13. andalucia - 5 Apr 2010\n\nNow, I'll group these by year:\n\n- 1999: 1 song\n- 2000: 3 songs (cedar room, catch the sun, man who told everything)\n- 2002: 3 songs (there goes the fear, pounding, caught by river)\n- 2005: 3 songs (black and white town, snowden, sky starts falling)\n- 2009: 2 songs (kingdom of rust, winter hill)\n- 2010: 1 song\n\nSo, in 2000, 2002, and 2005, each had exactly three song releases. That's three different years where the maximum number of releases was three.\n\nNow, the claim says \"the most song release in a year be 3 , which happen in 3 different year.\" So it looks like that's true because there are exactly three years (2000, 2002, 2005) each having three releases.\n\nI should also check if any other year had more than three releases. Looking at the data, none of the years have four or more songs released in a single year. The highest is three in those three years.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were three different years where exactly three song releases occurred each. From the table, we see that 2000, 2002, and 2005 each had three releases. This matches the claim exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"release info\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"release info\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 11 more song release on heavenly than there be on casino.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what exactly the claim is referring to. It's about the number of song releases on Heavenly versus Casino. So, I need to count how many times each appears in the table and see if there's a difference of 11 more on Heavenly than Casino.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song release with details like the song title, release date, etc. The relevant columns for this claim are \"release info\" and \"album.\" Wait, actually, no\u2014wait: the albums might be associated with different releases, but the claim is about song releases on Heavenly versus Casino. So maybe I need to look at which songs were released through the label called Casino.\n\nWait, looking back at the table structure, there's a column called \"release info\" and another called \"album.\" For example, in the first row, under \"release info,\" it says \"cd , 10 vinyl,\" and the album is \"here it comes ep.\" So perhaps Casino refers to an album name or a label?\n\nWait no, actually, I think Casino might be one of the release info types. Looking at the first row: the release info is \"casino (chip003).\" Oh, so Casino is a specific release info category. So each time \"casino\" appears in the \"release info\" column, that's a song release on Casino.\n\nSimilarly, Heavenly seems to be another label or release info category as well. For example, in the second row, it's \"heavenly (hvn95).\" So I need to count how many times \"casino\" appears and how many times \"heavenly\" appears in the \"release info\" column.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, sometimes \"casino\" is present. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: release info is \"casino (chip003)\" \u2014 so that's one Casino release.\nOther rows: I don't see any other entries with \"casino\" in the release info column except for row 0.\n\nNow, how many times does \"heavenly\" appear in the release info? Let's see:\n\nRow 1: \"heavenly (hvn95)\"\nRow 2: \"heavenly (hvn96)\"\nRow 3: \"heavenly (hvn98)\"\nRow 4: \"heavenly (hvn111)\"\nRow 5: \"heavenly (hvn116)\"\nRow 6: \"heavenly (hvn126)\"\nRow 7: \"heavenly (hvn145)\"\nRow 8: \"heavenly (hvn150)\"\nRow 9: \"heavenly (hvn152)\"\nRow 10: \"heavenly (hvn189)\"\nRow 11: \"heavenly (hvn192)\"\nRow 12: \"heavenly (hvn201)\"\n\nThat's 13 times. So Heavenly has 13 releases, Casino has 1.\n\nWait, the claim is about 11 more on Heavenly than Casino. Let me calculate:\n\nHeavenly count = 13\nCasino count = 1\n\nSo 13 -1=12. The claim says 11 more. That's a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding what \"song release\" refers to. Perhaps it's the number of albums or EPs released under each label, not individual songs.\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row is a song title. So each song is a single release. Therefore, Casino has one song, and Heavenly has thirteen songs.\n\nSo 13 -1=12, which is not 11 as stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting or misunderstanding. Let me recount:\n\nCasino: Only row 0 has \"casino\" in release info\u2014so 1.\n\nHeavenly: Rows 1 to 12 (since row 13 is a -/-). So rows 1-12: that's 12 entries? Wait, let me count again.\n\nRows:\n\n1. Row 0: Casino\n2. Row 1: Heavenly\n3. Row 2: Heavenly\n4. Row 3: Heavenly\n5. Row 4: Heavenly\n6. Row 5: Heavenly\n7. Row 6: Heavenly\n8. Row 7: Heavenly\n9. Row 8: Heavenly\n10. Row 9: Heavenly\n11. Row 10: Heavenly\n12. Row 11: Heavenly\n13. Row 12: Heavenly\n\nWait, row indices go from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 data rows), and then the last four rows are the -/- entries.\n\nSo in the actual data rows (excluding the last four which are all \"-\"s), how many times does \"casino\" appear? Only once (row 0). And how many times does \"heavenly\" appear in row 1 to row 12: that's 12 times.\n\nSo Heavenly has 12 song releases, Casino has 1. So 12 -1=11, which matches the claim.\n\nWait, I think earlier I included row 13 as a data row, but actually, the table ends with four \"-\" rows, so perhaps in the actual data rows (excluding the last four), \"heavenly\" appears from row 1 to row 12, that's 12 entries. So 12-1=11.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed 11 more song releases on Heavenly than Casino.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"release info\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release info\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"there be the same number of song releases by dove in the year 1999 and 2000.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking for. It's about counting the number of song releases by Doves in two specific years: 1999 and 2000. So, I need to look into the table and identify all the songs released by Doves during these years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song release. The columns include \"song\", \"release date\", \"release info\", etc. To find relevant information, I should focus on the \"song\" and \"release date\" columns since the claim is about song releases in specific years.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to see which songs were released in 1999 and 2000. \n\n- Scanning through the table:\n  - The first song is \"here it comes,\" released on August 2, 1999.\n  - Next, \"the cedar room\" is from March 20, 2000.\n  - Then there's \"catch the sun\" on May 29, 2000, and \"the man who told everything\" on October 30, 2000. All these are in 2000 except \"here it comes.\"\n  \nWait, but \"here it comes\" is in 1999, so that's one song for 1999.\n\nLooking at the years:\n- For 1999: Only \"here it comes\" is listed.\n- For 2000: There are multiple songs. Let me count them. \n\nFrom the table:\n1. here it comes - 1999\n2. the cedar room - 2000\n3. catch the sun - 2000\n4. the man who told everything - 2000\n5. there goes the fear - 2002 (so not in 2000)\n6. pounding - 2002\n7. caught by the river - 2002\n8. black and white town - 2005\n9. snowden - 2005\n10. sky starts falling - 2005\n11. kingdom of rust - 2009\n12. winter hill - 2009\n13. andalucia - 2010\n14. The last four rows are about releases that didn't chart, but their dates might not be relevant.\n\nWait, I think the \"release info\" column sometimes includes things like vinyl copies or formats, but the release date is in another column. So I should focus on the \"release date\" column to determine the year of each song's release.\n\nSo, for 1999: Only \"here it comes.\"\nFor 2000: Let me list all songs released that year:\n- the cedar room (March 20)\n- catch the sun (May 29)\n- the man who told everything (October 30)\n\nThat's three songs in 2000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each song's release date to ensure they are indeed in 2000. For example, \"the cedar room\" is March 20, 2000\u2014that's correct. \"catch the sun\" on May 29, 2000, and \"the man who told everything\" on October 30, 2000. So that's three songs.\n\nIn 1999, there's only one song: \"here it comes.\"\n\nSo, the count for 1999 is 1, and for 2000, it's 3. Therefore, the number of song releases by Doves in these two years isn't the same. \n\nNow, the claim says that the numbers are the same. Since 1 \u2260 3, the claim is false.\n\nBut I should make sure there aren't any other songs from Doves released in those years not listed here. Looking at the table, after \"here it comes\" and before 2002, the next ones are in 2000 and onwards. There's no indication of another song from Doves in 1999 besides \"here it comes.\" \n\nAlso, the \"release that did not chart\" rows have dates but they're probably from later years or not relevant. So, I can safely assume that only those four songs (including non-charting ones) are listed.\n\nTherefore, the count is indeed 1 in 1999 and 3 in 2000.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there's an equal number of song releases by Doves in 1999 and 2000. However, based on the table analysis, only one song (\"here it comes\") was released in 1999, while three songs were released in 2000.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"dove\" probably refers to the artist or label associated with these songs. Looking at the table, I see entries like \"heavenly (hvn95)\", \"heavenly (hvn96)\", etc., which suggests that \"heavenly\" is a label associated with Dove releases. So, each row represents a release by Dove.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that the number of song releases increases every year. That means I need to check if the number of releases per year is higher than the previous year, and this trend continues consistently across all years in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized by rows where each row represents a release with details like song title, release date, etc. The \"release info\" column includes formats like CD, vinyl, DVD, etc., but I think the key here is to count how many releases occurred each year and compare them.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the years and the corresponding number of releases:\n\n- 1999: Only one song (\"here it comes\")\n- 2000: Three songs (\"the cedar room\", \"catch the sun\", \"the man who told everything\")\n- 2002: Two songs (\"there goes the fear\", \"pounding\")\n- 2005: Three songs (\"black and white town\", \"snowden\", \"sky starts falling\")\n- 2009: Two songs (\"kingdom of rust\", \"winter hill\")\n- 2010: One song (\"andalucia\")\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to show an increasing trend.

Let me get the exact counts per year.\n\nLet's list each row's release date:\n\nRow 0: 2 august 1999\nRow 1: 20 march 2000\nRow 2: 29 may 2000\nRow 3: 30 october 2000\nRow 4: 15 april 2002\nRow 5: 22 july 2002\nRow 6: 14 october 2002\nRow 7: 7 february 2005\nRow 8: 9 may 2005\nRow 9: 12 september 2005\nRow 10: 30 march 2009\nRow 11: 20 july 2009\nRow 12: 5 april 2010\n\nNow, group them by year:\n\n1999: 1 release (row 0)\n2000: rows 1-3 (3 releases)\n2002: rows 4-6 (3 releases) \u2013 Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nWait, row 4 is April 15, 2002\nRow5: July 22, 2002\nRow6: October14, 2002\nSo that's three releases in 2002.\n\nThen 2005: rows7-9 (3 releases)\n2009: rows10-11 (2 releases)\n2010: row12 (1 release)\n\nWait, but looking back, I think the counts per year are as follows:\n\n1999: 1\n2000: 3\n2002: 3\n2005: 3\n2009: 2\n2010: 1\n\nSo from 1999 to 2000, it increased from 1 to 3. Then in 2002, same as 2000. Then in 2005, same number of releases as 2002 and 2000. So it didn't increase every year after that.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the number of song releases by dove increase every year.\" Does this mean that each subsequent year has more releases than the previous one?\n\nSo let's check:\n\nFrom 1999 to 2000: Increase from 1 to 3 \u2013 good.\nFrom 2000 to 2002: Same in 2000 (3) and then 2002 also has 3. So no increase.\nFrom 2002 to 2005: 3 to 3, same again.\nFrom 2005 to 2009: 3 down to 2 \u2013 decrease.\nFrom 2009 to 2010: 2 down to 1 \u2013 further decrease.\n\nSo the number of releases doesn't consistently increase every year. It increases once from 1999 to 2000 but then remains the same or decreases in subsequent years. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that while the number of song releases increased from 1999 to 2000, it did not consistently rise each following year. The count remained stable or decreased in later years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"song_release\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"all song except 1 be release on the album some cities.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"songs\" and \"albums,\" specifically \"some cities.\" So, it's saying that every song, except possibly one, is released on the album named \"some cities.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are multiple albums listed in the 'album' column. One of them is \"some cities,\" which releases include songs like \"black and white town,\" \"snowden,\" and \"sky starts falling.\" There's also \"kingdom of rust\" and others.\n\nI need to go through each row and check the 'album' column. For the claim to be true, all songs except one should be on \"some cities.\" Let me look at each song:\n\n1. \"here it comes\" is on \"here it comes ep.\"\n2. \"the cedar room\" is on \"lost souls.\"\n3. \"catch the sun\" is on \"lost souls.\"\n4. \"the man who told everything\" is on \"lost souls.\"\n5. \"there goes the fear\" is on \"the last broadcast.\"\n6. \"pounding\" is on \"the last broadcast.\"\n7. \"caught by the river\" is on \"the last broadcast.\"\n8. \"black and white town\" is on \"some cities.\"\n9. \"snowden\" is on \"some cities.\"\n10. \"sky starts falling\" is on \"some cities.\"\n11. \"kingdom of rust\" is its own album.\n12. \"winter hill\" is part of \"kingdom of rust.\"\n13. \"andalucia\" is part of \"the places between: the best of doves.\"\n\nWait a minute, so most songs are not on \"some cities.\" Only three songs\u2014black and white town, snowden, sky starts falling\u2014are on that album. The rest belong to different albums like lost souls, the last broadcast, kingdom of rust, etc.\n\nThe claim says all songs except one should be on some cities. But from what I see, there are 13 songs listed (from row 0 to row 12), but actually, \"andalucia\" is another song, making it 14? Wait, no, the rows go up to 13, with each row being a song. So, looking at each song's album:\n\n- Rows 8,9,10 are on some cities (3 songs).\n- The rest are not.\n\nSo, except for \"black and white town,\" \"snowden,\" and \"sky starts falling,\" none of the other songs are on \"some cities.\" That means there are way more than one song not on that album. So the claim is incorrect because it's not all songs except one; it's only a few.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that in 2009, Doves released more than 5 songs. Let's look at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the songs released in 2009. So, I'll go through each row and check the release date. \n\nLooking at the table, the \"release date\" column has dates ranging from August 1999 to April 2010. I'm only interested in the year 2009.\n\nLet me scan each row:\n- Here It Comes: August 1999\n- The Cedar Room: March 2000\n- Catch The Sun: May 2000\n- The Man Who Told Everything: October 2000\n- There Goes The Fear: April 2002\n- Pounding: July 2002\n- Caught By The River: October 2002\n- Black And White Town: February 2005\n- Snowden: May 2005\n- Sky Starts Falling: September 2005\n- Kingdom Of Rust: March 2009\n- Winter Hill: July 2009\n- Andalucia: April 2010\n\nFrom this, the songs released in 2009 are \"Kingdom of Rust\" and \"Winter Hill.\" That's two songs. Wait, is that all? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, Kingdom of Rust was released on March 30, 2009, and Winter Hill followed on July 20, 2009. So that's two releases. Each release typically includes multiple tracks, but the claim is about the number of song releases, not tracks per song.\n\nTherefore, in 2009, Doves only released two songs. The claim says they released more than five, which is false. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"more songs were released through the record label casino than through heavenly\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: song, release date, release info, formats, and album. The task is to compare the number of releases under the Casino label versus the Heavenly label.\n\nFrom the table, I need to count how many songs are released under each label. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\n1. \"here it comes\" - Album is \"here it comes ep\". Since the release info includes \"casino (chip003)\", this is a Casino release.\n2. \"the cedar room\" - Album is \"lost souls\", and release info is \"heavenly (hvn95)\", so Heavenly.\n3. \"catch the sun\" - Album is \"lost souls\", release from Heavenly.\n4. \"the man who told everything\" - Album is \"lost souls\", Heavenly.\n5. \"there goes the fear\" - Album is \"the last broadcast\", and release info mentions Casino? Wait, no, the release info says \"heavenly (hvn111)\", so that's Heavenly.\n6. \"pounding\" - Album is \"the last broadcast\", but the release info shows \"heavenly (hvn116)\" again, so Heavenly.\n7. \"caught by the river\" - Album is \"the last broadcast\", and release info says \"heavenly (hvn126)\", so Heavenly.\n8. \"black and white town\" - Album is \"some cities\", and release info includes \"heavenly (hvn145)\".\n9. \"snowden\" - Album is \"some cities\", with release info \"heavenly (hvn150)\".\n10. \"sky starts falling\" - Album is \"some cities\", and release info mentions \"heavenly (hvn152)\".\n11. \"kingdom of rust\" - Album is \"kingdom of rust\". Looking at release info: \"cd , 7 vinyl , 3 x 12 vinyl\". Wait, the label here is Heavenly because it's (hvn189). So that's another Heavenly release.\n12. \"winter hill\" - Album is \"kingdom of rust\", with release info \"heavenly (hvn192)\", so Heavenly.\n13. \"andalucia\" - Release info says \"dl\". The album is \"the places between : the best of doves\". Looking back, I think Casino releases have album names like \"here it comes ep\", \"lost souls\", \"some cities\", etc., while Heavenly releases include albums like \"heavenly (hvn95)\", \"lost souls\", \"kingdom of rust\". But wait, in row 13, the release info is just \"dl\" without a label mentioned. Hmm, maybe that's a special case or perhaps it's under Casino? Wait, no, Casino's entries usually have \"(chip003)\" etc., while Heavenly have \"(hvn...)\".\n\nWait, in row 13, the album name is \"the places between : the best of doves\", which I'm not sure about. The release info doesn't specify a label, but looking at the pattern, it seems that Casino releases are under albums like \"here it comes ep\", \"lost souls\", etc., while Heavenly has releases with (hvn...) in their info.\n\nSo row 13 is under Heavenly because it's one of their releases? Or maybe not. Wait, let me check again: The release info for \"andalucia\" just says \"dl\". Maybe that doesn't correspond to Casino or Heavenly but another label. But since the claim is comparing Casino and Heavenly, this might not count towards either.\n\nWait, no, in the table, all releases are under Casino or Heavenly? Let me check again. The first row is Casino (chip003), then rows 2-4 are Heavenly, rows 5-10 are Heavenly, rows 11-12 are Heavenly, and row 13's album is \"the places between...\", which I'm not sure about.\n\nBut according to the data, the \"casino\" label releases are:\n\n1. here it comes\n2. there goes the fear (album is the last broadcast, but release info says Casino? Wait no, in row 5, the song's album is \"the last broadcast\", which might be under Casino or Heavenly.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of songs released by Casino and Heavenly.\n\nCasino:\n\n- here it comes (row 0)\n- there goes the fear (row 4) \u2013 Wait, no, row 5's song is \"there goes the fear\" with album \"the last broadcast\". The release info for row 5 says \"heavenly (hvn111)\", so that's Heavenly. So only row 0 is Casino.\n\nWait, that can't be right because then Casino has only one release, which seems unlikely. Let me check again.\n\nRow 0: here it comes \u2013 Casino\nRows 2-4: the cedar room, catch the sun, the man who told everything \u2013 all Heavenly\nRow5: there goes the fear \u2013 Heavenly (hvn111)\nRow6: pounding \u2013 Heavenly\nRow7: caught by the river \u2013 Heavenly\nRow8: black and white town \u2013 Heavenly\nRow9: snowden \u2013 Heavenly\nRow10: sky starts falling \u2013 Heavenly\nRows11-12: kingdom of rust, winter hill \u2013 Heavenly\nRow13: andalucia \u2013 maybe not Casino or Heavenly? Or perhaps it's a different label.\n\nWait, that would mean Casino only has one release, which is \"here it comes\". But the claim says more songs were released through Casino than Heavenly. That can't be true because Heavenly has many more releases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me go back.\n\nCasino:\n\n- here it comes (row 0)\n- any others? The song \"pounding\" in row6 is Heavenly, but the album is \"the last broadcast\". Wait, but the release info for \"there goes the fear\" says \"heavenly (hvn111)\", so that's Heavenly. So only row 0 is Casino.\n\nHeavenly:\n\nRows2-4: 3 songs\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\nRow7:1\nRow8:1\nRow9:1\nRow10:1\nRow11:1\nRow12:1\n\nSo that's 3 + 8 = 11 songs under Heavenly. Casino only has 1.\n\nWait, but the claim is that more songs are released through Casino than Heavenly. So if Casino has only 1 and Heavenly has 11, that would make the claim FALSE. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe \"the last broadcast\" is a Casino album? Let me check row5: song is \"there goes the fear\", album is \"the last broadcast\". The release info says \"heavenly (hvn111)\", so that's Heavenly. So the album is under Heavenly.\n\nSimilarly, rows6-10 have albums like \"the last broadcast\" and \"some cities\", both under Heavenly.\n\nRows11-12: kingdom of rust and winter hill are also under Heavenly.\n\nSo Casino only has row0, which is 1 song. Heavenly has 3+8=11 songs.\n\nThus, the claim that more songs were released through Casino than Heavenly is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether more songs were released through the Casino record label than Heavenly, we need to count the number of songs under each label in the table.\n\n**Casino Releases:**\n- \"here it comes\" (Row 0)\n\n**Heavenly Releases:**\n- \"the cedar room\", \"catch the sun\", \"the man who told everything\" (Rows 2-4)\n- \"there goes the fear\", \"pounding\", \"caught by the river\", \"black and white town\", \"snowden\", \"sky starts falling\", \"kingdom of rust\", \"winter hill\", \"andalucia\" (Rows 5-10, 11-12)\n\nThis totals to:\n- Casino: 1 song\n- Heavenly: 11 songs\n\nSince Casino has fewer releases than Heavenly, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
