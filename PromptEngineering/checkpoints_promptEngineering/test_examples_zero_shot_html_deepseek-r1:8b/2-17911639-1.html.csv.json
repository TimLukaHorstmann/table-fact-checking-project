    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"euro 2000 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 0.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that during the Euro 2000 qualifying matches, there was a match where the score was 3-0. My task is to check if such a match exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has several rows, each representing a different match with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. My first step is to go through each row and look for any instance where the competition is \"euro 2000 qualifying\" and the score is exactly \"3 - 0\".\n\nI'll start by scanning the 'competition' column. The competitions listed are:\n\n1. Euro 2000 qualifying\n2. Friendly\n3. Euro 2000 qualifying\n4. Friendly\n5. 2002 world cup qualification\n6. Friendly\n\nNow, I'll check each row where competition is \"euro 2000 qualifying.\"\n\nThe first relevant row (row_index=0) has a score of \"3 - 0\" for the competition \"euro 2000 qualifying.\" That seems to fit the claim exactly.\n\nThen, I should look at other rows. The second and third rows are friendly matches; they don't have Euro 2000 qualifying as their competition, so their scores aren't relevant here. The fourth row is another friendly match but with a score of \"1 - 0,\" which doesn't fit the condition either.\n\nThe fifth row has the competition as \"2002 world cup qualification\" and a score of \"2 - 0.\" Since the competition isn't Euro 2000 qualifying, it's not relevant. The sixth row is another friendly match with a score of \"2 - 1,\" which also doesn't apply.\n\nSo, only one cell meets both conditions: when the competition is Euro 2000 qualifying and the score is 3-0. That cell is in row 0, column \"score.\"\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other rows. There are six rows total, and only row 0 matches both criteria. Therefore, the claim is supported by this specific cell.\n\nNow, to structure the answer as required: a JSON object with \"answer\" as \"TRUE\" and \"relevant_cells\" listing each matching cell. Since there's only one relevant cell, I'll include it in the list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"euro 2001 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in a match where the score was 3-1, the competition was \"euro 2001 qualifying.\" I need to check if any row in the table matches both conditions: score is 3-1 and competition is euro 2001 qualifying.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if either of these two conditions are met. Alternatively, since the claim has both conditions, I should look for rows where both are present.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Date: 5 June 1999\n- Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n- Score: 3 - 0\n- Result: 4 - 0\n- Competition: Euro 2000 qualifying\n\nHere, the score is 3-0, which doesn't match 3-1. So this row isn't relevant.\n\nSecond row:\n- Date: 18 August 1999\n- Venue: Dynamo Samarkand Stadium, Samarkand\n- Score: 3 - 1\n- Result: 5 - 1\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nThe score here is 3-1. But the competition is \"friendly,\" not \"euro 2001 qualifying.\" So this row doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nThird row:\n- Date: 4 September 1999\n- Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n- Score: 1 - 0\n- Result: 1 - 1\n- Competition: Euro 2000 qualifying\n\nScore is 1-0 and competition is Euro 2000 qualifying. Doesn't match.\n\nFourth row:\n- Date: 26 February 2001\n- Venue: National Sport Base Sportpalace, Varna\n- Score: 1 - 0\n- Result: 1 - 0\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nScore is 1-0 and competition is friendly.\n\nFifth row:\n- Date: 6 June 2001\n- Venue: Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Baku\n- Score: 2 - 0\n- Result: 2 - 0\n- Competition: 2002 World Cup Qualification\n\nScore is 2-0 and competition is about the World Cup.\n\nSixth row:\n- Date: 17 August 2005\n- Venue: Qemal Stafa Stadium, Tirana\n- Score: 0 - 1\n- Result: 2 - 1\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nScore is 0-1 and competition is friendly.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a row. Let me count again. The table has six rows, from index 0 to 5. So the fifth row is row index 4? Wait no, the first row is index 0, so fifth row is index 4, sixth is index 5.\n\nWait, no, looking at the HTML, each <tr> tag is a row. Let me count them:\n\n1. First <tr>: index 0\n2. Second: index 1\n3. Third: index 2\n4. Fourth: index 3\n5. Fifth: index 4\n6. Sixth: index 5\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, the first row is index 0, then next is 1, etc., up to 5 for the last row.\n\nSo, in the fifth row (index 4), the competition is \"2002 world cup qualification,\" and the score is 2-0. So no match.\n\nNow, going back to the claim: \"euro 2001 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 1.\"\n\nLooking through all rows, none of them have both a score of 3-1 and competition as euro 2001 qualifying.\n\nWait, but in the second row (index 1), the score is 3-1, but the competition is friendly. So that doesn't match.\n\nIs there any row where the competition is \"euro 2001 qualifying\" and the score is 3-1? Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 0: Euro 2000 qualifying, score 3-0\n\nRow 1: Friendly, score 3-1\n\nRow 2: Euro 2000 qualifying, score 1-0\n\nRow 3: Friendly, score 1-0\n\nRow 4: World Cup qualification, score 2-0\n\nRow 5: Friendly, score 0-1\n\nSo, none of the rows have both \"euro 2001 qualifying\" as competition and a score of 3-1. Therefore, the claim is not supported by any row in the table.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that there's a match with a score of 3-1 and the competition being \"euro 2001 qualifying.\" After checking all rows in the table, no such match exists. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
