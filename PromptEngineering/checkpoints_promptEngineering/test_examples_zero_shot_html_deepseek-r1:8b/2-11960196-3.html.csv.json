    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"dalembert get the highest both in high point and high rebound\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided HTML table. \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Dalembert was the player who achieved the highest points and also had the highest rebounds in a particular game. So, I need to check if there's any row in the table where Dalembert is listed as having both the highest points and the highest rebounds.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like team, date, score, high points (player), high rebounds (player), etc. The columns relevant to this claim are \"high points\" and \"high rebounds.\"\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to see if Dalembert is mentioned in both these columns for any given game.\n\nStarting from row 0:\n- High points: Miller (20)\n- High rebounds: Evans (14)\nNo mention of Dalembert here.\n\nRow 1:\n- High points: Williams (17)\n- High rebounds: Evans (11)\nAgain, no Dalembert.\n\nRow 2:\n- High points: Dalembert (23) \u2192 This is a point in favor.\n- High rebounds: Dalembert (16) \u2192 Another point.\nSo in row 2, Dalembert has both the highest points and highest rebounds. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should check all rows to ensure there's no other occurrence where someone else might have higher points or rebounds. However, since the claim is specifically about Dalembert, even if others also had high points or rebounds on different games, as long as there's at least one game where he leads both, it could be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The instruction says to check if the claim is fully supported by the table. So, if in any row, Dalembert is the highest in both high points and high rebounds, then it's TRUE.\n\nLooking again at row 2: \n- High points: Dalembert (23)\n- High rebounds: Dalembert (16)\n\nYes, that's a single instance where he leads both. Therefore, the claim is supported as TRUE.\n\nNow, to list the relevant cells:\n- The row index for this occurrence is 2.\n- The columns are \"high points\" and \"high rebounds\".\n\nSo, the JSON should reflect these two cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 6 game with team detroit be between april 20 and may 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a specific game number (game 6), the team (Detroit), and specifies that it should occur between April 20 and May 1.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a game with details like date, team, etc. So, I need to find the row corresponding to game 6 and check if its date falls between April 20 and May 1.\n\nThe table's rows are numbered from 1 to 6. Game 6 is in the sixth row (row index 5, since we start counting from 0). In that row, under the \"date\" column, it says \"may 1\". So, the date for game 6 is May 1.\n\nNow, I need to check if May 1 falls between April 20 and May 1. Wait, the claim says \"between april 20 and may 1.\" Hmm, does that include May 1 or not? In some contexts, \"between\" can be exclusive, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut in this case, the date for game 6 is May 1, which is exactly the end of the period stated. Depending on interpretation, if between includes the start and end dates, then May 1 would qualify. However, sometimes \"between\" is used to mean strictly after April 20 and before May 1.\n\nBut looking at the claim again: it's saying the game is between April 20 and May 1. So, if May 1 is considered within that range, then it's TRUE because May 1 is the end date. If \"between\" is meant to exclude May 1, then it would be FALSE.\n\nBut in the table, the exact date is May 1. The claim says between April 20 and May 1, which could include May 1 as the upper bound. So I think it's acceptable to say that May 1 falls within or at the end of the specified period.\n\nAdditionally, the team for game 6 is Detroit, which matches the claim's mention of \"team detroit.\" So both conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because game 6 with Detroit occurs on May 1, which falls within the specified range of April 20 and May 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"more people view the game in the palace of auburn hills\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. First, I'll go through each step carefully.\n\nThe claim is about attendance at games played at the Palace of Auburn Hills. From the table, it looks like each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc., and one of those columns is \"location attendance\". That column seems to list both the venue name and the number of attendees for each game.\n\nI need to find out if the Palace of Auburn Hills consistently has more people attending each game compared to other venues or if it's not necessarily always higher. Looking at the table:\n\n- Game 1: Palace with 22076 attendance\n- Game 2: Same venue, same attendance\n- Games 3 and 4 are in Wachovia Center with lower attendances (18k vs 22k)\n- Games 5 and 6 also at the Palace but with the same 22k attendees.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, Game 1 is the first one, then Game 2 is another game, so maybe it's a series. For example, Game 3 and 4 are in Wachovia Center, which suggests that when they played there, attendance was lower. So for Palace games (Games 1, 2,5,6), the attendance is consistently about 22k, while away games have lower.\n\nBut does the claim say \"more people view the game in the palace\"? It doesn't specify whether it's higher than other venues or just that more people attend there. But looking at the data, when they play at Palace, the attendance is 22076 each time, but when playing away, it's around 18k.\n\nSo for the games played at Palace (games 1,2,5,6), their home games have higher attendance compared to when they played away. So perhaps the claim refers to whether more people attend their home games, which are in the Palace. But the way the claim is phrased, it's about the venue itself. It doesn't directly compare across venues but rather focuses on the Palace as a location with high attendance.\n\nHowever, looking at the data, each game at the Palace has around 22k attendees, while other venues have lower. So within their own games, Palace has higher attendance. Therefore, more people do view the games in the Palace compared to when they play elsewhere.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"more people view the game in the palace of auburn hills.\" It might be interpreted as whether the venue itself sees more attendees than others. Based on the table, each time they play at the Palace, attendance is around 22k, which is higher than their away games. So that supports the claim being TRUE.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells. The column in question is \"location attendance\". Each row where the location is the Palace would be relevant. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Game 1: Palace, attendance 22076\n- Game 2: Same venue\n- Games 3 and 4: Wachovia Center\n- Games5,6: Palace again\n\nSo for rows 0,1,5,6 (row indices starting at 0). But the claim doesn't specify \"more than other venues\", but rather just that more people view the game in the Palace. So perhaps all rows where location is Palace are relevant.\n\nWait, no, because in each of those games, the attendance is consistent. It's not necessarily higher than previous games unless compared to others. But the claim doesn't specify comparison; it just states that more people attend there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about whether the venue's attendance is more than a certain number, but from the table, it's clear that each Palace game has around 22k attendees, which is higher than other venues. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are those where \"location attendance\" column has the Palace's attendance numbers. So in row 0, column 'location attendance' is 'the palace of auburn hills 22076'. Similarly for rows 1,5,6.\n\nSo I need to list each occurrence where location is Palace and extract that cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that more people view the game in the Palace of Auburn Hills. By examining the \"location attendance\" column, we see that games played at this venue consistently attract higher attendance compared to away games. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"iguodala be the high assist in 4 of the game\" is true based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It's saying that Iguodala was the player with the highest assists in 4 games. So, I need to check each game in the table and see if there are any instances where Iguodala had more assists than his teammates.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns like game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and series. The relevant column for this claim is \"high assists.\"\n\nI'll go through each row (game) one by one:\n\n1. **Game 1**: The high assist is listed as Iguodala with 8. So that's one game where he leads.\n2. **Game 2**: High assist goes to Iguodala again, this time with 4. That's the second game.\n3. **Game 3**: Here, it says \"green , iguodala\" with 6 assists. Since both are listed, it might mean they tied. So maybe it's not just Iguodala alone here.\n4. **Game 4**: The high assist is Iguodala with 5. That's the third game where he leads.\n5. **Game 5**: High assist is again Iguodala, this time with 6. Fourth game.\n6. **Game 6**: In this row, it says \"evans , ollie\" with 3 assists. So no mention of Iguodala being the highest here.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 4 games where Iguodala was the high assist. Let me count how many times he was the sole top in assists:\n\n- Game 1: Only Iguodala\n- Game 2: Only Iguodala\n- Game 3: He's mentioned along with Green, so maybe a tie or both have the same. So not sure if that counts as him being the high.\n- Game 4: Only Iguodala\n- Game 5: Only Iguodala\n\nSo if we count Games 1,2,4,5 where he was the sole highest, that's four games. But in Game 3 and 6, he didn't lead alone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim counts any time he is among the top, even tied. If so, Game 3 would be his third instance, making it five games. But the claim says \"4 of the game,\" which likely means four instances where he was the highest.\n\nWait, looking back, the claim might be a bit ambiguous. It could mean in four different games, or possibly four times across all games. But based on the instruction, I think it's about how many games he led, not total assists.\n\nSo in that case:\n\n- Game 1: Yes\n- Game 2: Yes\n- Game 3: Maybe a tie, so maybe not counted as leading alone.\n- Game 4: Yes\n- Game 5: Yes\n\nIf we don't count Game 3, he led in four games (1,2,4,5). So that's four instances where Iguodala was the high assist.\n\nBut wait, let me check each row again to make sure:\n\n- **Game 1**: High assists - Iguodala (8)\n- **Game 2**: High assists - Iguodala (4)\n- **Game 3**: High assists - Green and Iguodala (6)\n- **Game 4**: High assists - Iguodala (5)\n- **Game 5**: High assists - Iguodala (6)\n- **Game 6**: High assists - Evans and Ollie (3)\n\nSo, in Game 3, it's a tie. The claim is about \"iguodala be the high assist,\" which implies he was the highest. If there's a tie, does that mean he wasn't the sole highest? So perhaps only when he is clearly the top.\n\nTherefore, considering that:\n\n- Games where Iguodala was the sole highest: 1,2,4,5 (four games)\n- Games where he tied or came after others: 3 and 6\n\nThus, the claim states he was the high assist in four games. So it's TRUE based on four instances.\n\nBut wait, another angle: Maybe \"in four of the game\" refers to four different games where he had at least some assists as the top, regardless of whether he was sole or tied. In that case, Game 3 would also count, making it five times. However, the wording is \"the high assist,\" which implies being the highest, not just having some.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct count is four games where he was the sole highest in assists.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we analyze each game's high assists:\n\n- **Game 1**: Iguodala leads with 8.\n- **Game 2**: Iguodala leads with 4.\n- **Game 3**: Tie between Green and Iguodala (6).\n- **Game 4**: Iguodala leads with 5.\n- **Game 5**: Iguodala leads with 6.\n- **Game 6**: Evans and Ollie lead with 3.\n\nIguodala is the sole leader in four games: 1, 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE based on Iguodala leading in four games.",

    "claim": "the highest series of the season be 2 - 4 , on game 6",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the highest series of the season be 2 - 4 , on game 6\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"highest series\" likely refers to the best series outcome for a particular team in the season. In basketball, a series is often about a playoff or a group of games leading up to a postseason. But here, looking at the table, it seems like these are regular-season games because there's no mention of playoffs or a specific series format beyond \"series\" being updated as 1 - 0, 1 - 1, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions \"2 - 4 on game 6\". So I need to check two things: whether the series outcome for game 6 is 2 - 4 and whether it's the highest series in the season.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Each row represents a game, from 1 to 6.\n- The \"series\" column shows the series record after each game. For example, after game 1, Detroit has 1 - 0; after game 2, 1 - 1; after game 3, 2 - 1; game 4: 2 - 2; game 5: 2 - 3; and game 6: 2 - 4.\n\nSo for game 6, the series is indeed 2 - 4. Now, I need to determine if this is the highest series of the season. Since it's the last game, and the team wins with a series of 2 - 4, but wait, in a typical sports league, the series is usually higher than that. For example, if it's a best-of-seven series, the maximum would be 4 - 3 or similar. But here, each game seems to be part of a single series, and after six games, the series result is 2 - 4.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"highest series\" implies that 2 - 4 is better than previous series outcomes in other games. Alternatively, it might mean the highest win-loss record at any point during the season.\n\nLooking back, each game's series column shows incremental updates:\n\n- Game 1: 1 - 0\n- Game 2: 1 - 1\n- Game 3: 2 - 1\n- Game 4: 2 - 2\n- Game 5: 2 - 3\n- Game 6: 2 - 4\n\nSo after each game, the series is updated. The highest series in terms of wins would be game 6 with 2 - 4. But wait, that's a loss for Detroit since it's 2 - 4. Maybe I'm misunderstanding \"highest series\". Perhaps it refers to the best result they achieved in any single game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"series\" here refers to the cumulative series record, and the highest point would be when they have the most wins at any game. For example, after game 3, their series is 2 - 1, which might be a peak if they lose subsequent games.\n\nBut according to the claim, it's specifically about game 6 having the highest series of 2 - 4. So I need to verify two things: whether the series on game 6 is indeed 2 - 4 and whether that's the highest point in the season.\n\nLooking at the table, after game 6, the series is 2 - 4, which is a loss for Detroit but perhaps their best series outcome of the season. So if the claim states that this is the case, then it would be true.\n\nWait, but \"highest series\" might mean they have the most wins in any series. But considering each game's series update, after game 6, they have 2 - 4, which might not necessarily be the highest. For example, if they had a higher win count earlier, like 3 - something, but in this case, it seems that the series progresses from 1 - 0 to 2 - 1 and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"highest series\" refers to the best game outcome for them, which is when they have more wins than losses. But looking at each game's score:\n\nGame 1: 90-86 (Detroit win)\nGame 2: 88-105 (Loss)\nGame 3: 95-75 (Win)\nGame 4: 84-93 (Loss)\nGame 5: 81-98 (Loss)\nGame 6: 77-100 (Loss)\n\nSo their highest score is game 1 and 3. But that's about points, not series outcomes.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to the team having a series record of 2 - 4 on game 6, which would mean they've won two games and lost four up to that point. If this is indeed their highest series in terms of wins at any point during the season, then it's true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"highest\" implies the most wins, regardless of the losses. So 2 - 4 means more losses than wins, so it's not a high series record. But if the team started with some wins and later had more losses, perhaps 2 - 4 is their best in terms of win-loss progression.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"highest series\" is the right interpretation. It might mean that on game 6, their series result is 2 - 4, making it their highest point in terms of series advancement during the season.\n\nGiven the table, after each game, the series progresses:\n\n1-0, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4.\n\nSo at game 6, it's indeed 2 - 4. So if the claim is that on game 6, their series result was 2 - 4 and that this is their highest series point during the season, then it's correct.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is accurate based on the provided data:\n\n1. **Series Outcome on Game 6**: According to the table, after game 6, the series result for Detroit is 2 - 4. This indicates that up to that point in the season, they had won two games and lost four.\n\n2. **Highest Series Point in the Season**: From the progression of the series:\n   - Game 1: 1 - 0\n   - Game 2: 1 - 1\n   - Game 3: 2 - 1\n   - Game 4: 2 - 2\n   - Game 5: 2 - 3\n   - Game 6: 2 - 4\n\n   The series reaches its peak (highest number of wins) after game 3 with a record of 2 - 1. However, if \"highest series\" refers to the last updated series result in the season, then game 6 indeed concludes the series at 2 - 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim that on game 6 the team's series was 2 - 4 and it represents their highest series point in the season is correct based on the information provided.\n\n**Answer**: The statement is accurate. On game 6, Detroit had a series record of 2-4, which was their highest series outcome during the season.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"dalembert have lower rebound than evans\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided in HTML format. It lists several games with details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and series. Each row represents a different game, and each column corresponds to specific data points.\n\nThe claim compares two players: Dalembert and Evans, specifically about their rebound numbers. To verify this, I need to find the relevant cells in the table that contain information on both players' rebounds.\n\nLooking at the table headers, I see that there's a column called \"high rebounds\" which likely refers to the player with the highest rebounds for that game. Each row has entries under this column, and sometimes the names are listed with the numbers in parentheses, like \"evans (14)\" or \"iguodala (8)\".\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see who has higher rebounds:\n\n1. **Row 0:** The high rebounder is Evans with 14.\n2. **Row 1:** High rebounder is Evans again with 11.\n3. **Row 2:** The entry here says \"green , iguodala (6)\". Since both Green and Iguodala are listed, I need to check if Dalembert was involved in this game. Looking at the team column, it's Detroit, but the player names don't mention Dalembert here. So, maybe he didn't play this game.\n4. **Row 3:** High rebounds are from Dalembert with 12. So here, Dalembert has more rebounds than Evans (who had 7 in this row).\n5. **Row 4:** High rebounder is Evans with 7.\n6. **Row 5:** Evans again has 7 rebounds.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"Dalembert have lower rebound than Evans.\" That would mean that in all games where both played, Dalembert's rebounds are less than Evans'. But looking at Row 3, it seems that Dalembert had higher rebounds than Evans (12 vs. 7). So this contradicts the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about \"Dalembert have lower rebound than Evans\" overall or in each game? If it's per game, then in some games, like Row 3, Dalembert has higher rebounds, making the claim false because it's not universally true across all relevant games.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if there are any other instances where both players played together. In Row 2, both Green and Iguodala had 6 rebounds, but not Dalembert. So maybe they don't play together often, but in the game where they do (Row 3), Dalembert outperforms Evans.\n\nAnother point: The high rebounds column might only list the highest for that game, so if both players are in the same game, their individual stats could be elsewhere. Wait, no\u2014the table seems to track each player's performance per game. So if a player isn't listed as a high rebounder, it doesn't mean they didn't play; perhaps their stats aren't highlighted here.\n\nWait, looking at Row 3: The high rebounds are from Dalembert (16). But in the same row, Evans is mentioned with 12? No, wait, the column only lists the highest. So in that game, Dalembert had the highest rebounds, but I'm not sure about Evans' total for that game. Maybe Evans had lower than Dalembert but higher than others.\n\nBut regardless of others, if in any game where both played, Dalembert has more rebounds than Evans, then the claim that \"Dalembert have lower rebound than Evans\" is false because it's not always true.\n\nWait, but I need to check for all rows where both players are present. Let me see:\n\nLooking at each row, I can list who had higher rebounds:\n\n- Row 0: Evans (14) vs. Who else? Maybe other teammates, but the claim is about Dalembert vs. Evans.\n- If in any game, Dalembert's rebounds are higher than Evans', then the overall statement would be false.\n\nIn Row 3, high rebounds from Dalembert (16), and Evans had 12. So here, Dalembert > Evans. That directly contradicts the claim that \"Dalembert have lower rebound than Evans\" because in this game, he didn't. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \"dalembert have lower rebound than evans,\" we need to check their performance across all relevant games.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The \"high rebounds\" column lists each game's top rebounder.\n2. **Check Each Game**:\n   - **Row 0**: Evans (14) > Dalembert (not listed here).\n   - **Row 1**: Evans (11) > Dalembert (not mentioned).\n   - **Row 2**: No mention of Dalembert; only Green and Iguodala.\n   - **Row 3**: Dalembert (16) > Evans (12). This contradicts the claim.\n   - **Rows 4-5**: Evans has higher rebounds.\n\nSince in Row 3, Dalembert outperformed Evans, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because in at least one game, Dalembert had more rebounds than Evans.",

Wait a minute, when I look at the table, I see that all the teams listed under the 'team' column are \"detroit\". That's different from \"detriou\". So maybe there's a typo or misinterpretation here.\n\nI should check if \"detriou\" is actually present in any of the games during that timeframe. Looking at the table, each row represents a game. The dates range from April 20th to May 1st, so I need to focus on rows where the 'date' falls within this period.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Row 0: April 20\n- Row 1: April 23\n- Row 2: April 25\n- Row 3: April 27\n- Row 4: April 29\n- Row 5: May 1\n\nSo all these rows are within April 20 to May 1. Now, the 'team' column in each of these rows says \"detroit\". There's no mention of \"detriou\" anywhere. So, based on that, there are games by team detroit during that time.\n\nNow, considering the claim is about \"detriou\", which doesn't match any team in the table, it seems like the claim is false because the team \"detroit\" did play multiple games within that timeframe.\n\nI should also check if maybe \"detriou\" was a misspelling or if I'm missing something. Maybe the team name has a different abbreviation or variation, but in this table, it's consistently \"detroit\". So there are definitely games by detroit during those dates, which means there are games involving the supposed team in question.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because such games do exist.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the table shows multiple games played by team \"detroit\" between April 20 and May 1, contradicting the claim that no game with team detriou exists during that period.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The claim is that \"the palace of auburn hills have less attendance than the wachovia center.\" So I need to check if, based on the table provided, the palace has fewer attendees compared to Wachovia.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. It seems each row represents a game, with details like date, team, score, etc. The relevant columns for attendance would be \"location attendance.\" Each location is either the palace or Wachovia center.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For row 1: location is \"the palace of auburn hills\" and attendance is 22076.\n- Row 2: same location with 22076.\n- Row 3: different location, Wachovia, with 18805.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are split between the two locations.\n- Row 6 is back at Wachovia with 14130.\n\nSo to compare attendances, I need to list all attendance numbers for both locations.\n\nLet me compile the data:\n\nPalace of Auburn Hills:\n- April 20: 22076\n- April 23: 22076\n- April 29: 22076\n\nWachovia Center:\n- April 25: 18805\n- April 27: 18347\n- May 1: 14130\n\nLooking at these numbers:\n\nPalace has 22076, 22076, and 22076 attendees.\nWachovia has 18805, 18347, and 14130.\n\nComparing the maximums:\nThe highest attendance for Wachovia is 18805, which is less than the Palace's 22076. Therefore, the palace consistently has higher or equal attendance compared to Wachovia in all games listed.\n\nSo the claim that \"the palace of auburn hills have less attendance than the wachovia center\" is FALSE because the palace actually had more attendees each time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the Palace of Auburn Hills' attendance was higher in all listed games compared to Wachovia Center. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. **Identify relevant columns:** \"location attendance\".\n2. **Extract data for both locations:**\n   - Palace of Auburn Hills: 22076 (three times).\n   - Wachovia Center: 18805, 18347, and 14130.\n3. **Compare attendances:** All Palace numbers are higher than the lowest Wachovia number.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "igoudala have lower assist than evans",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"Igoudala have lower assist than Evans\" is true or false based on the given HTML table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's comparing the assists of two players, Igoudala and Evans. So I need to find their assist numbers in the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns, there are several that might be relevant. The 'high assists' column seems directly related because it lists the top assists for each game. But wait, sometimes multiple players can have high assists, especially if they share the same number. For example, in row 3, it says \"green , iguodala (6)\". So in that case, both Green and Igoudala have 6 assists.\n\nI should check each row to see how many times each player's assists are listed as the highest. For Igoudala, I'll look for his name in the 'high assists' column across all rows.\n\nIn row 0: Miller has 20, so no.\nRow1: Williams with 17.\nRow2: No Igoudala here; Evans and others have higher numbers.\nRow3: Igoudala tied at 6.\nRow4: Young leads with 15.\nRow5: Igoudala has 21.\nRow6: Evans with 7, but I'm looking for Igoudala's assists. Wait, in row6, it says \"evans , ollie (3)\", so no Igoudala.\n\nNow, comparing Igoudala's assist numbers to Evans'. Let me list both:\n\nIgoudala's high assists:\n- Row3: 6\n- Row5:21\n\nEvans' high assists:\n- Row0:14\n- Row1:11\n- Row2:11 (but it's his own, not Igoudala)\nWait, in row1, the high rebounds are Evans with 11. Assists for row1: Williams has 17, so Evans doesn't have the highest assist that game.\n\nIn row6, Evans has 7, and Igoudala isn't listed as a top assistant there.\n\nSo Igoudala's assists in rows where he is the highest:\n- Row3:6\n- Row5:21\n\nEvans' highest assist is 14 in row0. So in that game, Igoudala didn't have higher than Evans. But looking at their individual stats, do they ever have Igoudala with more assists than Evans?\n\nWait, maybe I should check each game for both players.\n\nLet me list all games and note when Igoudala's assist is lower than Evans' or not.\n\nRow0: Miller 20 (assists). Igoudala isn't listed as a top assist here; Miller is. Evans has 14 rebounds but no assists listed, so maybe he didn't lead in that game.\nRow1: Williams with 17 assists. No Igoudala here, and Evans has 11 rebounds, not assists.\nRow2: Evans has 11 rebounds. Assist leader is someone else (Williams again?), but I'm focusing on their own assists. Wait, the 'high assists' column shows who had the most in that game.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a table of each player's assist counts per game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look at each row and see if Igoudala has lower or higher than Evans.\n\nBut the claim is whether Igoudala has lower assist than Evans. So for each game where both are relevant, does Igoudala have less?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about their overall performance across games, but maybe it's per game. Or perhaps it's about the total season stats.\n\nBut looking at the table, it seems to be a series of games, so each row represents a single game. Therefore, in each game, we can compare Igoudala and Evans' assists.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\nRow0: Game1, April 20\n- High assists: Miller (20)\nIgoudala's assist: Not listed as top, so maybe he didn't lead here.\nEvans: Rebounds (14), not assists. So in this game, Igoudala's assists are likely less than Evans' if Evans had any.\n\nRow1: April 23\n- High assists: Williams (17)\nIgoudala is not listed, so again, perhaps he didn't lead here.\nEvans has rebounds but not assists as top. So maybe no comparison.\n\nRow2: April25\n- High assists: Green and Igoudala (6). So both have 6. Evans isn't the leader here; his rebounds are 16 but not assists.\nSo in this game, Igoudala's assist is equal to Evans'?\n\nWait, no. In this row, it says \"green , iguodala (6)\", meaning they tied for the most assists at 6. So neither has lower than the other; they're equal.\n\nRow3: April27\n- High assists: Young (15). Igoudala isn't leading here.\nEvans has 7 rebounds but not assists as top.\n\nRow4: April29?\nWait, let me check row numbers:\n\nRows are 0 to 6. Wait, the games might be from Game0 to Game6, but the dates may vary.\n\nIn any case, in this row, high assist is Young with 15. So Igoudala didn't lead here.\n\nRow5: May1?\nAssists: Igoudala (21), which is higher than Evans' 7 in this game.\n\nSo in this game, Igoudala > Evans.\n\nRow6: May3?\nAssists: Not clear from the table. It says \"evans , ollie (3)\", so maybe Ollie has 3 assists? Or they tied at 3?\n\nWait, the format is: Player, number. So for row6, high rebounds are Evans with 7. High assists: not sure because it's written as \"evans , ollie (3)\". So perhaps in that game, both had 3 assists, making it a tie.\n\nSo Igoudala didn't have higher than 21, but does he have any games where he has more than Evans?\n\nIn row5, yes:21 vs Evans'7.\n\nBut the claim is whether Igoudala's assists are lower than Evans'. So looking across all games, in most cases, Igoudala doesn't lead, except in row5. However, the exact wording of the claim isn't clear\u2014whether it's about each individual game or overall.\n\nIf it's about each game, then sometimes Igoudala has more (row5), sometimes less (others). So they don't always have Igoudala lower.\n\nBut if it's about total across all games, then totals might be different. For example:\n\nIgoudala: sum of his high assists: 6 +21 =27\nEvans: sum of his high assists:14+11+7=32? Wait, no. Each time he is a top assist in a game.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nFor each player, list their high assists per game.\n\nIgoudala:\n- Game3 (row2):6\n- Game5 (row4):21\n\nTotal:27\n\nEvans:\n- Game0 (row1? Wait, rows might correspond differently.)\n\nWait, actually, the way the table is structured, each row is a separate game. So:\n\nRow0: Game0: Miller 20 assists.\nRow1: Game1: Williams 17.\nRow2: Game2: someone else.\nRow3: Game3: Young 15\nRow4: Game4: Igoudala 21\nRow5: Game5: Evans7\nRow6: Game6: ?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with the row numbering. Alternatively, perhaps each row is a separate game, regardless of date.\n\nSo, per game:\n\nIgoudala's high assists:\n- Game2 (row3):6\n- Game4 (row5? Or maybe row4. This is unclear.)\n\nWait, let me clarify: Each row seems to represent a different game, with the players and their stats for that game.\n\nSo in Row0 (Game1?), the stats are:\n\nPlayer: Miller, assists:20\n\nIn Row1 (Game2?): Williams, assists:17\n\nRow2 (Game3?): Green and Igoudala, 6 each\n\nRow3 (Game4?): Young,15\n\nRow4 (Game5?): Igoudala,21\n\nRow5 (Game6?): Evans,7\n\nRow6 (Game7?): Evans and Ollie, 3 each.\n\nSo per game:\n\nIgoudala's high assists: in Game3 (row2) and Game5 (row4):6 and21\n\nEvans' high assists: in Game0 (row1), he had 14 rebounds; not sure about assists. Wait, no\u2014wait, in row0, the high rebounds are Evans with14, but what about assists?\n\nWait, each row lists different stats. So, for example:\n\nRow0: Miller has20 assists, Evans has14 rebounds.\n\nSo in that game, the top assist was Miller (20), so Igoudala didn't lead.\n\nIn Row1: Williams has17 assists, so Evans' rebounds are11, but no assist listed as top. So Evans didn't lead here either.\n\nRow2: Green and Igoudala share6 assists each; Evans had16 rebounds but not leading.\n\nRow3: Young leads with15 assists; Igoudala isn't leading here.\n\nRow4: Igoudala leads with21 assists; Evans' rebounds are7.\n\nRow5: Evans has7 rebounds, and Ollie or someone else might have the assist. But the high assists here would be someone else if it's written as \"evans , ollie (3)\". So in this game, the top assists are 3 by both, but who exactly? Maybe both have equal?\n\nRow6: Evans and Ollie share3 assists each; so the top assist is3.\n\nSo compiling this:\n\nIgoudala led in:\n- Game3 (row2):6\n- Game5 (row4):21\n\nEvans led in:\n- Any game? Looking at it, I don't see where Evans has high assists. In row0, he had high rebounds but not assist. In row1, he had11 rebounds but not high assist. In row2, his rebounds were16, but assist was shared.\n\nWait, actually, each row only lists one or two top stats. So perhaps in Row5 (Game6), the high assists are someone else, since it says \"evans , ollie (3)\". Maybe both had 3, making it tied.\n\nSo Evans never led in assists, as far as I can see.\n\nIgoudala led in two games: Game3 and Game5.\n\nIn other games, someone else led or it was a tie.\n\nTherefore, across all games, Igoudala has higher assists than Evans in two instances. In the rest, either someone else leads or they are tied.\n\nSo the claim that \"Igoudala's assists are always lower than Evans' \" is incorrect because in at least two games, Igoudala had higher assists.\n\nUnless the claim refers to individual games where Igoudala was present. But in any case, the statement seems to be inaccurate.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that Igoudala's assists are always lower than Evans' is false. Across the games analyzed:\n\n- **Igoudala led in two games** with higher assist counts (6 and 21 points).\n- In other games, either someone else had the highest assists or there was a tie.\n\nThus, Igoudala does not consistently have lower assists; she outperformed Evans in some matches.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement is false. Igoudala's assists are not always lower than Evans'; she has had higher assist counts in some games.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the highest series of the season do not occur until may\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It's saying that the highest series number for the season doesn't happen until May. So, I should look through the table to see when the maximum series number occurs.\n\nLooking at the 'series' column in the table:\n\nRow 1: 1-0\nRow 2: 1-1\nRow 3: 2-1\nRow 4: 2-2\nRow 5: 2-3\nRow 6: 2-4\n\nSo, the series numbers go up to 2-4 in row 6. The highest series number here is 2-4, which occurs on May 1st.\n\nNow, checking the dates:\n\nApril 20, 23, 25, 27, 29, and May 1.\n\nThe highest series (2-4) happens on May 1, which is in May. So the claim says that the highest doesn't occur until May, meaning after April. That seems to be true because all games before May have lower series numbers.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if any game in May has a higher series than 2-4. Since row 6 is May 1 and it's 2-4, and there are no more rows after that, the highest series is indeed 2-4 in May.\n\nSo, the claim is correct because the highest series occurs in May, not before.\n</think>\n\nThe highest series of the season (2-4) occurs on May 1st, which is in May. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
