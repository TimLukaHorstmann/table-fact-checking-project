    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Bebe Neuwirth play Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast and Krysta Rodriguez play Wednesday Addams.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim into two separate statements. \n\n1. Bebe Neuwirth plays Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast.\n2. Krysta Rodrigues plays Wednesday Addams.\n\nI need to check both parts against the table to see if they hold true.\n\nStarting with the first statement: Bebe Neuwirth as Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast. Looking at the table, I'll search for \"Morticia Addams\" and see who is listed under the \"original broadway cast.\" Scanning the rows, in row 1 (index 0), under the role \"morticia addams,\" the name is Bebe Neuwirth. That matches exactly with the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, for the second statement: Krysta Rodrigues plays Wednesday Addams. I'll look for \"Wednesday addams\" and check the \"original broadway cast.\" In row 5 (index 5), under the role \"wednesday addams,\" the name is Krysta Rodriguez. Wait, there's a slight discrepancy here\u2014Rodriguez vs. Rodrigues. However, in the table, it's spelled as Krysta Rodrigues. But the claim says \"Krysta Rodrigues.\" Oh no, wait\u2014the claim has Krysta Rodrigues but the table lists Krysta Rodrigues as Wednesday Addams? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at row 5 (index 5), the role is Wednesday Addams and the name is Krysta Rodrigues. So that matches the second part of the claim, which also uses \"Krysta Rodrigues.\" Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"Krysta Rodrigues,\" but in the table, it's spelled as \"Krysta Rodrigues\" as well? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in row 5 (index 5), the name is Krysta Rodrigues. So the claim correctly states that Krysta Rodrigues plays Wednesday Addams. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n\nThus, both statements in the claim are TRUE based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because Bebe Neuwirth is indeed Morticia Addams in the original Broadway cast, and Krysta Rodrigues plays Wednesday Addams. Both roles are confirmed in their respective columns of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"daniel boaventura be 1 of 6 people who play gomez addams\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant information in the table. The claim mentions Daniel Boaventura and Gomez Addams. So, I should check which row corresponds to Gomez Addams and see if Daniel Boaventura is listed there.\n\nLooking at the table, the first column under \"original\" casts lists each character's actors. For Gomez Addams, the original Broadway cast is Nathan Lane. Then, in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast, it says Daniel Boaventura. So, Daniel Boaventura plays Gomez Addams in the original cast of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe claim states that he is one of six people who play Gomez Addams. To confirm this, I need to check if there are five other actors listed for Gomez Addams in other casts, such as original Broadway, closing Broadway, etc.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Original Broadway: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway: Roger Rees\n- Original US Tour: Douglas Sills\n- Original Nonequity Tour: Jesse Sharp\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo: Daniel Boaventura\n- Original Lima: Diego Bertie\n\nThat's six different actors for Gomez Addams across various casts. So, the claim is accurate because Daniel Boaventura is indeed one of six people who have played Gomez Addams.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE and relevant cells are row 5 (since rows start from 0), under the \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Pugsley Addams is true or false based on the given HTML table. The claim says that Pugsley Addams is the only role with three people available in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\nFirst, I should locate where Pugsley Addams is listed in the table. Looking at the table, each row represents a different character. Pugsley Addams is in one of these rows. Let me scan through the \"role\" column for his name.\n\nYes, there's a row with \"pugsley addams\". Now I need to check the corresponding cast members under the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast, which is one of the columns. The table has several columns: original broadway cast, closing broadway cast, etc., and one of them is for the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\n\nLooking specifically at Pugsley Addams' row, under the \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" column, it says \"nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz , matheus lustosa\". So that's three names listed there. \n\nNow I need to check if any other role in the S\u00e3o Paulo cast has three or more people as well. If another role also has three people, then the claim would be false because it's not just Pugsley.\n\nI'll go through each row and look at their \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" entries. \n\nStarting with Morticia Addams: two names.\nUncle Fester: one name.\nGrandma Addams: one name.\nWednesday Addams: one name.\nPugsley Addams: three names.\nOther characters like Lucas Beineke, Alice Beineke, etc., each have either one or two names.\n\nWait, let me check Lurch's cast. It has \"rog\u00e9rio guedes\" only, so that's one person.\n\nMal Beineke has Wellington Nogueira and Miguel Alvarez? Wait, no, looking again: Mal Beineke's S\u00e3o Paulo cast is \"wellington nogueira\". Hmm, maybe I misread earlier.\n\nWait, in the Pugsley row, it's three people. Let me check each role:\n\n- Gomez Addams: one\n- Morticia: two\n- Uncle Fester: one\n- Grandma: one\n- Wednesday: one\n- Pugsley: three\n- Lurch: one\n- Mal Beineke: one\n- Alice: one\n- Lucas: one\n\nWait, no, I think I might have missed some. Let me check each role's S\u00e3o Paulo cast again.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: nathan lane (Broadway), roger rees (closing), etc., but S\u00e3o Paulo is daniel boaventura. So one.\n2. Morticia: bebe neuwirth, Brooke Shields, etc. S\u00e3o Paulo: marisa orth. One person.\n3. Uncle Fester: Kevin Chamberlin, Brad Oscar, etc. S\u00e3o Paulo: claudio galvan. One.\n4. Grandma Addams: Jackie Hoffman again, and others. S\u00e3o Paulo: in\u00e1 de carvalho. One.\n5. Wednesday: Krysta Rodriguez, Rachel Potter, etc. S\u00e3o Paulo: laura lobo. One.\n6. Pugsley: three people as per the claim.\n7. Lurch: Zachary James again, Tom Corbeil, etc. S\u00e3o Paulo: rog\u00e9rio guedes. One person.\n8. Mal Beineke: Terrence Mann, Adam Grupper, etc. S\u00e3o Paulo: wellington nogueira. One.\n9. Alice Beineke: Carolee Carmello, Heidi Blickenstaff, etc. S\u00e3o Paulo: paula capovilla. One.\n10. Lucas Beineke: Wesley Taylor, Jesse Swenson, etc. S\u00e3o Paulo: beto sargentelli. One.\n\nSo only Pugsley has three people in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. Therefore, the claim is correct. He's the only one with three available actors.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because only Pugsley Addams has three people listed in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast, and no other role does so.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The user mentioned Adam Riegler and Zachary James. So I need to check where they are.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn row 5, the role is Pugsley Addams.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"gomez have be play by 8 different actor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"gomez.\" Looking at the table headers, there's a column called \"role,\" and under that, each row lists characters like Gomez Addams, Morticia Addams, etc. So I think \"gomez\" refers to the role of Gomez Addams.\n\nThe next part is \"have be play by 8 different actor.\" Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe it's a typo or misphrasing. Perhaps it should be \"be played by 8 different actors.\" So the claim is saying that Gomez has been played by 8 different actors across various productions.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check how many different actors have played Gomez Addams. Each row in the \"original broadway cast,\" \"closing broadway cast,\" etc., lists the actor for each role. So I should focus on the cells under each production category for the role of Gomez Addams.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First row: Gomez Addams is played by Nathan Lane in original Broadway, Roger Rees in closing Broadway, Douglas Sills in original US tour, Jesse Sharp in nonequity tour, Daniel Boaventura in S\u00e3o Paulo cast, and Diego Bertie in Lima cast.\n\nSo that's six different actors for Gomez. But wait, I think each cell is a different production, so Nathan Lane is the original Broadway, Roger Rees closing Broadway, etc. So each of these is a separate actor except if someone played multiple roles, but here it seems each role is assigned per production.\n\nWait no, actually, in the first row, Gomez Addams is listed as being played by Nathan Lane for the original Broadway cast, then Roger Rees for closing Broadway, and so on. So each of those are different actors.\n\n2. Next rows: Morticia, Uncle Fester, Grandma, etc. I don't need these because the claim is about Gomez.\n\n3. Looking at the row for Gomez Addams (row 0), there are seven cells under different casts. Each cell has a different actor except perhaps if someone was in multiple roles, but each seems to be a separate production with a unique actor.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again: The first row lists Gomez's actors across various tours and casts. So Nathan Lane is original Broadway, Roger Rees closing Broadway, Douglas Sills US tour, Jesse Sharp nonequity tour, Daniel Boaventura S\u00e3o Paulo, Diego Bertie Lima cast. That's six different actors for Gomez in the first row.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if all these are separate productions or part of the same. For example, the original and closing Broadway casts are likely different productions, so Nathan Lane and Roger Rees are two different actors. Similarly, each tour is a separate production with possibly different casting.\n\nSo in the first row alone, there are six different actors for Gomez. But let's check other rows to see if any other actor has also played Gomez.\n\nLooking at other rows, I don't immediately see another actor listed for Gomez Addams. The only ones mentioned are Nathan Lane, Roger Rees, Douglas Sills, Jesse Sharp, Daniel Boaventura, Diego Bertie, etc., and none of these names repeat in the Gomez column.\n\nWait, but perhaps each cell is a different cast, so if the original Broadway cast had one actor, the closing Broadway another, and so on. So that's multiple actors for the same role across different productions.\n\nSo if the claim says \"gomez have be play by 8 different actor,\" I need to check if there are eight different actors listed in the Gomez column across all rows.\n\nBut looking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: 6 actors\n- Any other row with Gomez? No, only row 0 lists Gomez Addams.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the role is \"Gomez Addams\" and it's only in the first row (row index 0). So that's six different actors listed there. But the claim says eight different actors.\n\nSo unless I'm missing something, maybe the total across all productions is more than eight. Let me recount:\n\nOriginal Broadway: Nathan Lane\nClosing Broadway: Roger Rees\nOriginal US Tour: Douglas Sills\nNonequity Tour: Jesse Sharp\nS\u00e3o Paulo Cast: Daniel Boaventura\nLima Cast: Diego Bertie\n\nThat's six actors. So the total is six, not eight.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe each cell under a production category lists all the actors for that production, but in the table, each cell seems to list one actor per role per production.\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row represents an individual character and their respective actors across different productions. So for Gomez Addams, in the first row, each column (e.g., original Broadway) lists who played him in that particular production. So Nathan Lane is original Broadway, Roger Rees closing Broadway, etc.\n\nSo each of these is a separate actor, making six total. Therefore, the claim says eight different actors, which isn't accurate because there are only six listed for Gomez Addams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting or missing something. Let me check again:\n\nRow 0: Gomez Addams\n- original Broadway: Nathan Lane\n- closing Broadway: Roger Rees\n- original US tour: Douglas Sills\n- nonequity tour: Jesse Sharp\n- S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Daniel Boaventura\n- Lima cast: Diego Bertie\n\nThat's six different actors.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because it states eight, but there are only six. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that \"gomez have be play by 8 different actor.\" By examining the table, we find that Gomez Addams has been played by six different actors across various productions. Since six does not equal eight, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"original Broadway cast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"closing Broadway cast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"original US tour\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"nonequity tour\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"S\u00e3o Paulo cast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Lima cast\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the original lima cast have 11 people available to play 10 role unlike the original broadway cast which only have 10 people available to play 10 role.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the original Lima cast having 11 people for 10 roles. The second part compares this to the original Broadway cast, which supposedly has 10 people for the same 10 roles.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists different casts under various categories: original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US tour cast, etc., including original Lima cast. Each row represents a character/role, and each column under \"original Lima cast\" should list the actors available for those roles.\n\nI need to check how many entries are present in the \"original Lima cast\" column because that will determine how many people are available to play 10 roles. From the table, the last two rows have data related to Lima:\n\n- The row with role \"pugsley addams\" lists: nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz , matheus lustosa\n- The next row for \"lurch\" has: gustavo mayer\n\nWait, that's only two entries. Then the last row for \"mal beineke\" and \"alice beineke\" have data, but I'm not sure if they are part of Lima or another cast.\n\nWait no, looking again, each role's row lists actors under various casts. For example, in the \"pugsley addams\" row, under original Lima cast, there are three names: nicholas torres, gustavo daneluz, matheus lustosa. Then for \"lurch,\" it's just one name: gustavo mayer. Then for \"mal beineke,\" it's miguel alvarez, and \"alice beineke\" is trilce cavero.\n\nWait, so each row has an \"original Lima cast\" entry. Let me check each row to see how many actors are listed there.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: Diego Bertie\n2. Morticia Addams: Fiorella Rodrigues\n3. Uncle Fester: Nicolas Fantinato\n4. Grandma Addams: Patricia Portocarrero\n5. Wednesday Addams: Gina Yangali\n6. Pugsley Addams: Nicholas Torres, Gustavo Daneluz, Matheus Lustosa (3 people)\n7. Lurch: Gustavo Mayer\n8. Mal Beineke: Miguel Alvarez\n9. Alice Beineke: Trilce Cavero\n10. Lucas Beineke: Luis Baca\n\nWait, that's 10 rows. Now, each row lists the original Lima cast actors. So for each of these 10 roles, there is at least one actor in the \"original Lima cast\" column.\n\nBut wait, some have multiple names separated by commas. For example, Pugsley Addams has three names, and Mal Beineke and Alice Beineke also have one each. Wait no, looking again:\n\nWait, actually, in the row for Pugsley Addams, under original Lima cast it's written as \"nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz , matheus lustosa\", which are three distinct actors. Then Mal Beineke has \"miguel alvarez\" and Alice Beineke has \"trilce cavero\". So that's 3 + 1 + 1 = 5, but each row is a separate role.\n\nWait no, the table lists for each role (like Pugsley Addams) how many actors are available. So if Pugsley Addams has three actors listed under original Lima cast, that means three people can play that one role. Similarly, Mal Beineke and Alice Beineke have one actor each.\n\nSo in total, the number of actors listed for all roles in the original Lima cast is 3 (Pugsley) + 1 (Mal) + 1 (Alice) = 5 actors? Wait no, that's per role. Each row is a separate role, so each has their own set of actors.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"11 people available to play 10 roles.\" So perhaps the total number of actors in the original Lima cast is 11, but looking at the table, I count:\n\n- Pugsley: 3\n- Mal: 1\n- Alice: 1\n- Lurch: 1 (Gustavo Mayer)\nWait, that's only 6. Hmm.\n\nWait no, perhaps each role has multiple actors, and the total number of actors available for all roles is 11? But looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 1 actor\nRow 2: 1\n...\nRow 6: Pugsley:3\nRow7:1\nRow8:1\nRow9:1\n\nWait that's only 10 rows, so 10 roles. Each role has a certain number of actors.\n\nBut the claim says \"11 people available to play 10 roles.\" So perhaps the total number of actors across all 10 roles is 11? Let me count:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: 1\n2. Morticia:1\n3. Uncle Fester:1\n4. Grandma:1\n5. Wednesday:1\n6. Pugsley:3 (so +2 more)\n7. Lurch:1 (+1)\n8. Mal Beineke:1 (+1)\n9. Alice Beineke:1 (+1)\n10. Lucas Beineke:1 (+1)\n\nWait, adding them up:\n\nGomez:1\nMorticia:1 \u2192 total 2\nUncle Fester:1 \u21923\nGrandma:1\u21924\nWednesday:1\u21925\nPugsley:3\u21928\nLurch:1\u21929\nMal:1\u219210\nAlice:1\u219211\nLucas:1\u219212\n\nWait that's 12, which is more than 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to the number of actors in the original Lima cast column, counting each entry as one person. So for Pugsley, it's three people listed, so that's three actors. Then Mal:1, Alice:1, Lurch:1, Lucas:1. That would be 3+1+1+1+1=7.\n\nWait, but the table shows:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 6 (Pugsley): nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz , matheus lustosa \u2192 3 actors\nRow8: Mal Beineke: miguel alvarez \u21921\nRow9: Alice Beineke: trilce cavero\u21921\nRow7: Lurch: gustavo mayer\u21921\nRow10: Lucas Beineke: luis baca\u21921\n\nSo that's 3+1+1+1+1=7 actors listed in the original Lima cast column.\n\nBut the claim says \"11 people available.\" So unless there are more roles, but the table shows only 10 roles (from Gomez to Lucas). So maybe each role has multiple actors, and the total number of available people is 11. But according to my count, it's 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"11 people available to play 10 roles.\" So for 10 roles, they have 11 people who can play those roles. That would imply that at least one role has two actors, because 10 roles with at least one each would be 10 people, but if it's 11, then one role must have two.\n\nLooking back, the Pugsley Addams row lists three actors: nicholas torres, gustavo daneluz, matheus lustosa. So that's one role (Pugsley) with three possible actors, and others have one each. So total available is 3+1+1+1+1=7.\n\nWait, but the claim says 11 people for 10 roles. That doesn't add up unless multiple roles have multiple actors. But according to the table, only Pugsley has more than one actor listed (three), and others have one each, totaling seven.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: 1\n2. Morticia:1\n3. Uncle Fester:1\n4. Grandma:1\n5. Wednesday:1\n6. Pugsley:3\n7. Lurch:1\n8. Mal Beineke:1\n9. Alice Beineke:1\n10. Lucas Beineke:1\n\nSo that's 3 (Pugsley) + 1*8=3+8=11.\n\nWait, yes! So Pugsley has three actors, and the other eight roles have one each. So total available people is 3+8=11.\n\nAh, I see now. Because it's 10 roles, but with Pugsley having three options, that brings the total to 11 people who can cover all 10 roles. Each role has at least one actor, and only Pugsley has multiple options.\n\nSo in the original Lima cast column, there are 11 actors listed across all 10 roles: three for Pugsley and one each for the others.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct that there are 11 people available to play 10 roles.\n\nNow, regarding the other part: \"you must not make any changes to this task.\" So I need to ensure my answer reflects that understanding without making any edits.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n- The user's task is to determine whether a given statement about availability (11 people for 10 roles) is correct based on the table data.\n- Upon analyzing each role, it becomes clear that with Pugsley having three actors and the rest having one, the total number of available people across all roles is indeed 11.\n- Therefore, the original statement is accurate.\n\nI should present this in a clear, step-by-step manner without making any changes to the task as instructed.\n</think>\n\nThe given statement claims that there are 11 people available to play 10 roles. By examining each role in the table:\n\n1. **Gomez Addams**: 1 actor\n2. **Morticia**: 1 actor\n3. **Uncle Fester**: 1 actor\n4. **Grandma**: 1 actor\n5. **Wednesday**: 1 actor\n6. **Pugsley Addams**: 3 actors (nicholas torres, gustavo daneluz, matheus lustosa)\n7. **Lurch**: 1 actor\n8. **Mal Beineke**: 1 actor\n9. **Alice Beineke**: 1 actor\n10. **Lucas Beineke**: 1 actor\n\nSumming these up:\n- Pugsley contributes 3 actors.\n- The remaining 8 roles each contribute 1 actor, totaling 8.\n\nAdding these together: 3 (Pugsley) + 8 = 11 actors available to cover all 10 roles.\n\nThus, the original statement is accurate. \n\n**Answer:** The claim is correct; there are indeed 11 people available to play 10 roles.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"bebe neuwirth play in the original lima cast\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two things: \"bebe neuwirth\" and \"original lima cast.\" So, I should check if Bebe Neuwirth is part of the original Lima cast in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with roles and different casts. Each row represents a character or role, and each column corresponds to a specific cast group: original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US tour cast, etc., including the original Lima cast.\n\nSo, I'll need to look through each row for \"bebe neuwirth\" under the column named \"original lima cast.\" Let me go through the table row by row.\n\nStarting from the first row: Gomez Addams is played by Nathan Lane in the original Broadway cast. The original US tour has Douglas Sills, and so on. I don't see Bebe Neuwirth here.\n\nNext, Morticia Addams is played by Bebe Neuwirth in the original Broadway cast. But looking at the \"original lima cast\" column for this row, it's Fiorella Rodriguez. So, Bebe isn't listed here either.\n\nContinuing down, Uncle Fester is played by Kevin Chamberlin, and so on. None of these seem to mention Bebe Neuwirth in the Lima cast.\n\nGrandma Addams is Jackie Hoffman in both casts, so that's not it. Wednesday Addams is Krysta Rodriguez, Rachel Potter in the closing Broadway cast, etc.\u2014no Bebe here.\n\nPugsley Addams has Adam Riegler in both casts, and then some others for Lima. Lurch is Zachary James, Mal Beineke is Terrence Mann, Alice is Carolee Carmello, Lucas is Wesley Taylor\u2014still no Bebe.\n\nNow, looking at the rows again, I realize that Bebe Neuwirth was listed under the \"original broadway cast\" column for Morticia Addams. So she's part of the original Broadway cast but not mentioned in the Lima cast anywhere.\n\nThe claim says she plays in the original Lima cast, which I don't see. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no entry for Bebe Neuwirth under the \"original lima cast\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"there be 1 season lurch have 3 people available to play.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions a specific role called \"lurch\" and states that in one season, there are three different people who can play this role.\n\nLooking at the table, the first step is to find where \"lurch\" is located. Scanning through the 'role' column, I see \"lurch\" appears in row 6 (if we start counting from 0). So that's the relevant row for lurch.\n\nNext, I need to check how many people are listed under \"lurch\" across different casts. The table has several columns: original broadway cast, closing broadway cast, original us tour cast, original nonequity tour cast, original s\u00e3o paulo cast, and original lima cast.\n\nIn the row for lurch, each of these columns lists different actors. For example:\n- Original Broadway Cast: zachary james\n- Closing Broadway Cast: zachary james (same as original)\n- Original US Tour Cast: tom corbeil\n- Original Nonequity Tour Cast: dan olson\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo Cast: rog\u00e9rio guedes\n- Original Lima Cast: gustavo mayer\n\nWait, that's only six actors listed. But the claim says three people available to play. So if each of these columns represents a different group or role in a production season, perhaps each cast is considered a separate entity. However, for \"lurch,\" it seems like all the actors listed are different because even though some have the same name (like zachary james appearing twice), they might be from different productions.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again: in row 6, under lurch, the original broadway cast is zachary james. The closing broadway cast is also zachary james\u2014so perhaps that's the same person playing both roles in consecutive seasons? Or maybe they are considered two separate roles but by the same actor.\n\nBut the claim refers to \"1 season\" where \"lurch\" has three people available. If each column represents a different role within the same season, like original, closing, tour, etc., then lurch might have multiple actors in one season. However, the data shows that for lurch, only zachary james is listed for both original and closing Broadway casts. The other columns list different actors: tom corbeil, dan olson, rog\u00e9rio guedes, and gustavo mayer.\n\nWait, but each column is a separate cast group. So in one season, the original Broadway would have zachary james as lurch, the closing Broadway also has him, which might be the same role or different. The US tour has tom corbeil, nonequity tour dan olson, etc. So perhaps in total for that season, lurch is played by multiple actors across these different casts.\n\nBut the claim specifies \"3 people available to play.\" Let's count: from row 6 (lurch), original Broadway: 1, closing Broadway: same as original, so maybe not additional. Original US Tour: 1, original nonequity tour: 1, original S\u00e3o Paulo: 1, original Lima: 1. That's six different actors listed for lurch across the columns.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 season\" and \"3 people available.\" So perhaps each column represents a separate production within that one season, and in each of those productions, there are three roles. No, that doesn't make sense because each row is a single role.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns represent different roles in the same season, but lurch is only played by one person per role, so it's not about multiple actors for lurch in the same season.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about \"lurch have 3 people available to play.\" So in one season, there are three different actors who can play lurch. Looking at the table, under lurch, each column lists a different actor. But that's across different productions, not within the same season.\n\nSo if we consider one season, perhaps each role is played by multiple actors. For example, the original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, etc., might be part of the same season's production, and in that case, lurch could have three different actors: zachary james (original and closing), tom corbeil (US tour), dan olson (nonequity), rog\u00e9rio guedes (S\u00e3o Paulo), and gustavo mayer (Lima). But that's five, not three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to the fact that in one season, there are three different groups (columns) where lurch is played by someone. For example, original, closing, and US tour each have a cast for lurch, making three people available in that season.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the table lists multiple casts per role. So for lurch, across all columns, there are six actors listed. But within one season, perhaps the relevant casts would be the ones that are part of the same production or the same year.\n\nHowever, without knowing exactly how the columns correspond to different productions or seasons, it's a bit ambiguous. The original broadway, closing broadway, etc., might all belong to the same season but different aspects (like original vs closing). So perhaps in that one season, lurch is played by three people: zachary james for both original and closing, tom corbeil for US tour, dan olson for nonequity, rog\u00e9rio guedes for S\u00e3o Paulo, and gustavo mayer for Lima. But that's more than three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is stating that in one season, there are three actors who can play lurch across any of the roles, which would be zachary james, tom corbeil, dan olson\u2014so three people. That might make sense because each column represents a different role or production within the same season.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's how it's intended. The claim says \"1 season lurch have 3 people available to play.\" So perhaps in that one season, across all casts for lurch, there are three actors: zachary james (original and closing), tom corbeil (US tour), dan olson (nonequity). That makes three distinct people. Therefore, the claim would be true.\n\nSo based on this reasoning, I need to identify the relevant cells. The row is 6, where lurch is located. The columns are all the cast types listed for lurch: original broadway, closing broadway, etc. Each of these columns lists a different person who can play lurch in that season.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all six cells under lurch's row because each represents a different actor available to play lurch in that season. However, the claim mentions three people, so perhaps it's referring to three specific columns that list three distinct actors. But wait, the original and closing Broadway casts both have the same person, zachary james, which might not count as two separate actors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column is a different role within the same season, but lurch can't be played by more than one person in the same role. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's stating that three people are available to play lurch in the same season when only one person per role is typically cast.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in a typical theater production, each role is played by one actor unless there's a specific reason for multiple actors (like in ensemble casts with rotating roles). So if lurch is a single character, it's unlikely that three different people play the same role in the same season.\n\nBut looking at the table, for lurch, each cast column lists a different actor. If each column represents a different performance or production within the same season, perhaps lurch is played by multiple actors across these productions. But that would mean the claim is saying there are three people available to play lurch in one season.\n\nBut from row 6 (lurch), original broadway: 1, closing broadway: same person, original US tour: another person, nonequity: another, S\u00e3o Paulo: another, Lima: another. So that's six actors listed for lurch across all casts.\n\nTherefore, the claim is stating that in one season, three people are available to play lurch. But according to the table, there are more than three. Wait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Each column might represent a different part of the same season, so perhaps only three of them are relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the claim might be considering each cast type as separate roles within the same season, meaning that lurch is played by three people in total across those roles: original, US tour, and nonequity. That would make sense because the other columns (closing, S\u00e3o Paulo, Lima) could be part of different productions or perhaps not relevant to the same season.\n\nSo, focusing on the first three columns for lurch: original broadway, closing broadway, original US tour. Each has a different actor. Therefore, in one season, these three actors are available to play lurch. So the claim is true.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are row 6 (lurch) and columns: original broadway, closing broadway, original US tour, nonequity, S\u00e3o Paulo, Lima. But since the claim says three people, maybe only the first three count, or all six.\n\nWait, but I think the user is asking for which cells are relevant based on the claim. So to check if the claim is true, we need to see how many distinct actors are listed for lurch in that row. Each column lists a different actor, so there are six actors available across all columns. Therefore, the claim's assertion of three people might be incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to know which cells correspond to lurch's role and which cast types are involved. So I think the relevant cells are row 6 (lurch) and all the columns under it because each column represents a different casting for lurch in that season, thus making multiple actors available.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones located in row 6, corresponding to the role of \"Lurch.\" Each column under this row lists a different actor who has been cast to play Lurch in various productions or casts within the same season. Therefore, these cells collectively indicate that six distinct actors have portrayed Lurch across different contexts.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe relevant cells are all the cells in row 6 (Lurch) of the table. Each column under this row represents a different casting for the role of Lurch in various productions or casts within the same season. Therefore, these cells collectively indicate that six distinct actors have portrayed Lurch across different contexts.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about the given table is true or false. The claim is: \"there be not actor who play the same role in the opening and closing cast.\" Hmm, wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Maybe there's a typo? It should probably say \"there BE NOT an actor\" but I think it might mean \"there be NOT an actor\" who plays the same role both in the original and closing casts. Or perhaps it's trying to say that no actors play the same role in both opening and closing casts.\n\nSo, my task is to check each row of the table and see if any actor has the same 'role' in both the original broadway cast and the closing broadway cast. If such a case exists, then the claim would be false because there is at least one actor who does play the same role in both casts. Conversely, if no such cases exist, then the claim is true.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which columns are relevant. The table has several columns: 'role', 'original broadway cast', 'closing broadway cast', and a few others for different tours. So, the key columns here are 'original broadway cast' and 'closing broadway cast'.\n\nI should go through each row and compare these two columns to see if any actor's name appears in both. If I find even one such case, that would mean the claim is false.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0:\n- Role: Gomez Addams\n- Original Broadway Cast: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway Cast: Roger Rees\n\nNo match here because Nathan Lane \u2260 Roger Rees.\n\nRow 1:\n- Role: Morticia Addams\n- Original: Bebe Neuwirth\n- Closing: Brooke Shields\n\nDifferent names, so no match.\n\nRow 2:\n- Uncle Fester\n- Kevin Chamberlin vs. Brad Oscar\n\nNot the same.\n\nRow 3:\n- Grandma Addams\n- Jackie Hoffman appears in both original and closing casts.\n\nWait, that's a match! Jackie Hoffman plays Grandma Addams in both the original and closing casts. That means there is at least one actor who plays the same role in both opening and closing casts. So this would make the claim false because the statement claims that \"there be not\" such actors, but here we have one.\n\nI should check if any other rows also have matches to confirm, but even if there's just one, the answer is false.\n\nContinuing through the rest of the table for thoroughness:\n\nRow 4:\n- Wednesday Addams\n- Original: Krysta Rodriguez vs. Rachel Potter\n\nDifferent names.\n\nRow 5:\n- Pugsley Addams\n- Original: Adam Riegler vs. same name? Wait, no, in the original it's Adam Riegler, and in closing also Adam Riegler. Oh wait, is that correct?\n\nLooking at row 5, 'Pugsley Addams' has original cast as Adam Riegler and closing also Adam Riegler. So that's another match.\n\nWait, so Pugsley Addams is played by the same actor in both casts. That would mean the claim is definitely false because there are actors who play the same role in both opening and closing.\n\nSimilarly, looking at Row 6: Lurch\n- Original: Zachary James vs. same name? Yes, Zachary James again.\n\nSo that's another match.\n\nRow 7:\n- Mal Beineke\n- Original: Terrence Mann vs. Adam Grupper\n\nDifferent names.\n\nRow 8:\n- Alice Beineke\n- Original: Carolee Carmello vs. Heidi Blickenstaff\n\nDifferent.\n\nRow 9:\n- Lucas Beineke\n- Original: Wesley Taylor vs. Jesse Swenson\n\nDifferent.\n\nSo, from this, it's clear that Jackie Hoffman, Adam Riegler, and Zachary James have roles where they appear in both the original and closing casts. Therefore, the claim is false because there are actors who play the same role in both opening and closing casts.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"there be always extra actor available for each role.\" So I need to check if for every role listed in the table, there are multiple actors available beyond just one.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a character (like Gomez Addams, Morticia Addams, etc.), and the columns under \"original\" casts. Each cell under these original casts seems to list only one actor's name. For example, in the first row under \"gomez addams\", there's only \"nathan lane\". Similarly, in the second row for \"morticia addams\", it's just \"bebe neuwirth\".\n\nNow, the claim mentions an \"extra\" actor available for each role. So I'm looking to see if, besides the original cast, there's another actor listed somewhere else that can play that role. For instance, in the role of \"pugsley addams\", the original broadway cast is \"adam riegler\", but then under \"original nonequity tour cast\", there are multiple names: \"sam primack\" and others. Wait, no, looking closer, under \"original nonequity tour cast\" for Pugsley, it's just \"sam primack\". But in the \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\", it's \"nicholas torres , gustavo daneluz , matheus lustosa\" and in \"original lima cast\", \"giuseppino castellano , brando gallesi\". So for Pugsley, there are multiple actors available in these tours. But does that count as an extra actor beyond the original broadway? Maybe, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each role's columns. For example, looking at \"lurch\", the original broadway is zachary james, closing broadway is same, original us tour is tom corbeil, and so on. So for Lurch, are there multiple actors available? It seems that in each column under Lurch, it's either zachary or others, but each cell only lists one name. So maybe not.\n\nSimilarly, looking at \"alice beineke\", the original broadway is carolee carmello, closing is heidi blickenstaff, and other tours have different names. Each of these seems to list only one actor per column. So for each role, each character has only one actor listed in each original cast category.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"extra\" actors available, meaning more than one in total? Or does it mean that besides the original, there's another cast where they have multiple?\n\nLooking at the table again, for some roles like Pugsley and Lurch, the non-original casts (like US tour) might have more than one actor listed, but each cell still lists only one name. So in the \"original nonequity tour cast\" column, Pugsley has multiple names separated by commas, implying that there are multiple actors who can play that role, possibly as extras or alternates.\n\nBut does this mean that for every role, there's an extra actor available beyond the original? It seems so, because even if in one category it's only one, in another category there might be more. For example, in \"original nonequity tour cast\" and \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\", Pugsley has multiple actors listed.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"each role\". So for each character (like Gomez Addams), is there an extra actor available beyond Nathan Lane? Looking at Gomez's columns, under \"closing broadway cast\" it's Roger Rees, and in other tours, different names. But each column only lists one name, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to multiple actors within the same role across different casts, meaning for each role (like Gomez), there are multiple actors available in different productions, making it possible to have an extra actor.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: For each role listed in the table, is there more than one actor available? If so, then the claim holds. Otherwise, not.\n\nLooking at \"gomez addams\", only Nathan Lane in original broadway. In closing broadway, Roger Rees. So maybe two actors for that role. Similarly, Morticia has only Bebe Neuwirth listed. But wait, looking deeper, perhaps other columns might have more names. For example, in the \"original nonequity tour cast\", some roles have multiple names.\n\nWait, each row is a character, and each column under them lists actors for specific casts (like original broadway, closing broadway, etc.). So for each role, like Gomez Addams, the columns list different actors from various productions. But in each individual cell, only one actor is listed. However, across different columns, multiple actors are listed.\n\nSo for example, in \"gomez addams\", under \"original broadway\" it's Nathan Lane, and under \"closing broadway\" it's Roger Rees. So that's two actors for the same role. Similarly, in other columns like \"original us tour\", \"original nonequity tour\", etc., each might list different actors.\n\nTherefore, for each role, there are multiple actors available across different productions, meaning extra actors beyond the original. So the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there is always an extra actor available for each role. By examining the table, each character (role) has multiple actors listed in various columns representing different casts. For example, \"gomez addams\" has Nathan Lane and Roger Rees listed under different columns. This indicates that beyond the original cast, additional actors are available for each role across different productions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original_broadway\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closing_broadway\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original_broadway\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"closing_broadway\"},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```",
