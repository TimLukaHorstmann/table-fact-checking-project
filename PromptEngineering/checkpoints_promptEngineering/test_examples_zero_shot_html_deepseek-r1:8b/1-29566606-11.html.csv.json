    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts: \n1. The program is \"art attack.\"\n2. It was originally broadcast on CITV.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different program with details about their removal and return dates, original and new channels. \n\nI'll start by locating \"art attack\" in the 'programme' column. Scanning through the rows:\n- Row 0: celebrity big brother\n- Row 1: big brother\n- Row 2: absolutely fabulous\n- Row 3: art attack\n- So, it's in row 3.\n\nNext, I need to find out where \"art attack\" was originally broadcast. The 'original channel (s)' column has the information for each program. For row 3, the original channel is CITV.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that \"art attack\" was originally broadcast on CITV, which matches the table data.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or conflicting information in the table. So, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is true, I check the relevant cells in the table. \n\n1. **Programme**: art attack is found in row 3 of the 'programme' column.\n2. **Original Channel**: For row 3, the original channel is CITV.\n\nSince these details match the claim, it's verified as TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original channel (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and the claim. The table has several columns: programme name, original removal date(s), original channel, return date, and new channel. The claim specifically mentions \"big brother\" returning on a particular date. So my focus should be on finding the relevant information for this specific programme.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Programme is \"celebrity big brother.\" Not the same as \"big brother,\" so I can ignore this.\n2. **Row 1**: Programme is \"big brother.\" This matches the claim's subject, so it's relevant.\n3. **Row 2**: programme is \"absolutely fabulous\"\u2014not relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: \"art attack\"\u2014no match.\n5. **Row 4**: \"born to be different\"\u2014no.\n\nSo only Row 1 is relevant because it refers to the correct programme.\n\nNext, I'll check which columns are important for verifying the claim. The claim mentions the return date, so the relevant column is \"date of return.\" Also, sometimes the original removal date can affect the return, but in this case, since we're only concerned with the return date, maybe that's not necessary unless there's a specific rule about when shows return.\n\nWait, the claim says \"will return on september 9, 2011.\" So I need to see if the table supports that. Looking at Row 1 for \"big brother,\" under \"date of return\" it's \"9 september 2011.\"\n\nThat matches exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row's data.\n\nNow, I should consider whether there are any other columns or rows that might affect this conclusion. For instance, sometimes shows might have multiple return dates if they come back after being removed more than once. But in Row 1, \"big brother\" has a single return date of September 9, 2011, which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other row for \"big brother\"\u2014looking back, no, only Row 1 is for that programme. So no confusion there.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because it accurately reflects the \"date of return\" for \"big brother\" as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches exactly with the \"date of return\" for \"big brother\" in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011\" is true or false based on the given HTML table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has five columns: programme, date of original removal, original channel, date of return, and new channel. The rows correspond to different TV programmes, including \"born to be different.\"\n\nThe claim in question is about when \"born to be different\" returns. So, I should focus on the row corresponding to that programme.\n\nLooking at the table, the fourth row (since we start counting from 0) is for \"born to be different.\" In this row, under the column \"date of return,\" the date listed is \"9 june 2011.\" \n\nNow, let's analyze the claim. It states that the return date is August 18, 2011. Comparing this with the table data, June 9, 2011, is different from August 18, 2011. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the information in the table.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The \"original removal\" date for \"born to be different\" spans from 2004 to September 13, 2007, and then again to May 5, 2009. However, the key piece of information here is the \"date of return,\" which directly contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" with the relevant cells pointing to the row index and column name for \"born to be different\" and its date of return.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of return\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
