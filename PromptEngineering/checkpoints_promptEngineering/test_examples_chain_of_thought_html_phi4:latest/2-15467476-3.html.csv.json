According to the table, Caerau El\u00fd RFC lost 12 games.\n\n3. **Verify the 'Losing Bonus' Column:**\n   - Look at the value in the 'losing bonus' column for Caerau Ely RFC. The table indicates a losing bonus of 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions mentioned in the claim are met:\n- Caerau El\u00fd RFC indeed lost 12 games.\n- They were given a losing bonus of 4.\n\nThus, based on the information from the table, the claim is accurate.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are located in the row corresponding to \"Caerau Ely RFC\":\n- 'lost' column: The cell has the value 12.\n- 'losing bonus' column: The cell has the value 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row for Caerau El\u00fd RFC, checked the 'lost' column showing they lost 12 games, and verified that their 'losing bonus' is 4.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losing bonus\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The number of tries scored by Caerau Ely RFC.\n2. The total points for Caerau Ely RFC.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step using the data provided in the HTML table format:\n\n### Step 1: Locate Caerau Ely RFC Row\n- We need to find the row corresponding to \"caerau ely rfc\" within the table.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Number of Tries Scored\n- Identify the column labeled \"tries for,\" which contains data about the number of tries scored by each club.\n- Check the value in this column for the row where the club is \"caerau ely rfc.\"\n\n### Step 3: Verify Total Points\n- Identify the column labeled \"points,\" which shows the total points accumulated by each club.\n- Check the value in this column for the row where the club is \"caerau ely rfc.\"\n\n### Detailed Verification:\n1. **Locate Caerau Ely RFC Row:**\n   - The relevant data row for \"caerau ely rfc\" is found at the 8th position within the table body.\n\n2. **Check Tries Scored:**\n   - In this row, under the column \"tries for,\" we see that \"caerau ely rfc\" has scored 21 tries.\n   \n3. **Check Total Points:**\n   - Under the column \"points,\" it shows a total of 22 points for \"caerau ely rfc.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that \"caerau ely rfc score 21 try and have a point total of 22.\"\n- From our verification, both parts of this statement are correct according to the data from the table.\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the row for 'caerau ely rfc' in the table.\",\n    \"Check the number of tries scored by Caerau Ely RFC under the 'tries for' column.
