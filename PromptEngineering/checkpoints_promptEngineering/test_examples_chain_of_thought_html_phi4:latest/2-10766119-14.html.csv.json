This data will be found under the column labeled \"away team score.\"\n\n2. **Extract Scores for Away Teams**:\n   - For each row, extract the value from the \"away team score\" column.\n   - Convert these scores to a common numerical format if necessary (since they are in VFL/AFL scoring format: goals and behinds).\n\n3. **Convert Scores to Numerical Values**: \n   - The VFL scoring system uses \"goals\" (worth 6 points each) and \"behinds\" (worth 1 point each). Convert each score from the format X.Y (Z), where:\n     - X is the number of goals,\n     - Y is the number of behinds,\n     - Z is the total score in points.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Points for Each Away Team**:\n   - For St Kilda: 21.11 = 21 goals and 11 behinds, which converts to \\( (21 \\times 6) + 11 = 126 + 11 = 137 \\).\n   - Footscray: 8.9 = 8 goals and 9 behinds, which converts to \\( (8 \\times 6) + 9 = 48 + 9 = 57 \\).\n   - Geelong: 8.8 = 8 goals and 8 behinds, which converts to \\( (8 \\times 6) + 8 = 48 + 8 = 56 \\).\n   - Richmond: 10.13 = 10 goals and 13 behinds, which converts to \\( (10 \\times 6) + 13 = 60 + 13 = 73 \\).\n   - Hawthorn: 11.13 = 11 goals and 13 behinds, which converts to \\( (11 \\times 6) + 13 = 66 + 13 = 79 \\).\n   - Fitzroy: 11.13 = 11 goals and 13 behinds, which converts to \\( (11 \\times 6) + 13 = 66 + 13 = 79 \\).\n\n5. **Compare Scores**:\n   - Compare the numerical values calculated above.\n   - The highest score among these is St Kilda's 137 points.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since St Kilda has the highest converted score of 137 points, the claim that \"St Kilda have the highest score as an away team in the 1928 VFL season\" is true based on this table data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1, Column: \"away team score\"\n- Row 2, Column: \"away team score\"\n- Row 3, Column: \"away team score\"\n- Row 4, Column: \"away team score\"\n- Row 5, Column: \"away team score\"\n- Row 6, Column: \"away team score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column for 'away team score' to find relevant data.\",\n    \"Extract away team scores from each row and convert them into numerical values using VFL scoring system (goals x 6 + behinds).\",\n    \"Calculate total points: St Kilda = 137, Footscray = 57, Geelong = 56, Richmond = 73, Hawthorn = 79, Fitzroy = 79.\",\n    \"Compare these scores to find the highest score among away teams.\",\n    \"St Kilda has the highest score of 137 points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
