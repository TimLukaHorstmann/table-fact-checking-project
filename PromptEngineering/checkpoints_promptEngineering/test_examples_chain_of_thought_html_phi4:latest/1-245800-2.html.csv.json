We need to identify the correct next longest expedition after Salyut 6 - EO - 3.\n\n### Relevant Data from Table:\n\n- **Salyut 6 - EO - 4**: 184.84 days (Row 9)\n- **Salyut 6 - EO - 3**: 175.02 days (Row 17)\n- **Next Longest Expedition**:\n  - Salyut 6 - EO - 6: 74.73 days (Row 20)\n  - Salyut 6 - EO - 1: 92.93 days (Row 2)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim correctly identifies the longest expedition as Salyut 6 - EO - 4 with 184.84 days.\n- It also correctly identifies Salyut 6 - EO - 3 as the next longest at 175.02 days.\n- However, it incorrectly refers to an expedition duration of \"6 5.96 day\" which seems to be a typographical error and does not match any expedition.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim correctly identifies Salyut 6 - EO - 4 as the longest at 184.84 days, followed by Salyut 6 - EO - 3 at 175.02 days.
