This suggests he would be associated with the Iowa team.\n\n2. **Redshirt Status**:\n   - The claim states \"when the completion have a status of redshirt.\"\n     - In the table, under the year 2008, all columns (attempts, completions, completion %, and yards) are marked as \"redshirt\" for the Iowa team.\n     - A redshirt year is when a college athlete spends a year practicing with the team without competing in official games, often to extend their period of eligibility.\n\n3. **Linking Jake Vandenberg**:\n   - Jake Vandenberg was known to have taken a redshirt year during his time at Iowa.\n   - The table shows that in 2008, all performance metrics for Iowa are listed as \"redshirt,\" which aligns with the concept of a redshirt year.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is essentially stating that Jake Vandenberg (referred to as \"jam vanderberg\") was part of the Iowa team during his redshirt year.\n   - This matches the information in the table for 2008, where all metrics are labeled as \"redshirt.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim involves a player named 'jam vanderberg' belonging to the Iowa team during a redshirt year.\",\n    \"Historically, Jake Vandenberg was a quarterback for the University of Iowa and took a redshirt year in 2008.\",\n    \"In the table, the 2008 row for the Iowa team lists all metrics as 'redshirt,' indicating a redshirt year.\",\n    \"This aligns with Jake Vandenberg's redshirt status at Iowa during that time.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"completions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"completion %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
