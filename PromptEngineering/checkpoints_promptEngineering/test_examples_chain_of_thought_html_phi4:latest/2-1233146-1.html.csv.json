    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003, we need to assess whether both the first and second rounds were tied in the first leg for the matches involving FC Slovan Liberec.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**:  \n   We are specifically interested in two rows from the table related to the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003:\n   - The match against \"fc slovan liberec\" (second round).\n   - The match against \"FC Slovan Liberec\" which is listed in the second round.\n\n2. **Verify Round and Result**:\n   - For the first relevant row, check if it was a first or second leg.\n     - The row indicates: `2003 | uefa intertoto cup | second round | fc slovan liberec | 0 - 2`.\n   - This result shows FC Slovan Liberec won with a score of 2-0, meaning the first leg was not tied.\n\n3. **Check Previous Round**:\n   - For the previous round (first round), we have: `2003 | uefa intertoto cup | second round | fc slovan liberec | 0 - 2`.\n   - To find the result of the first round, look at: \n     - The row indicates: `2003 | uefa intertoto cup | second round | fc slovan liberec | 0 - 2`.\n     - There's a preceding match against \"FC Slovan Liberec\" in the table:\n       - `2003 | uefa intertoto cup | first round | FC Slovan Liberec | 1 - 0`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The first round result of 1-0 against FC Slovan Liberec was not tied.\n   - The second round match resulted in a loss (0-2), also not a tie.\n\nThus, neither the first nor the second rounds were tied in the first leg for these matches.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is that both the first and second rounds of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003 were tied in the first leg. Checking the table, the first round against FC Slovan Liberec was a 1-0 result, which is not a tie. The second round resulted in a 0-2 loss to FC Slovan Liberec, also not a tie.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Celtic and Omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1\" is true or false, we need to carefully examine each relevant entry in the provided data. Specifically, we are looking for any matches involving Celtic and Omonia that resulted in a scoreline of 0 - 1.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - We will focus on entries where Celtic and Omonia appear as opponents.\n   \n2. **Check Match Scores:**\n   - For each match involving Celtic or Omonia, we need to check if the scoreline was 0 - 1.\n\n3. **Review Data Entries:**\n\n   - **Entry Involving Celtic:**\n     - Year/Season: \"2010 - 11\"\n     - Tournament: \"uefa europa league\"\n     - Round: \"third qualifying round\"\n     - Opponent: \"juventus fc\"\n     - Result: \"0 - 1\"\n\n     This entry does not involve Celtic as the opponent, but rather Juventus FC.
