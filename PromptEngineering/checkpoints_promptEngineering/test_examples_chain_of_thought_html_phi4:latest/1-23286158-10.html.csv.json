We will check each row of the table for the team name to see if it matches \"portland\" or a derivative thereof (e.g., mentioning an opposing team, as is typical in NBA records).\n\n2. **Count the Number of Wins**:\n   - Look at each game's result column (\"score\") to identify which games were wins and which were losses for the Trail Blazers.\n   - A win is indicated by \"w\", while a loss is indicated by \"l\".\n\n3. **List of Games from April 1-15, 2010**: \n   - The table lists five games with dates:\n     - April 3\n     - April 7\n     - April 9\n     - April 11\n     - April 12\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Game**:\n   - **Game 77 (April 3)**: Opponent is Sacramento. Result is \"w 98 - 87 (ot)\" indicating a win.\n   - **Game 78 (April 7)**: Opponent is LA Clippers. Result is \"w 93 - 85 (ot)\" indicating a win.\n   - **Game 79 (April 9)**: Opponent is Dallas. Result is \"l 77 - 83 (ot)\" indicating a loss.\n   - **Game 80 (April 11)**: Opponent is LA Lakers. Result is \"w 91 - 88 (ot)\" indicating a win.\n   - **Game 81 (April 12)**: Opponent is Oklahoma City. Result is \"w 103 - 95 (ot)\" indicating a win.\n\n5. **Total Wins and Losses**:\n   - From the games listed, the Trail Blazers won four games (Games 77, 78, 80, 81) and lost one game (Game 79).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim states that they \"win 4 out of their 5 games in the first half of April 2010.\" Based on our analysis, this is accurate.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Game 77: Date = \"april 3\", Team = \"sacramento\", Score = \"w 98 - 87 (ot)\"\n- Game 78: Date = \"april 7\", Team = \"la clippers\", Score = \"w 93 - 85 (ot)\"\n- Game 79: Date = \"april 9\", Team = \"dallas\", Score = \"l 77 - 83 (ot)\"\n- Game 80: Date = \"april 11\", Team = \"la lakers\", Score = \"w 91 - 88 (ot)\"\n- Game 81: Date = \"april 12\", Team = \"oklahoma city\", Score = \"w 103 - 95 (ot)\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The Portland Trail Blazers played five games from April 3 to April 12, 2010.
