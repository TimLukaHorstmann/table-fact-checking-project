    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"hawthorn have the highest score of the away team in the season\" is true or false, we need to examine the 'away team' scores from each game listed in the table. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** \n   - We are interested in the \"away team score\" column because it contains the scores of away teams for all matches.\n\n2. **Extract Away Team Scores:**\n   - For each row in the table, extract the 'away team' and their corresponding 'away team score':\n     - Row 1: Footscray with a score of 6.14 (50)\n     - Row 2: Melbourne with a score of 10.16 (76)\n     - Row 3: Hawthorn with a score of 10.14 (74)\n     - Row 4: Geelong with a score of 14.16 (100)\n     - Row 5: Collingwood with a score of 15.11 (101)\n     - Row 6: Fitzroy with a score of 9.11 (65)\n\n3. **Convert Scores to Comparable Format:**\n   - Convert the scores from \"x.y\" format into total points:\n     - Footscray: \\(6 \\times 6 + 14 = 50\\)\n     - Melbourne: \\(10 \\times 6 + 16 = 76\\)\n     - Hawthorn: \\(10 \\times 6 + 14 = 74\\)\n     - Geelong: \\(14 \\times 6 + 16 = 100\\)\n     - Collingwood: \\(15 \\times 6 + 11 = 101\\)\n     - Fitzroy: \\(9 \\times 6 + 11 = 65\\)\n\n4. **Compare Scores to Find the Highest:**\n   - List the scores for comparison:\n     - Footscray: 50\n     - Melbourne: 76\n     - Hawthorn: 74\n     - Geelong: 100\n     - Collingwood: 101\n     - Fitzroy: 65\n\n5. **Determine the Highest Score:**\n   - The highest score among these is Collingwood with 101 points.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since Hawthorn's score of 74 is not the highest, the claim that \"hawthorn have the highest score of the away team in the season\" is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'away team score' column was examined to determine which team had the highest points.
