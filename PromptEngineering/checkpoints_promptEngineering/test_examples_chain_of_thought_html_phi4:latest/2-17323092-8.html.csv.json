These rows are 61 through 73 based on the 'date' column.\n\n2. **Extract High Points Data:**\n   - For each game in March, extract the player(s) and their corresponding high points from the \"high points\" column:\n     - Row 61: Chris Bosh (28)\n     - Row 62: Andrea Bargnani, Chris Bosh (25)\n     - Row 63: Chris Bosh (34)\n     - Row 64: Chris Bosh (30)\n     - Row 65: Andrea Bargnani (21)\n     - Row 66: Chris Bosh (27)\n     - Row 67: Andrea Bargnani (27)\n     - Row 68: Chris Bosh (18)\n     - Row 69: Chris Bosh (35)\n     - Row 70: Chris Bosh (16)\n     - Row 71: Andrea Bargnani (23)\n     - Row 72: Chris Bosh (21)\n     - Row 73: Chris Bosh (31)\n\n3. **Calculate Total High Points for Each Player in March:**\n   - **Chris Bosh:** \n     - Total = 28 + 25 + 34 + 30 + 27 + 18 + 35 + 16 + 21 + 31 = 265\n   - **Andrea Bargnani:**\n     - Total = 25 (from Row 62) + 21 (Row 65) + 27 (Row 67) + 23 (Row 71) = 96\n\n4. **Determine the Player with the Most High Points:**\n   - Chris Bosh has a total of 265 points.\n   - Andrea Bargnani has a total of 96 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are only two players mentioned in terms of high points for March, and Chris Bosh has more than Andrea Bargnani, Chris Bosh does not have the second most high points; he has the most.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all games played in March.
