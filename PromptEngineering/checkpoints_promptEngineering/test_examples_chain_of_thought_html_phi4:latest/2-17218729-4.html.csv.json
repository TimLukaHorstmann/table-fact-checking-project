    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if Pittsburgh played Montreal after December 19, accumulated more than 24 points post-December 19, and had an attendance of 14,995 at one of these games. Let's break down each part:\n\n1. **Check for a Game between Pittsburgh and Montreal After December 19:**\n   - Review the \"date\" column to identify any game involving Montreal as the visitor or host after December 19.\n   - Locate the row where the date is December 25 with Montreal listed as the visitor and Pittsburgh as the home team.\n\n2. **Verify Points Accumulation Post-December 19:**\n   - Identify games played by Pittsburgh after December 19 and determine if they won (home score > visitor score) or tied (3 points awarded for a tie).\n   - From December 25 to December 31, check each game:\n     - December 25: Pittsburgh vs. Montreal; score 2-4. Pittsburgh lost, no points added.\n     - December 26: Pittsburgh vs. Philadelphia; score 1-6. Pittsburgh lost, no points added.\n     - December 28: Toronto vs. Pittsburgh; score 4-2. Pittsburgh lost, no points added.\n     - December 31: Buffalo vs. Pittsburgh; score 3-3. Pittsburgh tied, gained 3 points.\n\n   - Before December 19, Pittsburgh had 25 points (on December 19). After the December 31 game, they had 28 points. Thus, they gained 3 more points after December 19.\n\n3. **Check for an Attendance of 14,995:**\n   - Review the \"attendance\" column to see if there was a game with exactly 14,995 attendees.\n   - There are two entries with attendance 14,995:\n     - December 5: Pittsburgh vs. Boston (as visitor).\n     - December 19: Pittsburgh vs. Boston (as home team).\n\nSince the conditions specify that the attendance should be for the game against Montreal after December 19, and there is no such match with 14,995 attendees, this part of the claim does not hold.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is false because while Pittsburgh played Montreal after December 19 and accumulated more than 24 points afterward, there was no game against Montreal with an attendance of 14,995.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
