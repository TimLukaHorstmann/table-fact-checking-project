The table lists various districts and their incumbents.\n\n2. **Locate Norman Sisisky**:\n   - In the third row, under the column \"incumbent\", we have \"Norman Sisisky\".\n   \n3. **Check the Year of First Election**:\n   - For this same row (third), in the \"first elected\" column, it states \"1982\". This confirms that Norman Sisisky was first elected in 1982.\n\n4. **Verify Re-election Status**:\n   - In the \"results\" column for the same row, it says \"re-elected\".\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"in 1982, Norman Sissiky be re-elected\". \n   - From our analysis, Norman Sisisky was first elected in 1982 and was indeed re-elected (as indicated by \"re-elected\" in the results column).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is consistent with the information provided in the table.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Norman Sisisky was re-elected in 1982.
