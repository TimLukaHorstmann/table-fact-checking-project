For example, \"11.23 (89)\" means 11 goals and 23 behinds, converting to a total of 89 points.\n3. **Focus on Goals**: The claim is specifically about the number of goals scored by home teams, which are the numbers before the dot.\n4. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Geelong's score is \"11.23 (89)\", which means 11 goals.\n   - **Row 2**: Fitzroy's score is \"16.12 (108)\", indicating 16 goals.\n   - **Row 3**: St Kilda's score is \"14.12 (96)\", indicating 14 goals.\n   - **Row 4**: Richmond's score is \"15.14 (104)\", indicating 15 goals.\n   - **Row 5**: Footscray's score is \"13.9 (87)\", indicating 13 goals.\n   - **Row 6**: North Melbourne's score is \"11.5 (71)\", which means 11 goals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Rows 2, 3, 4, and 5 have home teams scoring more than 11 goals (16, 14, 15, and 13 respectively).\n   - Therefore, the claim that no home team scored more than 11 is FALSE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 2: \"home team score\" column with value \"16.12 (108)\"\n   - Row 3: \"home team score\" column with value \"14.12 (96)\"\n   - Row 4: \"home team score\" column with value \"15.14 (104)\"\n   - Row 5: \"home team score\" column with value \"13.9 (87)\"\n\nThe JSON output is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'home team score' column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 2 teams (hawthorn and south melbourne) scored more than 10 goals\" is true or false, we need to analyze each row of the table, focusing on the 'home team score' and 'away team score'. The scores are presented in a format where the first number before the period represents the goals. We will check if hawthorn and south melbourne are indeed the only teams that scored more than 10 goals.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Row 1:**\n   - Home Team (Geelong): Scored 11.23, which means they scored 11 goals.\n   - Away Team (Hawthorn): Scored 6.13, which means they scored 6 goals.\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - Home Team (Fitzroy): Scored 16.12, which means they scored 16 goals.\n   - Away Team (South Melbourne): Scored 8.8, which means they scored 8 goals.\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - Home Team (St Kilda): Scored 14.12, which means they scored 14 goals.\n   - Away Team (Melbourne): Scored 16.16, which means they scored 16 goals.\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - Home Team (Richmond): Scored 15.14, which means they scored 15 goals.\n   - Away Team (Essendon): Scored 15.9, which means they scored 15 goals.\n\n5. **Row 5:**\n   - Home Team (Footscray): Scored 13.9, which means they scored 13 goals.\n   - Away Team (Collingwood): Scored 10.5, which means they scored 10 goals.\n\n6. **Row 6:**\n   - Home Team (North Melbourne): Scored 11.5, which means they scored 11 goals.\n   - Away Team (Carlton): Scored 16.25, which means they scored 16 goals.\n\nNext, let's identify the teams that scored more than 10 goals:\n- Geelong (Row 1) scored 11 goals.\n- Hawthorn (Row 1) scored 6 goals.\n- Fitzroy (Row 2) scored 16 goals.\n- South Melbourne (Row 2) scored 8 goals.\n- St Kilda (Row 3) scored 14 goals.\n- Melbourne (Row 3) scored 16 goals.\n- Richmond (Row 4) scored 15 goals.\n- Essendon (Row 4) scored 15 goals.\n- Footscray (Row 5) scored 13 goals.\n- Collingwood (Row 5) scored 10 goals.\n- North Melbourne (Row 6) scored 11 goals.\n- Carlton (Row 6) scored 16 goals.\n\nTeams that scored more than 10 goals:\n- Geelong (11)\n- Fitzroy (16)\n- St Kilda (14)\n- Melbourne (16)\n- Richmond (15)\n- Essendon (15)\n- Footscray (13)\n- North Melbourne (11)\n- Carlton (16)\n\nFrom this analysis, it's clear that hawthorn and south melbourne are not the only teams to score more than 10 goals.
