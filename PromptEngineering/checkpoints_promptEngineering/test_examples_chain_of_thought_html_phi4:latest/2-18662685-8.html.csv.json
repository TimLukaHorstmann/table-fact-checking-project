    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two specific aspects:\n\n1. The rower ranked sixth should be from South Korea.\n2. The notes for this row should indicate \"sc / d\".\n\nLet's go through these steps one by one using the provided table.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Rower Ranked Sixth\n- Look at the column labeled \"rank\" and find the row with rank value of 6.\n  \nFrom the table:\n```html\n<tr>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>jang kang - eun , kim hong - kyun</td>\n    <td>south korea</td>\n    <td>7:12.17</td>\n    <td>sc / d</td>\n</tr>\n```\n- The rower ranked sixth is \"jang kang-eun, kim hong-kyun\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Country\n- Check the column labeled \"country\" for the same row (rank = 6).\n\nFrom the table:\n```html\n<td>south korea</td>\n```\n- The country associated with this rank is South Korea.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Notes\n- Look at the column labeled \"notes\" in the same row (rank = 6).\n\nFrom the table:\n```html\n<td>sc / d</td>\n```\n- The notes for this rank are indeed \"sc / d\".\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n1. Row index: 6, Column name: \"rank\"\n2. Row index: 6, Column name: \"country\"\n3. Row index: 6, Column name: \"notes\"\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The rower ranked sixth is identified as 'jang kang-eun, kim hong-kyun' from South Korea with notes 'sc / d'.
