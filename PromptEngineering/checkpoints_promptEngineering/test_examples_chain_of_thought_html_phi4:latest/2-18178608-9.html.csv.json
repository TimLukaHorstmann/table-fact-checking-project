However, it does not specify England as the opponent; thus, we cannot conclude from this row alone that England played against Scotland.\n\n3. **Check Matches Against Ireland:**\n   - The table has two entries for matches against \"Ireland\":\n     - First entry:\n       - Date: 19 / 03 / 1988\n       - Venue: Twickenham, London\n       - Status: Five Nations\n     - Second entry:\n       - Date: 23 / 04 / 1988 (This is in April, not March)\n   - The first match against Ireland occurred on 19th March 1988 at Twickenham.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all of the test match England compete in with Australia be hold in Twickenham, London\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Test Matches Involving Australia:**\n   - We are specifically looking for matches labeled as \"test match\" involving the team \"australia\".\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Rows:**\n   - From the table, we identify rows where the 'opposing teams' column is \"australia\" and the 'status' column indicates a \"test match\".\n\n3. **Check Venue for Each Identified Test Match:**\n   - We need to verify the venue for each identified test match involving Australia.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against Extracted Data:**\n   - The claim states that all such matches are held at \"Twickenham, London\". Therefore, we must ensure that all venues listed for these matches are indeed Twickenham, London.\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Opposing Team: Australia\n  - Status: First test\n  - Venue: Ballymore, Brisbane\n  - This match does not meet the criteria as it is held in Brisbane, not at Twickenham.\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Opposing Team: Australia\n  - Status: Second test\n  - Venue: Concord Oval, Sydney\n  - This match does not meet the criteria as it is held in Sydney, not at Twickenham.\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Opposing Team: Australia\n  - Status: Test match\n  - Venue: Twickenham, London\n  - This match meets the criteria as it is held at Twickenham.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that not all test matches with Australia are held in Twickenham, London.
