Here's how we can approach it:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table has a series of dates listed sequentially.\n   - Each row represents a game played by the team, with columns for `Date`, `Opponent`, and other details like scores.\n\n2. **List the Opponents Sequentially**:\n   - We will extract the opponent names in order from each row to track if any opponent appears on consecutive days.\n\n3. **Check for Consecutive Repetitions**:\n   - As we list the opponents, we need to compare each opponent with the one listed immediately after it.\n   - If an opponent appears twice consecutively, this would mean the team plays against the same opponent on two different dates in a row, disproving the claim.\n\n4. **Review Dates and Opponents**:\n   - Here are the opponents from the table by date:\n\n     1. September 20: `Braves`\n     2. September 21: `Mets`\n     3. September 22: `Phillies`\n     4. September 23: `Pirates`\n     5. September 24: `Pirates`\n     6. September 25: `Expos`\n     7. September 26: `Expos`\n     8. September 27: `Expos`\n\n   - From this list, we can observe that:\n     - The team plays against the `Pirates` on both September 23 and 24.\n     - The team plays against the `Expos` on September 25, 26, and 27.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are instances where the same opponent appears consecutively (i.e., Pirates on Sept 23 and 24, Expos on Sept 25-27), the claim that \"the team plays against distinct opponents every day\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that the statement is false.
