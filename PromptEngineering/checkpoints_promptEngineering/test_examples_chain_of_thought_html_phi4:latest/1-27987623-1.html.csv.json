We need to verify if there are indeed 21 episodes and who directed them.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Episode**: Go through each row in the table, focusing on the 'Directed by' column to determine which director was responsible for each episode.\n\n3. **Count Episodes Directed by Michael McDonald**:\n   - Look for entries where \"Michael Mcdonald\" is listed as the director.\n   - Count these instances and see if they add up to 21 episodes.\n\n4. **Check for Other Directors**:\n   - Identify any episodes directed by someone other than Michael McDonald.\n   - If there are any, then he did not direct the entire season.\n\n5. **Verification**: Ensure all rows from episode 1 through 21 (or however many exist) are accounted for in terms of directorship.\n\n**Detailed Examination:**\n\n- Episodes 1 to 6: Directed by various directors including John Stephens, Bill Lawrence, and John T.
