By scanning through this column, we find an entry for \"october 9\" (note: the text is in lowercase).\n\n3. **Extract Information from Relevant Row**:\n   - Once the row corresponding to \"October 9\" is identified, we need to look at two specific columns: `event` and `series leader`.\n   - The event on this date is listed as \"paris - bourges\".\n   - Most importantly for our claim, we check who is listed in the column labeled `series leader`.\n\n4. **Check Series Leader**:\n   - According to the table, the `series leader` on October 9 is J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pineau (fra).\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pineau be the series leader\" on October 9.\n   - Based on our extracted data, this statement matches exactly with what's listed in the table.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pineau is indeed listed as the series leader on October 9, the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row with date 'october 9'.
