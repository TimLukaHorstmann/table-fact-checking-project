We compare this against the extracted result from the table.\n\n5. **Determine Truth Value of the Claim:**\n   - If the result in the table matches \"1 - 0\", then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- The row with \"date\" as \"17 december 2002\" corresponds to:\n  - `round`: round 5\n  - `opponents`: chelsea\n  - `result f - a`: 1 - 0 (matches the claim)\n  - `attendance`: 57985\n\nThe result from the table for December 17, 2002, is indeed \"1 - 0\", which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.
