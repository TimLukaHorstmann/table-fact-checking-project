    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two aspects: the original air date for season 7's episode number 17 and whether it was directed by John Stephen.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Season 7 Information**:\n   - The table provides data across multiple seasons. We need to focus on episodes listed as part of \"Season 7\".\n   \n2. **Locate Episode Number 17 in Season 7**:\n   - From the table, episode number 17 is row index 60 with the title \"inglourious bassterds\". This confirms it belongs to season 7.\n\n3. **Check Original Air Date for Episode 17 (Season 7)**:\n   - According to the data in row index 60, the original air date for this episode is April 5, 2010.\n   - The claim states that the air date should be October 26, 2009, which does not match the actual date of April 5, 2010.\n\n4. **Verify Director for Episode 17 (Season 7)**:\n   - In row index 60, it is stated that the director for episode 17 is Joe Lazarov.\n   - The claim states that the episode should be directed by John Stephen, which does not match with Joe Lazarov being the actual director.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Air Date Mismatch**: The claimed air date (October 26, 2009) is incorrect.
