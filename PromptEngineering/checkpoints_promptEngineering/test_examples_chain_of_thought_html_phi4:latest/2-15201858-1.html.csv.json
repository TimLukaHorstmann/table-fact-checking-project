    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we will break down each part of the claim and verify it against the data provided in the HTML table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Players Mentioned:**\n   - The claim mentions three players: Hilee Taylor, Geoff Schwartz, and Mackenzy Bernadeau.\n   \n2. **Verify Round Information for Each Player:**\n\n   - **Hilee Taylor**:\n     - Look through the table to find \"hilee taylor\".\n     - From the 7th row in the table, we see that Hilee Taylor was picked in round 7 (column 'round' value is 7).\n   \n   - **Geoff Schwartz**:\n     - Look through the table to find \"geoff schwartz\".\n     - From the 8th row in the table, we see that Geoff Schwartz was also picked in round 7 (column 'round' value is 7).\n   \n   - **Mackenzy Bernadeau**:\n     - Look through the table to find \"mackenzy bernadeau\".\n     - From the 9th row in the table, we see that Mackenzy Bernadeau was picked in round 7 (column 'round' value is 7).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n\n   - The claim states that both Hilee Taylor and Geoff Schwartz are \"1st round draft pick\". However, according to the data:\n     - Both were drafted in round 7.\n   \n   - The claim further states Mackenzy Bernadeau is a \"6th round draft pick\". According to the data:\n     - He was actually picked in round 7.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Hilee Taylor and Geoff Schwartz are not first-round picks, and Mackenzy Bernadeau is not a sixth-round pick. Both Hilee Taylor and Geoff Schwartz were seventh-round picks, and Mackenzy Bernadeau was also a seventh-round pick.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Hilee Taylor**: Row 7 (Round: 7)\n- **Geoff Schwartz**: Row 8 (Round: 7)\n- **Mackenzy Bernadeau**: Row 9 (Round: 7)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Hilee Taylor and Geoff Schwartz are first-round picks, while Mackenzy Bernadeau is a sixth-round pick.
