On April 10, Nashville was the visitor against Detroit with an attendance of 20,066.\n     2. On April 12, again with Nashville as the visitor, the attendance remained 20,066.\n\n2. **Verification for April 10:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"april 10.\"\n   - Check the \"visitor\" column to confirm it lists \"nashville.\"\n   - Check the \"home\" column to confirm it lists \"detroit,\" indicating Nashville was indeed the visitor.\n   - Verify the \"attendance\" column shows the value as \"20066.\"\n\n3. **Verification for April 12:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"april 12.\"\n   - Confirm that the \"visitor\" column again lists \"nashville.\"\n   - Ensure the \"home\" column lists \"detroit,\" reaffirming Nashville was the visitor.\n   - Verify that the \"attendance\" column shows the same value as before, \"20066.\"\n\n### Verification Results\n\n- **April 10:**\n  - Visitor: Nashville\n  - Home: Detroit\n  - Attendance: 20,066\n  \n  This matches the claim.\n\n- **April 12:**\n  - Visitor: Nashville\n  - Home: Detroit\n  - Attendance: 20,066\n  \n  This also matches the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe information in the table confirms that on both April 10 and April 12, Nashville was the visitor against Detroit with an attendance of 20,066.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the data provided in the table regarding which team had the \"decision\" when they were playing at home or away.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"isaac have the decision in every game when detroit be home or nashville be home.\"\n   - This implies that for all games listed, Isaac Ellis (as mentioned by name) is recorded as having made the decision.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Game Entry:**\n   - We will review each row in the table to verify if Isaac Ellis is indeed listed under the \"decision\" column for both home and away games of Detroit and Nashville.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row:**\n\n   - **Row 1 (April 10):**\n     - Visitor: Nashville\n     - Home: Detroit\n     - Decision: Ellis\n     - This matches our requirement as Detroit is home, and Ellis is the decision-maker.\n   \n   - **Row 2 (April 12):**\n     - Visitor: Nashville\n     - Home: Detroit\n     - Decision: Ellis\n     - Again, Ellis is the decision-maker when Detroit is at home.\n\n   - **Row 3 (April 14):**\n     - Visitor: Detroit\n     - Home: Nashville\n     - Decision: Ellis\n     - Here, Nashville is at home, and Ellis is listed as the decision-maker.\n   \n   - **Row 4 (April 16):**\n     - Visitor: Detroit\n     - Home: Nashville\n     - Decision: Ellis\n     - Once more, with Nashville hosting, Ellis has the decision.\n\n   - **Row 5 (April 18):**\n     - Visitor: Detroit\n     - Home: Nashville\n     - Decision: Ellis\n     - With Nashville at home, Ellis is again the decision-maker.\n   \n   - **Row 6 (April 20):**\n     - Visitor: Nashville\n     - Home: Detroit\n     - Decision: Ellis\n     - Finally, with Detroit hosting, Ellis holds the decision.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - In each game listed in the table, regardless of whether Detroit or Nashville is playing at home, Isaac Ellis is consistently recorded as having the decision.\n   - Therefore, the claim is verified to be true based on the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells are all those under the \"decision\" column for every row in the table.
