    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Rene Lambert is true, we need to verify two aspects from the table: his position and his draft pick number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Rene Lambert's Entry**:\n   - The player in question is \"Rene Lambert\".\n   - We scan through each row of the table until we find a row where the \"player\" column matches \"rene lambert\".\n\n2. **Check Player Position**:\n   - Once we locate the correct row for Rene Lambert, check the value in the \"position\" column.\n   - The claim states that his position is \"right wing\".\n   \n3. **Verify Draft Pick Number**:\n   - In the same row where Rene Lambert's name appears, look at the \"pick\" column to confirm if he was drafted with the 146th pick.\n   - The claim mentions a draft pick number of 146.\n\n4. **Cross-Verification with Table Data**:\n   - Identify which cells correspond to these specific pieces of information (position and pick).\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n\n- From the table, we find Rene Lambert in row index 2 (since indices start at 0):\n  - **Position**: \"right wing\"\n  - **Pick Number**: 146\n\nBoth conditions stated in the claim (\"play right wing\" and \"be draft with the 146th pick\") match the data found in these cells.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The position matches: Rene Lambert is listed as a \"right wing\".\n- The draft number matches: He was drafted with the 146th pick.\n- Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the table data provided.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate Rene Lambert's entry in the table by matching the player name. \\n2. Verify that his position is 'right wing' as stated in the claim. \\n3.

The relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- Position: Row index 2, column \"position\"\n- Player Name: Row index 2, column \"player\"\n- Pick Number: Row index 2, column \"pick\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
