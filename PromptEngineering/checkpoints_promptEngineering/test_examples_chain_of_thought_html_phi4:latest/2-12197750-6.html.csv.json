    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"at 576, the highest roll belongs to dannevirke high school\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the data provided in the table for each school's roll number and specifically identify if Dannevirke High School has the highest number.\n\n### Chain of Thought:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest**: We are interested in the \"roll\" column since it contains the values that represent the student population sizes (rolls) of each school.\n\n2. **Locate Dannevirke High School's Roll**:\n   - Scan through the table to find the row corresponding to Dannevirke High School.\n   - Identify its roll number from the \"roll\" column.\n\n3. **Check for Highest Roll Value in the Table**:\n   - Compare Dannevirke High School's roll with all other rolls listed in the table to see if it is indeed the highest value.\n\n4. **Verification of Claim Details**:\n   - The claim states that the highest roll is 576.\n   - Verify if Dannevirke High School has a roll number equal to 576 and check against any higher roll numbers found elsewhere in the table.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n- **Dannevirke High School**: Located at row 5, it has a roll of 330 as per the \"roll\" column.\n  \n- **Compare with Other Schools**:\n  - Examine each school's roll number:\n    - For example, Pahiatua School (row 14) has a roll of 259.\n    - Tararua College (row 16) has a roll of 330.\n    - TKKM O Tamaki Nui A Rua (row 17) has a roll of 73.\n\n- **Identify the Highest Roll**:\n  - From scanning all rows, it's clear that no school in the table has a roll number higher than 576.\n  - The highest roll numbers encountered are 330 from both Dannevirke High School and Tararua College.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the highest roll is 576 at Dannevirke High School. However, there is no school with a roll of 576 in the table; the maximum roll observed was 330 (Dannevirke High School and Tararua College both have this value).\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5: \"roll\" column for Dannevirke High School.\n- Various rows under the \"roll\" column to verify no school has a roll of 576 or higher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row corresponding to Dannevirke High School and identify its roll number.
