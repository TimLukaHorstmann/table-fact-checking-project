    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Joel Houston composes 4 of the songs on the album 'con todo'\" is true or false, we must perform a detailed analysis based on the given table. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Joel Houston\u2019s Compositions**:\n   - First, we need to find all rows where \"joel houston\" is listed as the composer.\n   - Scan through each row in the \"composer\" column for entries containing \"joel houston\".\n\n2. **Check Album Names**:\n   - For each song composed by Joel Houston, check the album name listed under the \"original album\" column to see if it matches \"con todo\".\n   - Note that we need to ensure this specific match as the claim specifies an album named \"con todo\".\n\n3. **Count Songs on 'Con Todo'**:\n   - Tally the number of songs by Joel Houston that are specifically from the \"con todo\" album.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Count**:\n   - Compare the count obtained in the previous step with the claim stating that Joel Houston composed 4 songs for this particular album.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Rows Composed by Joel Houston**:\n   - Row 1: \"para exaltarte\" - Composer: Joel Houston, Album: This is our god\n   - Row 2: \"correr\u00e9\" - Composer: Joel Houston, Album: This is our god\n   - Row 4: \"desde mi interior\" - Composer: Joel Houston, Album: Unidos permanecemos\n   - Row 9: \"soy libre\" - Composer: Joel houston (part of the team), Album: Saviour king\n\n2. **Checking for 'Con Todo'**:\n   - None of these rows mention an album named \"con todo\". The albums listed are \"This is our god\", \"Unidos permanecemos\", and \"Saviour king\".\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no entries in the table where Joel Houston composed a song for an album named \"con todo\".\n   - Therefore, he does not compose 4 or any songs on such an album.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Joel Houston is listed as a composer in rows 1, 2, 4, and partially in row 9.
