    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's follow a structured approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Couple and Their Dance Details:**\n   - The claim refers to \"stine & tom - erik.\"\n   - We need to find this couple in the \"couple\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Verify the Style and Music:**\n   - According to the claim, they dance an \"English waltz\" to \"what a wonderful world - louis armstrong.\"\n   - We should confirm these details for \"stine & tom - erik.\"\n\n3. **Check the Scores Given by Judges:**\n   - The claim specifies that \"trine dehli cleve\" gave them a score of 6.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"stine & tom - erik\" and check the score given by \"trine dehli cleve.\"\n\n4. **Validate the Total Score:**\n   - Although not directly part of the claim, verifying the total ensures all data is consistent.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table:\n\n1. **Locate \"stine & tom - erik\":**\n   - Found in row 6 under the \"couple\" column.\n\n2. **Verify Style and Music:**\n   - In row 6, the \"style\" is \"english waltz.\"\n   - The \"music\" is \"what a wonderful world - louis armstrong.\"\n   - Both match the claim.\n\n3. **Check Score by Trine Dehli Cleve:**\n   - In row 6, under \"trine dehli cleve,\" the score is 7.\n   - The claim states it should be 6, which does not match.\n\n4. **Total Score (for completeness):**\n   - Total in row 6 is 27, but this doesn't affect the truth of the specific claim about Trine Dehli Cleve's score.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim that \"trine dehli cleve\" gave a score of 6 to \"stine & tom - erik\" is false because she actually gave them a score of 7.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate 'stine & tom - erik' in the table, found in row 6. 2. Verify style and music: both match ('english waltz' and 'what a wonderful world - louis armstrong'). 3. Check score by 'trine dehli cleve': actual score is 7, not 6 as claimed. 4. Total score is irrelevant to the specific claim about Trine Dehli Cleve's score.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"style\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"music\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"trine dehli cleve\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
