    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the specific game against Houston**: The claim mentions a match against Houston on December 14, 2008.\n\n2. **Locate the row corresponding to Week 14**:\n   - From the table, Week 14 is listed with the date \"December 7, 2008\".\n   - This indicates that the match against Houston actually took place on December 7, 2008, not December 14, 2008.\n\n3. **Verify the opponent and date in Week 14**:\n   - The opponent for Week 14 is indeed Houston.\n   - However, as established, the date is December 7, 2008.\n\n4. **Check the match report column for Week 14**:\n   - The \"Match Report\" column for Week 14 lists \"recap\".\n   - This confirms that the match report against Houston on December 7, 2008, is listed as \"recap\".\n\n5. **Evaluate the claim against the table data**:\n   - The claim specifies December 14, 2008, but the actual date of the game against Houston was December 7, 2008.\n   - Therefore, the match report for December 14, 2008, does not exist in this context.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since there is no match on December 14, 2008, against Houston, the claim about a \"match report\" being listed as \"recap\" on that date is false.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim mentions a game against Houston on December 14, 2008. However, Week 14 shows the game against Houston was actually on December 7, 2008, with 'recap' as the match report. There is no game listed for Houston on December 14, 2008.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Match Report\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
