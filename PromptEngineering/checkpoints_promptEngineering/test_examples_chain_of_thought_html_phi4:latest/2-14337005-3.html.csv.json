    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game against the Toronto Blue Jays ending with a score of 2 - 1 is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table. Here's how I approached it:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"the game against the toronto blue jay end with a score of 2 - 1\". Therefore, we need to locate all entries in the table where the opponent is \"toronto blue jays\" and check their scores.\n\n2. **Locate Matches Against Toronto Blue Jays:**\n   - Scan through the \"opponent\" column to find rows that contain \"toronto blue jays\".\n\n3. **Check Scores for These Matches:**\n   - For each match against the Toronto Blue Jays, look at the \"score\" column to see if any of them ended with a score of 2 - 1.\n\n4. **Verification from the Table:**\n   - On May 6th, there is an entry where the opponent is \"toronto blue jays\" and the score is listed as \"5 - 2\".\n   - On May 13th, there is another entry for a match against the Toronto Blue Jays with the score being \"3 - 1\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no entries in the table where a game against the Toronto Blue Jays ended with a score of 2 - 1.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false as there are no games against the Toronto Blue Jays that ended with a score of 2 - 1.
