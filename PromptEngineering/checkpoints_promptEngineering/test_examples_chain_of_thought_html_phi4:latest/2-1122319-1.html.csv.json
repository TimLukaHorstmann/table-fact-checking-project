    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the steps to analyze it.\n\n### Claim Breakdown\n\nThe claim states: \"the no of grid have 104 lap and a time / retire of + 6.18 be 1\"\n\nWe need to verify if:\n- There is exactly one driver (one row) with:\n  - `laps = 104`\n  - `time / retired = + 6.18`\n\n### Steps for Verification\n\n1. **Identify Columns:**\n   - The relevant columns based on the claim are \"laps\" and \"time / retired.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row in the Table:**\n   - We need to look at each row of the table and check if both conditions (`laps = 104` and `time / retired = + 6.18`) are met.\n\n3. **Check for Laps = 104:**\n   - Scan through all rows to find any entry where \"laps\" equals 104.\n   - None of the entries in the table have laps equal to 104.\n\n4. **Check for Time/Retired = + 6.18:**\n   - Find rows with `time / retired` value as `+ 6.18`.\n   - From the table, only the driver \"Richie Ginther\" has a time of `+ 6.18`.\n\n5. **Verify Combined Condition:**\n   - Since there is no row with `laps = 104`, it's impossible for any row to have both conditions (`laps = 104` and `time / retired = + 6.18`) met.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that there should be exactly one such driver, but since we found no drivers meeting the criteria of having `laps = 104`, the condition can't possibly hold true for even a single entry in this table.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nSince no row meets both conditions simultaneously, technically no cells are relevant to satisfy the entire claim. However, we identified where one part of the condition (time/retired) is satisfied:\n\n- Row index: 1 (second row), Column name: \"time / retired\" for `+ 6.18`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires a driver with exactly 104 laps and a time/retired of + 6.18.
