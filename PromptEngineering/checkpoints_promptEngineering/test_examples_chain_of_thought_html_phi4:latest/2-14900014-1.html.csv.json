We need to locate row 2 (since rows are typically indexed starting from 1) which corresponds to week 2.\n   \n2. **Verify the Opponent**:\n   - In row 2, check the column labeled `opponent`. The value is \"new england patriots\", which matches the opponent stated in the claim.\n\n3. **Check the Attendance**:\n   - Next, we need to confirm the attendance figure for this game. Look at the column labeled `attendance` in row 2.\n   - The attendance recorded is 53632.0, which corresponds exactly to \"53632\" as mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Date Consistency Check (Optional)**:\n   - Although not explicitly required by the claim, it's often useful to verify additional information for consistency. In row 2, the date column states \"september 7 , 1997\", confirming that the game took place on this specific date.\n   \n5. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - The opponent is indeed \"new england patriots\".\n   - The attendance figure recorded is exactly 53632, matching the claim.\n   - All other relevant data points (date and week number) are consistent with the provided row.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe details in the table for week 2 match all parts of the claim.
