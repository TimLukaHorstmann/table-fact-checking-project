We need to locate this name within the table.\n   - From the table, we find that Tero Lehtera is listed at row index 235 with the name \"tero lehtera\".\n\n2. **Verify the Position Played:**\n   - According to the claim, Tero Lehtera plays in the \"centre\" position.\n   - In the same row (row index 235), under the column \"position\", it states that he plays as a \"Centre\".\n   - This confirms the first part of the claim regarding his playing position.\n\n3. **Check the NHL Team:**\n   - The claim mentions that Tero Lehtera was picked by the \"Florida Panther\" NHL team.\n   - We need to verify which NHL team selected him.\n   - In row index 235, under the column \"team\", it is stated that he was picked by the \"florida panthers\".\n   - Note: The claim uses \"Florida Panther\" while the table has \"florida panthers\".
