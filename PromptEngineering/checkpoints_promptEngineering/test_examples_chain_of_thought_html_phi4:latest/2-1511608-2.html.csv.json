    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to break down the components of the claim and verify them against the data provided in the HTML table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Net Profit/Loss:** The claim states that a net profit/loss value of -1140000000 has an associated basic EPS (sek) of -6.58.\n2. **Employees (average/year):** Additionally, it claims that this particular year had more than 31034 employees on average per year.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Net Profit/Loss = -1140000000:**\n   - We need to scan through the \"net profit / loss (sek)\" column in the table to find a value of -1140000000.\n   - From the data, this occurs for the year 2001.\n\n2. **Check Basic EPS (sek) for Year 2001:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row (year), we will check the \"basic eps (sek)\" column to see if it is indeed -6.58.\n   - In row corresponding to the year 2001, \"basic eps (sek)\" is -6.58.\n\n3. **Verify Employees (average/year) for Year 2001:**\n   - We need to check the value in the \"employees (average / year)\" column for the same year (2001).\n   - The number of employees for the year 2001 is 31035, which is indeed larger than 31034.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- All parts of the claim are verified against the table. The net profit/loss of -1140000000 corresponds to a basic EPS of -6.58 and an average employee count greater than 31034 for the year 2001.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n- Row index for 2001: \n  - Net Profit/Loss (sek): -1140000000\n  - Basic EPS (sek): -6.58\n  - Employees (average / year): 31035\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified the row with net profit/loss of -1140000000 which corresponds to the year 2001.
