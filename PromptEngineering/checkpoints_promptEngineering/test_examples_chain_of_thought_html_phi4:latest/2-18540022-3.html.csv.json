    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true, we need to analyze the number of episodes for each TV show listed in the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that \"Regatta~Kimi to ita eien~\" should be the only title with less than 11 episodes.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"episodes\" column of the table to identify which shows have fewer than 11 episodes.\n   \n3. **Analyze Each Row for Episodes:**\n   - **Row 1 (\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea):** 11 episodes\n   - **Row 2 (\u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e):** 12 episodes\n   - **Row 3 (\u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537):** 12 episodes\n   - **Row 4 (\u30c0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u3002\uff5edance\u2606drill\uff5e):** 11 episodes\n   - **Row 5 (\u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30de\u30de\u3092\u611b\u3059):** 11 episodes\n   - **Row 6 (\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!):** 12 episodes\n   - **Row 7 (\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f):** 10 episodes\n   - **Row 8 (\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e):** 9 episodes\n   - **Row 9 (\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba):** 9 episodes\n   - **Row 10 (ca\u3068\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3063!):** 11 episodes\n   - **Row 11 (\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc):** 10 episodes\n\n4. **Identify Shows with Less Than 11 Episodes:**\n   - \"\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f\" has 10 episodes.\n   - \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\" has 9 episodes.\n   - \"\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\" has 9 episodes.\n   - \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" has 10 episodes.\n\n5. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies that only \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\" should have less than 11 episodes.\n   - However, there are other shows (\"\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f\", \"\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\", and \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\") that also have fewer than 11 episodes.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because there are multiple titles with less than 11 episodes, not just \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 7, Column \"episodes\" (10 episodes)\n- Row 8, Column \"episodes\" (9 episodes)\n- Row 9, Column \"episodes\" (9 episodes)\n- Row 11, Column \"episodes\" (10 episodes)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'Regatta~Kimi to ita eien~' should be the only title with less than 11 episodes.
