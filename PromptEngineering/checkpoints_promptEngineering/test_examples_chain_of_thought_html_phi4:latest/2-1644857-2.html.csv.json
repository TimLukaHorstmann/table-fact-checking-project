    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate two parts of the claim:\n\n1. **Scotland has stolen ends less than 9.**\n2. **Craig Brown is the skip for the United States.**\n\nLet's analyze each part step-by-step using the data from the table.\n\n### Step 1: Verify Scotland's Stolen Ends\n\n- Locate the row corresponding to \"scotland.\"\n- Identify the value in the \"stolen ends\" column for Scotland.\n- According to the table, the stolen ends for Scotland is 10 (located at row index 1).\n\nThe claim states that Scotland has stolen ends less than 9. However, from the table, we see that Scotland has stolen ends equal to 10.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Craig Brown's Skip Position\n\n- Locate the row corresponding to \"united states.\"\n- Identify the value in the \"skip\" column for the United States.\n- According to the table, the skip for the United States is indeed Craig Brown (located at row index 6).\n\nThe claim correctly identifies Craig Brown as the skip for the United States.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The first part of the claim is FALSE because Scotland has stolen ends equal to 10, not less than 9.\n- The second part of the claim is TRUE because Craig Brown is indeed the skip for the United States.\n\nSince both parts of the claim must be true for the entire claim to be true, and one part is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n1. Scotland's \"stolen ends\" (row index 1, column name \"stolen ends\").\n2. United States' \"skip\" (row index 6, column name \"skip\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Check the 'stolen ends' for Scotland: it is 10, not less than 9.\\n2. Verify Craig Brown as skip for the United States: this part of the claim is correct.\\n3. Since one part of the claim is false, the entire claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
