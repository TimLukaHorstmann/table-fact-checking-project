    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the most game play be in October\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data to count how many games were played each month. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Extract the Month from Each Game Date:**\n   - For each row in the table, identify the date and extract the month.\n   - The dates are given in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. We focus on the `- MM -` part to determine the month.\n\n2. **Count Games per Month:**\n   - Initialize a counter for games played in October.\n   - For each row:\n     - If the extracted month is 09 (September), do nothing regarding counting October games.\n     - If the extracted month is 10 (October), increment the October game count.\n     - Continue this process for other months as well to ensure October has the most games.\n\n3. **Compare October with Other Months:**\n   - After processing all rows, compare the number of games played in October with those played in other months.\n   - If October has the highest count, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet's apply this reasoning to the table:\n\n- **September Games (09):** Rows 1 and 2 are in September. Total = 2 games.\n- **October Games (10):** Rows 3 to 6 are in October. Total = 4 games.\n- **November Games (11):** Rows 7 to 12 are in November. Total = 6 games.\n- **December Games (12):** Row 13 is in December. Total = 1 game.\n\nFrom this analysis, November has the most games with 6, not October which has 4. Therefore, the claim \"the most game play be in October\" is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for October and other months:\n\n- **October:**\n  - Row 3: Date `1973-09-30` (end of September)\n  - Row 4: Date `1973-10-07`\n  - Row 5: Date `1973-10-14`\n  - Row 6: Date `1973-10-21`\n\n- **November:**\n  - Row 7: Date `1973-10-28` (end of October)\n  - Row 8: Date `1973-11-04`\n  - Row 9: Date `1973-11-11`\n  - Row 10: Date `1973-11-18`\n  - Row 11: Date `1973-11-25`\n  - Row 12: Date `1973-12-02` (start of December)\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was analyzed to count games per month.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"three games have a sum of points bigger than 85\" is true, we need to analyze the 'result' column from each row in the table. Specifically, we are interested in calculating the total number of points scored by both teams for each game and checking if there are three such games where this sum exceeds 85.\n\nHere's how we can systematically approach this:\n\n1. **Extract Scores:** For each row in the 'result' column, extract the scores of the home team (the team associated with Shea Stadium or other mentioned stadiums) and their opponents.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Points Per Game:**\n   - For week 1: \"l 23 - 7\" implies the opponent scored 23 points, and the home team scored 7. The total is 30.\n   - For week 2: \"w 34 - 10\" means the home team scored 34, and the opponent scored 10. Total = 44.\n   - For week 3: \"l 9 - 7\" indicates the opponent scored 9, and the home team scored 7. Total = 16.\n   - For week 4: \"l 31 - 3\" means the opponent scored 31, and the home team scored 3. Total = 34.\n   - For week 5: \"w 9 - 7\" implies the home team scored 9, and the opponent scored 7. Total = 16.\n   - For week 6: \"l 26 - 14\" indicates the opponent scored 26, and the home team scored 14. Total = 40.\n   - For week 7: \"l 40 - 28\" means the opponent scored 40, and the home team scored 28. Total = 68.\n   - For week 8: \"l 24 - 14\" implies the opponent scored 24, and the home team scored 14. Total = 38.\n   - For week 9: \"w 33 - 13\" means the home team scored 33, and the opponent scored 13.
