    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table concerning the number of episodes per series.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"of all of the series that be list the lowest number of episode of 1 series be 11.\" This can be interpreted as saying that the series listed has a total of 11 episodes, which is claimed to be the lowest among any series mentioned.\n\n2. **Analyze the Table Structure**:\n   - The table contains columns: `no in series`, `no in season`, `title`, `directed by`, `written by`, `original air date`, `production`, and `us viewers (in millions)`.\n   - Each row represents an episode of a television series, with its corresponding details.\n\n3. **Determine the Total Number of Episodes**:\n   - The column `no in series` is crucial here as it lists the sequential number for each episode across all seasons.\n   - By examining this column, we can determine how many episodes are present in total.\n   - Counting the entries in the `no in series` column gives us the total number of episodes listed.\n\n4. **Count the Episodes**:\n   - The table has 13 rows (excluding headers), each corresponding to an episode.\n   - Thus, the total count of episodes is 13.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests that there are only 11 episodes in this series.\n   - Since we have counted 13 episodes from the `no in series` column, the claim does not match the data provided.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table lists a total of 13 episodes for the series.\n   - Therefore, the claim that there are only 11 episodes is incorrect based on the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table has rows corresponding to each episode.
