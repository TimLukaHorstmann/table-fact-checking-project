    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components**:\n   - The claim states there was a crowd of 74,656 for Essendon as the home team on 26 June 1952.\n\n2. **Check the Date**:\n   - According to the table, all matches listed are on \"26 june 1982\". \n   - Therefore, there is no match in the table from 26 June 1952.\n   \n3. **Locate Essendon as Home Team**:\n   - In the table, Essendon is listed as the home team in one row:\n     - Row: 5\n     - Column: \"home team\" -> Essendon\n     - Date: \"26 june 1982\"\n     - Crowd: 47,656\n\n4. **Check Crowd Size**:\n   - The crowd size for the Essendon match is listed as 47,656.\n   - The claim mentions a crowd of 74,656.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no entry for 26 June 1952 in the table and the date mentioned in the claim does not match any date in the table, the claim cannot be true based on this data.\n   - Additionally, even if we consider only the Essendon game, the crowd size of 74,656 is incorrect as per the table.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states there was a crowd of 74,656 for Essendon as the home team on 26 June 1952.\",\n    \"All matches in the table are dated '26 june 1982', so there is no match from 26 June 1952.\",\n    \"Essendon appears as the home team on '26 june 1982' with a crowd of 47,656.\",\n    \"The date and crowd size mentioned in the claim do not match any entry in the table.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
