    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information in the Claim:**\n   - The artist is mentioned as \"maggie toal.\"\n   - The draw number is stated as 7.\n   - The song title is given as \"fee him with love.\"\n\n2. **Analyze Each Component of the Claim Against the Table:**\n\n   a. **Artist Name:**\n      - We need to find an entry where the artist's name matches \"maggie toal.\"\n      - In the table, row 7 has the artist \"maggie toal\" in the \"artist\" column.\n\n   b. **Draw Number:**\n      - The claim specifies draw number 7.\n      - We look for a row with the value 7 in the \"draw\" column.\n      - Row 7 matches this condition as it contains the number 7 in the \"draw\" column.\n\n   c. **Song Title:**\n      - According to the claim, the song should be \"fee him with love.\"\n      - In the table, row 7 has the song title \"feed him with love\" in the \"song\" column.\n      - The song title does not match exactly as there is a typographical error; it should be \"feed him with love,\" not \"fee him with love.\"\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - While two components of the claim (artist and draw number) are correct, the song title contains a typo, making it incorrect.\n   - Therefore, based on the discrepancy in the song title, the entire claim is false.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n\n   - Row 7, Column \"draw\": Contains the value 7\n   - Row 7, Column \"artist\": Contains the value \"maggie toal\"\n   - Row 7, Column \"song\": Contains the value \"feed him with love\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that artist 'maggie toal' has draw number 7 for the song 'fee him with love'. Upon examining the table: \\n1. The artist 'maggie toal' is correctly identified in row 7, column 'artist'.\\n2. The draw number 7 matches in row 7, column 'draw'.\\n3. However, the song title given as 'fee him with love' does not match; it should be 'feed him with love', showing a typographical error.\\nThus, due to the incorrect song title, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
