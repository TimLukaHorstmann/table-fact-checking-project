This matches part of the claim (chart position in the US).\n\n4. **Check for Year 1985:**\n   - There is no entry for \"under the influence\" in the year 1985, so it did not chart at any position during that year.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The title \"under the influence\" charted at position 56 in the US only in 1986, not in both 1985 and 1986 as claimed.\n  \nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The title 'under the influence' appears for the year 1986 with a US chart position of 56.

We need to examine rows where the \"year\" column is 1986.\n\n2. **Locate Rows for 1986:**\n   - From the table, there are two entries for the year 1986:\n     - Row 1: `title` = \"under the influence\", `us r&b` = 9, `us dance` = 6\n     - Row 2: `title` = \"animals\", with \"-\" (no data) in all columns\n\n3. **Check Condition for US R&B:**\n   - The claim specifies that \"the value of us r&b be 9\". \n   - In the first row of 1986, `us r&b` is indeed 9.\n\n4. **Verify US Dance Value:**\n   - According to the claim, if `us r&b` is 9, then `us dance` should be 6.\n   - In the same row where `us r&b` is 9 (`title` = \"under the influence\"), `us dance` is indeed 6.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conditions of the claim are satisfied in the first row for 1986: when `us r&b` is 9, `us dance` is 6.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2 (indexing from 0): \n  - Column \"year\": 1986\n  - Column \"title\": under the influence\n  - Column \"us r&b\": 9\n  - Column \"us dance\": 6\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies conditions for the year 1986 where 'us r&b' is 9 and 'us dance' should be 6.
