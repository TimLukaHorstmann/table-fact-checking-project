    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Marseille's first leg score being 3 - 1 when they are listed as team 1 is true or false, we need to examine the relevant rows of the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: The claim involves \"Marseille\" being the first team in a row. Therefore, locate any row where \"team 1\" is \"marseille\".\n\n2. **Examine Marseille's Row**:\n   - Look for the row with \"marseille\" under the column labeled \"team 1\".\n   - From the table provided, we find this occurs at the last row in the body of the table.\n\n3. **Check First Leg Score**:\n   - In the identified row, check the value under the \"1st leg\" column.\n   - For Marseille vs. Zenit St Petersburg, the \"1st leg\" score is \"3 - 1\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that when Marseille is listed as team 1, the first leg's score is 3 - 1.\n   - This matches our finding in step 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the row with Marseille as team 1 has a \"1st leg\" score of 3 - 1, the claim is verified to be true based on the table data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'team 1' is 'marseille'.\",\n    \"In the identified row, check the value under the '1st leg' column.\",\n    \"The score for Marseille's first leg against Zenit St Petersburg is '3 - 1'.\",\n    \"This matches the claim that when Marseille is team 1, the first leg's score is 3 - 1.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This is found in the third row of the table's body (`<tbody>`).\n\n2. **Extract Scores for First and Second Leg:**\n   - For the first leg, look at the column labeled \"1st leg\". The score listed here for Bolton Wanderers is `1 - 1`.\n   - For the second leg, look at the column labeled \"2nd leg\". The score listed here for Bolton Wanderers is `0 - 1`.\n\n3. **Compare Scores:**\n   - Compare the scores from the first and second legs:\n     - First Leg Score: `1 - 1`\n     - Second Leg Score: `0 - 1`\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer\".\n   - Since `1 - 1` is not equal to `0 - 1`, the scores are different.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the first leg and second leg scores for Bolton Wanderers are not the same.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row for 'bolton wanderers' in the table.
