Therefore, we cannot directly verify from this table if any players were indeed drafted by the Washington Redskins.\n   - We need to assume that all entries in the table are potential candidates unless external information is provided.\n\n4. **Identify Players with \"db\" Position**:\n   - Look through the `position` column for any entry labeled as \"db\":\n     - Row 5: Jimmy Spencer, position = db\n     - Row 6: Charles Bell, position = db\n\n5. **Count the Total Number of Drafted Players in the Table**:\n   - There are 9 players listed in total (rows 1 to 9).\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim Based on Available Data**:\n   - The claim specifies \"2 player draft\" by the Washington Redskins with at least one having a \"db\" position.\n   - Without information about which team drafted each player, we cannot definitively say that any of these players were drafted by the Washington Redskins.\n   - However, there are two players listed with a \"db\" position.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the table does not provide information about the drafting team, and assuming all players could potentially be from different teams, we cannot confirm or deny the claim based solely on this data.\n   - The presence of two \"db\" positions is noted, but without team-specific data, the claim remains unverifiable.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the lack of explicit information about which team drafted each player, we cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume all players are potential candidates for being drafted by any team, including the Washington Redskins, and given that there are two \"db\" positions listed, the claim could be plausible but not verifiable from this table alone.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 2 players were drafted by the Washington Redskins with at least one having a 'db' position.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify whether a player from Michigan State University was drafted in the third round. Let's examine the table systematically:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim involves two key pieces of information:\n     1. A player from \"michigan state\" (college column).\n     2. This player being drafted in the \"third round\" (round column).\n\n2. **Review Each Row for Michigan State Players:**\n   - Look through each row to find any instance where the `college` is \"michigan state\".\n\n3. **Check Round Number for These Players:**\n   - For rows that match the college criterion, check the `round` column to see if it indicates a third round draft.\n\n4. **Analyzing Each Row:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - College: \"michigan state\"\n     - Round: 1\n     - The player is drafted in the first round, not the third.\n   \n   - **Row 2 to Row 8:** \n     - Colleges are \"southern california\", \"texas a&m\", \"texas\", \"florida\", and \"baylor\".\n     - These rows do not match the college criterion.\n\n   - **Row 9 to Row 12:**\n     - College: Various, none being \"michigan state\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is only one player from Michigan State in the table (row 1), and he was drafted in the first round, not the third.\n   - No players from Michigan State were drafted in the third round according to this data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"a michigan state player be draft in the third round\" is FALSE. The only relevant cell for our conclusion is from row 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was analyzed row by row to identify any player drafted from 'michigan state'.
