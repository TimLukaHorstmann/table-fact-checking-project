    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the episode title 'The Predators' be the most recent episode in the table to be directed by Bernard Mceveety\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Episodes Directed by Bernard Mceveety\n\nWe'll begin by identifying all episodes directed by Bernard Mceveety. We will look through the \"director\" column for entries matching \"bernard mceveety\".\n\n- **Row 6**: Director is \"Bernard Mceveety\"\n- **Row 11**: Director is \"Bernard Mceveety\"\n- **Row 12**: Director is \"Bernard Mceveety\"\n- **Row 13**: Director is \"Bernard Mceveety\"\n- **Row 18**: Director is \"Bernard Mceveety\"\n- **Row 19**: Director is \"Bernard Mceveety\"\n\n### Step 2: List Episode Titles Directed by Bernard Mceveety\n\nNext, we'll list the episode titles for each of these rows to find all episodes directed by him:\n\n- **Row 6 (Episode 17)**: Title is \"Hidalgo\"\n- **Row 11 (Episode 22)**: Title is \"Gold Train: The Bullet - Part 3\"\n- **Row 12 (Episode 23)**: Title is \"PS Murry Christmas\"\n- **Row 13 (Episode 24)**: Title is \"No Tomorrow\"\n- **Row 18 (Episode 29)**: Title is \"Tara\"\n- **Row 19 (Episode 30)**: Title is \"One for the Road\"\n- **Row 20 (Episode 31)**: Title is \"The Predators\"\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Most Recent Episode Directed by Bernard Mceveety\n\nWe need to find out which of these episodes was aired last. This can be determined from the \"air date\" in the \"air date\" column:\n\n- **Row 6 (Episode 17)**: Aired on January 10, 1972\n- **Row 11 (Episode 22)**: Aired on December 13, 1971\n- **Row 12 (Episode 23)**: Aired on December 27, 1971\n- **Row 13 (Episode 24)**: Aired on January 3, 1972\n- **Row 18 (Episode 29)**: Aired on January 17, 1972\n- **Row 19 (Episode 30)**: Aired on January 24, 1972\n- **Row 20 (Episode 31)**: Aired on January 31, 1972\n\nThe most recent episode directed by Bernard Mceveety is \"The Predators,\" which aired on January 31, 1972.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"The Predators\" is the most recent episode in the table to be directed by Bernard Mceveety.
