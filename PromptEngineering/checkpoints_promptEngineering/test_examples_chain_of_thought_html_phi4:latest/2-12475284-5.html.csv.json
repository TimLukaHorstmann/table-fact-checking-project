    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tim Herron's score be 136\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for the relevant data about Tim Herron.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - Look through the rows in the `tbody` section of the HTML table to find any entries that correspond to \"Tim Herron.\"\n\n2. **Extract Information:**\n   - Once we identify the row for Tim Herron, check the values under the `score` and `to par` columns.\n\n3. **Verify Score:**\n   - The claim states Tim Herron's score should be 136. We need to confirm if the score listed in his row matches this value.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row Search:** \n  - Traverse each row within the `<tbody>` tag.\n  - Locate the row where the `player` column contains \"tim herron.\"\n\n- **Row Identification:**\n  - The relevant row is:\n    ```html\n    <tr>\n      <td>t1</td>\n      <td>tim herron</td>\n      <td>united states</td>\n      <td>69 + 67 = 136</td>\n      <td>- 8</td>\n    </tr>\n    ```\n\n- **Score Verification:**\n  - In the `score` column for Tim Herron, the value is \"69 + 67 = 136.\"\n  - This confirms that his total score is indeed 136.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Tim Herron's score be 136\" matches the data in the table.

In golf, a higher numerical score is worse since it means more strokes taken. We will compare scores of all players:\n\n1. **Players with place \"t1\"**:\n   - Billy Andrade: 136\n   - Luke Donald: 136\n   - Henrik Stenson: 136\n   - Tim Herron: 136\n\n2. **Players with place \"t5\"**:\n   - Davis Love III: 137\n   - Geoff Ogilvy: 137\n   - Tiger Woods: 137\n\n3. **Players with place \"t8\"**:\n   - Fred Funk: 138\n   - Billy Mayfair: 138\n   - Chris Riley: 138\n   - David Toms: 138\n\n### Step 3: Comparing Scores\n\n- The lowest score (best performance) is 136, achieved by players in place \"t1\".\n- Tiger Woods has a score of 137, which places him with players in position \"t5\".\n- The highest scores listed are 138 from players in position \"t8\".\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Claim\n\nThe claim states that Tiger Woods has the highest score. However, based on our analysis:\n- Tiger Woods' score is 137.\n- Higher scores than Tiger Woods' (i.e., worse performances) are 138.\n\nThus, Tiger Woods does not have the highest score; players in place \"t8\" do.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"Tiger Woods has the highest score\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we understand that a higher numerical golf score indicates a worse performance.
