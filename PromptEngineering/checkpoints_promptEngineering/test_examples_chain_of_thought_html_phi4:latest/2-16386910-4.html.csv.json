This means we expect the count of home games to be greater than or equal to the count of visitor games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Visitor Count:**\n  - December 2, 1976: Visitor\n  - December 3, 1976: Visitor\n  - December 5, 1967: Visitor\n  - December 10, 1976: Home\n  - December 11, 1976: Home\n  - December 14, 1976: Home\n  - December 15, 1976: Visitor\n  - December 17, 1976: Visitor\n  - December 19, 1976: Visitor\n  - December 26, 1976: Visitor\n  - December 28, 1976: Home\n\n- **Visitor Total:** 7 games as the visitor.\n\n- **Home Count:**\n  - December 10, 1976: Home\n  - December 11, 1976: Home\n  - December 14, 1976: Home\n  - December 28, 1976: Home\n\n- **Home Total:** 4 games as the home team.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs appear more frequently as the visiting team (7 times) than as the home team (4 times).
