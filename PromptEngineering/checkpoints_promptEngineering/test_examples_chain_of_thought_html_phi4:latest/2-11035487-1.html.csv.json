    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the runner placed 4 times in the 10000 m event\" is true or false, we need to carefully examine each entry in the table for occurrences of the \"10000 m\" event.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We are interested in the columns `competition`, `venue`, and `event` since these will provide us with information about where and in what events placements were achieved.\n\n2. **Scan Each Row for '10000 m' Event**: We need to look at each row of the table to see if \"10000 m\" appears in the `event` column.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - **Row 1**: The event is \"individual junior race\". Not relevant.\n   - **Row 2**: The event is \"team junior race\". Not relevant.\n   - **Row 3**: The event is \"10000 m\". This is a match, count = 1.\n   - **Row 4**: The event is \"individual 20 km\". Not relevant.\n   - **Row 5**: The event is \"team 20 km\". Not relevant.\n   - **Row 6**: The event is \"individual\".

This is a match, count = 3.\n   - **Row 9**: The event is \"individual\". Not relevant.\n   - **Row 10**: The event is \"marathon\". Not relevant.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: After examining all rows, the runner placed in the \"10000 m\" event three times (rows 3, 7, and 8).\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim**: The claim states that the runner placed four times in the \"10000 m\" event.
