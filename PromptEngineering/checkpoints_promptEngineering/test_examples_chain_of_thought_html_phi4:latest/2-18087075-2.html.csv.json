    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tobias Kamke didn't win a tennis match until he first played in Canada\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table to check for instances of wins by Tobias Kamke before any tournament held in Canada.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Wins**: We need to look at the \"outcome\" column and find rows where the outcome is \"winner\". This indicates matches that Tobias Kamke won.\n\n2. **Check Tournament Locations Before Canada**:\n   - The claim specifies the first win occurred in a tournament in Canada. Therefore, we must check if there are any wins recorded before the first match held in Canada.\n   \n3. **Locate Canadian Tournaments**:\n   - Find the row(s) with \"tournament\" column mentioning locations in Canada.\n\n4. **Compare Dates**:\n   - For each win identified (step 1), compare its date against the dates of matches played in Canada to determine if any wins occurred before playing in Canada.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Wins Identified**:\n  - Row 5: \"winner\", Date: 26 July 2010, Tournament: Granby, Canada\n  - Row 6: \"winner\", Date: 11 October 2010, Tournament: Tiburon, US\n  - Row 7: \"winner\", Date: 13 November 2011, Tournament: Loughborough, UK\n  - Row 9: \"winner\", Date: 16 September 2012, Tournament: P\u00e9tange, Luxembourg\n\n- **Canadian Tournaments**:\n  - Only one Canadian tournament is mentioned in the table: Granby on 26 July 2010.\n\n- **Date Comparison**:\n  - The win in Canada (Granby) is on 26 July 2010.\n  - Other wins are:\n    - Tiburon, US: 11 October 2010\n    - Loughborough, UK: 13 November 2011\n    - P\u00e9tange, Luxembourg: 16 September 2012\n\nSince all other wins occurred after the Canadian tournament on 26 July 2010, Tobias Kamke did not win a match before playing in Canada.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Tobias Kamke's first recorded win was indeed during his first appearance at a tournament in Canada (Granby).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all rows where the outcome is 'winner' to find wins.\",\n    \"Locate the Canadian tournament(s) from the 'tournament' column.\",\n    \"Compare dates of wins with the date of the first Canadian match.\",\n    \"Determine if any wins occurred before playing in Canada.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kamke plays better on clay than hard surface court\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze Kamke's performance records on both surfaces.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played on Clay:**\n   - Look for entries in the \"surface\" column with the value \"clay.\"\n   - Extract relevant rows and examine the \"outcome\" (runner-up or winner).\n\n2. **Analyze Kamke's Performance on Clay:**\n   - For each match played on clay, note whether Kamke won or lost.\n\n3. **Identify Matches Played on Hard Surface:**\n   - Look for entries in the \"surface\" column with the value \"hard\" or \"hard (i)\".\n   - Extract relevant rows and examine the \"outcome.\"\n\n4. **Analyze Kamke's Performance on Hard Surfaces:**\n   - For each match played on a hard surface, note whether Kamke won or lost.\n\n5. **Compare Results:**\n   - Count the number of wins and losses for Kamke on both clay and hard surfaces.\n   - Determine if there is a clear pattern where Kamke performs better (i.e., more wins) on one surface compared to the other.\n\n### Extracted Data:\n\n- **Clay Surface Matches:**\n  - **Row 2:** Runner-up against Teymuraz Gabashvili (Score: 1 - 6, 4 - 6)\n  - **Row 4:** Runner-up against Robin Haase (Score: 4 - 6, 2 - 6)\n  - **Row 8:** Runner-up against Thomaz Bellucci (Score: 6 - 7 (4 - 7), 3 - 6)\n\n- **Hard Surface Matches:**\n  - **Row 1:** Runner-up against Steve Darcis (Score: 3 - 6, 6 - 1, 4 - 6)\n  - **Row 3:** Runner-up against Kevin Anderson (Score: 7 - 6 (9 - 7), 6 - 7 (7 - 9), 1 - 6)\n  - **Row 5:** Winner against Milos Raonic (Score: 6 - 3, 7 - 6 (7 - 4))\n  - **Row 6:** Winner against Ryan Harrison (Score: 6 - 1, 6 - 1)\n  - **Row 7:** Winner against Flavio Cipolla (Score: 6 - 2, 7 - 5)\n  - **Row 9:** Winner against Paul-Henri Mathieu (Score: 7 - 6 (9 - 7), 6 - 4)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Clay Performance:**\n  - Matches Played: 3\n  - Wins: 0\n  - Losses: 3\n\n- **Hard Surface Performance:**\n  - Matches Played: 5\n  - Wins: 3\n  - Losses: 2\n\nKamke has a record of winning on hard surfaces (3 wins, 2 losses) and losing all matches played on clay (0 wins, 3 losses). This indicates that Kamke performs better on hard surfaces compared to clay.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Kamke plays better on clay than hard surface court\" is FALSE based on the data provided. Kamke has a winning record on hard courts and no wins on clay.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified matches played on clay (3 losses) and hard surfaces (3 wins, 2 losses).
