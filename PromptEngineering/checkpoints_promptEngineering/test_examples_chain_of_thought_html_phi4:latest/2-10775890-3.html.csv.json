Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date**: The claim pertains to a specific date: \"7 May 1960\". We should locate all rows in the table with this date.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for 7 May 1960**:\n   - All rows have the same date: \"7 may 1960\", so we need to check each row for details about the teams and scores mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Find the Match Involving Richmond as Away Team**:\n   - We are looking specifically for a match where \"richmond\" is listed as the away team.\n   - From the table, identify the row with the home team as \"north melbourne\" and the away team as \"richmond\".\n\n4. **Verify Scores and Crowd Details**:\n   - In this row, verify that the score for Richmond (away team) is indeed \"3.8 (26)\".\n   - Also, check if the crowd count listed for this match is \"9000\".\n\n5. **Confirm All Aspects of the Claim**:\n   - The claim states: \"a crowd of 9000 watch the away team, richmond, score 3.8 (26)\".
