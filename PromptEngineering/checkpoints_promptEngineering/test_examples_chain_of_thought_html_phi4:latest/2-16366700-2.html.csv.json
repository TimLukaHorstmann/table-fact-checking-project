    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"bobby hull have score the most playoff goal of all chicago blackhawk player\" is true or false, we need to assess Bobby Hull's performance specifically in terms of playoff games from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that Bobby Hull has scored the most goals in playoffs among all Chicago Blackhawks players listed.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data**: We focus on the \"playoffs\" column, as this column indicates the number of playoff games played by each player. It is important to note that the table does not provide information about goals scored; it only lists the number of games played in playoffs.\n\n3. **Extract Playoff Game Data**:\n   - Bobby Hull: 62 playoff games\n   - Stan Mikita: 59 playoff games\n   - Steve Larmer: 45 playoff games\n   - Denis Savard: 61 playoff games\n   - Dennis Hull: 33 playoff games\n   - Jeremy Roenick: 35 playoff games\n   - Tony Amonte: 13 playoff games\n   - Hubert Pit Martin: 26 playoff games\n   - Bill Mosienko: 10 playoff games\n   - Ken Wharram: 16 playoff games\n\n4. **Comparison**: From the extracted data, Bobby Hull has played in 62 playoff games, which is more than any other player listed.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Although we do not have data on goals scored, Bobby Hull has participated in the most number of playoff games among the players listed. The claim about scoring \"the most playoff goal\" cannot be verified as true or false from this table since it only provides data on games played, not goals scored.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nGiven that the table does not contain information regarding the actual number of goals scored by each player in the playoffs, we cannot conclusively determine whether Bobby Hull has scored the most playoff goals. Therefore, based on available data, the claim is **FALSE** since it assumes a metric (goals) that isn't provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table provides the number of playoff games played by each player but does not include any information about goals scored in those playoffs.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in the regular season, all players have scored less than 300 goals,\" we need to examine each player's statistics for regular-season games from the provided table. Specifically, we should look at the values in the \"regular season\" column, which indicates the number of goals each player scored during regular-season games.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to focus on the \"regular season\" column as this column contains the information about goals scored by each player in regular-season games.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Player's Regular Season Goals**:\n   - Bobby Hull: 604 goals\n   - Stan Mikita: 541 goals\n   - Steve Larmer: 406 goals\n   - Denis Savard: 377 goals\n   - Dennis Hull: 298 goals\n   - Jeremy Roenick: 267 goals\n   - Tony Amonte: 268 goals\n   - Hubert Pit Martin: 243 goals\n   - Bill Mosienko: 258 goals\n   - Ken Wharram: 252 goals\n\n3. **Check for Values Greater Than or Equal to 300**:\n   - We need to find any player with a regular-season goal total of 300 or more.\n   - Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, Steve Larmer, Denis Savard, and Dennis Hull all have scores that are greater than 299 goals (specifically, they all exceed 299 goals).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since several players scored 300 or more goals in regular-season games, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells for Reference**:\n   - The cells from the \"regular season\" column for Bobby Hull (row index 0), Stan Mikita (row index 1), Steve Larmer (row index 2), Denis Savard (row index 3), and Dennis Hull (row index 4) are relevant, as they contain values greater than or equal to 300.\n\nHere is the final answer formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if all players have scored less than 300 goals in regular-season games, we examine each player's 'regular season' column.
