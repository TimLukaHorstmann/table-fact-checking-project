The first broadcast date of that particular episode.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Episode Broadcast Date\n\n- We are given the claim involves an episode broadcasted on **4 May 2012**.\n- From the table, we look at the \"first broadcast\" column to find which row corresponds to this date.\n\nRelevant cell:\n- Row index: 2 (corresponds to `05x03`)\n- Column name: \"first broadcast\"\n- Value: \"4 may 2012\"\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Guest on That Episode\n\n- Now that we have identified that the episode with the first broadcast date of **4 May 2012** is `05x03`, we need to check the guest in the \"andrew and jacks guest\" column for this row.\n\nRelevant cell:\n- Row index: 2 (corresponds to `05x03`)\n- Column name: \"andrew and jacks guest\"\n- Value: \"jessica ennis\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"Jessica Ennis be the guest on Andrew and Jack's episode broadcast on 4 May 2012.\" Based on our analysis:\n\n- The episode with the first broadcast date of **4 May 2012** is indeed `05x03`.\n- The guest for this episode, according to the table, is **Jessica Ennis**.\n\nSince both conditions match the claim, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the episode broadcast on 4 May 2012 by checking the 'first broadcast' column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the specific information related to the episode featuring Jessica Ennis as a guest.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as Andrew and Jack's guest be before May 2012.\"\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Information in the Table:**\n   - We need to find the row where Jessica Ennis is listed under the column \"andrew and jacks guest.\"\n   - According to the table, Jessica Ennis is mentioned in the row with `episode` value `05x03`.\n\n3. **Check the Broadcast Date for Episode 05x03:**\n   - In the same row (`05x03`), check the date listed under the column \"first broadcast\" to determine when this episode was first aired.\n   - The date given is \"4 May 2012.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim requires that the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis be before May 2012.\n   - The date \"4 May 2012\" indicates that the episode aired in May, not before it.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the broadcast date is within May 2012 and not before it, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as a guest should be before May 2012.
