    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the Westgaard Bridge, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: Locate the row containing information about the Westgaard Bridge.\n2. **Extract Structure Type**: Check the column that specifies the type of bridge structure to confirm if it matches \"pratt pony through truss.\"\n3. **Confirm County Location**: Verify that the bridge is located in Traill County.\n4. **Synthesize Information**: Compare extracted details with the claim to determine its accuracy.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n1. **Locate Westgaard Bridge Row**:\n   - From the given table, we find an entry labeled \"Westgaard Bridge\" which provides us with relevant data: row index 20 (considering zero-based indexing) in the table.\n\n2. **Extract Structure Type**:\n   - In this row, under the column named \"Type,\" it is specified as \"pratt pony through truss.\"\n\n3. **Confirm County Location**:\n   - Under the \"County\" column for the same row, the location is listed as \"Mchenry,\" not \"Traill.\" \n\n4. **Comparison with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the Westgaard Bridge is a \"pratt pony through truss bridge in Traill county.\"\n   - While the structure type matches (\"pratt pony through truss\"), the county does not match (it's in Mchenry, not Traill).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Due to the discrepancy in county location, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the final answer structured in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the row for Westgaard Bridge.\",\n    \"Check the 'Type' column; it lists 'pratt pony through truss'.\",\n    \"Verify the 'County' from the table: it states 'Mchenry', not 'Traill'.\",\n    \"Compare with the claim which states 'in Traill county'.\",\n    \"The structure type matches but the location does not. Hence, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Name\", \"value\": \"westgaard bridge\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Type\", \"value\": \"pratt pony through truss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"County\", \"value\": \"mchenry\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
