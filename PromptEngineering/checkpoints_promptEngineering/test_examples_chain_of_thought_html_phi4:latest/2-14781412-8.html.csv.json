We are particularly interested in the \"gold\" column because it pertains to the winner of the gold medal.\n\n#### Relevant Row\n- **Row with Nadia al-Moutawaa**:\n  - Year: 1982\n  - Location: New Delhi\n  - Gold: Nadia al-Moutawaa\n\n### Step 3: Verify if Nadia al-Moutawaa is the First Gold Medalist Listed\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Nadia al-Moutawaa is indeed the first gold medalist listed in the table. \n\n1.

Check the \"gold\" column for any entry prior to Nadia al-Moutawaa:\n   - In 1982, Nadia al-Moutawaa is listed as the gold medalist.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince the table starts from the year 1982 and lists Nadia al-Moutawaa as the gold medalist for that year, she is indeed the first person recorded in this dataset to win a gold medal. The claim does not provide specific information about whether this event was related to equestrian or any other sport; however, given the data provided, she is the first gold medalist according to the table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim \"Nadia al-Moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games\" can be considered TRUE based on the dataset provided.
