Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Row Corresponding to \"1 \u20a7\"\n\n- The table lists coins by their values in the \"value\" column.\n- We need to find the row where the value is \"1 \u20a7\".\n\n### Step 2: Check the Diameter for \"1 \u20a7\"\n\n- In the identified row, look at the \"diameter\" column.\n- According to the claim, the diameter should be \"14 mm\".\n- From the table, the \"diameter\" of the coin with value \"1 \u20a7\" is indeed listed as \"14 mm\".\n\n### Step 3: Check the Weight for \"1 \u20a7\"\n\n- In the same row, examine the \"weight\" column.\n- The claim states that the weight should be \"0.55 g\".\n- From the table, the \"weight\" of the coin with value \"1 \u20a7\" is listed as \"0.55 g\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim (diameter of 14 mm and weight of 0.55 g) are satisfied by the data for the coin valued at \"1 \u20a7\".
