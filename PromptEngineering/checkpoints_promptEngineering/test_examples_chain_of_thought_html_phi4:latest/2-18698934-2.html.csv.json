    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"none of the competition be friendly\" is true or false, we need to analyze each row of the table under the column labeled \"competition.\" The objective is to check if there are any entries in this column that indicate a \"friendly\" competition.\n\nHere's how we will proceed:\n\n1. **Examine Each Entry Under 'Competition':**  \n   We will go through each row in the table and look at what is listed under the \"competition\" column.\n\n2. **Identify Friendly Competitions:**  \n   For each row, determine if the value in the \"competition\" column matches the term \"friendly.\"\n\n3. **Assess the Claim:**  \n   If we find any entry labeled as \"friendly,\" then the claim that none of the competitions are friendly is false. Conversely, if all entries are not \"friendly,\" the claim would be true.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1:** The competition is listed as \"2010 hong kong - macau interport.\"  \n  - This is not a \"friendly\" match.\n  \n- **Row 2:** The competition is labeled \"friendly.\"\n  - This entry is indeed marked as a friendly match, which directly contradicts the claim.\n\n- **Row 3:** The competition is listed again as \"friendly.\"\n  - Another instance of a friendly match, further contradicting the claim.\n\n- **Row 4:** Here, too, the competition is labeled as \"friendly.\"\n  - Yet another friendly match, reinforcing that the claim is false.\n\n- **Row 5:** The competition is noted as \"friendly\" once more.\n  - This confirms multiple instances of friendly matches in the table.\n\nSince we found multiple entries (specifically rows 2, 3, 4, and 5) where the competition was labeled \"friendly,\" the claim that none of the competitions were friendly is false. \n\nHere are the relevant cells for each instance:\n- Row 2: { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n- Row 3: { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n- Row 4: { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n- Row 5: { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n\n**Final Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Examine each entry under the 'competition' column.
