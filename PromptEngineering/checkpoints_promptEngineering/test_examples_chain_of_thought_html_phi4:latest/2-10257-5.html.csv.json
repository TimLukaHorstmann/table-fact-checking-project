    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate whether the competition being \"vsfl\" occurred only once in 1996 based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Year and Competition:**\n   - The claim specifies the year as 1996.\n   - It also states that the competition should be \"vsfl.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row for 1996:**\n   - We look through the table to find the row where the `year` column is 1996.\n\n3. **Check Competition Type for 1996:**\n   - In the identified row, we check what value is present in the `competition` column.\n   - For the year 1996, we see that the competition type listed is \"vsfl.\"\n\n4. **Verify Occurrences of \"vsfl\" in 1996:**\n   - Since our task involves determining if this is the only occurrence of \"vsfl\" in 1996, we need to ensure there are no additional rows for 1996 with a different or same competition type.\n   - We observe that there is only one row for the year 1996.\n\n5. **Check Other Years for \"vsfl\":**\n   - To further confirm the uniqueness of this occurrence in 1996, we can check if \"vsfl\" appears in other years as well.\n   - The table shows another instance of \"vsfl\" occurring in 1998, which confirms that \"vsfl\" is not exclusive to 1996.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The competition type \"vsfl\" indeed occurs only once in the year 1996 according to the data provided. However, it is also found in other years (e.g., 1998).\n- Therefore, while the claim about the occurrence of \"vsfl\" being exclusive to one time in 1996 is true, it's important to note that \"vsfl\" itself is not unique to just 1996.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement is TRUE regarding the year 1996 as there is only one instance of \"vsfl\" for that specific year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified the row with the year 1996 and confirmed that 'vsfl' was listed as the competition type.
