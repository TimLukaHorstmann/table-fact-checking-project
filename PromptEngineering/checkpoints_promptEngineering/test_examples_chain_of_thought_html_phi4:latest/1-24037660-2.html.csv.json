Check if \"54 black swan racing\" was the GTD winning team when \"8 drayson racing\" was the LMP winning team.\n2. Identify where these occurrences happen in the table.\n\nLet's analyze each part step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Locate the occurrence of \"8 drayson racing\" as the LMP Winning Team:\n- Scan through the rows under the column labeled \"lmp winning team.\"\n- In row 7, we find that \"8 drayson racing\" is listed as the LMP winning team.\n\n#### 2. Verify if \"54 black swan racing\" was the GTD Winning Team in the same race round:\n- Check the \"gtd winning team\" column for the corresponding row where \"8 drayson racing\" appears.\n- In row 7, under the \"gtd winning team,\" we see that it is listed as \"54 black swan racing.\"\n\n#### 3. Confirm both conditions are met simultaneously:\n- Since both \"8 drayson racing\" and \"54 black swan racing\" appear in the same round (row 7), both parts of the claim hold true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"54 black swan racing be the gtc win team when lmp win team be 8 drayson racing.\" Based on the analysis, this condition is satisfied at round 7 during the race at Road America.
