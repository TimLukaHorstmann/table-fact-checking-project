    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the largest attendance at a game on September 13, 1976, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Date of Interest**: We are interested in the date \"September 13, 1976,\" as mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row**: \n   - Look through each row in the table under the \"date\" column until we find the match for \"September 13, 1976.\"\n\n3. **Check Attendance for This Date**:\n   - Once the row is identified, look at the \"attendance\" column to find out how many people attended that game.\n\n4. **Compare With Other Attendances**: \n   - We need to determine if this attendance number (44505) is indeed the largest among all games listed in the table.\n\n5. **List All Attendance Figures**:\n   - For verification, list all attendance figures from each row and compare them with 44505.\n\n6. **Identify the Maximum Attendance**: \n   - Identify which game had the highest number of attendees by comparing all figures.\n\n7. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Verify if the claim that \"the largest attendance of 44505 be at the game that take place on September 13, 1976\" is accurate based on our findings.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. The row with \"September 13, 1976\" under the \"date\" column corresponds to:\n   - `row_index`: 0\n   - Attendance: 77683\n\n2. Compare this attendance with other games listed in the table:\n   - September 19, 1976: 61384\n   - September 26, 1976: 44505\n   - October 3, 1976: 51909\n   - October 10, 1976: 59110\n   - October 17, 1976: 71009\n   - October 24, 1976: 45144\n   - October 31, 1976: 41285\n   - November 7, 1976: 61157\n   - November 15, 1976: 51799\n   - November 21, 1976: 36539\n   - November 25, 1976: 66875\n   - December 5, 1976: 43475\n   - December 12, 1976: 50451\n\n3. The largest attendance is 77683 for the game on September 13, 1976.\n\n4. Therefore, the claim that \"the largest attendance of 44505 be at the game that take place on September 13, 1976\" is false since 77683 (not 44505) was the largest attendance and it occurred on September 13, 1976.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The date 'September 13, 1976' corresponds to an attendance of 77683.
