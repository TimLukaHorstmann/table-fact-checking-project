    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two pieces of information from the table: \n\n1. The opponent for week 14.\n2. The attendance for week 14.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Locate Week 14 in the Table:**\n   - Check the \"week\" column to find the entry with \"14.\"\n\n2. **Verify the Opponent for Week 14:**\n   - Once we locate row 14, check the \"opponent\" column.\n   - According to the table, the opponent is listed as \"kansas city chiefs.\"\n\n3. **Check the Attendance for Week 14:**\n   - In the same row (week 14), look at the \"attendance\" column.\n   - The attendance is listed as \"77778.\"\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the opponent in week 14 was \"kansas city chief\" and the attendance was \"74524.\"\n   - We found:\n     - Opponent: \"kansas city chiefs\" (matches the opponent part of the claim, though there is a minor spelling difference).\n     - Attendance: \"77778\" (does not match the claimed attendance of \"74524\").\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The opponent matches in terms of the team name (\"kansas city chiefs\"), but the spelling is slightly different from what's in the claim (\"kansas city chief\").\n- The attendance does not match, as it should be \"77778\" instead of \"74524.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim about the attendance being 74524 for week 14 is false. Even though the opponent part is correct except for a minor spelling error, the discrepancy in the attendance makes the entire claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate row 14 under 'week' to find the opponent and attendance.
