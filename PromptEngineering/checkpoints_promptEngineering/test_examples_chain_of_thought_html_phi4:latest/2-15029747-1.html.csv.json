    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Brandi Love being nominated for two awards at the AVN Award ceremony in 2013 is true or false, we need to carefully examine the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Ceremony:**\n   - The claim mentions the \"AVN award\" ceremony. We should locate entries in the table where the `ceremony` column contains \"avn award.\"\n\n2. **Check Year Consistency:**\n   - The year specified is 2013. Therefore, we only consider rows where the `year` column equals 2013.\n\n3. **Count Nominations at AVN Award Ceremony:**\n   - We need to count how many times the `result` column says \"nominated\" for entries that meet both criteria above (i.e., `ceremony` is \"avn award\" and `year` is 2013).\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states Brandi Love was nominated for two awards at this specific ceremony in 2013.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - `year`: 2013\n  - `ceremony`: avn award\n  - `result`: nominated\n  - This row corresponds to the \"milf / cougar performer of the year\" award. \n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - `year`: 2013\n  - `ceremony`: avn award\n  - `result`: nominated\n  - This row corresponds to the \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison)\" award.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There are two rows where Brandi Love was nominated at the AVN Award ceremony in 2013.\n- Both entries show a `result` of \"nominated.\"\n\nThus, the claim is true. The relevant cells that support this conclusion are from Row 1 and Row 2 with `column_name` being `ceremony`, `year`, `result`, and `award`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify entries where the ceremony is 'avn award' and year is 2013.
