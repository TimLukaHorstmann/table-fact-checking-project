    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jabaquara lost 14 games and have 57 against\" is true or false, let's analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim is about the team \"jabaquara.\"\n   - Locate the row where the team name is \"jabaquara.\" This corresponds to `row_index` 11 in the table.\n\n2. **Check the Number of Games Lost:**\n   - In the table, the column \"lost\" indicates how many games the team has lost.\n   - For \"jabaquara\" (at `row_index` 11), the value under the \"lost\" column is 14.\n   - This matches the claim that Jabaquara lost 14 games.\n\n3. **Check the Number of Goals Against:**\n   - The column \"against\" shows how many goals the team has conceded.\n   - For \"jabaquara\" (at `row_index` 11), the value under the \"against\" column is 57.\n   - This matches the claim that Jabaquara have 57 against.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim are verified by the table data for \"jabaquara.\"\n   - Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- The relevant cells from the table are:\n  - Row index 11, column \"lost\" with value 14.\n  - Row index 11, column \"against\" with value 57.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row for 'jabaquara' at row_index 11.
