    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two parts of the statement:\n\n1. All ships (except for 'Fury') were commissioned in May 1935.\n2. The ship named 'Fury' was not commissioned in May 1935.\n\nLet's analyze each row of the table based on these criteria.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n- **Row 1: Fame**\n  - Commissioned date: 26 April 1935\n  - Not in May 1935, so this contradicts the claim that all ships except 'Fury' were commissioned in May 1935.\n\n- **Row 2: Fearless**\n  - Commissioned date: 22 December 1934\n  - Not in May 1935, further contradicting the first part of the claim.\n\n- **Row 3: Firedrake**\n  - Commissioned date: 30 May 1935\n  - Complies with the claim that it was commissioned in May 1935.\n\n- **Row 4: Foresight**\n  - Commissioned date: 15 May 1935\n  - Complies with the claim that it was commissioned in May 1935.\n\n- **Row 5: Forester**\n  - Commissioned date: 29 March 1935\n  - Not in May 1935, contradicting the first part of the claim.\n\n- **Row 6: Fortune**\n  - Commissioned date: 27 April 1935\n  - Not in May 1935, further contradicting the first part of the claim.\n\n- **Row 7: Foxhound**\n  - Commissioned date: 6 June 1935\n  - Not in May 1935, again contradicting the first part of the claim.\n\n- **Row 8: Fury**\n  - Commissioned date: 18 May 1935\n  - This ship was commissioned in May 1935, which contradicts the second part of the claim that 'Fury' was not commissioned in May 1935.\n\n- **Row 9: Faulknor (flotilla leader)**\n  - Commissioned date: 24 May 1935\n  - Complies with the claim that it was commissioned in May 1935.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows:\n- Not all ships were commissioned in May 1935, which contradicts part one of the claim.\n- 'Fury' was indeed commissioned in May 1935, contradicting part two of the claim.\n\nThus, the statement is FALSE. \n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells are those containing the commission dates for each ship:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze each row to check if all ships except 'Fury' were commissioned in May 1935.\",\n    \"'Fame' was commissioned on 26 April 1935, contradicting the first part of the claim.\",\n    \"'Fearless' was commissioned on 22 December 1934, further contradicting the first part.\",\n    \"'Firedrake', 'Foresight', and 'Faulknor (flotilla leader)' comply with May 1935 commissioning.\",\n    \"'Forester' was commissioned on 29 March 1935, further contradicting the first part.\",\n    \"'Fortune' was commissioned on 27 April 1935, further contradicting the first part.\",\n    \"'Foxhound' was commissioned on 6 June 1935, again contradicting the first part.\",\n    \"'Fury' was commissioned on 18 May 1935, which contradicts the second part of the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"26 April 1935\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"22 December 1934\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"30 May 1935\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"15 May 1935\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"29 March 1935\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"27 April 1935\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"6 June 1935\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"18 May 1935\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"commissioned\", \"value\": \"24 May 1935\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
