    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all of the titles were released in the year 1999\" is true or false, we will examine each row in the table for the information about the release years of the movies.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Release Year**:\n   - The column that indicates the release year of the titles is labeled \"year.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row's Release Year**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Year: 1995\n     - Titles in this row were released in 1995, not 1999.\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Year: 1996\n     - Titles in this row were released in 1996, not 1999.\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Year: 1998\n     - Titles in this row were released in 1998, not 1999.\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Year: 1998\n     - Titles in this row were also released in 1998, not 1999.\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Year: 1999\n     - Titles in this row were indeed released in 1999.\n   - **Row 6**:\n     - Year: 1999\n     - Titles in this row were also released in 1999.\n   - **Row 7**:\n     - Year: 2000\n     - Titles in this row were released in 2000, not 1999.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on the Analysis**:\n   - Not all titles listed in the table were released in 1999. Specifically, there are movies from years 1995, 1996, 1998, and 2000 present as well.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"all of the titles were released in the year 1999\" is false.\n\n4. **List Relevant Cells**:\n   - We identified rows where the release years differ from 1999 as relevant for disproving the claim.\n   - These are: Row 1 (Year), Row 2 (Year), Row 3 (Year), Row 4 (Year), and Row 7 (Year).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The column 'year' indicates when each title was released.
