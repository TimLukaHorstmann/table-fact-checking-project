    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to verify two parts from the table:\n\n1. The result of the fight against Rob Constance.\n2. The result of the fight against Wayne Cole.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n**Part 1: Fight with Rob Constance**\n\n- **Locate Row:** Find the row where \"opponent\" is \"rob constance\".\n- **Verify Result and Method:**\n  - Check the \"res\" (result) column for this row.\n  - Check the \"method\" column for this row to see if it matches \"decision (split)\".\n\n**Part 2: Fight with Wayne Cole**\n\n- **Locate Row:** Find the row where \"opponent\" is \"wayne cole\".\n- **Verify Result and Method:**\n  - Check the \"res\" (result) column for this row.\n  - Check the \"method\" column for this row to see if it matches \"ko (punch)\".\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n**Part 1: Rob Constance**\n\n- **Row Index:** Row with opponent \"rob constance\" is row 10.\n- **Result and Method:**\n  - The \"res\" value is \"win\".\n  - The \"method\" value is \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\nThe claim states the result should be a \"decision (split)\", but it is actually a \"decision (unanimous)\". Therefore, this part of the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n**Part 2: Wayne Cole**\n\n- **Row Index:** Row with opponent \"wayne cole\" is row 4.\n- **Result and Method:**\n  - The \"res\" value is \"win\".\n  - The \"method\" value is \"ko (punch)\".\n\nThe claim correctly states the result as a \"ko (punch)\", so this part of the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince one part of the claim is false, the overall claim is FALSE. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identify the rows corresponding to the opponents 'rob constance' and 'wayne cole'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for \"ifl : chicago\":**\n   - Look through the table rows in the \"event\" column to find the entry that matches \"ifl : chicago\".\n   - According to the table, this is found in the third row.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Rounds for \"ifl : chicago\":**\n   - Check the \"round\" column for the same row (third row) where \"ifl : chicago\" is listed.\n   - The value in the \"round\" column is 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Row for \"euphoria : road to the titles\":**\n   - Look through the table rows in the \"event\" column to find the entry that matches \"euphoria : road to the titles\".\n   - According to the table, this is found in the seventh row.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Rounds for \"euphoria : road to the titles\":**\n   - Check the \"round\" column for the same row (seventh row) where \"euphoria : road to the titles\" is listed.\n   - The value in the \"round\" column is 1.\n\n5. **Compare the Number of Rounds:**\n   - \"ifl : chicago\" has 3 rounds.\n   - \"euphoria : road to the titles\" has 1 round.\n   - Since 3 (for \"ifl : chicago\") is greater than 1 (for \"euphoria : road to the titles\"), the claim that \"the ifl : chicago event have a lesser number of rounds than the euphoria : road to the title event\" is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For \"ifl : chicago\", relevant cells are:\n     - Row 3, Column \"event\": \"ifl : chicago\"\n     - Row 3, Column \"round\": 3\n   - For \"euphoria : road to the titles\", relevant cells are:\n     - Row 7, Column \"event\": \"euphoria : road to the titles\"\n     - Row 7, Column \"round\": 1\n\nNow, we can provide the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row for 'ifl : chicago' by checking the 'event' column.
