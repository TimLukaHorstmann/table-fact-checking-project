    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"3 schools have an enrollment of under 10000\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the enrollment numbers for each school listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Enrollment Column:**\n   - The column that contains enrollment data is labeled as \"enrollment.\"\n\n2. **Extract Enrollment Data:**\n   - University of Delaware: 19067\n   - Lebanon Valley College: 2100\n   - University of Rhode Island: 19095\n   - Rutgers University: 56868\n   - Stony Brook University: 23997\n   - West Chester University: 12800\n\n3. **Compare Enrollment Figures to 10000:**\n   - **University of Delaware:** 19067 (not under 10000)\n   - **Lebanon Valley College:** 2100 (under 10000)\n   - **University of Rhode Island:** 19095 (not under 10000)\n   - **Rutgers University:** 56868 (not under 10000)\n   - **Stony Brook University:** 23997 (not under 10000)\n   - **West Chester University:** 12800 (not under 10000)\n\n4. **Count the Schools with Enrollment Under 10000:**\n   - Only Lebanon Valley College has an enrollment of less than 10000.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"3 schools have an enrollment of under 10000.\" However, only 1 school meets this criterion based on our evaluation.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because there is only 1 school with enrollment under 10000, not 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified the 'enrollment' column and extracted the data for each school. We then compared these figures to 10000 to determine how many schools have enrollments below this number. Only Lebanon Valley College has an enrollment under 10000, making the claim that 3 schools do so FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
