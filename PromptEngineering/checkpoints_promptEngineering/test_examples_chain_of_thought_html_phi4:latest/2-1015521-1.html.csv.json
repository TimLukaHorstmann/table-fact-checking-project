    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the aircraft Bell 212 Twin Huey be a trainer type\" is true or false, we need to examine the information provided in the table about the Bell 212 Twin Huey.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the \"Bell 212 Twin Huey\" aircraft.\n   - By scanning through the rows of the table, we locate:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>bell 212 twin huey</td>\n       <td>united states</td>\n       <td>transport / utility</td>\n       <td>bell 212</td>\n       <td>4</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the \"Type\" Column:**\n   - We focus on the \"type\" column for this row to verify the aircraft's type.\n   - The entry in the \"type\" column is \"transport / utility.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the Bell 212 Twin Huey is a \"trainer type.\"\n   - Comparing this with the table, we see that its actual type is listed as \"transport / utility,\" not \"trainer.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the type of the aircraft does not match the claimed type (\"trainer\"), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells from the row for Bell 212 Twin Huey are:\n  - Row index: 16\n  - Column name: \"aircraft\" with value \"bell 212 twin huey\"\n  - Column name: \"type\" with value \"transport / utility\"\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row for 'Bell 212 Twin Huey' and checked its type in the table. The type listed is 'transport / utility,' not 'trainer.' Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\", \"value\": \"bell 212 twin huey\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"transport / utility\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
