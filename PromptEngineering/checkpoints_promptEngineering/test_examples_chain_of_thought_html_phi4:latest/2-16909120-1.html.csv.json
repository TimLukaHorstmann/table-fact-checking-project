    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to carefully analyze the data provided in the table, focusing specifically on the rows where the column named \"Name\" contains entries with the name \"granville\". We will also compare the numbers listed under the columns \"1st lbsc number\" and \"lbsc Name\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Name \"granville\":**\n   - Look through each row in the table to find where the \"Name\" column contains \"granville\".\n   - From the data, we observe that there is one such row:\n     - Row 216: The name listed is \"granville\".\n\n2. **Check '1st lbsc number' for Row with Name \"granville\":**\n   - For the identified row (Row 216), check the value under the column \"1st lbsc number\".\n   - The \"1st lbsc number\" for this row is \"-\". This indicates that no specific number is assigned.\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim Regarding 'lbsc Number':**\n   - The claim states that \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville.\"\n   - We need to verify if there's any entry where \"granville\" appears in the column \"lbsc Name\", and check its corresponding \"1st lbsc number\".\n\n4. **Check 'lbsc Name' Across All Rows:**\n   - Review each row to see if \"granville\" is listed under the \"lbsc Name\" column.\n   - From the data, no row has \"granville\" in the \"lbsc Name\" column.\n\n5. **Analyze Row 217 for Contextual Clarity:**\n   - The claim references the number 217, which implies that this row should have some relevance to the statement about \"granville\".\n   - In Row 217:\n     - The name is \"northcote\", not \"granville\".\n     - The \"1st lbsc number\" is \"620\".\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - There are no rows where \"granville\" appears in the \"lbsc Name\" column, which means there cannot be a comparison or determination of whether 217 is the lowest such number.\n   - The row with name \"granville\" does not have an associated \"1st lbsc number\", thus making it impossible to evaluate against other entries.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe claim is false because there are no entries where \"granville\" appears in the \"lbsc Name\" column, rendering any comparison meaningless. Therefore, the statement about 217 being the lowest such number cannot hold true under these conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows with 'granville' as a name; Row 216 has this name but lacks an '1st lbsc number'. Next, check for any entry where 'granville' is in the 'lbsc Name' column, finding none. The claim about 217 being the lowest such number is invalid because no relevant comparisons can be made without 'granville' appearing in the 'lbsc Name' column.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 216, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 216, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 217, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 217, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
