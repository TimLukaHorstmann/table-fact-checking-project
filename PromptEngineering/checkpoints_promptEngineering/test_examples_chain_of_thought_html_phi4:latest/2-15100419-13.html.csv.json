Justin Durant is an offensive tackle.\n2. He was drafted from Arizona State.\n3. His draft pick number is 252.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Check if Justin Durant is listed as an Offensive Tackle:**\n   - Locate the row with the name \"justin durant.\"\n   - From the table, find:\n     - Row with `name` = \"justin durant\"\n     - Check the `position` column for this row.\n   - The table shows that Justin Durant's position is \"linebacker,\" not \"offensive tackle.\"\n\n2. **Verify if Justin Durant was drafted from Arizona State:**\n   - Still using the same row with `name` = \"justin durant.\"\n   - Check the `college` column for this row.\n   - The table indicates that Justin Durant's college is \"hampton,\" not \"arizona state.\"\n\n3. **Confirm if Justin Durant's draft pick number is 252:**\n   - Again, using the same row with `name` = \"justin durant.\"\n   - Check the `pick` and `overall` columns for this row.\n   - The table shows that Justin Durant was picked at 16 in round 2, which corresponds to overall pick number 48. This is not pick number 252.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false based on all three components being incorrect:\n\n- Justin Durant's position is \"linebacker,\" not \"offensive tackle.\"\n- He attended \"hampton\" college, not \"arizona state.\"\n- His draft pick number was 48, not 252.\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n- Row index: 1 (second row of the body)\n  - `name`: \"justin durant\"\n  - `position`: \"linebacker\"\n  - `college`: \"hampton\"\n  - `pick`: 16\n  - `overall`: 48\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Justin Durant is an offensive tackle, drafted from Arizona State with pick number 252.
