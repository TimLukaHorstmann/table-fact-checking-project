The Blue Bombers defeating the Edmonton Eskimos with a score of 30 - 23 at home.\n2. A week later, the Blue Bombers losing to the Edmonton Eskimos on the road with a score of 36 - 22.\n\nLet's analyze these steps using the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Locate the game against the Edmonton Eskimos:**\n   - We need to find the match where the Blue Bombers won against the Edmonton Eskimos.\n   - According to row 14, on September 26th, the Blue Bombers defeated the Edmonton Eskimos with a score of 30 - 23. The result is marked as \"win,\" and this matches the first part of our claim.\n\n2. **Verify the location:**\n   - Although the table does not explicitly state whether the game was home or away, it can be inferred by examining other games:\n     - For home games, the attendance figures tend to be higher.\n     - Compare with known road games (e.g., against teams like the Saskatchewan Roughriders and Toronto Argonauts) which have lower attendances compared to the maximum.\n\n3. **Check the subsequent game a week later:**\n   - The next game for the Blue Bombers is in row 15, on October 4th.\n   - In this game, they lost to the Edmonton Eskimos with a score of 36 - 22. The result is marked as \"loss.\"\n\n4. **Verify the location for the second match:**\n   - As observed earlier, road games generally have lower attendances.\n   - For row 15, the attendance is 40,453 which is one of the highest in the table and suggests it was an away game compared to their average home game.\n\n5. **Confirm the timing:**\n   - The dates align correctly; September 26th (win) followed by October 4th (loss), fitting the \"a week prior\" description in the claim.\n\nBased on these analyses, both conditions of the claim are met:\n\n- The Blue Bombers defeated the Edmonton Eskimos with a score of 30 - 23 at home.\n- A week later, they lost to the Eskimos by a score of 36 - 22 on the road.\n\nHere is the final JSON output reflecting this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the game where Blue Bombers defeated Edmonton Eskimos: September 26, 30-23 win.\",\n    \"Infer home game by comparing attendance figures.\",\n    \"Locate next game against Edmonton Eskimos: October 4, 36-22 loss.\",\n    \"Verify it as an away game through higher attendance compared to typical road games.\",\n    \"Confirm sequence of events matches the claim's timing.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we must analyze specific rows from the table to confirm whether the events described occurred in the sequence mentioned.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Against Edmonton Eskimos:**\n   - Look for entries where the opponent is \"edmonton eskimos.\"\n\n2. **Verify Scores and Locations:**\n   - Check if there was a match where the score was \"30 - 23\" (indicating a win against Edmonton) and label it as home or away.\n   - Confirm another match with a score of \"36 - 22\" against Edmonton Eskimos, indicating a loss.\n\n3. **Establish Sequential Order:**\n   - Ensure that the win occurred one week before the subsequent loss.\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 14**:\n  - `opponent`: \"edmonton eskimos\"\n  - `score`: \"30 - 23\"\n  - `result`: \"win\"\n  - `date`: \"sept 26\"\n  - The record shows \"5 - 8,\" implying the team won their fifth game and had eight losses before this match.\n\n- **Row 15**:\n  - `opponent`: \"edmonton eskimos\"\n  - `score`: \"36 - 22\"\n  - `result`: \"loss\"\n  - `date`: \"oct 4\"\n  - The record changes to \"5 - 9,\" indicating a loss that follows the previous win.\n\n#### Sequence and Location:\n\n- The match on September 26th (Row 14) is followed by the match on October 4th (Row 15).\n- The location of these matches isn't directly stated in the table, but based on typical sports scheduling, if a team plays at home one week and then on the road the next, we can infer:\n  - September 26th could be considered a home game.\n  - October 4th would then be an away game.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the team defeated Edmonton Eskimos 30-24 at home and lost to them 36-22 on the road a week later. However, based on the table:\n- The score of the win was actually \"30 - 23,\" not \"30 - 24.\"\n- All other conditions (sequence, opponent, and outcome) match.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified two matches against Edmonton Eskimos with scores '30 - 23' (win) and '36 - 22' (loss).
