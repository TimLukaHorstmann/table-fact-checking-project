Let's break down our reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Competitions:**\n   - We focus on the \"competition\" column to see which matches were part of a World Cup qualifying competition.\n   \n2. **Count World Cup Qualifying Matches:**\n   - Go through each row and count how many times \"1994 world cup qualifying,\" \"1998 world cup qualifying,\" or similar phrases appear in the \"competition\" column.\n\n3. **Assess Total Number of Matches:**\n   - Count the total number of matches listed to understand what proportion is for World Cup qualifying.\n\n4. **Calculate Proportion and Determine Claim Validity:**\n   - If a majority (more than half) of the matches are not for World Cup qualifiers, then the claim that \"very few\" matches were for World Cup qualification might be considered true.\n   \n5. **Review Results:**\n   - After counting, compare the proportion of qualifying matches to non-qualifying matches.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Matches Listed in Table:**\n   - Total number of rows (matches) = 17\n\n2. **World Cup Qualifying Matches:**\n   - \"1994 world cup qualifying\": \n     - Rows with this competition: 3 (rows with indices 0, 1, 2)\n   - \"1998 world cup qualifying\":\n     - Rows with this competition: 7 (rows with indices 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)\n\n3. **Total World Cup Qualifying Matches:**\n   - Total = 3 (for 1994) + 7 (for 1998) = 10 matches\n\n4. **Proportion of World Cup Qualifying Matches:**\n   - Proportion = Number of qualifying matches / Total number of matches\n   - Proportion = 10 / 17 \u2248 0.588\n\n5. **Conclusion on Claim Validity:**\n   - Since approximately 58.8% of the matches are for World Cup qualification, more than half of the matches listed are indeed for World Cup qualifying competitions.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"very few\" of the matches were for World Cup qualification is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells include all instances where the competition is either \"1994 world cup qualifying\" or \"1998 world cup qualifying.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified which matches in the table are listed under 'world cup qualifying' by checking the 'competition' column.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to evaluate whether there are three games listed in the table where the total points scored by both teams resulted in a draw (i.e., equal scores). Let's break down our reasoning step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Draw Matches\n\nA \"draw\" in football is indicated when the score column shows an equal number for both teams. We'll look at each row and identify those where the result is marked as \"draw.\"\n\n- **31 October 1993** - Venue: Sydney, Australia; Score: 1 - 1; Result: Draw\n- **14 December 1997** - Venue: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Score: 0 - 0; Result: Draw\n- **22 November 1997** - Venue: Tehran, Iran; Score: 1 - 1; Result: Draw\n- **29 November 1997** - Venue: Melbourne, Australia; Score: 2 - 2; Result: Draw\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Draws\n\nFrom the above step, we identified four matches that ended in a draw:\n1. 31 October 1993 with a score of 1 - 1.\n2. 14 December 1997 with a score of 0 - 0.\n3. 22 November 1997 with a score of 1 - 1.\n4. 29 November 1997 with a score of 2 - 2.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"3 games have a total of zero point score end in a draw.\" This implies we need at least three matches where the total points scored by both teams equals zero, which is not possible since a match must always have some non-zero scores to be counted. However, focusing on the essence of what is being asked:\n\n- The phrase \"total of zero point score\" could be interpreted incorrectly, as it suggests an impossible scenario (scores adding up to zero). \n- The focus should instead be on identifying if there are at least three matches with equal scores.\n\nWe have identified four such draw matches from our analysis. Therefore, the claim is effectively true under a reasonable interpretation: there are indeed more than three games that ended in a draw.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this reasoning process, we conclude that the statement is TRUE because there are indeed three (and actually four) games that ended in a draw.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified matches with equal scores indicating a draw. We found four such matches: 31 October 1993 (1-1), 14 December 1997 (0-0), 22 November 1997 (1-1), and 29 November 1997 (2-2).
