    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's evaluate it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Claim\n\nThe claim states:\n- A draft pick from Calgery Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, and Edmonton plays the position \"OL\" (Offensive Lineman).\n\n### Step 2: Extract Relevant Information from the Table\n\nWe need to look at the rows corresponding to each team mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **Calgary Stampeders**\n   - Look for the row with \"calgary stampeders\" under the \"cfl team\" column.\n   - This corresponds to row index 4 (0-based indexing).\n   - Relevant information: \n     - Player: Doug Brown\n     - Position: DL (Defensive Lineman)\n     - College: Simon Fraser\n\n2. **Montreal Alouettes**\n   - Look for the row with \"montreal alouettes\" under the \"cfl team\" column.\n   - This corresponds to row index 5 (0-based indexing).\n   - Relevant information:\n     - Player: Steve Charbonneau\n     - Position: DL (Defensive Lineman)\n     - College: New Hampshire\n\n3. **Edmonton**\n   - Look for rows with \"edmonton eskimos\" or just \"edmonton\" under the \"cfl team\" column.\n   - These correspond to row indices 2 and 7, respectively:\n     - Row index 2 (0-based indexing) corresponds to Edmonton Eskimos:\n       - Player: Ian Franklin\n       - Position: CB (Cornerback)\n       - College: Weber State\n     - Row index 7 (0-based indexing) corresponds to Edmonton:\n       - Player: Mark Farraway\n       - Position: DL (Defensive Lineman)\n       - College: St. Francis Xavier\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Claim Against Extracted Information\n\n- For **Calgary Stampeders**, Doug Brown plays as a DL, not OL.\n- For **Montreal Alouettes**, Steve Charbonneau plays as a DL, not OL.\n- For **Edmonton**, neither Ian Franklin (CB) nor Mark Farraway (DL) plays OL.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNo player from Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, or Edmonton plays the position \"OL\".
