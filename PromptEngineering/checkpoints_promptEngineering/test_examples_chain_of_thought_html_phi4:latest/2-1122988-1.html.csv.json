This matches the claim that he started at grid position 26.\n\n3. **Verify Laps Completed**: Next, we check how many laps Pascal Fabre completed:\n   - In the \"laps\" column, it shows that he completed `71` laps.\n\n4. **Cross-Verification**: The table entry for Pascal Fabre states his time/status as \"+ 5 laps\". This indicates that he finished 5 laps behind the leader, which is consistent with completing 71 laps while others completed more (like those who completed 76 or 75 laps).\n\nBy confirming both the grid position and the number of laps, we have verified each aspect of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table: Pascal Fabre started at grid 26 and completed 71 laps. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Pascal Fabre's row in the table to find his starting position and number of laps completed.
