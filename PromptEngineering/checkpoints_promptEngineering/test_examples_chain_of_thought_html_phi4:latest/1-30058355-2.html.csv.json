    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific points:\n\n1. Check if \"cancelled no time\" appears for Saturday, 20th August.\n2. Confirm the speed and time for Friday, 26th August.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Check Saturday (Sat 20 Aug):**\n   - We look at all rows under the column \"sat 20 aug\".\n   - Every row in this column shows \"cancelled no time\". This confirms that all entries for Saturday are indeed marked as \"cancelled no time\".\n\n2. **Check Friday (Fri 26 Aug) for Jamie Coward:**\n   - Identify the row where \"rider\" is \"jamie coward 600cc suzuki\".\n   - Check the entry under the column \"fri 26 aug\" for this rider.\n   - The entry shows \"19'41.41 114.971 mph\".\n\n3. **Verify Claim Consistency:**\n   - The claim states that \"cancel no time be show for sat 20 aug when fri 26 aug be 19'41.41 114.971 mph\".\n   - Since \"cancelled no time\" is shown for all entries on Saturday and Jamie Coward's entry on Friday matches the specified time and speed, the claim aligns with the table data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information in the table: all riders have \"cancelled no time\" for Saturday, 20th August, and Jamie Coward has a recorded time of \"19'41.41 114.971 mph\" on Friday, 26th August.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

The time and speed for Wednesday, August 24th should be \"20'22.05\" with a speed of \"111.148 mph\".\n2. For the same rider, the time on Monday, August 22nd should be \"19'56.16\" with a speed of \"113.553 mph\".\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the Rider:**\n   - We need to find which rider has these times and speeds.\n\n2. **Verify Wednesday's Time for Each Rider:**\n   - Check the time and speed for each rider on \"Wed 24 Aug\" to see who matches \"20'22.05 111.148 mph\".\n\n3. **Verify Monday's Time for the Identified Rider:**\n   - Once we identify the rider from step 2, check their time and speed on \"Mon 22 Aug\" to verify if it is \"19'56.16 113.553 mph\".\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Check Wednesday's Data:**\n   - Jamie Coward (Row 1): 19'41.41 114.971 mph\n   - Michael Sweeney (Row 2): 19'58.63 113.320 mph\n   - Grant Wagstaff (Row 3): 20'07.24 112.511 mph\n   - Stephen McKnight (Row 4): 20'12.61 112.013 mph\n   - Andrew Brady (Row 5): 19'52.95 113.859 mph\n   - Paul Smyth (Row 6): 19'59.73 113.216 mph\n   - David Lumsden (Row 7): -- no time\n   - Andy Fenton (Row 8): -- no time\n   - Dan Sayle (Row 9): **20'22.05 111.148 mph**\n\n2. **Verify Monday's Data for Dan Sayle:**\n   - For Dan Sayle, check \"Mon 22 Aug\": 20'22.05 111.148 mph\n\n3. **Check if the Claim Matches for Dan Sayle:**\n   - The claim states that on Wednesday (24 Aug), it should be \"20'22.05 111.148 mph\". This matches Dan Sayle's time and speed.\n   - However, the claim also states that on Monday (22 Aug) for the same rider, it should be \"19'56.16 113.553 mph\".\n   - For Dan Sayle on Monday: 20'22.05 111.148 mph, which does not match \"19'56.16 113.553 mph\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while the Wednesday time for Dan Sayle matches the claimed time and speed, his Monday time and speed do not match the claimed values.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identified that '20'22.05 111.148 mph' on Wed 24 Aug corresponds to Dan Sayle.
