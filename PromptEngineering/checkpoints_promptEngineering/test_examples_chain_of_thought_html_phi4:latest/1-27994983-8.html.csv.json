This can be found in the second column under \"artist\".\n   - The relevant row for Brolle is where the artist name matches \"brolle\".\n\n2. **Verify Juries and Viewers Scores:**\n   - Check the number of juries' votes received by Brolle.

The claim states that Brolle received 21 votes from viewers.\n   - Locate the \"viewers\" column in Brolle\u2019s row and verify this information.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Score:**\n   - According to the claim, Brolle's total score is 29. This should be confirmed by adding the number of juries' votes (8) and viewers' votes (21).\n   - Verify that the \"total\" column for Brolle reflects this sum as 29.\n\n5. **Verify Placement:**\n   - Finally, confirm the placement or rank in the competition for Brolle.
