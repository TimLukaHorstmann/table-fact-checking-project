    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify two aspects from the table: \n\n1. Whether Rowan Barrett's year of birth is 1972.\n2. Whether his current age aligns with being born in that year.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Rowan Barrett in the Table**:\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to \"Rowan Barrett\" in the table.\n\n2. **Verify Year of Birth**:\n   - Check the \"year born (age)\" column for Rowan Barrett's entry to confirm if it states he was born in 1972.\n   \n3. **Verify Current Age**:\n   - The same cell should also provide his age, which can be used to cross-check the year of birth.\n\n4. **Cross-Verification**:\n   - Calculate the current year from the given age and year of birth to ensure consistency.\n\n### Detailed Verification\n\n1. **Locate Rowan Barrett in the Table**:\n   - Row 6 contains \"Rowan Barrett\" as the player name.\n\n2. **Verify Year of Birth**:\n   - In Row 6, under the \"year born (age)\" column, it states \"November 24, 1972 (age41)\". This confirms that his year of birth is indeed 1972.\n\n3. **Verify Current Age**:\n   - The age listed is 41. Assuming the current year is 2013 (since ages are calculated as of a specific point in time), subtracting 41 from 2013 gives us 1972, which matches the provided year of birth.\n\n4. **Cross-Verification**:\n   - As of November 24, 2013, Rowan Barrett would turn 41, confirming that his age and year of birth are consistent with being born in 1972.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"1972 be the year when rowan barrett be bear\" is TRUE based on the table's information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate Rowan Barrett in the table (Row 6). 2. Verify his year of birth from the 'year born (age)' column, which states November 24, 1972 (age41). 3.
