    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the majority of replay games were won by the home team\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data from the provided table specifically focusing on the replay matches.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Replay Matches**: \n   - Look for rows in the table with \"replay\" under the \"tie no\" column. These rows represent replay games.\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - For each replay match, identify which team is listed as the home team and check if they won the game by looking at the \"score\" column.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Replay Match**:\n\n    - **Match 1**: \n      - Row: 3rd row in table\n      - Home Team: Northampton Town\n      - Score: 1-2 (Northampton Town lost, as the score is lower than the opponent's)\n      \n    - **Match 2**: \n      - Row: 6th replay match overall, 14th row in table\n      - Home Team: Halifax Town\n      - Score: 1-2 (Halifax Town lost)\n\n    - **Match 3**: \n      - Row: 7th replay match overall, 16th row in table\n      - Home Team: Leyton Orient\n      - Score: 4-1 (Leyton Orient won)\n\n    - **Match 4**: \n      - Row: 8th replay match overall, 18th row in table\n      - Home Team: Chester City\n      - Score: 4-0 (Chester City won)\n\n4. **Count Wins by Home Teams**:\n   - Leyton Orient and Chester City each won their respective replay matches as the home team.\n   - Northampton Town and Halifax Town did not win as the home team.\n\n5. **Determine Majority**:\n   - Out of 4 replay matches, 2 were won by the home teams (Leyton Orient and Chester City).\n   - Therefore, exactly half of the replay games were won by the home team, not a majority.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince only half of the replay games were won by the home team, it does not constitute a \"majority.\" A majority would require more than half to be true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified four replay matches and determined that two were won by the home teams.

This is not a shut-out.\n\n3. **Check Other Games for Shut-Outs:**\n   - Review all games to see if any game has a score of 4-0.\n   - None of the other rows show a score of 4-0, and no other game involves Woking as a team that achieved a shut-out.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Claim:**\n   - The claim states Woking played the highest scoring shut out game with a score of 4 to 0.\n   - Since Woking did not play any shut-out game (let alone one with a score of 4-0), the claim is false.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Woking's game in Row 5 was scored at 5-1, which is not a shut-out.
