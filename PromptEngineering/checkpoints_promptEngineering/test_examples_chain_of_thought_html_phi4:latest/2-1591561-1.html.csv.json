We need to find all entries in the table where the \"aircraft\" column matches \"ju - 52\".\n\n2. **Check the Location for ju - 52:**\n   - Once we identify the row(s) with \"ju - 52\", we check the \"location\" column to see if it is \"off maputo\".\n   \n3. **Verify Fatalities for ju - 52:**\n   - We also need to verify the \"fatalities\" value in the same row(s) to see if it matches \"0 / 108\".\n\n### Examination of Table Data:\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - **aircraft**: \"ju - 52\"\n  - **location**: \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\"\n  - **fatalities**: \"unknown\"\n\nFrom this examination, we can conclude the following about the claim:\n\n- The \"ju - 52\" aircraft is indeed present in the table.\n- However, its location is \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\", not \"off maputo\".\n- Additionally, the fatalities for the \"ju - 52\" entry are listed as \"unknown\", not \"0 / 108\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"the ju - 52 aircraft have a location of off maputo and 0 / 108 fatalities\" is **FALSE** because:\n- The location does not match (\"lagoa p\u00e1ti\" vs. \"off maputo\").\n- The fatalities do not match (\"unknown\" vs. \"0 / 108\").\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for the \"ju - 52\" aircraft are in row index 2, specifically:\n- **Row Index**: 1 (since table rows typically start at index 0)\n- **Columns**:\n  - \"location\": \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\"\n  - \"aircraft\": \"ju - 52\"\n  - \"fatalities\": \"unknown\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is about a 'ju - 52' aircraft with a location of 'off maputo' and fatalities '0 / 108'.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to examine the data related to the aircraft with the tail number `c9 - bad` and check if the number of fatalities is listed as \"unknown.\" Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Tail Numbers:**\n   - The column that lists the tail numbers is labeled `tail number`.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with the Tail Number `c9 - bad`:**\n   - We need to scan through each row in the table to find where `c9 - bad` appears under the `tail number` column.\n\n3. **Check the Corresponding Fatalities:**\n   - Once we identify the row with tail number `c9 - bad`, we will look at the corresponding value in the `fatalities` column for that row.\n\n4. **Verify if Fatalities are \"Unknown\":**\n   - We need to determine whether the fatalities listed for this particular aircraft is marked as \"unknown.\"\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- In the table provided:\n  - The row where `tail number` is `c9 - bad` is at index 4 (considering zero-based indexing). This row corresponds to the aircraft located in Lichinga with a Boeing 737-200.\n  - In this row, under the `fatalities` column, the value listed is `0 / 108`.\n\nSince the number of fatalities for the aircraft with tail number `c9 - bad` is `0 / 108`, it is not \"unknown.\" Therefore, the claim that \"the aircraft with the tail number c9 - bad have an unknown number of fatalities\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's how to format this in the requested JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the column 'tail number' and found 'c9 - bad' at row index 4.
