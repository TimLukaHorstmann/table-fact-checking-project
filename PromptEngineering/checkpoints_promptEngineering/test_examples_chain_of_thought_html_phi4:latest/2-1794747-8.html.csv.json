    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Imelda Staunton winning the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical category in 2013 is true or false, we will analyze the given HTML table step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Year and Award Ceremony:**\n   - The claim specifies the year as \"2013\" and the award ceremony as the \"Laurence Olivier Award.\"\n   \n2. **Locate Rows Corresponding to 2013 Laurence Olivier Awards:**\n   - We need to find rows in the table where both the `year` is \"2013\" and the `award ceremony` is \"laurence olivier award.\"\n\n3. **Examine Each Relevant Row for the Category and Result:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct rows, we look at each row's `category` to find \"best actress in a musical.\"\n   - We then check the `result` column to see if it says \"won\" for that category.\n\n4. **Identify the Nominee:**\n   - Ensure that the nominee listed under the relevant category is indeed \"imelda staunton.\"\n\n5. **Verify All Conditions:**\n   - Confirm that all conditions of the claim are met: year (2013), award ceremony (Laurence Olivier Award), category (best actress in a musical), nominee (Imelda Staunton), and result (won).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - `year`: 2013\n  - `award ceremony`: laurence olivier award\n  - `category`: best musical revival\n  - `nominee`: best musical revival\n  - `result`: won\n  - This row is not relevant because the category does not match.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - `year`: 2013\n  - `award ceremony`: laurence olivier award\n  - `category`: best actor in a musical\n  - `nominee`: michael ball\n  - `result`: won\n  - This row is not relevant because the category does not match.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - `year`: 2013\n  - `award ceremony`: laurence olivier award\n  - `category`: best actress in a musical\n  - `nominee`: imelda staunton\n  - `result`: won\n  - This row matches all the conditions of the claim.\n\n- **Rows 5, 6, and 7**:\n  - These rows have different categories and results (nominated), so they are not relevant to the claim about \"best actress in a musical.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical category in 2013\" is true.
