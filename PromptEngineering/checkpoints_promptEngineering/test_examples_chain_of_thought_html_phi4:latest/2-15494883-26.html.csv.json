    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to carefully analyze the information provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states two things:\n     1. Vit\u00f3ria airport has the highest capacity utilization.\n     2. It runs at 222.5% capacity.\n\n2. **Analyzing Capacity Utilization:**\n   - We need to examine the \"capacity in use\" column for all rows to see which airport has the highest percentage value.\n   - The values under the \"capacity in use\" column are:\n     - S\u00e3o Paulo (Rank 1): 113.4%\n     - S\u00e3o Paulo (Rank 2): 78.4%\n     - Bras\u00edlia (Rank 3): 134.1%\n     - Rio de Janeiro (Rank 4): 40.2%\n     - Rio de Janeiro (Rank 5): 152.7%\n     - Salvador: 69.1%\n     - Porto Alegre: 52.7%\n     - Belo Horizonte: 213.0%\n     - Recife: 63.5%\n     - Curitiba: 81.2%\n     - Fortaleza: 77.3%\n     - Florian\u00f3polis: 125.7%\n     - Manaus: 75.4%\n     - Bel\u00e9m: 49.3%\n     - Vit\u00f3ria: 222.5%\n\n3. **Identifying the Maximum Capacity Utilization:**\n   - The highest value in the \"capacity in use\" column is 222.5% for Vit\u00f3ria (Rank 15).\n\n4. **Verifying Both Parts of the Claim:**\n   - Part 1: Vit\u00f3ria airport has the highest capacity utilization at 222.5%. This is TRUE based on our analysis.\n   - Part 2: It runs at 222.5% capacity. This matches the value in the table for Vit\u00f3ria, so this part is also TRUE.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell for verifying the highest capacity utilization and its percentage is at row index 15 (Rank 15) under the \"capacity in use\" column.\n\nHere's the final answer formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Vit\u00f3ria airport has the highest capacity utilization at 222.5%.

Check if Vit\u00f3ria also has the least annual growth.\n\nLet's break down each step:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Most Over Capacity Airport\n- The \"capacity in use\" column shows how much of the airport\u2019s capacity is being utilized, expressed as a percentage.\n- To find the most over-capacity airport, we need to identify the location with the highest percentage in the \"capacity in use\" column.\n\nFrom the table:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 113.4%\n- Bras\u00edlia: 134.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro: 40.2%, 152.7%\n- Salvador: 69.1%\n- Porto Alegre: 52.7%\n- Belo Horizonte: 213.0%\n- Recife: 63.5%\n- Curitiba: 81.2%\n- Fortaleza: 77.3%\n- Florian\u00f3polis: 125.7%\n- Manaus: 75.4%\n- Bel\u00e9m: 49.3%\n- Vit\u00f3ria: 222.5%\n\nThe highest \"capacity in use\" percentage is for Belo Horizonte at 213.0%, followed by Vit\u00f3ria at 222.5%.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Vit\u00f3ria has the Least Annual Growth\n- The \"annual change\" column shows the growth rate of passengers, expressed as a percentage.\n- To find the airport with the least annual growth, we need to identify the location with the lowest percentage in the \"annual change\" column.\n\nFrom the table:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 12.8%, 11.7%\n- Bras\u00edlia: 45.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro: 30.4%, 9.2%\n- Salvador: 20.0%\n- Porto Alegre: 11.6%\n- Belo Horizonte: 7.5%\n- Recife: 16.1%\n- Curitiba: 13.0%\n- Fortaleza: 24.0%\n- Florian\u00f3polis: 7.8%\n- Manaus: 10.3%\n- Bel\u00e9m: 13.5%\n- Vit\u00f3ria: 6.1%\n\nThe lowest \"annual change\" percentage is for Vit\u00f3ria at 6.1%.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Vit\u00f3ria has the highest capacity in use percentage (222.5%) but it's not the most over-capacity airport since Belo Horizonte has a higher value of 213.0%.\n- However, Vit\u00f3ria does have the least annual growth rate at 6.1%.\n\nThe claim states that \"the most over capacity airport, Vit\u00f3ria, be also the airport that has seen the least annual growth.\" This is FALSE because although Vit\u00f3ria has the least annual growth, it is not the most over-capacity airport.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the highest 'capacity in use' percentage to determine the most over capacity airport.\",\n    \"Vit\u00f3ria has a 'capacity in use' of 222.5%, but Belo Horizonte has a higher value at 213.0%.\",\n    \"Check for the lowest 'annual change' percentage to find the airport with the least annual growth.\",\n    \"Vit\u00f3ria has the lowest 'annual change' at 6.1%.\",\n    \"The claim is false because Vit\u00f3ria is not the most over capacity airport.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The 'annual change' indicates the percentage increase or decrease in passenger numbers compared to the previous year.\n\nHere's how I will evaluate this claim step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Data**: \n   - Each row corresponds to a specific ranking and location, providing data on total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use.\n   - The 'annual change' column shows whether there has been an increase or decrease in passenger numbers.\n\n2. **Interpret Positive and Negative Change**:\n   - A positive percentage (e.g., 12.8%) indicates an increase in the number of passengers from the previous year.\n   - A negative percentage would indicate a decrease, but none are shown here as all values are positive.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Entry**: \n   - For each row, examine the 'annual change' value to determine if it's positive or negative.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Collect information on which rows have a positive 'annual change', as these indicate an increase in use.\n   \n5. **Conclusion Based on Data**:\n   - If any entry has a positive percentage, the claim is false because not all airports have seen a decrease.\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n- Row 1: S\u00e3o Paulo, 12.8% (increase)\n- Row 2: S\u00e3o Paulo, 11.7% (increase)\n- Row 3: Bras\u00edlia, 45.1% (increase)\n- Row 4: Rio de Janeiro, 30.4% (increase)\n- Row 5: Rio de Janeiro, 9.2% (increase)\n- Row 6: Salvador, 20.0% (increase)\n- Row 7: Porto Alegre, 11.6% (increase)\n- Row 8: Belo Horizonte, 7.5% (increase)\n- Row 9: Recife, 16.1% (increase)\n- Row 10: Curitiba, 13.0% (increase)\n- Row 11: Fortaleza, 24.0% (increase)\n- Row 12: Florian\u00f3polis, 7.8% (increase)\n- Row 13: Manaus, 10.3% (increase)\n- Row 14: Bel\u00e9m, 13.5% (increase)\n- Row 15: Vit\u00f3ria, 6.1% (increase)\n\nAll the entries show a positive annual change percentage, meaning all airports have experienced an increase in use.\n\nFinal conclusion:\nThe claim is FALSE because every airport on the list has seen an increase in passenger numbers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each row's 'annual change' value indicates whether there was an increase or decrease in passengers.
