We need to locate Hurac\u00e1n in the table.\n\n2. **Locate Hurac\u00e1n's Row:**\n   - Scanning through the rows, we find that Hurac\u00e1n is listed on row 5 of the table.\n\n3. **Check Points for Specific Seasons:**\n   - The claim specifies points scored by Hurac\u00e1n in two specific seasons:\n     - **1992-93:** According to the claim, Hurac\u00e1n should have 38 points.\n     - **1993-94:** According to the claim, Hurac\u00e1n should have 43 points.\n\n4. **Verify Points for 1992-93:**\n   - In row 5, under the column \"1992 - 93\", we see the value is indeed 38, which matches the claim.\n\n5. **Verify Points for 1993-94:**\n   - In the same row (row 5), under the column \"1993 - 94\", the value listed is 43, which also matches the claim.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both specified points for Hurac\u00e1n in the seasons 1992-93 and 1993-94 match those given in the table.
