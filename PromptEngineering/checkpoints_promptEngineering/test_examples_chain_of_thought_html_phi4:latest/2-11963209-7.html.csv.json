    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Nowitzki was the leading scorer in less than half the games,\" we need to determine how many games Dirk Nowitzki was the leading scorer compared to the total number of games listed.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Total Number of Games:**  \n   Count all the rows in the table, as each row represents a game involving the Mavericks.\n   \n2. **Count Games Where Nowitzki Was the Leading Scorer:**  \n   Look at the \"leading scorer\" column to identify which games had Dirk Nowitzki as the leading scorer.\n\n3. **Comparison of Counts:**  \n   Compare the number of games where Nowitzki was the leading scorer against the total number of games to see if it is less than half.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Total Number of Games:**  \n  There are 14 rows in the table, indicating 14 games involving the Mavericks.\n  \n- **Games Where Nowitzki Was Leading Scorer:**  \n  By examining the \"leading scorer\" column:\n  - On February 6, 2008, Dirk Nowitzki scored 29 points.\n  - On February 8, 2008, he scored 21 points.\n  - On February 10, 2008, he scored 21 points.\n  - On February 13, 2008, he scored 37 points.\n  - On February 14, 2008, he scored 36 points.\n  - On February 20, 2008, he scored 31 points.\n  - On February 22, 2008, he scored 27 points.\n  - On February 24, 2008, he scored 29 points.\n  - On February 25, 2008, he scored 29 points.\n  - On February 28, 2008, he scored 28 points.\n  - On February 29, 2008, he scored 34 points.\n\n  This totals to 11 games where Nowitzki was the leading scorer.\n\n- **Comparison:**  \n  Nowitzki led in scoring in 11 out of 14 games. Half of 14 is 7. Since 11 is greater than 7, Nowitzki led in more than half of the games.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim \"Nowitzki was the leading scorer in less than half the games\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Total number of games involving Mavericks is 14.
