    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify specific information from the provided HTML table. Here are the steps for analyzing the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject of the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions \"Bruno Brand\u00e3o\" from Brazil.\n\n2. **Locate Bruno Brand\u00e3o's Row in the Table:**\n   - We search through the `name` column to find \"bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra )\".\n\n3. **Verify the Snatch Weight for Bruno Brand\u00e3o:**\n   - Once we locate Bruno Brand\u00e3o, we need to check his snatch weight under the `snatch` column.\n\n4. **Check if the Snatch Value Matches 157.0:**\n   - We compare the value in the `snatch` column with the claimed value of 157.0.\n\nNow let's apply these steps using the table data:\n\n- **Step 1:** The claim is about \"Bruno Brand\u00e3o (bra)\".\n  \n- **Step 2:** In the table, locate the row for Bruno Brand\u00e3o:\n  - This corresponds to the fourth row in the `<tbody>` section of the HTML.\n\n- **Step 3:** Check the snatch value in this row:\n  - The snatch column for Bruno Brand\u00e3o is `157.0`.\n\n- **Step 4:** Compare with the claimed snatch weight:\n  - The claim states that his snatch weight is 157.0, which matches exactly with what's listed in the table.\n\nBased on these steps, we can confirm that the claim is true.\n\nHere is the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim mentions 'Bruno Brand\u00e3o from Brazil' and states his snatch weight as 157.0.

This does not match the claim.\n     - No other rows have both a snatch of 153.0 kg and clean & jerk of 180.0 kg.\n\n2. **Verify the Name:**\n   - Since no person matches both conditions (snatch = 153.0, clean & jerk = 180.0), there is no need to check for Jos\u00e9 Espinoza's name in this context.\n   \n3. **Check Bodyweight of Jos\u00e9 Espinoza:**\n   - Locate the row with `name` as \"Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (NCA)\".\n     - Row index 6 has \"jos\u00e9 espinoza ( nca )\" with a bodyweight of 99.40 kg, which is less than 100 kg.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There is no person in the table who matches both the snatch and clean & jerk values specified in the claim.\n- Jos\u00e9 Espinoza's bodyweight does not meet the condition of being greater than 100 kg, but this is irrelevant since he wasn't identified by the snatch and clean & jerk criteria.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Christian L\u00f3pez (GUA), where `snatch` = 153.0: \n  - Row index 4, column \"snatch\"\n  - Row index 4, column \"clean & jerk\"\n- For Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (NCA):\n  - Row index 6, column \"name\"\n  - Row index 6, column \"bodyweight\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the person with snatch = 153.0 kg and clean & jerk = 180.0 kg.\",\n    \"Check each row for these values: Christian L\u00f3pez (GUA) has a snatch of 153.0 but a clean & jerk of 182.0, so no match is found.\",\n    \"Since no one matches both conditions, Jos\u00e9 Espinoza cannot be the person referred to in the claim.\",\n    \"Verify Jos\u00e9 Espinoza's bodyweight: Row index 6 shows his bodyweight as 99.40 kg, which is less than 100 kg.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"clean & jerk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bodyweight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
