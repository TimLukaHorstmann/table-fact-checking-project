These results are different.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim that \"the Wimbledon have the same result in the year 1986 and 1999\" is FALSE because the outcomes (\"a\" vs. \"1r\") are not the same.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- For the year 1986: Row for \"Wimbledon\", Column \"1986\".\n- For the year 1999: Row for \"Wimbledon\", Column \"1999\".\n\nFinally, here is the JSON output summarizing our reasoning and conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to 'Wimbledon'.\",\n    \"Locate the columns for the years 1986 and 1999.\",\n    \"Check the result under the 'Wimbledon' row for the year 1986, which is 'a'.\",\n    \"Check the result under the 'Wimbledon' row for the year 1999, which is '1r'.\",\n    \"Compare the results: 'a' for 1986 and '1r' for 1999.\",\n    \"Since 'a' does not equal '1r', the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1986\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1999\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
