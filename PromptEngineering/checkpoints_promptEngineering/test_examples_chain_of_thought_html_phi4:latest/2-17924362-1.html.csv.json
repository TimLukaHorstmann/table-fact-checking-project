    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 15\" is true or false based on the provided table, we must analyze each game where the team experienced a loss (denoted by 'l') and identify the highest score they achieved.\n\nHere's how to approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Losses**: Locate all entries in the table with a result starting with 'l' (indicating a loss).\n\n2. **Extract Scores from Losses**:\n   - For each identified game, extract the points scored by the Denver Broncos.\n   - The format of the `result` column is \"score_team - score_opponent\".\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Points in Losses**:\n   - Compare all extracted scores and determine the highest score achieved in any losing match.\n\n4. **Evaluate Against Claim**: \n   - Verify if this maximum points value is 15 or less, as per the claim.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - List cells from which these points were derived for reference.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Games with Losses**:\n   - Row 3: vs Buffalo Bills, Result `l 14 - 38` (Broncos scored 14)\n   - Row 4: vs Pittsburgh Steelers, Result `l 9 - 20` (Broncos scored 9)\n   - Row 6: vs Kansas City Chiefs, Result `l 13 - 26` (Broncos scored 13)\n   - Row 7: vs Oakland Raiders, Result `l 17 - 42` (Broncos scored 17)\n   - Row 8: vs Cincinnati Bengals, Result `l 16 - 17` (Broncos scored 16)\n   - Row 10: vs Atlanta Falcons, Result `l 21 - 35` (Broncos scored 21)\n   - Row 12: vs Oakland Raiders, Result `l 10 - 17` (Broncos scored 10)\n   - Row 14: vs Miami Dolphins, Result `l 13 - 14` (Broncos scored 13)\n\n2. **Determine Maximum Points Scored in Losses**:\n   - The points scored in each loss are: 14, 9, 13, 17, 16, 21, 10, and 13.\n   - The maximum score from these losses is 21.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the most points scored in a loss was 15 or less.\n   - Since the highest score they achieved in a loss was 21, this exceeds 15.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells correspond to rows with losses (Row 3, Row 4, Row 6, Row 7, Row 8, Row 10, Row 12, and Row 14) from the `result` column.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because the Denver Broncos scored more than 15 points in a loss during the season listed in the table (specifically, they scored 21 against the Atlanta Falcons).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify losses and extract Broncos' scores from each.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos went into overtime only 2 times\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Overtime Games**: We need to find which column in the table indicates if a game went into overtime. This information is typically found in the \"result\" column.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game's Result**:\n   - Look at each row's \"result\" column to see if it mentions \"OT\", which stands for overtime.\n   \n3. **Count the Overtime Games**:\n   - Tally the number of games that mention \"OT\".\n\n4. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states there were only 2 overtime games in 1975.\n\nLet's go through each row and check the \"result\" column for mentions of overtime:\n\n- **Row 1**: Result is \"w 37 - 33\" (no OT)\n- **Row 2**: Result is \"w 23 - 13\" (no OT)\n- **Row 3**: Result is \"l 14 - 38\" (no OT)\n- **Row 4**: Result is \"l 9 - 20\" (no OT)\n- **Row 5**: Result is \"w 16 - 15\" (no OT)\n- **Row 6**: Result is \"l 13 - 26\" (no OT)\n- **Row 7**: Result is \"l 17 - 42\" (no OT)\n- **Row 8**: Result is \"l 16 - 17\" (no OT)\n- **Row 9**: Result is \"w 27 - 17\" (no OT)\n- **Row 10**: Result is \"l 21 - 35\" (no OT)\n- **Row 11**: Result is \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\" (OT mentioned, 1st overtime game)\n- **Row 12**: Result is \"l 10 - 17\" (no OT)\n- **Row 13**: Result is \"w 25 - 10\" (no OT)\n- **Row 14**: Result is \"l 13 - 14\" (no OT)\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that only one game went into overtime (\"w 13 - 10 (ot)\" in row 11).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states there were 2 overtime games, but our count shows only 1.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's format this conclusion in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Examine each row in the 'result' column for mentions of 'OT'.
