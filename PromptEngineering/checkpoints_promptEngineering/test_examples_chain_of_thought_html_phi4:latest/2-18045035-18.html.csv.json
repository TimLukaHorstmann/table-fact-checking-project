    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the statement and verify each part using the data from the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown\n\n1. **Highest Gain:**\n   - The claim states that the highest gain is 232.\n   - Check the \"gain\" column for the maximum value:\n     - Curtis Brinkley: 1193\n     - Doug Hogue: 232\n     - Antwon Bailey: 227\n     - Delone Carter: 141\n     - Tony Fiammetta: 66\n     - Rob Long: 24\n     - Andrew Robinson: 35\n     - Cam Dantley: 98\n   - The highest gain is indeed 1193 by Curtis Brinkley, not 232. Thus, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n2. **Lowest Gain:**\n   - The claim states that the lowest gain is 35.\n   - Check the \"gain\" column for the minimum value:\n     - As listed above, the smallest gain is 24 by Rob Long.\n   - Therefore, the lowest gain is not 35; it's 24. This part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n3. **Highest Long:**\n   - The claim states that the highest long is 58 by Doug Hogue.\n   - Check the \"long\" column for the maximum value:\n     - Curtis Brinkley: 45\n     - Doug Hogue: 82\n     - Antwon Bailey: 39\n     - Delone Carter: 32\n     - Tony Fiammetta: 58\n     - Rob Long: 24\n     - Andrew Robinson: 9\n     - Cam Dantley: 20\n   - The highest long is 82 by Doug Hogue. This part of the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. **Lowest Long:**\n   - The claim states that the lowest long is 20 by Andrew Robinson.\n   - Check the \"long\" column for the minimum value:\n     - As listed above, the smallest long is 9 by Andrew Robinson.\n   - Therefore, the lowest long is not 20; it's 9. This part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim has multiple inaccuracies regarding the highest and lowest gains, as well as the lowest long.
