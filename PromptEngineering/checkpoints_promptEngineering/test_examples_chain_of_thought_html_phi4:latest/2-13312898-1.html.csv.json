    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"joe sabol be draft first\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the data provided about each player's draft position.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim states that Joe Sabol was drafted first. In a draft, the team with the first pick selects first, followed by subsequent teams in order.\n\n2. **Examine the Draft Positions:** Each row of data includes the player's name and their draft position. Specifically, look at the \"round\" (which is the same as the order) and the \"overall\" column to determine each player's draft order:\n\n   - The first pick has a round number 1 and an overall number that represents its position in the entire draft.\n   - For example, if the player was picked first overall, the round would be 1, and the overall position should be 1.\n\n3. **Identify Joe Sabol's Position:**\n   - Find Joe Sabol in the data table.\n   - Check his \"round\" (which should indicate it's the 28th pick because it shows as 28) and \"overall\" number (which is 326).\n\n4. **Evaluate Against First Pick:** \n   - The first pick of any draft would have a \"round\" value of 1 and an \"overall\" position of 1.\n   - Joe Sabol's \"round\" is 28, and his \"overall\" number is 326.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Joe Sabol was not drafted in the first round or picked first overall (his draft details show otherwise), he was not the first pick in the draft.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'joe sabol be draft first' is evaluated by examining the draft data.
