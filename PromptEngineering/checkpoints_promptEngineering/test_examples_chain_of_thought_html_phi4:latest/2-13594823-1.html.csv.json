Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - We are interested in three specific songs: \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", \"charlie\", and \"world wide web\".\n   \n2. **Locate the performances of these songs:**\n   - \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" is performed by Garmarna, which appears in row 8.\n   - \"charlie\" is performed by Jim Jidhed, which appears in row 5.\n   - \"world wide web\" is performed by Nick Borgen, which appears in row 6.\n\n3. **Check the order of performances:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row 5: \"charlie\" (Jim Jidhed) with place 10th\n     - Row 6: \"world wide web\" (Nick Borgen) with place 9th\n     - Row 8: \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" (Garmarna) with place 8th\n\n4. **Verify the claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"world wide web\" should be placed right after both \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\" and \"charlie\".\n   - From the order in the table, \"world wide web\" is performed before \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", not right after it.\n   - \"world wide web\" is also performed immediately after \"charlie\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"world wide web\" does not follow \"en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta\", the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that 'charlie' is in row 5, 'world wide web' is in row 6, and 'en g\u00e5ng ska han gr\u00e5ta' is in row 8.
