    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to assess whether Corinthians could have achieved an undefeated season if they had 5 fewer games:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Current Record Analysis:**\n   - According to the table, Corinthians' current record is:\n     - Played: 20\n     - Drawn: 3\n     - Lost: 1\n   - This means they have lost only 1 game in their 20-game season so far.\n\n2. **Calculate Games Left to Play for an Undefeated Season:**\n   - To be undefeated, a team must not lose any games. Corinthians currently have one loss.\n   - With 5 fewer games (i.e., played 15 instead of 20), they would need to maintain their current record or improve it.\n\n3. **Hypothetical Scenario with 5 Fewer Games:**\n   - If they had only 15 games, their record could be:\n     - Played: 15\n     - Drawn: Up to 3 (same as current)\n     - Lost: 0 (to remain undefeated)\n\n4. **Feasibility Check:**\n   - Currently, they have played 20 games with 1 loss.\n   - If we remove 5 games from their record:\n     - They would need those 5 games to be among the ones where they either drew or lost.\n     - Since they have only 1 loss, removing this game and possibly some drawn games could potentially result in a scenario where all remaining 15 games are either wins or draws.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that Corinthians have only 1 loss out of 20 games, it is feasible to construct a hypothetical record with 15 games where they do not lose any games (i.e., 0 losses).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"the corinthian be 5 game away from be undefeeated their entire season\" is TRUE.
