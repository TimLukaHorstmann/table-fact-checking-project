    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Frost and Scott McCarron be listed on place 1 and 2, respectively\" is true or false, let's go through a step-by-step analysis of the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify David Frost's Position:**\n   - Look for David Frost in the \"player\" column.\n   - In row 3, we find:\n     - `place`: \"t3\"\n     - `player`: \"david frost\"\n     - This indicates that David Frost is tied at position 3 with Phil Mickelson.\n\n2. **Identify Scott McCarron's Position:**\n   - Look for Scott McCarron in the \"player\" column.\n   - In row 8, we find:\n     - `place`: \"t7\"\n     - `player`: \"scott mccarron\"\n     - This indicates that Scott McCarron is tied at position 7 with Scott Hoch and Vijay Singh.\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states David Frost should be in place 1, and Scott McCarron should be in place 2.\n   - Based on our findings:\n     - David Frost is actually in \"t3\", not place 1.\n     - Scott McCarron is in \"t7\", not place 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"David Frost and Scott McCarron be listed on place 1 and 2, respectively\" is **FALSE** because neither player holds the positions claimed. David Frost is tied for position 3, and Scott McCarron is tied for position 7.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For David Frost: Row index 3, column \"place\".\n- For Scott McCarron: Row index 8, column \"place\".\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"David Frost is listed at 't3' and Scott McCarron is listed at 't7'.
