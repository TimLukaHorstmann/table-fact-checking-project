    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table for information related to Mike Weir's performance in the Masters tournament.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"Mike Weir\" in the table. This is found at `row_index 3`.\n\n2. **Examine the Columns for Mike Weir:**\n   - Look at the \"year (s) won\" column to confirm when he won. According to the table, Mike Weir won in 2003.\n   - Check the \"to par\" column to see his score relative to par for that win. The value is `+ 2`.\n\n3. **Interpret the \"To Par\" Value:**\n   - In golf, a score of \"to par\" indicates how many strokes over or under par the player finished. A negative number signifies a performance under par.\n   - Mike Weir's score was \"+ 2\", indicating he finished 2 strokes over par.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Mike Weir only won 1 Masters tournament under par.\"\n   - Since his winning score was \"+ 2\" (over par), he did not win under par.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table, Mike Weir's victory in 2003 was not under par. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Mike Weir's row and checked his 'to par' score for the year he won (2003). The score was '+2', indicating he finished over par, not under par.
