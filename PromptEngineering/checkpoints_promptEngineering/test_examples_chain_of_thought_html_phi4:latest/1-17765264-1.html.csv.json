The claim states: \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year.\" Here's how we approach verifying it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We focus on the \"result\" column to find any ties (indicated by \"t\" for tie) in the table.\n   - The table provides results from a series of games over multiple weeks, including a tied game.\n\n2. **Locate the Tied Game**:\n   - In row 12, the result is \"t 38 - 38,\" indicating a tied game against the Buffalo Bills on November 27, 1960.\n   - The corresponding \"date\" for this entry is \"november 27 , 1960.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Date and Year**:\n   - The table data pertains to the year 1960, not 1980 as stated in the claim.\n   - The tied game occurred on November 27, 1960.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim's Year Context**:\n   - The claim mentions \"November 6, 1980,\" which does not appear anywhere in the table.\n   - The entire dataset is from 1960, so there are no records for any events occurring in 1980 within this table.\n\n5. **Conclusion on the Claim**:\n   - Since the table only contains data from 1960 and mentions a tied game on November 27, 1960, it cannot validate or refute any claim about games in 1980.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is unrelated to the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because:\n- The table does not contain any information from 1980.\n- It mentions a tie on November 27, 1960, not November 6, 1980.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table only includes data for the year 1960.
