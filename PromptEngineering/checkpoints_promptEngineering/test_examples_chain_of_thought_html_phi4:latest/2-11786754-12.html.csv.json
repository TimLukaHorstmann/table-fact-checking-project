    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that an average (avg) of 5.3 corresponds to players who have more than 0 touchdowns ('td 's') and more than 135 receiving yards ('yards').\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We need rows where both 'td 's' > 0 and 'yards' > 135.\n   \n3. **Check Each Row**:\n   - For each row, check if the conditions are met (more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards).\n   - If a row meets these criteria, verify if its average ('avg') is 5.3.\n\n4. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - Row 1: \n     - 'td 's': 4 (greater than 0)\n     - 'yards': 171 (greater than 135)\n     - 'avg': 10.6\n   - Row 2:\n     - 'td 's': 0 (not greater than 0)\n   - Row 3:\n     - 'td 's': 1 (greater than 0)\n     - 'yards': 135 (not greater than 135)\n   - Row 4:\n     - 'td 's': 2 (greater than 0)\n     - 'yards': 16 (not greater than 135)\n   - Row 5:\n     - 'td 's': 0 (not greater than 0)\n   - Row 6:\n     - 'td 's': 3 (greater than 0)\n     - 'yards': 58 (not greater than 135)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Only Row 1 meets both criteria of having more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards.\n   - The average for Row 1 is 10.6, not 5.3.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Since no row with an average of 5.3 meets the criteria, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires identifying rows where 'td 's' > 0 and 'yards' > 135. Only Row 1 meets these conditions, but its average is 10.6, not 5.3. Therefore, no row satisfies all parts of the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"td 's\", \"value\": 4},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yards\", \"value\": 171},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg\", \"value\": 10.6}\n  ]\n}\n```",
