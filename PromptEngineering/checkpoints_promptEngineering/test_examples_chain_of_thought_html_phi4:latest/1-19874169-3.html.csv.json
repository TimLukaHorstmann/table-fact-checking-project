Here's how we can systematically verify this:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We focus on two columns:\n   - `branding`: To confirm if it includes \"yes! fm\".\n   - `frequency`: To check for the specific frequency, \"101.1 mhz\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0**:\n     - `branding`: \"yes! fm 101.1\" \u2014 This includes \"yes! fm\".\n     - `frequency`: \"101.1 mhz\" \u2014 This matches the specified frequency.\n     - Conclusion: Both conditions are met in this row.\n\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - `branding`: \"yes! fm 104.1 urdaneta\" \u2014 Includes \"yes! fm\", but\n     - `frequency`: \"104.1 mhz\" \u2014 Does not match \"101.1 mhz\".\n     - Conclusion: Frequency does not match.\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - `branding`: \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" \u2014 Includes \"yes! fm\", but\n     - `frequency`: \"91.1 mhz\" \u2014 Does not match \"101.1 mhz\".\n     - Conclusion: Frequency does not match.\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - `branding`: \"yes! fm 106.3 dumaguete\" \u2014 Includes \"yes! fm\", but\n     - `frequency`: \"106.3 mhz\" \u2014 Does not match \"101.1 mhz\".\n     - Conclusion: Frequency does not match.\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - `branding`: \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" \u2014 Includes \"yes! fm\", but\n     - `frequency`: \"104.7 mhz\" \u2014 Does not match \"101.1 mhz\".\n     - Conclusion: Frequency does not match.\n\n3. **Final Evaluation**: The first row satisfies both conditions of the claim, confirming that \"yes! fm\" broadcasts at 101.1 MHz.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 0, Column `branding`: \"yes! fm 101.1\"\n   - Row 0, Column `frequency`: \"101.1 mhz\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table.
