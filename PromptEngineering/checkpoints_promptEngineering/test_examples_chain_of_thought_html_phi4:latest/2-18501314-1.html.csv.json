    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the number of league appearances for both Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson from the provided table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Locate Dave Sutton's Row:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"Dave Sutton\" in the table.\n   - Identify the column labeled \"League Apps\" to find his total league appearances.\n\n2. **Locate Phil Wilson's Row:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"Phil Wilson\" in the table.\n   - Identify the column labeled \"League Apps\" to find his total league appearances.\n\n3. **Extract and Compare Values:**\n   - Extract the values from the \"League Apps\" column for both Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson.\n   - Compare these values to see if they are both 44.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n- **Dave Sutton's League Apps:**\n  - Locate the row with \"Dave Sutton.\"\n  - In this row, under the \"League Apps\" column, the value is 41.\n\n- **Phil Wilson's League Apps:**\n  - Locate the row with \"Phil Wilson.\"\n  - In this row, under the \"League Apps\" column, the value is 45.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that both Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson have 44 league appearances.
