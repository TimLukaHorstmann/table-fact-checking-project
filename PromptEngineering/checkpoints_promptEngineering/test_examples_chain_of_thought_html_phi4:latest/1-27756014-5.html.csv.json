According to the table, on November 16, the Bucks played against \"la lakers\" (not the Trailblazers).\n\n2. **High Points Scored by a Player in Each Game:**\n   - Review each game's \"high points\" column for games played in November.\n   - The highest score listed is 31 points by Brandon Jennings on November 16 against the LA Lakers.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Specific Details\n\n- **November 16 Game (Row 11):**\n  - Opponent: LA Lakers\n  - High Points: Brandon Jennings with 31 points\n\n- **Check All Games in November for Highest Score:**\n  - Review all rows corresponding to games from November 2 to November 26.\n  - The highest score recorded is indeed 31 by Brandon Jennings, not 37.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the most points scored in a single game was 37 against the Trailblazers on November 16.
