This is accurate for the years she competed (2010 and 2011) since she played one game each year and lost both.\n   - For the years she did not participate, it is technically correct to say she lost all her games because there were no games to win.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim \"Tatjana Maria lost all of her games in the Australian Open\" is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked Tatjana Maria's performance at the Australian Open from 2007 to 2012.
