This will help us locate the correct game.\n\n3. **Verify Teams**:\n   - In this row, ensure that the \"visitor\" column lists \"penguins\" and the \"home\" column lists \"blues\".\n\n4. **Check Attendance**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct row, check the \"attendance\" column to see if it matches the claimed attendance of 9092.\n\n5. **Confirm the Claim**:\n   - If all conditions match (correct date, teams, and attendance), then the claim is true.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- The row with \"date\": \"march 6\" has:\n  - \"visitor\": \"penguins\"\n  - \"home\": \"blues\"\n  - \"attendance\": \"9092\"\n\nThis matches all parts of the claim.
