    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided for matches played at different venues during the Scottish football season.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - We are interested in the \"venue\" column since it lists where each match was played.\n   - Additionally, the \"competition\" column helps us identify which matches count as part of the Scottish football season (friendly games).\n\n2. **Extract Matches for Each Venue**:\n   - **Easter Road, Edinburgh**: Look for entries where the venue is \"easter road , edinburgh\".\n     - From the table, there is one match at Easter Road on 30 May with a score of 4 - 1 under the competition \"friendly\".\n\n   - **Hampden Park, Glasgow**: Look for entries where the venue is \"hampden park , glasgow\".\n     - The matches are:\n       - 6 September: Score 3 - 1, Competition ecqg5\n       - 11 October: Score 1 - 0, Competition ecqg5\n       - 15 November: Score 1 - 0, Competition ecqpo\n\n3. **Count the Matches**:\n   - Easter Road, Edinburgh: 1 match.\n   - Hampden Park, Glasgow: 3 matches.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Scotland plays at Easter Road, Edinburgh \"5 times more\" than at Hampden Park, Glasgow during the Scottish football season.\n   - Mathematically, \"5 times more\" means that the number of matches at Easter Road should be 5 times the number of matches at Hampden Park.\n   - Calculation: If Hampden Park has 3 matches, then 5 times this amount is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) matches.\n   - Easter Road only has 1 match, which is not 15 or even more than the matches at Hampden Park.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Scotland plays at Easter Road, Edinburgh significantly fewer times (1 time) compared to Hampden Park, Glasgow (3 times), and not \"5 times more\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined the 'venue' column to count matches at each venue. At Easter Road, Edinburgh, there is 1 match; at Hampden Park, Glasgow, there are 3 matches.
