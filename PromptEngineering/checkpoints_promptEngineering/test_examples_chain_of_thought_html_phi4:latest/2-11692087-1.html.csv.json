    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the Coquitlam Adanacs making 1,177 points over 45 seasons is correct, we need to analyze the given data step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Total Points:**\n   - The table provides a row labeled \"total\" with relevant statistical information for the team.\n   - In this row, under the \"Points\" column, it lists the number as 1,177.\n\n2. **Verify Number of Seasons:**\n   - Under the same \"total\" row, the \"Seasons\" column indicates that there are 45 seasons.\n   \n3. **Cross-Check with Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"the Coquitlam Adanacs have made 1177 points over 45 seasons.\"\n   - We need to confirm if both these numbers (1,177 points and 45 seasons) match the data in the table.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Data:**\n   - The table confirms that the total number of points is indeed 1,177.\n   - It also confirms that the number of seasons covered by this statistic is 45.\n   - Therefore, the claim accurately reflects the information provided in the table.\n\n### JSON Output\n\nBased on the reasoning above, we conclude that the statement is true. We identify the relevant cells as follows:\n\n- **Row Index:** The total row is typically placed at the end of the table; assuming sequential numbering starting from 0 for each data row, this would be row index 26.\n- **Column Names:**\n  - \"Points\" column contains the value 1,177.\n  - \"Seasons\" column contains the value 45.\n\nThus, the relevant cells can be identified by these indices:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'total' row in the table.\",\n    \"Check the 'Points' column in the 'total' row to see if it lists 1,177 points.\",\n    \"Check the 'Seasons' column in the 'total' row to confirm there are 45 seasons.\",\n    \"Verify that these numbers match those given in the claim: 1,177 points over 45 seasons.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Seasons\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
