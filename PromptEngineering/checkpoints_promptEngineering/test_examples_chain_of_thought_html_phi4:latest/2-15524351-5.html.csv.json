Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The term \"shutout\" refers to a scenario where one team scores no points in a game. Therefore, we are looking for games where the 'result' column indicates that the Deacons scored 0 points.\n\n2. **Inspecting Each Game**:\n   - **09 / 09 / 1972**: Opponent: Davidson, Result: W 26-20\n     - The Deacons scored 26 points. Not a shutout.\n   \n   - **09 / 16 / 1972**: Opponent: SMU, Result: L 10-56\n     - The Deacons scored 10 points.

This is a shutout.\n\n   - **10 / 28 / 1972**: Opponent: Clemson, Result: L 0-31\n     - The Deacons scored 0 points. This is a shutout.\n   \n   - **11 / 04 / 1972**: Opponent: South Carolina, Result: L 3-35\n     - The Deacons scored 3 points.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Claim\n\nThe claim states: \"the deacon be shutout 3 times, but never by more than 10 points.\"\n\n- **Shutout**: A team is considered shut out if they score 0 points in a game.\n- **Three Times**: The team should have been shut out in three different games.\n- **Never by More Than 10 Points**: In each of these games where the team was shut out, the margin of loss should not exceed 10 points.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Shutout Games\n\nWe need to identify rows where the \"result\" column shows that the team scored 0 points. This can be determined by checking if the result format is \"l X - Y\" where X is 0 (e.g., \"l 0 - Y\").\n\n1. **Row 4**: Result = \"l 0 - 23\"  \n   The team was shut out with a loss margin of 23 points.\n\n2. **Row 6**: Result = \"l 0 - 21\"  \n   The team was shut out with a loss margin of 21 points.\n\n3. **Row 7**: Result = \"l 0 - 31\"  \n   The team was shut out with a loss margin of 31 points.\n\nThese rows correspond to games where the team was shut out, totaling three times as stated in the claim.\n\n### Step 3: Checking the Margin of Loss\n\nNow we check if any of these shutout losses had a margin greater than 10 points:\n\n- **Row 4**: Loss margin = 23 points  \n  This is more than 10 points.\n  \n- **Row 6**: Loss margin = 21 points  \n  This is more than 10 points.\n\n- **Row 7**: Loss margin = 31 points  \n  This is more than 10 points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the team was never shut out by more than 10 points, but in all three shutout games identified (rows 4, 6, and 7), the margins were greater than 10 points. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The team was shut out 3 times as indicated by results where they scored 0 points: rows 4 ('l 0 - 23'), 6 ('l 0 - 21'), and 7 ('l 0 - 31').

Specifically, we should identify both teams' scores from these results to see if any team has scored 50 or more points.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We focus on the \"result\" column as it contains the scores of each game. Each entry is formatted as `w/l X - Y`, where:\n   - `w` or `l` indicates a win or loss for the team represented by this table.\n   - `X` and `Y` are the points scored by the team in question and their opponent, respectively.\n\n2. **Extract Scores from Results**: For each game entry, extract both scores (team score and opponent's score) from the \"result\" column:\n   - **Game 1** (`09 / 09 / 1972`, vs Davidson): `w 26 - 20` (Team: 26, Opponent: 20)\n   - **Game 2** (`09 / 16 / 1972`, vs SMU): `l 10 - 56` (Team: 10, Opponent: 56)\n   - **Game 3** (`09 / 23 / 1972`, vs Tennessee): `l 6 - 45` (Team: 6, Opponent: 45)\n   - **Game 4** (`10 / 07 / 1972`, vs Maryland): `l 0 - 23` (Team: 0, Opponent: 23)\n   - **Game 5** (`10 / 14 / 1972`, vs NC State): `l 13 - 42` (Team: 13, Opponent: 42)\n   - **Game 6** (`10 / 21 / 1972`, vs North Carolina): `l 0 - 21` (Team: 0, Opponent: 21)\n   - **Game 7** (`10 / 28 / 1972`, vs Clemson): `l 0 - 31` (Team: 0, Opponent: 31)\n   - **Game 8** (`11 / 04 / 1972`, vs South Carolina): `l 3 - 35` (Team: 3, Opponent: 35)\n   - **Game 9** (`11 / 11 / 1972`, vs Duke): `w 9 - 7` (Team: 9, Opponent: 7)\n   - **Game 10** (`11 / 18 / 1972`, vs Virginia): `l 12 - 15` (Team: 12, Opponent: 15)\n   - **Game 11** (`11 / 25 / 1972`, vs Virginia Tech): `l 9 - 44` (Team: 9, Opponent: 44)\n\n3. **Analyze Scores**: Examine each score to determine if any is 50 or higher:\n   - The scores for the team represented in this table are all below 50.\n   - The highest score by an opponent is 56 (in Game 2 vs SMU).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the claim states \"the highest number of points anyone scored be below 50,\" and we found that the opponent's score against SMU was 56, which exceeds 49, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for this analysis is in row index 1 (2nd row) under \"result\" because it contains the highest score of 56 by any team in the dataset.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extract scores from the 'result' column for each game.\",\n    \"Identify both team and opponent scores for each match.\",\n    \"Find the maximum score among all teams (both ours and opponents).\",\n    \"Determine if any score is 50 or above.
