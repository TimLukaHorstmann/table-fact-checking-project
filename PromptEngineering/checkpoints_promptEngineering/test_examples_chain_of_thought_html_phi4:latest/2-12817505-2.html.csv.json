We need to find this value in the data table:\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"Arsenal\" and the date \"9 April 2006\".  \n     - Row Index: 43\n     - Attendance: 70908\n\n2. **Search for Matches:**  \n   Next, we need to check all games since August 13, 2005, to see if there are any other instances where the attendance was exactly 70,908.\n\n3. **Examine Each Game's Attendance:**  \n   We will go through each row from \"13 August 2005\" onward and compare the attendance figures against 70,908:\n   - Row Index: 1 (Date: 13 August 2005), Attendance: 35429\n   - Row Index: 2 (Date: 20 August 2005), Attendance: 36224\n   - ...\n   - Continue this process for all rows up to the end of the dataset.\n\n4. **Count Matches:**  \n   We count how many times the attendance figure matches 70,908 after August 13, 2005.\n\n**Checking the Data Table:**\n\n- Row Index: 43 (Date: 9 April 2006), Attendance: 70908 (Match)\n- After examining all subsequent rows:\n  - No other row has an attendance of 70,908.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- There is only one game with an attendance of 70,908 since August 13, 2005.  \n- The claim states there should be 19 games with this exact attendance, which is incorrect based on the data.\n\n**Final Answer in JSON Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the target attendance for Arsenal on April 9, 2006, as 70,908.

This match involves Portsmouth as the away team against Wigan Athletic.\n   \n5. **Identify Games After 11 February 2006**:\n   - Check if there are any matches listed after this date.\n   - Matches continue from 12 March 2006 to 7 May 2006.\n\n6. **Determine the Last Match of the Season**:\n   - The last match in the list is on 7 May 2006, involving Charlton Athletic as the away team against a home team that isn't specified here but can be inferred as the final game mentioned in the sequence.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since there are matches listed after 11 February 2006, it cannot be considered the last match of the season.\n   - The last match is clearly on 7 May 2006.\n\nWith these steps, we conclude that the claim \"the last game of the season happened on 11 February 2006\" is false.
