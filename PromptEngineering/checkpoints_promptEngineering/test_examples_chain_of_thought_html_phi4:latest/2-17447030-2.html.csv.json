    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant row for the opponent \"Dan Severn\"\n- We need to locate the row where the opponent is \"Dan Severn\". \n\n### Step 2: Check the details of the identified row\n- Once we find the row with \"Dan Severn\" as the opponent, we must verify:\n  - The method of the result.\n  - The event in which it took place.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the claim\n- According to the claim:\n  - Method should be \"submission (arm triangle choke)\"\n  - Event should be \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step-by-step Examination\n\n1. **Locate Row for Dan Severn**:\n   - Look at each row and check the \"opponent\" column.\n   - We find that in row 3, the opponent is \"Dan Severn\".\n\n2. **Check Method and Event for Dan Severn**:\n   - In row 3, the method is \"submission (arm triangle choke)\".\n   - In row 3, the event is \"wef 9 - world class\".\n   \n3. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that when the opponent is \"Dan Severn\", the method should be \"submission (arm triangle choke)\" and the event should be \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\".\n   - We see that while the method matches (\"submission (arm triangle choke)\"), the event does not match.
