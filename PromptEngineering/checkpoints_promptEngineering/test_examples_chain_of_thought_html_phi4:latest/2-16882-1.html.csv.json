The closest are:\n     - High Speed Alliance: 5%\n     - Schiphol Logistics Park: 53%\n\n3. **Check Principal Activities**: Find any company among those identified (with incorporation in the Netherlands) that has \"flight academy\" as its principal activity.\n   - Only KLM Flight Academy fits this criterion with a principal activity of \"flight academy\".\n\n4. **Combine All Criteria**:\n   - The only company related to \"flight academy\" is KLM Flight Academy.\n   - However, it does not have 99% equity shareholding; it has 100%.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There are no companies incorporated in the Netherlands with a group\u2019s equity shareholding of exactly 99% and principal activities as \"flight academy\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires a company from the Netherlands with 99% equity shareholding and 'flight academy' as its principal activity.
