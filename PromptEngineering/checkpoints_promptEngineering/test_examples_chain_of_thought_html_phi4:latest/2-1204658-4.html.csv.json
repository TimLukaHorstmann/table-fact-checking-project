St Kilda is listed as the home team.\n2. The venue for their game is Junction Oval.\n3. Their score is 5.10, which converts to 40 points.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Relevant Data in the Table\n\nThe table has columns labeled: \n- Home Team\n- Home Team Score\n- Away Team\n- Away Team Score\n- Venue\n- Date\n\nWe need to find a row where:\n- The \"home team\" is \"st kilda\"\n- The \"venue\" is \"junction oval\"\n- The \"home team score\" is \"5.10 (40)\"\n\n### Step 3: Examine Each Row in the Table\n\nLet's go through each row in the table to find a match:\n\n1. **Row 1:**\n   - Home Team: st kilda\n   - Home Team Score: 5.10 (40)\n   - Venue: junction oval\n\n   This matches all parts of the claim.\n\n2. **Row 2:** \n   - Home Team: melbourne\n   - Venue: mcg\n   \n   Does not match the required home team or venue.\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - Home Team: fitzroy\n   - Venue: brunswick street oval\n\n   Does not match the required home team or venue.\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - Home Team: essendon\n   - Venue: emcg\n\n   Does not match the required home team or venue.\n\n5. **Row 5:**\n   - Home Team: collingwood\n   - Venue: victoria park\n\n   Does not match the required home team or venue.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe first row of the table confirms that St Kilda was indeed the home team at Junction Oval with a score of 5.10 (40).
