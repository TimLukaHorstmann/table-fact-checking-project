    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"richardo v be the no9 team that have no6 play paulo\" is true, let's break down the statement into logical components:\n\n1. **Interpretation of Claim:**\n   - The phrase \"no9 team\" suggests we are looking for information related to the ninth row in the table.\n   - The phrase \"have no6 play paulo\" implies checking the sixth column within that specific row to see if it mentions \"paulo.\"\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Row and Column:**\n   - We need to look at the ninth row (`row_index = 9`) of the table.\n   - Within this row, we examine the sixth column.\n\n3. **Checking the Content:**\n   - The content in the ninth row and sixth column is \"paulo.\"\n   - This confirms that within the ninth row, \"paulo\" is mentioned in the sixth column.\n\n4. **Verification of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"richardo v be the no9 team,\" which means we need to verify if \"ricardo v\" appears in any relevant context in the ninth row.\n   - In the ninth row, \"ricardo v\" is mentioned as part of \"marco ricardo v telmo.\"\n   - Since \"ricardo v\" is indeed part of the ninth row's content, and \"paulo\" appears in the sixth column of the same row, the claim holds true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim accurately describes the presence of \"ricardo v\" and \"paulo\" in the specified context within the table.\n\nNow, let's summarize this reasoning and provide the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim refers to the ninth row as 'no9 team'.\",\n    \"We need to check if 'paulo' appears in the sixth column of this row.\",\n    \"In the ninth row, the sixth column contains 'paulo'.\",\n    \"The claim also mentions 'richardo v', which appears in the ninth row as part of 'marco ricardo v telmo'.\",\n    \"Both conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the content of the ninth row.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no nominations\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"paulo\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

There is a team consisting of Marco, Ricardo V., and Telmo.\n     2. This is the eighth (no8) such team listed in the table.\n     3.
