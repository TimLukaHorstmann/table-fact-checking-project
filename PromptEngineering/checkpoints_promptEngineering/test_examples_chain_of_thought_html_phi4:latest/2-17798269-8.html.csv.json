    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the second highest scoring game for the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009 being against the Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers is true, let's follow a structured reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Scoring Games:**\n   - We need to find all games where the total score (sum of both teams' goals) exceeds a certain threshold that would classify them as high-scoring.\n   - Calculate the total score for each game in March 2009 from the provided table.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Scores:**\n   - For each row, sum up the scores:\n     - March 2 vs New York Islanders: 4 + 2 = 6\n     - March 4 vs Detroit Red Wings: 3 + 2 = 5\n     - March 8 vs Chicago Blackhawks: 5 + 1 = 6\n     - March 10 vs Atlanta Thrashers: 3 + 0 = 3\n     - March 12 vs Minnesota Wild: 2 + 1 = 3\n     - March 14 vs Edmonton Oilers: 3 + 2 = 5\n     - March 15 vs Vancouver Canucks: 4 + 2 = 6\n     - March 17 vs Minnesota Wild: 3 + 2 = 5\n     - March 19 vs Edmonton Oilers: 8 + 1 = 9\n     - March 22 vs San Jose Sharks: 3 + 1 = 4\n     - March 25 vs Anaheim Ducks: 7 + 2 = 9\n     - March 27 vs Vancouver Canucks: 4 + 1 = 5\n     - March 29 vs Anaheim Ducks: 4 + 1 = 5\n\n3. **Identify High-Scoring Games:**\n   - From the scores calculated, identify games with the highest total scores:\n     - March 19 vs Edmonton Oilers: 9\n     - March 25 vs Anaheim Ducks: 9\n\n4. **Determine Second Highest Scoring Game:**\n   - The second highest scoring game is one of these two games (both have a score of 9).\n   - Check if either of these matches the conditions given in the claim.\n\n5. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the second-highest scoring game should be against both the Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers.\n   - However, from our calculations:\n     - March 19 (vs Edmonton Oilers) has a score of 9\n     - March 25 (vs Anaheim Ducks) also has a score of 9\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The second highest scoring game is not against both the Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers; it's against one or the other, but not both.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Calculate total scores for each game in March 2009.\",\n    \"Identify games with the highest total scores.\",\n    \"Determine which games have the second highest scoring totals.\",\n    \"Verify if these games match the conditions specified in the claim.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is false as no single game matches both opponents.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
