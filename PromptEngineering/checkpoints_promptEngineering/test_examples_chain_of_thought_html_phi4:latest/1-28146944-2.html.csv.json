Let\u2019s go through the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Episode**: Locate the row in the table corresponding to the episode title \"milo 's big idea\".\n   - This corresponds to row with `no in series` 30.\n\n2. **Check Story & Storyboards By Column**: Examine the information provided under the column \"story & storyboards by\" for this episode.\n   - For row 30, it lists: \"jackie buscarino (story) neil graf (storyboards)\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Roles**:\n   - The text indicates that Jackie Buscarino is credited with the story and Neil Graf is credited with the storyboards.\n   - This means two different people are involved: one for the story and another for the storyboards.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the roles of story and storyboard are assigned to two different individuals, it does not satisfy the condition that a single person did both tasks.\n\nNow, let's compile this information into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The episode titled 'milo 's big idea' corresponds to row with no in series 30. The 'story & storyboards by' column for this row indicates 'jackie buscarino (story) neil graf (storyboards)', meaning two different people are credited, one for the story and another for the storyboard. Therefore, the claim that one person did both tasks is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"story & storyboards by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
