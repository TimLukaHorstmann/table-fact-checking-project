    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, let's analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Information from the Claim\n\n- **Rider**: Ryan Farquhar\n- **Bike**: 1000cc Kawasaki\n- **Day with No Time Listed**: Tuesday, June 2\n\n### Step 2: Locate Ryan Farquhar in the Table\n\nRyan Farquhar is listed as row number 12.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Times for Each Day\n\nWe will look at each day's time entry for Ryan Farquhar to see if there are any entries marked as \"no time\".\n\n- **Sunday, June 1**: `18'11.52` (124.440 mph)\n- **Monday, June 2**: `-- no time`\n- **Tuesday, June 3**: `18'36.60` (121.644 mph)\n- **Wednesday, June 4**: `18'19.47` (123.539 mph)\n- **Thursday, June 5**: `17'58.92` (125.893 mph)\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Claim Against Table Data\n\nThe claim states that Ryan Farquhar has no time listed for Tuesday, June 2. However, based on our analysis:\n\n- On Monday, June 2, there is \"no time\" listed.\n- For Tuesday, June 3, a valid time (`18'36.60`) is recorded.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that Ryan Farquhar has no time listed for Tuesday, June 2, is incorrect because the entry of \"no time\" is actually on Monday, June 2. The times for Tuesday, June 3 are properly listed.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Ryan Farquhar's row in the table.\",\n    \"Check each day's entry for times or 'no time' notes.\",\n    \"Note that Monday has 'no time', but Tuesday has a valid time recorded.\",\n    \"Conclude the claim is false as it incorrectly states the day with no time.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Sunday\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Monday\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Tuesday\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Wednesday\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
