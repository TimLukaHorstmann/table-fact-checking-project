For St. Andrews University in row 14, the enrollment is listed as 600.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that \"the number of student enrol at St. Andrew university be 600.\"\n   - According to the table, St. Andrews University has an enrollment of exactly 600 students, which matches the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the enrollment figure from the table aligns with the claim's statement, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere\u2019s how this reasoning translates into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim concerns St. Andrews University's student enrollment.
