The result is a win, leading to a record of \"4 - 4\".\n\n5. **Determine if Record Matches the Claim**:\n   - After week 7 and before playing against New England Patriots in week 15, check the records on or after October 29.\n   - On or after October 29 (week 8), the team never had a record of \"3 - 4\".
