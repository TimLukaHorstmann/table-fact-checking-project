Week 5 has an attendance of 34488, and week 11 has an attendance of 75238. Calculate the difference: 75238 - 34488 = 40750. The claim states a difference of 21883 more in attendance during week 5 compared to week 11, which would imply a week 11 attendance of 56371 if true. Since the actual week 11 attendance is 75238, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we will carefully analyze the provided HTML table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states:\n- The Detroit Lions were an opponent twice for a team during the year 1992.\n- The Washington Redskins played against this unnamed team twice in 1992.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Table Data\n\nWe will focus on two pieces of information from the table:\n1. **Opponent Team**: We need to find which teams are listed as opponents and check if Detroit Lions appear exactly twice.\n2. **Identify Matches with Washington Redskins**: Check if any team played against Washington Redskins twice, since that's a condition given in the claim.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Occurrences of \"Detroit Lions\"\nFrom the table:\n- Row 3: Week 3, Date: September 20, 1992, Opponent: Detroit Lions (Result: W 13 - 10)\n- No other row lists Detroit Lions as an opponent. Thus, the team played against Detroit Lions only once in 1992.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Occurrences of \"Washington Redskins\"\nThe table does not list any games played by or against Washington Redskins. Therefore, there are no records of them playing twice within this dataset.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The Detroit Lions were listed as an opponent only once, not twice.\n- There is no mention of the Washington Redskins in the table at all, let alone twice.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim \"the detroit lion and the washington redskins be opponent 2 time during the year 1992\" cannot be true because:\n1. Detroit Lions were opponents only once.\n2. Washington Redskins are not listed as opponents at any point.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated by checking two conditions: whether the Detroit Lions appeared twice as an opponent and if there were two matches against the Washington Redskins in 1992. The table shows that Detroit Lions were only listed once, and Washington Redskins are not mentioned at all. Therefore, both parts of the claim are false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
