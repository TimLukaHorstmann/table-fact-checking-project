Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that the Atlanta Falcons drafted more defensive backs than any other position in their 1987 NFL Draft.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to check each row of the table for the number of players drafted at each position and specifically identify those drafted as \"defensive back\".\n\n3. **Extracting Defensive Backs**:\n   - Row 4: Reggie Pleasant, Position: Defensive Back\n   - Row 8: Ashley Lee, Position: Defensive Back\n   - Row 11: John Ayres, Position: Defensive Back\n\n   From this extraction, we see that there are three defensive backs drafted by the Falcons.\n\n4. **Counting Other Positions**:\n   - Guard: Bill Fralic (1 player)\n   - Defensive End: Mike Gann (1 player)\n   - Wide Receiver: Emile Harry (1 player)\n   - Linebacker: Ronnie Washington, Micah Moon (2 players)\n   - Center: Brent Martin (1 player)\n   - Tight End: Ken Whisenhunt (1 player)\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - Defensive Backs: 3 players\n   - The next highest number of players drafted in any single position is Linebacker with 2 players.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the Falcons drafted more defensive backs (3) than any other individual position, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists the draft picks for each round and their positions.

This satisfies our condition for the 5th pick in a single round.\n4. **Row 3**: The `pick` value is `12`, so this round does not meet the condition.\n5. **Row 4**: The `pick` value is `5`. This meets the condition, adding to our count of rounds with the 5th pick.\n6. **Row 5**: The `pick` value is `19`, so this round does not meet the condition.\n7. **Row 6**: The `pick` value is `4`, so this round does not meet the condition.\n8. **Row 7**: The `pick` value is `5`.
