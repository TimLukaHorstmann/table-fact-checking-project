    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the areas of Guangxi and Shanxi provinces from the provided data table.\n\n1. **Identify the Area Values:**\n   - Find the area for Guangxi:\n     - Look for \"Guangxi\" in the table.\n     - According to Row 28, the area is 35,354 square miles.\n   - Find the area for Shanxi:\n     - Look for \"Shanxi\" in the table.\n     - According to Row 21, the area is 148,064 square miles.\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Compute the difference between the areas of Guangxi and Shanxi:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{Area of Shanxi} - \\text{Area of Guangxi}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 148,064 - 35,354 = 112,710\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compare the Calculated Difference with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the difference in area is only 10 square miles.\n   - Our calculated difference is 112,710 square miles.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 112,710 is significantly greater than 10, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For Guangxi (Row 28):\n     - Area column value: 35,354\n   - For Shanxi (Row 21):\n     - Area column value: 148,064\n\nThe final answer can be formatted into a JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the area of Guangxi from Row 28, which is 35,354 square miles.\",\n    \"Identify the area of Shanxi from Row 21, which is 148,064 square miles.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference in area: 148,064 - 35,354 = 112,710 square miles.\",\n    \"Compare the calculated difference (112,710) with the claim (10).\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is false because the actual difference is much larger than stated.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
