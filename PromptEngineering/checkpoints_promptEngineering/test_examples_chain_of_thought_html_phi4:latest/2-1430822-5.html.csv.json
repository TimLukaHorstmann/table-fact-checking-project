    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Lucas Di Grassi placed third in 2008\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant parts of the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Locate the Row for 2008:**\n   - The year in question is 2008. We need to find this row within the table.\n\n2. **Identify the Column for \"Third Place\":**\n   - Once the correct row (year) is found, we look at the column labeled \"third\" to see who placed third in that season.\n\n3. **Check the Content of the \"Third\" Column for 2008:**\n   - In the 2008 row, under the \"third\" column, check if the name \"lucas di grassi\" appears.\n\n4. **Verify Team Association (if necessary):**\n   - If multiple entries could match, ensure it's the correct Lucas Di Grassi by checking any associated team names for clarity.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on this examination, we can conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- The row corresponding to 2008 shows:\n  - \"giorgio pantano (racing engineering)\" as first place.\n  - \"bruno senna (isport international)\" as second place.\n  - **\"lucas di grassi (barwa int campos team)\"** as third place.\n\nThis confirms that Lucas Di Grassi indeed placed third in 2008, making the claim true.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row for the year 2008.
