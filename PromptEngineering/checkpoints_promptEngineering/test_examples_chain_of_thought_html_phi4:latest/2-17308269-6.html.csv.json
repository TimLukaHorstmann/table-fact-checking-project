    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ann Strother is true or false, we need to evaluate two components of the statement:\n\n1. **Ann Strother's Nationality**: The claim states \"be from connecticut,\" which suggests that her nationality should be Connecticut.\n2. **Former WNBA Team**: The claim includes \"be never play on indiana fever,\" indicating she has not been part of Indiana Fever.\n\nLet's evaluate these components using the data in the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Ann Strother's Row**:\n   - Find the row corresponding to Ann Strother by identifying her name in the \"player\" column.\n   - According to the table, she is listed as pick number 5.\n\n2. **Check Nationality**:\n   - In the same row (pick 5), look at the \"nationality\" column.\n   - The entry shows \"united states,\" not Connecticut. Therefore, Ann Strother is not from Connecticut.\n\n3. **Verify Former WNBA Team**:\n   - Still in the same row, examine the \"former wnba team\" column.\n   - The entry lists \"indiana fever,\" indicating she has played for Indiana Fever.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth components of the claim are false:\n\n- Ann Strother is not from Connecticut; her nationality is listed as United States.\n- She has indeed played for Indiana Fever, contradicting the part of the claim stating she never did.\n\nBased on this analysis, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells in the table that pertain to evaluating the claim are:\n\n1.
