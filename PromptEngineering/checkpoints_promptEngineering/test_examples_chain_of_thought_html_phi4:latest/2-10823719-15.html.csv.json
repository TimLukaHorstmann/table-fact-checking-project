We need to find rows in the table that match this date.\n   - Check each row's \"date\" column:\n     - Row 1: \"14 july 1979\"\n     - Row 2: \"14 july 1979\"\n     - Row 3: \"14 july 1979\"\n     - Row 4: \"14 july 1979\"\n     - Row 5: \"14 july 1979\"\n     - Row 6: \"15 july 1979\"\n\n2. **Identify the Venue**:\n   - The claim mentions \"VFL Park\". We need to find rows where the \"venue\" is \"vfl park\".\n   - Check each row's \"venue\" column for those with the date \"14 july 1979\":\n     - Row 1: \"mcg\"\n     - Row 2: \"western oval\"\n     - Row 3: \"victoria park\"\n     - Row 4: \"princes park\"\n     - Row 5: \"vfl park\"\n\n3. **Identify the Teams and Scores**:\n   - The claim specifies that at VFL Park, the away team was \"geelong\" with a score of \"11.12 (78)\".\n   - For the row where the venue is \"vfl park\" on \"14 july 1979\":\n     - Row 5: \n       - Home Team: \"hawthorn\"\n       - Away Team: \"geelong\"\n       - Home Team Score: \"11.13 (79)\"\n       - Away Team Score: \"11.12 (78)\"\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The row with date \"14 july 1979\" and venue \"vfl park\" is Row 5.\n   - In this row, the away team is indeed \"geelong\", and their score is \"11.12 (78)\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim matches the data in Row 5 of the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows with date '14 july 1979'.
