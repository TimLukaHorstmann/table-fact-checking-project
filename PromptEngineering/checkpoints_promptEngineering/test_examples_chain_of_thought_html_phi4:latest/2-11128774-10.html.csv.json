Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Decision by Mclean**: The claim states that the decision was made by Mclean.\n2. **Series at 2 - 3**: It specifies that the series score should be 2 - 3.\n3. **Home Team is Vancouver**: The home team mentioned in the claim is Vancouver.\n4. **Score of 3 - 5**: The game's score is specified as 3 - 5.\n5. **Date is May 13**: Finally, it mentions that this occurred on May 13.\n\n### Verification:\n- We will examine each row in the table to find a match for all these conditions simultaneously.\n\n#### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Check each row for the date \"May 13\":**\n   - The table has an entry with `date` as \"may 13\" (row index 5).\n\n2. **Verify other conditions for the row with date \"May 13\":**\n   - **Decision**: Check if `decision` is \"mclean\".\n     - For row index 5, `decision` is \"mclean\". This matches the condition.\n   - **Series Score**: Check if `series` is \"2 - 3\".\n     - For row index 5, `series` is \"2 - 3\". This also matches the condition.\n   - **Home Team**: Check if `home` is \"vancouver\".\n     - For row index 5, `home` is \"vancouver\", satisfying this condition as well.\n   - **Score**: Check if `score` is \"3 - 5\".\n     - For row index 5, `score` is \"3 - 5\". This matches the specified score in the claim.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in row index 5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim accurately describes the details provided for the game on May 13.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze two parts:\n\n1. **Decision by Mclean**: Verify if every game in the table has \"mclean\" as the decision.\n2. **Date Range in May**: Check if all dates listed are within the month of May.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Check Decision Column**:\n   - Look at each row's \"decision\" column to ensure it is consistently \"mclean\".\n   - Rows examined:\n     - May 2: decision = \"mclean\"\n     - May 5: decision = \"mclean\"\n     - May 7: decision = \"mclean\"\n     - May 9: decision = \"mclean\"\n     - May 11: decision = \"mclean\"\n     - May 13: decision = \"mclean\"\n   - Conclusion: All decisions are \"mclean\".\n\n2. **Check Date Column**:\n   - Verify if all dates are within the month of May.\n   - Dates listed:\n     - May 2\n     - May 5\n     - May 7\n     - May 9\n     - May 11\n     - May 13\n   - Conclusion: All dates occur in May.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The claim mentions the \"1992-93 Vancouver Canucks season\". However, this table does not provide any information about the year or specific details about the season.\n   - Based solely on the table provided, we cannot confirm or deny if these games are from the 1992-93 season as there is no relevant data in the table to verify this part of the claim.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n- The decision being \"mclean\" for all entries is true according to the table.\n- All dates occurring in May is also true based on the table.\n- However, due to lack of information regarding the specific season (1992-93), we cannot confirm the full context of the claim. Therefore, based solely on the provided data, the claim as stated (\"in the 1992 - 93 Vancouver Canuck season\") cannot be verified.\n\nSince the table does not support or refute the year/season part but confirms \"mclean\" decisions and dates in May, we focus on what is verifiable:\n\n- The statement about Mclean being the decision and all dates occurring in May are true based on available data.\n  \nTherefore, with the information given in the table:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'decision' column consistently shows 'mclean' for each entry.
