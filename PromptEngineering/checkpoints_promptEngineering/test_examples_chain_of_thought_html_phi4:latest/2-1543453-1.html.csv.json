Here's what the relevant rows look like:\n\n1. **1987** - `alvin seville simon seville david 'dave' seville`\n2. **1999** - `alvin seville simon seville david 'dave' seville`\n3. **2000** - `alvin seville simon seville david 'dave' seville`\n4. **2005** - `alvin seville simon seville david 'dave' seville`\n5. **2007** - `alvin seville simon seville`\n6. **2009** - `alvin seville simon seville`\n7. **2011** - `alvin seville simon seville`\n\n### Step 2: Check Consistency of Actor for Simon Seville\n\nThe claim states that there are two different actors playing the role of Simon Seville across these seven productions. Let's analyze:\n\n- In all the rows listed, Simon Seville is consistently mentioned alongside Alvin and occasionally David 'Dave' Seville.\n- The table does not provide specific names of the actors who portrayed Simon Seville in any of the years or specify any changes.\n\n### Step 3: Verify for Actor Change\n\nTo verify if two different actors played Simon Seville, we would need explicit information indicating a change. However:\n\n- The table shows no indication of different actors by name or credit.\n- Both \"producer\" and \"actor\" columns are marked as \"yes,\" but this does not specify actor changes or names.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the data in the table, there is no evidence provided to support that two different actors played Simon Seville.
