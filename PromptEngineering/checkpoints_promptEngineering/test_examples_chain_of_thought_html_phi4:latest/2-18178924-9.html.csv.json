    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Twickenham, London have less than 16 against\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant information from the HTML table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The claim pertains to games played at \"Twickenham, London\". Therefore, we focus on the `venue` column in the table to identify matches held at this venue.\n   \n2. **Locate Matches at Twickenham, London:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 2: Venue is \"twickenham , london\" with a score of 9 against Wales.\n     - Row 4: Venue is \"twickenham , london\" with a score of 9 against Ireland.\n     - Row 5: Venue is \"twickenham , london\" with a score of 16 against New Zealand.\n\n3. **Analyze the 'Against' Scores at Twickenham, London:**\n   - For the matches held at Twickenham, London:\n     - Against Wales: The score is 9.\n     - Against Ireland: The score is 9.\n     - Against New Zealand: The score is 16.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"Twickenham, London have less than 16 against\".\n   - We need to check if all matches at Twickenham have scores strictly less than 16.\n   - We find that two matches (against Wales and Ireland) have scores of 9, which are less than 16. However, the match against New Zealand has a score of exactly 16.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is one instance where the score \"against\" is not less than 16 (it's exactly 16), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 2, Column `against`: Score 9\n- Row 4, Column `against`: Score 9\n- Row 5, Column `against`: Score 16\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim pertains to matches at Twickenham, London.
