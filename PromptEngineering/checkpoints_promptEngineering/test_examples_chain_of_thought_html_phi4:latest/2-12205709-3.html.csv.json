We'll look for this date within the `date` column (under the header `date`) of the table.\n   \n2. **Locate April 18 Entry**:\n   - Locate the row where the cell under the column named \"date\" contains \"april 18\".\n\n3. **Check the Score on April 18**:\n   - Once we find the relevant date, examine the cell in that row under the column labeled \"score\".\n   - Note the score listed for this particular game.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states: \"the score of the game held on April 18 be 7 - 0.\"\n   - Compare the actual score from the table with the claimed score to verify if they match.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the score in the table matches \"7 - 0\", the claim is true.\n   - If it does not, the claim is false.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Locate the row with `date` as \"april 18\". This corresponds to the 13th row in the table (considering zero-indexing).\n  \n- Check the score for April 18:\n  - In this row, under the column \"score\", we find the entry: \"7 - 3\".\n\n- Compare this with the claim:\n  - The claim is \"the score of the game held on April 18 be 7 - 0\".\n  - Since \"7 - 3\" does not match \"7 - 0\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cell that contains the information necessary to evaluate the claim is located at:\n- `row_index`: 13\n- `column_name`: \"score\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to April 18 under the 'date' column.\",\n    \"Locate and note the score for this specific date, which is found in the 'score' column.\",\n    \"Compare the actual score ('7 - 3') with the claimed score ('7 - 0').\",\n    \"Since they do not match, conclude that the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"when Nakaumura (0 - 1) lost, attendance hit 11210\" is true or false, we need to carefully analyze the table for relevant information.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Player**: The claim mentions a player named \"Nakaumura.\" In the table, there is an entry with \"nakamura (0 - 1)\" in the 'Loss' column. We will assume this refers to the same person since it's common for names to have different spellings.\n\n2. **Check the Record**: According to the table, Nakamura has a loss record of \"(0 - 1).\" This indicates that this is his first recorded loss in the table.\n\n3. **Find the Date and Attendance**:\n   - The row where \"nakamura (0 - 1)\" appears is on April 29 against the White Sox.\n   - In this same row, the 'Attendance' column shows a value of \"11210.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Conditions**: \n   - The claim states that when Nakamura lost, the attendance was 11210. We have identified that Nakamura's loss (0 - 1) corresponds to an attendance of 11210.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: All conditions specified in the claim are met by the data in the table: Nakamura's loss record is (0 - 1), and the corresponding attendance on April 29 was indeed 11210.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim mentions a player named 'Nakaumura' with a loss record of '(0 - 1)' and an attendance of 11210.
