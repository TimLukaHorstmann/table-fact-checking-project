Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Claimed Episode and Viewership**: \n   - The claim states that the episode \"Homecoming\" has 2.60 million US viewers.\n   - Locate \"Homecoming\" in the table to verify its actual viewership.\n\n2. **Locate the Episode \"Homecoming\"**:\n   - From the table, find the row corresponding to the episode titled \"homecoming\".\n   - This is found at row index 206 with a viewership of 3.00 million (not 2.60 million as claimed).\n\n3. **Verify Viewership for \"Homecoming\"**:\n   - The actual US viewer count for \"Homecoming\" is 3.00 million, not 2.60 million.\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Viewer Count in the Table**:\n   - Check all entries to find the highest number of viewers.\n   - The episode with the highest number of viewers is \"Lioness\", not listed here, but from available data, \"homecoming\" has the highest at 3.00 million.\n\n5. **Verify Episodes with 2.60 Million Viewers**:\n   - Locate any episodes that have exactly 2.60 million viewers.\n   - The episode titled \"Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf\" (not listed here) is known to have 2.60 million, but within the table, the episode \"shield\" has 2.60 million viewers.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that \"Homecoming\" has 2.60 million viewers is incorrect.\n   - Moreover, \"Homecoming\" does not have the highest number of viewers; it actually has the highest in this dataset at 3.00 million.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
