    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Year of Interest**: The claim specifically mentions the year 2002. We need to focus on entries from this year.\n\n2. **Locate Entries for 2002**: Examine each row in the \"date\" column to find matches that fall within the year 2002.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Matches**:\n   - From the table, identify rows where the date indicates a match occurred in 2002.\n   - These rows are:\n     - Row 8: Date is \"1 June 2002\", Venue is \"sapporo dome , sapporo\", Score is \"4 - 0\", Result is \"8 - 0\", Competition is \"2002 world cup\".\n     - Row 9: Date is \"21 August 2002\", Venue is \"vasil levski national stadium , sofia\", Score is \"2 - 2\", Result is \"2 - 2\", Competition is \"friendly\".\n     - Row 10: Date is \"11 October 2002\", Venue is \"asim ferhatovi\u0107 hase stadium , sarajevo\", Score is \"1 - 1\", Result is \"1 - 1\", Competition is \"friendly\".\n\n4. **Determine Goals Scored**:\n   - For each match, look at the \"score\" column to determine how many goals were scored by the team associated with Carsten Jancker.\n   - Row 8: The score \"4 - 0\" indicates that Carsten Jancker's team scored 4 goals in this match.\n   - Row 9: The score \"2 - 2\" indicates that Carsten Jancker's team scored 2 goals, but we only count the goals from his team, which is 2.\n   - Row 10: The score \"1 - 1\" indicates that Carsten Jancker's team scored 1 goal.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Goals**:\n   - Add up the goals scored by Carsten Jancker\u2019s team in each match:\n     - From Row 8: 4 goals\n     - From Row 9: 2 goals\n     - From Row 10: 1 goal\n   - Total = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 goals\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002.\n   - Based on our calculations, his team scored a total of 7 goals across three matches in 2002.\n   - However, the table does not specify which player scored these goals. Therefore, we cannot definitively attribute all or any specific number of these goals to Carsten Jancker.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002\" cannot be verified as TRUE based solely on this table because it lacks information about individual goal scorers.

The final \"result\" shows the full-time score. Here, no goals are indicated in the \"score\" as being scored by Carsten Jancker.\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Date: 1 September 2001\n     - Competition: 2002 World Cup Qualifier\n     - Score: 1 - 0\n     - Result: 1 - 5\n\n     Similar to Row 4, the \"score\" (1-0) is an interim score.
