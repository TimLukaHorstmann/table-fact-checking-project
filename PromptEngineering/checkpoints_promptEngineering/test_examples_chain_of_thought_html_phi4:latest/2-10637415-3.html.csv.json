    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we will analyze each row in the HTML table to check for drawn matches.\n\n### Claim:\n\"The halifax blue sox be the only team to not have get a draw during the 1997 world club championship.\"\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the \"drawn\" column**:\n   - Column name: `drawn`\n   - This column indicates the number of drawn matches for each team.\n\n2. **Evaluate each row for the \"drawn\" value**:\n   - We need to check if any team has a non-zero value in the \"drawn\" column, which would indicate at least one draw.\n   \n3. **Row-by-row analysis**:\n   - **Row 1 (Wigan Warriors)**: `drawn` = 0\n     - No draws for Wigan Warriors.\n   - **Row 2 (London Broncos)**: `drawn` = 0\n     - No draws for London Broncos.\n   - **Row 3 (Bradford Bulls)**: `drawn` = 0\n     - No draws for Bradford Bulls.\n   - **Row 4 (St Helens RLFC)**: `drawn` = 0\n     - No draws for St Helens RLFC.\n   - **Row 5 (Warrington Wolves)**: `drawn` = 0\n     - No draws for Warrington Wolves.\n   - **Row 6 (Halifax Blue Sox)**: `drawn` = 0\n     - No draws for Halifax Blue Sox.\n\n4. **Conclusion from the table**:\n   - All teams listed in the table have 0 draws, including Halifax Blue Sox.\n   - Therefore, it is not true that Halifax Blue Sox are the only team without a draw since all teams share this characteristic.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n- The claim states that Halifax Blue Sox are the \"only\" team with no draws. However, every team listed has zero draws.\n- Thus, the statement is FALSE because multiple teams have not gotten any draws, not just Halifax Blue Sox.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'drawn' column indicates the number of drawn matches for each team.
