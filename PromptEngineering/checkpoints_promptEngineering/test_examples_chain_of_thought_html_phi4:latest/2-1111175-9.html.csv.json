    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Magdalena Maleeva played twice as often on hard surface than on clay\" is true, we need to analyze the data from the table provided.\n\n### Steps of Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played on Clay Surface:**\n   - We look for entries in the table where the column \"surface\" is labeled as \"clay\".\n   - Count the number of matches played by Magdalena Maleeva on clay.\n\n2. **Identify Matches Played on Hard Surface:**\n   - Similarly, we look for entries where the surface is labeled as \"hard\" or \"hard (i)\".\n   - Count the number of matches played by Magdalena Maleeva on these surfaces.\n\n3. **Compare the Counts:**\n   - Compare the counts from steps 1 and 2 to determine if the number of hard court matches is twice that of clay court matches.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Matches Played on Clay Surface:**\n  - Row 0: \"clay\"\n  - Row 1: \"clay\"\n  - Row 3: \"clay\"\n  - Row 4: \"clay\"\n  - Total Matches on Clay = 4\n\n- **Matches Played on Hard Surface:**\n  - Row 2: \"hard\"\n  - Row 9: \"hard (i)\"\n  - Row 18: \"hard (i)\"\n  - Row 19: \"hard (i)\"\n  - Total Matches on Hard = 4\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMagdalena Maleeva played 4 matches on clay and 4 matches on hard surfaces. Therefore, she did not play twice as often on the hard surface compared to the clay.\n\n- The claim is **FALSE** because the number of hard court matches (4) is equal to the number of clay court matches (4), not double.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are those corresponding to the surfaces \"clay\" and \"hard\"/\"hard (i)\" for Magdalena Maleeva's matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Counted the number of matches played by Magdalena Maleeva on clay surfaces and hard surfaces.
