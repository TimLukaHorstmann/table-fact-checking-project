Let's analyze the data from the provided table step by step.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Races at Albi Circuit:**\n   - First, locate all rows where the \"Race\" column contains \"Albi.\"\n   - We have two entries related to Albi:\n     - Row 18 and Row 19 both mention \"grand prix de l'albigeois qualifying heat.\"\n     - Row 20 and Row 21 mention \"grand prix de l'albigeois final.\"\n\n2. **Check for Different Races:**\n   - From the above step, we see two distinct race events at Albi:\n     - Qualifying Heat\n     - Final\n\n3. **Verify BRM Type 15 Participation:**\n   - Check if the BRM Type 15 participated in these races.\n   - According to Rows 18-21:\n     - In both \"grand prix de l'albigeois qualifying heat\" (Rows 18 and 19), Ken Wharton drove a BRM Type 15, finishing in position 2.\n     - In the \"grand prix de l'albigeois final\" (Rows 20 and 21), Ken Wharton again participated with a BRM Type 15 but retired from the race.\n\n4. **Count Unique Races:**\n   - We identified two unique races at Albi where the BRM Type 15 participated:\n     - Qualifying Heat\n     - Final\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the BRM Type 15 took part in four different races on the Albi circuit.\n   - Based on the table, there are only two unique races at Albi where the BRM Type 15 participated.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified all entries related to the Albi circuit.
