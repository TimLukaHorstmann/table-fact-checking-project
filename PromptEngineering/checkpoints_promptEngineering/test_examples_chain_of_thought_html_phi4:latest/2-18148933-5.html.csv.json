    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"David Frost be from United States\" is true or false, we will analyze the provided table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row for David Frost:**\n   - Locate the row where the player's name is \"david frost\". According to the table, this is in the third row.\n\n2. **Check the 'country' column for David Frost:**\n   - In the identified row (row 3), look at the value under the 'country' column.\n   - The entry shows that David Frost's country is \"south africa\".\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that David Frost is from the United States.\n   - However, based on the table data, he is listed as being from South Africa.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since David Frost is from South Africa and not the United States, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant cells for verification:**\n   - The relevant cell to verify this information is in row 3 under the 'country' column.\n\nHere's the JSON output summarizing the reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the row with player name 'david frost'.\",\n    \"Check the 'country' value for David Frost, which is found to be 'south africa'.\",\n    \"The claim states he is from the United States.\",\n    \"Since he is actually from South Africa, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
