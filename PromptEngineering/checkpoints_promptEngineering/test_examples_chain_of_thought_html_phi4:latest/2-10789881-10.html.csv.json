    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim implies that exactly two-thirds (or approximately 67%) of the games listed had a home team score higher than 10.0 goals. Since \"third\" is mentioned, and there are six matches in total, this would mean approximately four teams should have scored more than 10.0 goals.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column to check for each row is \"home team score\".\n\n3. **Convert Scores to Goals**: The scores are given in a format that includes both goals and behinds (e.g., 14.12 (96)). We need to focus only on the number of goals, which is the first value before the dot.\n\n4. **Count Matches with Home Team Score > 10**:\n   - Row 1: Hawthorn scored 14 goals.\n   - Row 2: Fitzroy scored 8 goals.\n   - Row 3: Richmond scored 8 goals.\n   - Row 4: Geelong scored 7 goals.\n   - Row 5: Essendon scored 12 goals.\n   - Row 6: South Melbourne scored 10 goals.\n\n5. **Determine Matches with Scores Greater than 10 Goals**:\n   - Hawthorn (14 goals) > 10\n   - Fitzroy (8 goals) \u2264 10\n   - Richmond (8 goals) \u2264 10\n   - Geelong (7 goals) \u2264 10\n   - Essendon (12 goals) > 10\n   - South Melbourne (10 goals) = 10\n\n6. **Count the Number of Matches with Scores > 10 Goals**: \n   - Hawthorn and Essendon have scores greater than 10 goals.\n   - Total matches where home team scored more than 10: 2.\n\n7. **Calculate the Fraction**:\n   - There are 6 total games.\n   - \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the games had a home team score higher than 10 goals, not two-thirds as claimed.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The claim that \"2 - third\" (approximately four teams) have scores higher than 10.0 is FALSE since only one-third (two out of six) did.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists six matches with home team scores provided.
