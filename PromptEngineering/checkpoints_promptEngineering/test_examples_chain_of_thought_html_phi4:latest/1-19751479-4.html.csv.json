    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the 10th race having \"99 GAINSCO / BOB STALLING RACING\" in pole position is true, we need to analyze the provided table and examine the relevant cells.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Pole Position:**\n   - In racing contexts, being \"in pole position\" typically means a team or driver had the fastest time during qualifying rounds, thus starting at the front of the grid for the race.\n\n2. **Identify Row Corresponding to Race 10:**\n   - We need to locate information about round 10 in the table. According to the data structure:\n     - The row where \"Round\" is \"10\" corresponds to Montreal.\n   \n3. **Locate Relevant Cells in Round 10:**\n   - For each race, there are four columns of results which we must examine for any indication of pole position status.\n\n4. **Check Each Result Column for Round 10:**\n   - Row Index = 10 (corresponds to round 10):\n     - First result column (Row 10, Column \"99 GAINSCO / BOB STALLING RACING\"): \n       - The team appears here and is marked as the winner of this race segment.\n     - Second result column (Row 10, Column \"99 GAINSCO / BOB STALLING RACING\"):\n       - Again, the team is noted here, indicating another strong performance but not necessarily pole position.\n     - Third result column (Row 10, Column \"MAX ANGELELLI / BRIAN FRISSELLE\"):\n       - The results show a different team and driver combination.\n     - Fourth result column (Row 10, Column \"57 STEVENSON MOTORSPORTS\"):\n       - Another distinct team is listed here.\n\n5. **Conclusion from Data Analysis:**\n   - There are no explicit mentions of pole position in the table for round 10 or any other race. \n   - The claim specifies that 99 GAINSCO / BOB STALLING RACING should be noted as having pole position specifically, but none of the columns indicate such a status directly.\n\n6. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - Without explicit data labeling \"pole position\" or equivalent terminology indicating qualifying success in any of these results for round 10, the claim cannot be confirmed based on the provided table alone.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The task is to verify if '99 GAINSCO / BOB STALLING RACING' had pole position in round 10.
