The corresponding `region` value should be checked to ensure it matches \"southwest\".\n   \n3. **Check the Results**:\n   - For the identified year and region, examine the `results` column to determine how many games were won and lost.\n   - Each \"w\" indicates a win, and each \"l\" indicates a loss. Count these occurrences in the results string.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Wins and Losses**:\n   - Calculate the total number of wins from the results (each \"w\" followed by scores counts as one win).\n   - Similarly, calculate the total number of losses from the results (each \"l\" followed by scores counts as one loss).\n\n5. **Verify the Record**:\n   - The record format is given in the `record` column as \"wins-losses\".

The `results` column matches: \"w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70\"\n2. The `record` column is \"27 - 9\"\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Table\n\n- **Row 1 (1980):** \n  - Record: \"18 - 12\"\n  - Results: \"l 72 - 86\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 2 (1981):**\n  - Record: \"24 - 5\"\n  - Results: \"w 85 - 69 l 56 - 58 ot\"\n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 3 (1983):**\n  - Record: \"24 - 7\"\n  - Results: \"w 76 - 67 l 54 - 56\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 4 (1984):**\n  - Record: \"23 - 7\"\n  - Results: \"w 70 - 69 l 63 - 78\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 5 (1985):**\n  - Record: \"26 - 6\"\n  - Results: \"w 81 - 65 l 59 - 63\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 6 (1996):**\n  - Record: \"24 - 9\"\n  - Results: \"l 51 - 58\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 7 (2004):**\n  - Record: \"23 - 8\"\n  - Results: \"l 78 - 79\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 8 (2007):**\n  - Record: \"28 - 7\"\n  - Results: \"w 79 - 77 l 79 - 84 ot\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 9 (2009):**\n  - Record: \"24 - 10\"\n  - Results: \"l 64 - 65\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 10 (2011):**\n  - Record: \"28 - 12\"\n  - Results: \"w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70\"  \n  - The results match the claim, but the record does not (\"28 - 12\" vs. claimed \"27 - 9\").\n\n- **Row 11 (2012):**\n  - Record: \"29 - 7\"\n  - Results: \"w 62 - 59 l 61 - 63\"  \n  - This does not match.\n\n- **Row 12 (2013):**\n  - Record: \"27 - 9\"\n  - Results: \"w 88 - 42 l 53 - 78\"  \n  - The record matches, but the results do not.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe claim requires both a specific `record` and `results` to match simultaneously in one row. No single row in the table satisfies both conditions at once:\n- Row 10 has the correct `results`, but an incorrect `record`.\n- Row 12 has the correct `record`, but incorrect `results`.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim requires finding a row with results 'w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70' and record '27 - 9'.\",\n    \"Rows are examined for these conditions.\",\n    \"Row 10 matches the results but has a different record ('28 - 12').\",\n    \"Row 12 matches the record but has different results ('w 88 - 42 l 53 - 78').\",\n    \"No single row satisfies both conditions.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\", \"value\": \"28 - 12\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"results\", \"value\": \"w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\", \"value\": \"27 - 9\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"results\", \"value\": \"w 88 - 42 l 53 - 78\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
