    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the information provided in the table regarding Gary Beach's nominations and results for Tony Awards.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions Tony Awards. Therefore, we will focus on rows where the \"award\" column contains \"tony award.\"\n\n2. **Locate Entries Involving Gary Beach:**\n   - We need to find entries in the table that mention Gary Beach in the \"nominee\" column under the category of \"tony award.\"\n\n3. **Check Gary Beach's Result:**\n   - Once we locate Gary Beach's entry, we will check the \"result\" column to determine if he won.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Winners:**\n   - We need to count how many individuals or entities are listed as winners in the Tony Awards category.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Gary Beach is one of four winners. We will verify this by checking if there are indeed four winners and if Gary Beach is among them.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Relevant Rows for Tony Awards:**\n  - Row 1: Award - \"tony award\", Result - \"won\" (Category - \"best revival of a musical\")\n  - Row 2: Award - \"tony award\", Nominee - \"gary beach\", Result - \"nominated\"\n  - Row 3: Award - \"tony award\", Result - \"won\" (Nominee - \"jerry mitchell\")\n  - Row 4: Award - \"tony award\", Result - \"nominated\" (Nominee - \"william ivey long\")\n\n- **Gary Beach's Entry:**\n  - In row 2, Gary Beach is nominated for the Tony Award in the category \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical,\" but he did not win (\"result\": \"nominated\").\n\n- **Count of Winners in Tony Awards:**\n  - From the relevant rows (1, 3), we have:\n    - Row 1: Winner (Category - \"best revival of a musical\")\n    - Row 3: Winner (Nominee - \"jerry mitchell\")\n\n  Thus, there are only two winners listed for the Tony Awards in this table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Gary Beach did not win a Tony Award; he was nominated but did not win.\n- There are only two winners of Tony Awards mentioned in the table, not four.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award but did not win.
