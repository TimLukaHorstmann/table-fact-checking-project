We will focus on rows where the \"year\" column equals 2012.\n   \n2. **Check for Nominations in Acting Categories in 2012:**\n   - The claim mentions that Kristofer Martin was nominated for three acting awards in 2012.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 4 (Index 1): He was nominated for \"best performance\" at \"The Young Critics Circle Awards.\"\n     - Row 5 (Index 2): He was nominated for \"new movie actor of the year\" at \"28th PMPC Star Awards for Movies.\"\n\n   - These are two acting nominations in 2012.
