B Shaw had 5 assists in that particular game.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - `game`: 1\n  - `date`: May 7\n  - `team`: Detroit Pistons\n  - `score`: L 75 - 86\n  - `high points`: R Lewis (20)\n  - `high rebounds`: K McHale (10)\n  - `high assists`: B Shaw (5)\n  - `location attendance`: Boston Garden\n  - `series`: 0 - 1\n\nThe score for this game is indeed \"L 75 - 86,\" which matches the final score mentioned in the claim. Additionally, it states that B Shaw had 5 assists.\n\nGiven these details from Row 1:\n\n- The final score of the game was 75 - 86.\n- B Shaw recorded 5 assists in this game.\n\nBoth conditions required by the claim are satisfied based on this row's data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.
