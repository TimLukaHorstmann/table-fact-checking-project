We need to locate this specific entry in the table.\n   - From the table, we see that there are two entries for \"8 may\" (May 8), one with \"tier i\" and another with \"tier iv\".\n\n2. **Verify Tier:**\n   - The relevant row for \"week of May 8, tier 1\" is:\n     - Row index: 5\n     - Tier: \"tier i\"\n\n3. **Check the Winner:**\n   - According to the claim, \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\" should be listed as winners.\n   - In row index 5, the winner is listed as \"conchita mart\u00ednez 6 - 3 , 6 - 1\".\n   - Therefore, the claim about the winners is incorrect.\n\n4. **Check the Runner-Up:**\n   - The claim states that \"conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini\" should be runners-up.\n   - In row index 5, the runner-up is listed as \"arantxa s\u00e1nchez vicario\".\n   - Therefore, the claim about the runners-up is incorrect.\n\n5. **Check the Semi-Finalists:**\n   - The claim states that \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\" should be semi-finalists.\n   - In row index 5, the semi-finalists are listed as \"helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce\".\n   - This part of the claim is correct.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim about the winners and runners-up does not match the data in the table for the specified week and tier.
