    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and verify if any game after May 10 has a score of \"5 - 4 (ot)\" with the location being \"montreal forum.\"\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the Date Column**: The column titled \"date\" lists all the dates on which games were played.\n\n2. **Locate Games After May 10**:\n   - Examine each row to find if there are any entries after May 10.\n   - In the table, the latest date mentioned is May 10.\n\n3. **Examine the Date Column for Entries After May 10**:\n   - The dates listed in order are: April 26, April 28, May 1, May 3, May 5, May 8, and May 10.\n   - There are no entries after May 10.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Dates**: Since there are no games listed after May 10, it is impossible for any game to have a date after May 10 with any score or location.\n\n5. **Examine the Score Column**:\n   - The specific score \"5 - 4 (ot)\" appears only once in the table on May 10.\n   - There are no other entries to verify if this score occurs again after May 10.\n\n6. **Conclusion on Scores**: Since there are no dates after May 10, there cannot be a game with the score \"5 - 4 (ot)\" after that date.\n\n7. **Examine the Location/Attendance Column**:\n   - The location \"montreal forum\" appears for games on April 26, April 28, May 5, and May 10.\n   - None of these dates are after May 10.\n\n8. **Conclusion on Locations**: Since there are no entries after May 10, the location \"montreal forum\" cannot be associated with any game after this date.\n\nBased on the analysis above, there is no game after May 10 that has a score of \"5 - 4 (ot)\" and takes place at \"montreal forum.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists games up to May 10.
