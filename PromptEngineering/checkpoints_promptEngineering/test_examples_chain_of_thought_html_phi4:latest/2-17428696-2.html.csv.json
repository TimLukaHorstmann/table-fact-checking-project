    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about TUF fighter Joseph Benavidez's fight record is correct, we will break down the claim into parts and verify each part using the provided data:\n\n1. **Claim Breakdown**:\n   - The event should have 3 rounds.\n   - The time for the event should be \"1:51\".\n   - At this event, Joseph Benavidez's record was \"2 - 0\".\n\n2. **Verification Steps**:\n\n    a. **Check for Events with 3 Rounds**:\n       - From the data, we need to find any fights that went the distance of 3 rounds. \n       - Typically, in MMA, only championship and main event non-title fights are scheduled for 3 rounds. Non-main events usually last 3:00 per round.\n\n    b. **Find Time \"1:51\"**:\n       - We need to identify if there is any fight recorded with the time \"1:51\".\n    \n    c. **Verify Record \"2 - 0\"**:\n       - Identify a fight where Joseph Benavidez's record was \"2 - 0\".\n\n3. **Analysis of Data**:\n\n   - Reviewing each row to find matches for these conditions:\n     - **Row with time \"1:51\"**: \n       - We find the match against Brian Peterson at `ifc warriors challenge 14` with a time listed as \"1:51\".\n     \n     - **Rounds Check**: \n       - This fight is not indicated as having gone to 3 rounds. It's a one-round event since no total time for all rounds is provided, and typically such short times imply the fight ended in that round.\n\n     - **Record \"2 - 0\"**:\n       - For the same match against Brian Peterson at `ifc warriors challenge 14`, Joseph Benavidez's record was indeed \"2 - 0\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n\n   - The event with a time of \"1:51\" does not indicate it went for 3 rounds. It is likely a one-round fight, as no other information suggests otherwise.\n   - Therefore, the claim that there exists an event meeting all three conditions (3 rounds, \"1:51\", and record \"2 - 0\") is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for time \"1:51\" and record \"2 - 0\" is found in the row corresponding to `ifc warriors challenge 14`.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires an event with three rounds, a time of '1:51', and a record of '2 - 0'. The only instance of a fight with '1:51' is against Brian Peterson at 'ifc warriors challenge 14', but this was not a 3-round event.
