    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process based on the information provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that \"the low point total for team with 81 place be 185.7.\"\n\n2. **Locate Teams with 81 Places**:\n   - Examine the 'places' column in the table to find any teams that have exactly 81 places.\n   - From the provided data, we observe the following entry in row 9:\n\n     ```\n     <tr>\n       <td>9</td>\n       <td>stacey smith / john summers</td>\n       <td>united states</td>\n       <td>185.70</td>\n       <td>81</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Points Total**:\n   - For the team with 81 places (row 9), check their corresponding points total.\n   - The 'points' column value for this row is 185.70.\n\n4. **Check for Any Other Teams with 81 Places**:\n   - Review the entire table to ensure there are no other teams listed with exactly 81 places.\n   - No additional entries have 81 places; therefore, Stacey Smith / John Summers is the only team at this rank.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim's Statement**:\n   - The claim mentions that the low point total for a team with 81 places should be 185.7.\n   - Since the only team with 81 places has exactly 185.70 points, this matches the claim.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the steps above, the claim is consistent with the data in the table.
