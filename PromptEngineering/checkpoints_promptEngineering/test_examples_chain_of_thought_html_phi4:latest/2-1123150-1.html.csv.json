Let's go through the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement claims that \"only 4 driver[s] be unable to complete 0 lap\". This means we are looking for exactly four instances in the table where a driver has a recorded number of completed laps as 0.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: We need to focus on the \"laps\" column, which lists the number of completed laps for each driver.\n\n3. **Search for Entries with 0 Laps**:\n   - We'll look through the rows in the table and identify where the value in the \"laps\" column is 0.\n\n4. **Count Instances**: Count how many times a driver has recorded completing 0 laps.\n\n5. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - If we find exactly four such instances, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - If we find more or fewer than four such instances, then the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n- **Row by Row Inspection**: \n  - For each row in the table, check if the \"laps\" column value is 0. \n\nLet's list down all the relevant cells based on our inspection:\n  \n1. **Michele Alboreto** (Row 16): Laps = 0\n2. **Pierluigi Martini** (Row 17): Laps = 0\n3. **Olivier Grouillard** (Row 18): Laps = 0\n\nThese are the rows where the laps completed by drivers is exactly 0.
