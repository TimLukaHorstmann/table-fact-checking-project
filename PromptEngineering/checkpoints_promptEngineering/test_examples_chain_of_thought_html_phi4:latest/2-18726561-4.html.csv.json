    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table for matches that ended in a draw and analyze their scores.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Drawn Matches:**\n   - A drawn match is indicated by an equal score (e.g., \"1 - 1\" or \"0 - 0\").\n   - We need to find all rows where the 'score' column contains a draw.\n\n2. **Locate Rows with Draws:**\n   - Row 7: Coventry City vs. Newcastle United, Score: \"1 - 1\"\n   - Row 13: Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth, Score: \"1 - 1\"\n\n3. **Check for Goalless Draws:**\n   - A goalless draw would be indicated by the score \"0 - 0\".\n   - We need to check if any of these drawn matches are goalless.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Drawn Match:**\n   - Row 7: The score is \"1 - 1\", which means it was not a goalless match.\n   - Row 13: The score is \"1 - 1\", which also means it was not a goalless match.\n\n5. **Check for Additional Draws:**\n   - Review the table again to ensure no other drawn matches are missed.\n   - There are only two drawn matches (Rows 7 and 13) that ended with scores of \"1 - 1\".\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the drawn matches were goalless (\"0 - 0\").\n   - Therefore, the claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is FALSE because there are only two drawn matches, and neither was goalless.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 7, Column 'score': \"1 - 1\"\n- Row 13, Column 'score': \"1 - 1\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the rows with drawn matches by looking for equal scores in the 'score' column.
