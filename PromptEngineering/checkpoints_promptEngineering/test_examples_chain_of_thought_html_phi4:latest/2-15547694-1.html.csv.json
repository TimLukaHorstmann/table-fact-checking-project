    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"administrative panel have 4 more members than national university of ireland\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to compare the numbers from the relevant columns in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The column for \"administrative panel.\"\n   - The column for \"national university of ireland.\"\n\n2. **Extract Data from Total Row:**\n   - From the \"total\" row:\n     - The value under \"administrative panel\" is 7.\n     - The value under \"national university of ireland\" is 3.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of members in \"national university of ireland\" from the number in \"administrative panel\":\n     \\[\n     7 (\\text{administrative panel}) - 3 (\\text{national university of ireland}) = 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the administrative panel has 4 more members than the national university of Ireland.\n   - Our calculation shows exactly a difference of 4.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since our calculated difference matches the claim, the statement is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- \"administrative panel\" in the total row: { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"administrative panel\" }\n- \"national university of ireland\" in the total row: { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national university of ireland\" }\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the columns for 'administrative panel' and 'national university of ireland'.
