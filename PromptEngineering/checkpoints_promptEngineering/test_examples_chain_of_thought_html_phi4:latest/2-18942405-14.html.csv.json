    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we will follow a systematic approach to verify each component of the claim by examining the relevant parts of the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: \n   - The claim states: \"the andrean fighting '59ers have an enrollment of 587.\"\n\n2. **Break Down the Claim**:\n   - School Name: Andrean\n   - Mascot: Fighting '59ers\n   - Enrollment: 587\n\n3. **Locate the Relevant Row in the Table**:\n   - We need to find the row where both \"school\" is \"andrean\" and \"mascot\" is \"fighting '59ers.\"\n\n4. **Examine the First Row of the Table**:\n   - School: Andrean\n   - Location: Merrillville\n   - Mascot: Fighting '59ers\n   - Enrollment: 587\n   - IHSAA Class: AAA\n   - IHSAA Football Class: AA\n   - County: 45 Lake\n\n5. **Verify the Details**:\n   - The school name \"andrean\" matches.\n   - The mascot \"fighting '59ers\" matches.\n   - The enrollment is listed as 587.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - All components of the claim are verified to be true based on the data in the first row of the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'the andrean fighting '59ers have an enrollment of 587.' We located the row where the school is 'andrean' and the mascot is 'fighting '59ers,' which corresponds to the first row. The enrollment listed in this row is indeed 587, confirming the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
