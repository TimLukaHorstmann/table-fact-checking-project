    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no team scored more than 110 points in a game\" is true or false, we need to examine the scores for each game listed in the table. The scores are provided in both goal-kick format (e.g., `13.16`) and as total points (e.g., `(94)`). We will focus on the total points column labeled \"home team score\" and \"away team score.\"\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns:**  \n   The scores are listed in two columns: \"home team score\" and \"away team score.\" Both columns contain values formatted as goal-kick followed by total points in parentheses.\n\n2. **Extract and examine the scores:**\n    - For each row, extract both the home team's and away team's total points.\n    - Convert these into numerical values to check if any are greater than 110.\n\n3. **Evaluate each game:**\n\n   - **Row 1:**  \n     - Home Team Score: `13.16 (94)` -> Total Points = 94\n     - Away Team Score: `11.7 (73)` -> Total Points = 73\n   \n   - **Row 2:**  \n     - Home Team Score: `17.17 (119)` -> Total Points = 119\n     - Away Team Score: `8.11 (59)` -> Total Points = 59\n\n   - **Row 3:**  \n     - Home Team Score: `10.10 (70)` -> Total Points = 70\n     - Away Team Score: `7.9 (51)` -> Total Points = 51\n\n   - **Row 4:**  \n     - Home Team Score: `18.12 (120)` -> Total Points = 120\n     - Away Team Score: `4.4 (28)` -> Total Points = 28\n\n   - **Row 5:**  \n     - Home Team Score: `5.9 (39)` -> Total Points = 39\n     - Away Team Score: `6.13 (49)` -> Total Points = 49\n\n4. **Identify scores greater than 110:**\n   - In Row 2, the home team score is 119 points.\n   - In Row 4, the home team score is 120 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since there are two instances where a team scored more than 110 points (119 and 120), the claim \"no team scored more than 110 points in a game\" is false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Examined each row to extract total points from 'home team score' and 'away team score'.
