    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Vladimira Uhl\u00ed\u0159ov\u00e1's progress past the group stage is true or false, we need to understand the context of grand slam tournaments:\n\n1. **Understanding \"Group Stage\":** In tennis, there isn't a \"group stage\" in Grand Slam tournaments as they are single-elimination events for individual players and doubles teams. The initial rounds are referred to by their round names: first round (1r), second round (2r), third round (3r), fourth round (4r), quarterfinals (qf), semifinals (sf), and finals.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Table:** \n   - Each row after \"grand slam tournaments\" represents a specific tournament within a year, namely the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open.\n   - The abbreviations for rounds are:\n     - 1r: First Round\n     - 2r: Second Round\n     - 3r: Third Round\n     - qf: Quarterfinals\n     - sf: Semifinals\n\n3. **Analyzing Progress in Each Year:**\n   - **2006:** \n     - Australian Open: \"a\" (did not participate or withdrew)\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 1r\n     - US Open: 1r\n     - Total progress beyond first round: 1 time\n\n   - **2007:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 3r\n     - Wimbledon: 2r\n     - US Open: sf\n     - Total progress beyond first round: 4 times\n\n   - **2008:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 3r\n     - Wimbledon: 2r\n     - US Open: 1r\n     - Total progress beyond first round: 3 times\n\n   - **2009:**\n     - Australian Open: 1r\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 1r\n     - US Open: 1r\n     - Total progress beyond first round: 1 time\n\n   - **2010:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 1r\n     - US Open: 1r\n     - Total progress beyond first round: 2 times\n\n   - **2011:**\n     - Australian Open: qf\n     - French Open: 3r\n     - Wimbledon: 2r\n     - US Open: 1r\n     - Total progress beyond first round: 3 times\n\n   - **2012:**\n     - Australian Open: 2r\n     - French Open: 2r\n     - Wimbledon: 3r\n     - US Open: 2r\n     - Total progress beyond first round: 4 times\n\n4. **Evaluating the Claim:** \n   - The claim states that Vladimira Uhl\u00ed\u0159ov\u00e1 has only progressed past the group stage once. Since there is no \"group stage\" in these tournaments, we interpret this as advancing past the initial round(s).\n   - Based on our analysis, she advanced beyond the first round more than one time in multiple years.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** \n   - The claim that she has only progressed past the group stage (or first round) once is false because there are several instances where she advanced beyond the first round in various years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand 'group stage' as advancing beyond initial rounds.\",\n    \"Analyze each year's performance across all tournaments.\",\n    \"Count the number of times she progressed beyond the first round each year.\",\n    \"Determine if there is only one instance where this occurred.\",\n    \"Conclude that multiple instances exist, making the claim false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2012\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
