    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the blue jays never lose more than 3 games in a row in the month of June 2000\" is true, we need to analyze the provided table data for all the games played by the Blue Jays during that month.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Games Involving the Blue Jays:**\n   - We first locate the entries involving the Blue Jays as either the \"home\" or \"away\" team.\n   \n2. **Determine Results of These Games:**\n   - For each game, check the \"result\" column to determine if it was a win (represented by a positive score difference for the home team) or a loss (represented by a negative score difference or an away victory).\n\n3. **Track Consecutive Losses:**\n   - We need to track sequences of losses and ensure no sequence exceeds three consecutive losses.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Relevant Game:**\n\n   - **June 20:** Blue Jays vs. Tigers at home, result is \"18 - 6\". The score indicates the Tigers won, so this is a loss for the Blue Jays.\n   - **June 21:** Blue Jays vs. Tigers away, result is \"6 - 0\". The score indicates the Blue Jays lost again.\n   - **June 22:** Blue Jays vs. Tigers at home, result is \"7 - 4\". The Blue Jays won this game.\n\n5. **Check for Other Games in June:**\n   - There are no other games listed involving the Blue Jays for the month of June.\n\n6. **Conclude Based on Analysis:**\n   - The longest sequence of losses recorded is two consecutive losses (June 20 and June 21).\n   - Since there are no additional games or sequences that show more than three consecutive losses, the claim holds true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the Blue Jays never lose more than 3 games in a row during June 2000.
