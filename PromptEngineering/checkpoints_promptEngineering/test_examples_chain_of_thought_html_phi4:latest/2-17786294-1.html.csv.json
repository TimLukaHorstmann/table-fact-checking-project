    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze each match's scores from the first round (home game) and identify which away teams scored goals. The claim states that only one away team scored in the first leg, specifically mentioning FC Mulhouse scoring 1 against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify First Round Scores:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"1st round\" column for each row to determine how many goals were scored by away teams in the home matches of their opponents.\n\n2. **Check Each Match:**\n   - **Row 1:** RC Lens vs. RC Strasbourg\n     - Score: 1 - 0 (RC Strasbourg away)\n     - Away team did not score.\n   \n   - **Row 2:** FC Rouen vs. Stade Lavallois\n     - Score: 1 - 0 (Stade Lavallois away)\n     - Away team did not score.\n\n   - **Row 3:** AS Monaco vs. AS Nancy\n     - Score: 2 - 0 (AS Nancy away)\n     - Away team did not score.\n   \n   - **Row 4:** Girondins de Bordeaux vs. FC Mulhouse\n     - Score: 0 - 1 (FC Mulhouse away)\n     - Away team scored 1 goal.\n\n   - **Row 5:** FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais\n     - Score: 0 - 0 (Olympique Lyonnais away)\n     - Away team did not score.\n   \n   - **Row 6:** AS Cannes vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard\n     - Score: 3 - 0 (FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard away)\n     - Away team did not score.\n\n   - **Row 7:** Sporting Toulon Var vs. En Avant Guingamp\n     - Score: 2 - 0 (En Avant Guingamp away)\n     - Away team did not score.\n   \n   - **Row 8:** FC Metz vs. Besan\u00e7on RC\n     - Score: 4 - 0 (Besan\u00e7on RC away)\n     - Away team did not score.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Goals by Away Teams in First Legs:**\n   - Only FC Mulhouse scored in the first leg against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n   - No other away teams scored in their respective first legs.\n\n4. **Verify Against the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that only 2 away teams scored in the first leg, which is incorrect based on our analysis.\n   - Only one away team (FC Mulhouse) scored in the first leg.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because only one away team scored in the first leg, not two as stated in the claim. The specific instance of FC Mulhouse scoring 1 goal against Girondins de Bordeaux is correct, but there was no other away team that scored.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify scores from the '1st round' column for each match to determine if any away teams scored.\",\n    \"Analyze each row:\",\n    \"- RC Lens vs. RC Strasbourg: Away team did not score.\",\n    \"- FC Rouen vs. Stade Lavallois: Away team did not score.\",\n    \"- AS Monaco vs. AS Nancy: Away team did not score.\",\n    \"- Girondins de Bordeaux vs. FC Mulhouse: Away team scored 1 goal.\",\n    \"- FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais: Away team did not score.\",\n    \"- AS Cannes vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: Away team did not score.\",\n    \"- Sporting Toulon Var vs. En Avant Guingamp: Away team did not score.\",\n    \"- FC Metz vs. Besan\u00e7on RC: Away team did not score.\",\n    \"Count the number of away teams that scored in the first leg: only 1 (FC Mulhouse).\",\n    \"The claim states 2 away teams scored, which is incorrect.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
