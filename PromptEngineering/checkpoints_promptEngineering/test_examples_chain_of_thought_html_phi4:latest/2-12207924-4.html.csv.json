    "resp": "To determine whether the Blue Jays played three games that went into extra innings in June 1979, we need to analyze the provided table data for matches played by the Blue Jays during that month.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**: We look at each game played by the \"Blue Jays\" from June 19th to June 30th.\n2. **Extra Innings Indicator**: In baseball, a game going into extra innings is typically indicated with \"(x)\" after the score where \"x\" denotes the inning number that ended the game.\n3. **Review Each Game**:\n   - **June 19 vs Yankees**: Score is `5-4`. The presence of `(10)` indicates this game went into the 10th inning (extra innings).\n   - **June 20 vs Yankees**: Score is `2-1` and then `3-2`. Neither score contains an extra innings indicator.\n   - **June 21 vs Yankees**: Score is `3-1`. No extra innings indicator here.\n   - **June 28 vs Yankees**: Score is `5-3 (10)`, which indicates this game went into the 10th inning (extra innings).\n   - **June 29 vs Orioles**: The first score is `6-1` and the second is `4-0`. Neither contains an extra innings indicator.\n   - **June 30 vs Orioles**: Score is `2-0`. No extra innings indicated.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom this analysis, only two games went into extra innings:\n- June 19 vs Yankees (10th inning)\n- June 28 vs Yankees (10th inning)\n\nThus, the claim that \"the blue jays play 3 game[s] that go into extra inning in June of 1979\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nBased on our review, the relevant cells for games going into extra innings are:\n1.
