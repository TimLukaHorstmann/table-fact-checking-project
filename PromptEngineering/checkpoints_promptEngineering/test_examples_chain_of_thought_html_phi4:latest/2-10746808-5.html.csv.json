    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a total of 2 teams score less than 40 points during the season\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the scores listed for each match on 29 May 1926 in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand Scoring System:**\n   - The scores are given in a format like `19.8 (122)`. Here, `19.8` refers to goals and behinds, while `(122)` is the total points.\n   - Each goal is worth 6 points and each \"behind\" (a failed attempt at a goal that still scores some points) is typically worth 1 point.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Row:**\n   - We will check both teams in every match to determine their total points.\n\n3. **Row-by-Row Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Home Team (Melbourne): `19.8 (122)` \u2192 Total = 122\n     - Away Team (Richmond): `12.17 (89)` \u2192 Total = 89\n\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Home Team (Essendon): `13.7 (85)` \u2192 Total = 85\n     - Away Team (St Kilda): `5.8 (38)` \u2192 Total = 38\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Home Team (South Melbourne): `10.15 (75)` \u2192 Total = 75\n     - Away Team (North Melbourne): `11.7 (73)` \u2192 Total = 73\n\n   - **Row 4:** \n     - Home Team (Hawthorn): `9.13 (67)` \u2192 Total = 67\n     - Away Team (Footscray): `14.16 (100)` \u2192 Total = 100\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Home Team (Geelong): `9.14 (68)` \u2192 Total = 68\n     - Away Team (Collingwood): `10.15 (75)` \u2192 Total = 75\n\n   - **Row 6:** \n     - Home Team (Fitzroy): `7.16 (58)` \u2192 Total = 58\n     - Away Team (Carlton): `7.6 (48)` \u2192 Total = 48\n\n4. **Identify Teams Scoring Less Than 40 Points:**\n   - From the analysis, only St Kilda in Row 2 scored less than 40 points with a total of 38.\n\n5. **Count Teams Scoring Less Than 40 Points:**\n   - Only one team (St Kilda) scored less than 40 points.\n   - The claim states \"a total of 2 teams\" which means two different matches or combinations where the total score for either team is less than 40.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since only one team, St Kilda, scored less than 40 points, the claim that two teams did so is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each match's scores to determine total points for both home and away teams.
