    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Date of Interest**: The claim mentions \"september 26 , 1971\". We need to find a row in the table where the 'date' column matches this date.\n\n2. **Locate the Row**:\n   - Inspect each row under the 'date' column to identify which one corresponds to \"september 26 , 1971\".\n   - Upon inspection, we find that row 2 has the date \"september 26 , 1971\".\n\n3. **Check the Attendance for the Identified Date**:\n   - Now that we have identified row 2 as corresponding to the date of interest, we need to check the 'attendance' column in this row.\n   - The attendance listed in row 2 is 57895.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"the attendance at the game be 57895 crowd\".\n   - Since the attendance recorded for September 26, 1971, is indeed 57895, the claim accurately reflects the information in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the steps above, the claim is TRUE as it matches the data provided in the table.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are from row 2: \n     - 'date': \"september 26 , 1971\"\n     - 'attendance': 57895\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the date of interest, locate the corresponding row in the table, check the attendance for that date, and verify it matches the claim.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two aspects: the date associated with week 14 and its attendance figure. Let's go through the relevant information from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Week 14 Details**:\n   - Locate row corresponding to \"week\" = 14.\n   - From the table, for week 14:\n     - Date: December 19, 1971\n     - Attendance: 75954\n\n2. **Compare with Claimed Information**:\n   - The claim states that week 14 is on September 26, 1971, which does not match the actual date of December 19, 1971.\n   - Additionally, it claims an attendance figure of 57895 for week 14. However, the actual attendance for this week was 75954.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is incorrect on both counts: the date and the attendance figures do not match those in the table for week 14.\n\nLet's now format our reasoning into a JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to 'week' = 14 from the table.\",\n    \"For week 14, the date listed is December 19, 1971, not September 26, 1971 as claimed.\",\n    \"The attendance for week 14 is 75954, whereas the claim states it was 57895.\",\n    \"Both the date and attendance figures in the claim do not match those from the table for week 14.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
