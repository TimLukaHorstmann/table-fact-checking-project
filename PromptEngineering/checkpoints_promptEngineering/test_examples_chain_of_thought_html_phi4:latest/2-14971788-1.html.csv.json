Our approach involves examining each game result to identify the scores for all opponents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column:**\n   - We are interested in the \"result\" column because it shows how many points were scored by the opponent in each game.\n\n2. **Extract and analyze data from the \"result\" column:**\n   - For each row, we will focus on the part of the result that indicates the opponent's score (the number after the dash).\n\n3. **List all opponents' scores:**\n   - Week 1: Atlanta Falcons scored 31 points.\n   - Week 2: Philadelphia Eagles scored 6 points.\n   - Week 3: San Francisco 49ers scored 7 points.\n   - Week 4: Chicago Bears scored 3 points.\n   - Week 5: Los Angeles Rams scored 24 points (tie, but score still noted).\n   - Week 6: Minnesota Vikings scored 20 points (tie, but score still noted).\n   - Week 7: Washington Redskins scored 13 points.\n   - Week 8: Green Bay Packers scored 10 points.\n   - Week 9: Atlanta Falcons scored 7 points.\n   - Week 10: Detroit Lions scored 7 points.\n   - Week 11: San Francisco 49ers scored 9 points.\n   - Week 12: Dallas Cowboys scored 17 points.\n   - Week 13: New Orleans Saints scored 10 points.\n   - Week 14: Los Angeles Rams scored 34 points.\n\n4. **Determine the fewest score:**\n   - From the extracted scores, the lowest opponent score is 3 points by the Chicago Bears in week 4.\n\n5. **Compare with the claim:**\n   - The claim states that the fewest points were scored by the Philadelphia Eagles (6 points). However, our analysis shows that the fewest points were actually scored by the Chicago Bears (3 points).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because the fewest point score by an opponent was 3 points by the Chicago Bears, not 6 points by the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We analyzed each game's result to identify the scores made by opponents.
