    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" on December 28 being Php 13.6 million is true, let's examine the table step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: Locate the row corresponding to the movie \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\". This is the first row in the table.\n\n2. **Find the Column for December 28**: Look for the column labeled \"december 28\" which lists the earnings for that specific date.\n\n3. **Check the Value**: In this row and under the \"december 28\" column, verify the value provided.\n\n4. **Cross-Verify with Total**: Optionally, check if this value aligns with the total from December 25 to 28 by adding up the values for December 25, 26, 27, and 28 in that row. The sum should equal the \"december 25 - 28 total\" column.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If the value matches what is claimed, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n- Locate the movie \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" in the first row.\n- Check the December 28 column for this row and find the value Php 13.6 million.\n- Verify by summing up:\n  - December 25: Php 20 million\n  - December 26: Php 18 million\n  - December 27: Php 16.5 million\n  - December 28: Php 13.6 million\n  - Total = Php 20M + Php 18M + Php 16.5M + Php 13.6M = Php 68.1 million\n\nThe calculated total (Php 68.1 million) is slightly off from the table's stated total of Php 67.9 million, likely due to rounding differences. However, this does not affect the specific claim about December 28.\n\n**Conclusion**: The value for \"ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)\" on December 28 is indeed Php 13.6 million as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate the row for 'ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!)' and check the column labeled 'december 28'.
