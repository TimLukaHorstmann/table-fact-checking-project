This doesn't affect point scoring but provides context.\n\n4. **Examine the 'High Points' Column:**\n   - For November 17, the \"high points\" column shows \"Allen - 12.\" This indicates that Lavoy Allen scored 12 points in this game.\n\n5. **Verify if Allen Scored the Most Points:**\n   - The claim states that Allen had the most points on this date with 12 points.\n   - Since the table only lists one player's high score for November 17, and it is Allen with 12 points, he indeed scored the most points.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information in the table, Allen did have the highest point total (12) on November 17, as no other player's scoring is mentioned for that game.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
