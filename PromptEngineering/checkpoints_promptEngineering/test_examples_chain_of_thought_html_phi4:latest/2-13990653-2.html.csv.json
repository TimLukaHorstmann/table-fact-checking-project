The column `opponent` will tell us against which team a game was played, while the column `loss` provides information about who conceded the loss (i.e., the pitcher).\n\n2. **Locate Entries Involving Diegomar Markwell:**\n   - We need to find entries in the `loss` column that contain \"diegomar markwell\". This will help us determine which game was associated with him as the player who experienced a loss.\n\n3. **Check the Opponent for That Entry:**\n   - Once we identify the row where Diegomar Markwell is mentioned under `loss`, we then check the corresponding entry in the `opponent` column to see if it says \"macoto cobras\".\n\n4. **Reviewing Table Data:**\n   - Looking at each row, particularly focusing on the `loss` column:\n     - On March 31st, the entry for `loss` is \"diegomar markwell\", and the corresponding `opponent` is \"macoto cobras\".\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that Diegomar Markwell's opponent was \"macoto cobra\" (a slight misspelling from \"cobras\") aligns with the entry on March 31st where \"macoto cobras\" appears as the opponent when Diegomar Markwell is listed in `loss`.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim can be considered true despite the minor spelling difference (\"cobra\" vs. \"cobras\").\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Row index 9, Column \"opponent\": Contains \"macoto cobras\".\n- Row index 9, Column \"loss\": Contains \"diegomar markwell\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim 'macoto cobra be the opponent of diegomar markwell', I first identified the relevant columns: 'opponent' and 'loss'.
