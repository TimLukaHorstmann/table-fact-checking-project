While the table shows matches were played on 23 June 1962, it does not explicitly confirm whether the entire season spanned only this single day or if it was just one of many match days.\n   - However, given the context and standard understanding of a sports league season (which spans multiple games over several weeks), the claim can be interpreted as TRUE in that VFL matches were played on 23 June 1962.\n\nBased on these observations, the chain of thought leads to the conclusion that the statement is true regarding the occurrence of VFL matches on this date.
