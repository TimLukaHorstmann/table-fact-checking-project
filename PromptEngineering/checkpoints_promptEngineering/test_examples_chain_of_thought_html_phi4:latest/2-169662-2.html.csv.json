The focus should be on the column indicating the round (or time if it's a submission or KO) to see if any fight was decided outside rounds 1 through 5.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Information**: \n   - We need to look at each fight's record in terms of how and when they were decided\u2014specifically checking the \"Round\" column (or equivalent information for KOs or submissions).\n\n2. **Check Each Fight Entry**:\n   - Review every row in the dataset, paying attention to the round data.\n   - For fights that ended via submission or KO, check if it specifies a time instead of rounds; such entries inherently occur within the first five minutes.\n\n3. **Evaluate Entries**: \n   - If any fight was decided beyond Round 5, the claim would be false.\n   - We'll list the relevant cells where this data is found for verification.\n\n**Detailed Evaluation:**\n\n- **UFC 23**: Frank Shamrock defeated via submission in Round 4 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 19**: Guy Mezger KO'd opponent in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 18**: Jerry Bohlander KO'd opponent due to a cut in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **West Coast NHB Championships 1**: Jeremy Screeton submission win at 0:16 \u2192 Submission typically within 1st round timeframe.\n- **UFC 13 (Wes Albritton)**: TKO in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 13 (Guy Mezger)**: Submission victory in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 29**: Evan Tanner KO with slam at 0:30 \u2192 KO within first round timeframe.\n- **UFC 32**: Evan Tanner submission win at 3:32 in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 25**: Wanderlei Silva decision victory over five rounds \u2192 Decision fight spans rounds 1-5 by definition.\n- **UFC 29**: Yuki Kondo submission victory at 1:51 in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 30**: Evan Tanner KO with slam at 0:30 in Round 1 \u2192 KO within first round timeframe.\n- **UFC 32**: Evan Tanner submission win at 3:32 in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 25**: Wanderlei Silva decision victory over five rounds \u2192 Decision fight spans rounds 1-5 by definition.\n- **UFC 29**: Yuki Kondo submission at 1:51 in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 30**: Evan Tanner KO with slam at 0:30 in Round 1 \u2192 KO within first round timeframe.\n- **UFC 32**: Evan Tanner submission win at 3:32 in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n- **UFC 29**: Yuki Kondo submission victory at 1:51 in Round 1 \u2192 Within rounds 1-5\n\nEvery fight was either decided by KO, submission, or technical decision within the first five rounds.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on reviewing all entries and their respective outcomes, every fight indeed ended between round 1 and round 5. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Reviewed each fight entry for its conclusion details, focusing on rounds or time (for KO/Submissions).
