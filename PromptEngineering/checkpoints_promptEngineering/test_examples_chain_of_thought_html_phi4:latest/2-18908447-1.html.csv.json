    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jim Obradovich is true or false, we need to analyze the table according to the criteria specified in the claim:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Pick after Round 2:** \n   - The claim states that Jim Obradovich was picked after Round 2.\n   \n2. **Before Pick 183:**\n   - The claim states he was picked before pick number 183.\n\n3. **Plays Tight End Position:**\n   - The claim states his position is tight end.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Check Jim Obradovich's Row:**\n   - From the table, we find the row where the player name matches \"jim obradovich\".\n   - This corresponds to:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>7</td>\n       <td>158</td>\n       <td>jim obradovich</td>\n       <td>tight end</td>\n       <td>usc</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Round 7 is After Round 2:**\n   - The \"round\" for Jim Obradovich is listed as 7.\n   - Since 7 > 2, this satisfies the condition of being picked after round 2.\n\n3. **Verify Pick 158 is Before Pick 183:**\n   - The \"pick\" number for Jim Obradovich is 158.\n   - Since 158 < 183, this satisfies the condition of being picked before pick 183.\n\n4. **Verify Position as Tight End:**\n   - The \"position\" for Jim Obradovich is listed as \"tight end\".\n   - This matches the claim that he plays tight end.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data in the table for Jim Obradovich.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For verification, the relevant cells from the table are:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\", \"value\": \"7\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\", \"value\": \"158\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\", \"value\": \"tight end\"}\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Jim Obradovich was picked in round 7, which is after round 2. His pick number is 158, which is before pick number 183. He plays the position of tight end.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\", \"value\": \"7\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\", \"value\": \"158\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\", \"value\": \"tight end\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to break down each part of the claim and compare it against the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"Jim Obradovich pick before round 2\"**\n   - According to the table, Jim Obradovich was picked in Round 7 (as seen in the row with `round` value \"7\").\n   - Therefore, the claim that he was picked before Round 2 is FALSE.\n\n2. **\"pick 183\"**\n   - The table shows that the pick number for Jim Obradovich is 158.\n   - Thus, the claim about him having pick number 183 is also FALSE.\n\n3. **\"play tight end position\"**\n   - The table indicates that Jim Obradovich's position is \"tight end\".\n   - This part of the claim is TRUE according to the data in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe entire claim is a conjunction of three statements, and for it to be true, all parts must be correct. Since two out of three parts are FALSE (\"pick before round 2\" and \"pick 183\"), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n- For verifying Jim Obradovich's round: \n  - Row index: 3 (Jim Obradovich's row)\n  - Column name: \"round\"\n- For verifying Jim Obradovich's pick number:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Column name: \"pick\"\n- For verifying Jim Obradovich's position:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Column name: \"position\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated in three parts.

Third, the statement 'play tight end position' is TRUE based on the table data.
