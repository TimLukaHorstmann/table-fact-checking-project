Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: We are interested in the 'home town' column since it contains information about where each player comes from.\n\n2. **Check Each Entry**:\n   - For row 1: \"little rock, ark\" (Arkansas) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n   - For row 2: \"eight mile, ala\" (Alabama) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n   - For row 5: \"swainsboro, ga\" (Georgia) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n   - For row 10: \"isle of palms, sc\" (South Carolina) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n   - For row 20: \"indianapolis, ind\" (Indiana) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n   - For row 21: \"irwinton, ga\" (Georgia) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n   - For row 23: \"birmingham, ala\" (Alabama) is not Montgomery, Alabama. \n   - For row 24: \"montgomery, ala\" matches the claim.\n   - For row 25: \"birmingham, ala\" (Alabama) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n   - For row 32: \"montgomery, ala\" matches the claim.\n   - For row 40: \"tuscaloosa, ala\" (Alabama) is not Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The claim states that every player on the team is from Montgomery, Alabama. However, several entries in the 'home town' column are different locations (e.g., Little Rock, Arkansas; eight mile, Alabama; swainsboro, Georgia; etc.). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells for this analysis are those in the 'home town' column across all rows since they directly pertain to verifying the claim about each player's hometown.\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'home town' column was checked for each player.
