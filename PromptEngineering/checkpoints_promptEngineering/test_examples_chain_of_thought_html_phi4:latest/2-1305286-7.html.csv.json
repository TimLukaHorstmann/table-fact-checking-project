This matches both parts of our criteria.\n   - Remaining rows (2005, 2007, 2012) do not mention either \"Rugrats Go Wild\" or Bruce Willis.\n\n3. **Verify Result:**\n   - In the 2004 row, Bruce Willis is listed as a nominee for \"Rugrats Go Wild\", and the result is \"nominated\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Bruce Willis was nominated for the film \"Rugrats Go Wild\".

We need to find this row in the table.\n   \n2. **Locate Row for 2001**:\n   - Upon examining the table, we find a row where the `year` column is \"2001\".\n\n3. **Check Category and Film for Consistency**:\n   - In this row, ensure that it matches with other details mentioned in the claim to validate accuracy.\n   - The category in the 2001 row is \"favorite voice from an animated movie\".\n   - The film associated is \"rugrats in paris : the movie\".\n\n4. **Verify Winner/Nominee**:\n   - According to the table, for the year 2001 under this category and film, the `winner / nominee (s)` is listed as \"Susan Sarandon\".\n   \n5. **Check Result**:\n   - The result column indicates that Susan Sarandon won (\"won\") in 2001.\n\n6. **Interpretation of Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001\". This means we are checking if Susan Sarandon was both nominated and won.\n   - From the table, Susan Sarandon is indeed a winner for this category and year.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Susan Sarandon was listed as a winner (not just nominated) in 2001 for \"favorite voice from an animated movie\" in the film \"rugrats in paris : the movie\".\n- The claim that she was a \"winner nominee\" is accurate because being a winner inherently includes nomination, hence confirming both aspects of the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant row and columns are:\n- Row index: 2 (since it's the third row starting from zero-based indexing)\n- Columns: \n  - `year`: \"2001\"\n  - `category`: \"favorite voice from an animated movie\"\n  - `film`: \"rugrats in paris : the movie\"\n  - `winner / nominee (s)`: \"Susan Sarandon\"\n  - `result`: \"won\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row for year 2001, verify that Susan Sarandon is listed as a winner for 'favorite voice from an animated movie' in the film 'rugrats in paris : the movie', and confirm she won.
