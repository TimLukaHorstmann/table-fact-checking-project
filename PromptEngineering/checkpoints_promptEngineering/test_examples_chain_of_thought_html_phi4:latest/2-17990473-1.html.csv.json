    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we will break down the statement into two parts and verify each part against the data in the HTML table:\n\n1. **Part 1: \"in week 12 there be 1 game\"**\n\n   - We need to check if there is an entry for week 12 in the table.\n   - By examining the rows of the table, we observe that the weeks are listed consecutively from 1 to 17, except for missing entries at week 12. Specifically:\n     - Week 11 has a game against \"oakland raiders.\"\n     - Week 13 directly follows with a game against \"kansas city chiefs,\" skipping week 12.\n   - This indicates there is no entry (or game) recorded for week 12.\n\n2. **Part 2: \"in week 13 the game be against opponent kansas city chief\"**\n\n   - We need to verify whether the game in week 13 was indeed against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n   - By examining the row corresponding to week 13, we find:\n     - The `week` column has the value `13`.\n     - The `opponent` column lists \"kansas city chiefs.\"\n   - This confirms that the opponent for week 13 is correctly identified as the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The first part of the claim (\"in week 12 there be 1 game\") is FALSE because there is no entry for week 12 in the table.\n- The second part of the claim (\"in week 13 the game be against opponent kansas city chief\") is TRUE, as verified by the data.\n\nThus, the entire claim is FALSE due to the first incorrect assertion regarding week 12. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For verifying week 12 absence: No relevant cells since there's no entry for week 12.\n- For verifying week 13 opponent:\n  - Row 13: \n    - Column \"week\": Value `13`\n    - Column \"opponent\": Value \"kansas city chiefs\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim has two parts.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about week 4's game attendance and date is TRUE or FALSE, we will examine the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Week 4 Details:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"week\" 4 in the table.\n   - In the table, find the entry where the \"week\" column has the value `4`.\n\n2. **Check Date for Week 4:**\n   - Once the correct row is identified, check the \"date\" column for this row.\n   - The claim states that week 4's game should be played on October 3, 1999.\n\n3. **Verify Attendance for Week 4:**\n   - Check the \"attendance\" column in the same row to see if it matches the claimed value of `74181`.\n\n### Relevant Cells from Table:\n\n- Locate the entry with:\n  - Row index corresponding to week 4.\n  - Column names we are interested in: \"date\" and \"attendance\".\n\nBased on the table provided:\n\n- **Row for Week 4:**\n  - The row where `week` is `4` has the following details:\n    - `date`: October 3, 1999\n    - `attendance`: 74181\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that week 4's game \"do not have an attendance of 74181 and be play on october 3 , 1999.\"\n- From the table, we see:\n  - Week 4 was indeed played on October 3, 1999.\n  - The attendance for this game was exactly `74181`.\n\nThus, both conditions in the claim are incorrect:\n1. The attendance is indeed `74181`, contradicting \"do not have an attendance of 74181\".\n2. The date matches October 3, 1999, contradicting \"be play on october 3 , 1999\" as a negation.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement in the claim is FALSE because it states both conditions incorrectly.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified week 4's details from the table.
