We need to locate this year within the \"year\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for 1999:**\n   - Scan through the rows in the \"year\" column to find the entry for 1999.\n   - In the table, we find that the row with the year 1999 is the sixth row (since indexing typically starts from 0).\n\n3. **Check the \"runner-up\" Column:**\n   - For the identified row (year 1999), examine the \"runner-up\" column to see who is listed as the runner-up for that year.\n   - The entry in the \"runner-up\" column for the year 1999 is \"karina hab\u0161udov\u00e1\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"in 1999 karina hab\u0161udov\u00e1 be the runner - up\".\n   - Based on our examination, the table confirms that Karina Hab\u0161udov\u00e1 was indeed listed as the runner-up in 1999.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the information from the table matches the claim, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the year 1999 in the 'year' column of the table.
