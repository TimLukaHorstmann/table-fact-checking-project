    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Chelsea play more home matches between 25 January 2003 and 10 March 2003\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data within the specified date range.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Range:**\n   - The claim specifies the period from 25 January 2003 to 10 March 2003.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to find all matches that fall within this date range:\n     - **26 January 2003:** Match against Shrewsbury Town\n     - **16 February 2003:** Match against Stoke City\n     - **8 March 2003:** Match against Arsenal\n\n3. **Determine Venue Type:**\n   - For each match, check if it was a home (\"h\") or away (\"a\") game:\n     - **26 January 2003:** Venue is \"a\" (away)\n     - **16 February 2003:** Venue is \"a\" (away)\n     - **8 March 2003:** Venue is \"a\" (away)\n\n4. **Count Home Matches:**\n   - Within the specified date range, there are no matches listed as home games (\"h\").\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are zero home matches between 25 January 2003 and 10 March 2003, it is false that Chelsea played more than zero home matches in this period.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells for the date range are:\n  - Row 2 (26 January 2003): Columns \"date\", \"venue\"\n  - Row 3 (16 February 2003): Columns \"date\", \"venue\"\n  - Row 4 (8 March 2003): Columns \"date\", \"venue\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated by checking matches between 25 January 2003 and 10 March 2003.
