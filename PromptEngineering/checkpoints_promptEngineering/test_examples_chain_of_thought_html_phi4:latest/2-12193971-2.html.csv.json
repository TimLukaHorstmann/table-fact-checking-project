    "resp": "To determine whether the statement \"Elche CF have fewer than 40 goals against other teams\" is true or false, we need to examine the specific data from the provided table. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Elche CF's Row**: Locate the row corresponding to \"Elche CF\" in the table. According to the table:\n   - Elche CF is listed under row 14.\n\n2. **Find Goals Against Column**: Determine which column corresponds to \"Goals against other teams.\" In this table, we find that:\n   - The column titled \"Goals against other teams\" lists these values for each team.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Data**: Look at the value in Elche CF's row under the \"Goals against other teams\" column:\n   - For Elche CF (row 14), the number of goals against is listed as \"50.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Statement**: Compare this extracted data with the statement's claim:\n   - The statement claims that Elche CF have fewer than 40 goals against other teams.\n   - Since Elche CF has 50 goals against, which is greater than 40, the statement is false.\n\n5. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Chain of thought: Locate Elche CF in the table (row 14), extract the number of goals against (column \"Goals against other teams\"), and compare it with 40.\n   - Conclusion: The statement is false because 50 is not less than 40.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the result into a JSON object as specified, including relevant cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify Elche CF's row (14) and locate 'Goals against other teams' column.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"cd castell\u00f3n have 3 more losses than elche cf\" is true or false, we need to extract relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The column indicating the number of losses for each team is the third one (\"3\"). This is because a typical football league standings table follows this order:\n     1. Position\n     2. Wins\n     3. Losses (sometimes labeled as \"Defeats\" or similar)\n     4. Draws\n     5. Goals For\n     6. Goals Against\n     7. Goal Difference\n\n2. **Locate cd castell\u00f3n in the Table:**\n   - Scan through the table to find the row corresponding to \"cd castell\u00f3n\".\n   - In this case, \"cd castell\u00f3n\" is found at `row_index` 11.\n\n3. **Determine Losses for cd castell\u00f3n:**\n   - Retrieve the number of losses from column \"3\" in `row_index` 11.\n   - The value is 13 losses.\n\n4. **Locate elche cf in the Table:**\n   - Scan through the table to find the row corresponding to \"elche cf\".\n   - In this case, \"elche cf\" is found at `row_index` 10.\n\n5. **Determine Losses for elche cf:**\n   - Retrieve the number of losses from column \"3\" in `row_index` 10.\n   - The value is 14 losses.\n\n6. **Compare Losses:**\n   - Calculate the difference in losses between cd castell\u00f3n and elche cf:\n     - Losses for cd castell\u00f3n = 13\n     - Losses for elche cf = 14\n     - Difference = 13 - 14 = -1\n\n7. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"cd castell\u00f3n have 3 more losses than elche cf.\"\n   - Based on our calculation, cd castell\u00f3n has 1 less loss than elche cf, not 3 more.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because cd castell\u00f3n actually have fewer losses than elche cf.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column for 'Losses' as the third column in the table.\",\n    \"Locate 'cd castell\u00f3n' at row_index 11 and find it has 13 losses.\",\n    \"Locate 'elche cf' at row_index 10 and find it has 14 losses.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference: cd castell\u00f3n (13) vs elche cf (14), resulting in -1, indicating cd castell\u00f3n has fewer losses.\",\n    \"The claim that cd castell\u00f3n have 3 more losses than elche cf is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"3\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"3\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
