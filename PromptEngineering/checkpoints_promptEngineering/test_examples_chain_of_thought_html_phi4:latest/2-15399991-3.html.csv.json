    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Houston Texans lose 5 games during the 2003 season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the 'result' column of the provided table, which lists each game's outcome for that season.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table represents a schedule of games played by a team (likely the Houston Texans given their home stadium is Reliant Stadium) during the 2003 NFL season.\n   - Each row corresponds to one week, with details including date, opponent, result, game location, broadcast time, and attendance.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The 'result' column shows whether the team won or lost each game. A win is indicated by a score where their points are higher than the opponent's (e.g., \"17 - 13\"), while a loss is indicated when their points are lower (\"0 - 27\").\n\n3. **Count Losses:**\n   - We need to count how many games ended in a loss for the team.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Game Result:**\n\n   - Week 1 (Row 1): \"W 10 - 6\" \u2014 Win\n   - Week 2 (Row 2): \"L 14 - 23\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 3 (Row 3): \"L 7 - 24\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 4 (Row 4): \"L 0 - 13\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 5 (Row 5): Game is not played (indicated by missing data).\n   - Week 6 (Row 6): \"W 12 - 10\" \u2014 Win\n   - Week 7 (Row 7): \"L 20 - 23 (ot)\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 8 (Row 8): \"W 17 - 13\" \u2014 Win\n   - Week 9 (Row 9): \"L 27 - 34\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 10 (Row 10): \"W 12 - 10\" \u2014 Win\n   - Week 11 (Row 11): \"L 20 - 23 (ot)\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 12 (Row 12): \"L 3 - 16\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 13 (Row 13): \"L 24 - 27\" \u2014 Loss\n   - Week 14 (Row 14): \"L 17 - 20\" \u2014 Loss\n\n5. **Total Losses:**\n   - Count the number of 'L' results from the above analysis.\n   - There are losses in Weeks 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.\n   - Total losses = 9\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe team lost 9 games during the 2003 season.
