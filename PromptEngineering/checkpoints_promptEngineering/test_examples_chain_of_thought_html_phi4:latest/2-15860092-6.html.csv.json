    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the win percentages against Rajasthan Royals and Kochi Tuskers Kerala being an average of 50% is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - Locate the rows for \"Rajasthan Royals\" and \"Kochi Tuskers Kerala\" in the table.\n   - Extract their win percentages.\n\n2. **Extract Win Percentages:**\n   - For Rajasthan Royals:\n     - Win % = 50.00\n   - For Kochi Tuskers Kerala:\n     - Win % = 0.00\n\n3. **Calculate the Average Win Percentage:**\n   - The formula for average is the sum of values divided by the number of values.\n   - Sum of win percentages = 50.00 (Rajasthan Royals) + 0.00 (Kochi Tuskers Kerala)\n   - Number of teams = 2\n   - Average win % = (50.00 + 0.00) / 2 = 25.00\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the average win percentage is 50%.\n   - Our calculated average win percentage is 25%.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 25% does not equal 50%, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Rajasthan Royals: Win % = 50.00 (Row index 5, Column \"win %\")\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala: Win % = 0.00 (Row index 9, Column \"win %\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows for Rajasthan Royals and Kochi Tuskers Kerala.
