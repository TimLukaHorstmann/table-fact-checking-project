Therefore, it was not decided by a single goal difference in regular playtime.\n\n3. **Identify Matches Involving Wolverhampton Wanderers:**\n   - Check the rows where either \"winner\" or \"loser\" is \"Wolverhampton Wanderers\".\n   - There is one such entry:\n     - 1972 - 73 FA Cup: Wolverhampton Wanderers won against Arsenal with a score of 3 - 1.\n\n4. **Check the Scores for Wolverhampton Wanderers Matches:**\n   - In the 1972 - 73 match, Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Arsenal by a margin of 2 points (3 - 1).\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Stoke City did win one match by only 1 point in regular playtime (against Everton).\n   - However, Wolverhampton Wanderers won their match against Arsenal by more than 1 point (by 2 points).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because while Stoke City did beat a team by 1 point, Wolverhampton Wanderers did not; they won by 2 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify matches involving Stoke City: 1970 - 71 (lost to Everton 3-2) and 1971 - 72 (lost to Birmingham City 0-0, decided by penalties).\",\n    \"Stoke City was defeated by 1 point in the 1970 - 71 match against Everton.\",\n    \"Identify matches involving Wolverhampton Wanderers: 1972 - 73 (won against Arsenal 3-1).\",\n    \"Wolverhampton Wanderers won by 2 points in their match against Arsenal.\",\n    \"The claim is false because Wolverhampton Wanderers did not win by only 1 point.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
