Therefore, there's no data indicating a runner-up position at the 2004 Rome Championship.\n     - No row lists the year as 2004 and the championship as \"toronto\". Thus, there's also no data for a runner-up position at the 2004 Toronto Championship.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since neither of these championships is listed in the table with an outcome of \"runner-up\" for the year 2004, the claim cannot be true based on the provided data.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - There are no relevant cells corresponding to the claim since the events and outcomes described do not exist within the dataset.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not contain any entries for a 'runner-up' outcome at the 2004 Rome or Toronto championships. Therefore, the player could not be the runner-up in these events as they are not listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
