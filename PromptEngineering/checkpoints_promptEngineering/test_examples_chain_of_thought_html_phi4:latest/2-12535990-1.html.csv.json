Let's go through this step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"oakland raider and new york jet be the only team to secure a win against kansas city chief in the 1968 season.\" This means we need to identify any teams listed as having won against Kansas City Chiefs in the 1968 NFL season.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Table\n\nThe table provides information about games played by an unspecified team during the 1968 season, including dates, opponents, results, and attendance.
