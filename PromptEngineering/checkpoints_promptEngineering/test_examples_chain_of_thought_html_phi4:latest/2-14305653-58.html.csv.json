The table shows the opponent as Uruguay, not Poland.\n\n   c. **Result Check:**\n      - On March 22, verify if the result was a loss of 2:1.\n      - Relevant cell: Row 0, \"results\" column.

It was a \"friendly\" match, not a Balkan Cup.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because none of the conditions (opponent, result, type of game) match the entry on March 22.\n   - Additionally, there is no record in the table of a game against Poland resulting in a loss of 2:1 during a Balkan Cup.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Row 0 (March 22): \"date\", \"city\", \"opponent\" (Uruguay), \"results\" (2:1, win), \"type of game\" (friendly).\n   - Row 2 (April 26) is the only entry against Poland, but it was a friendly match with a result of 2:1 in favor.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that on March 22, Yugoslavia lost 2:1 to Poland in a Balkan Cup.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table for two main components:\n\n1. **The number of times the Yugoslavian national team failed to score (result 0:x).**\n2. **If there was a World Cup qualification match where they dropped a 2:1 result against Denmark.**\n\nLet's go through each part step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify games where Yugoslavia failed to score\n\nWe need to find rows in the table where the \"results\" column shows a score of \"0:x\", indicating that Yugoslavia did not score any goals:\n\n- **Row 4:** August 27, Bucharest, Romania (2:1) - Yugoslavia scored 1 goal.\n- **Row 5:** September 10, Luxembourg (5:0) - Yugoslavia scored 5 goals.\n- **Row 6:** September 27, Ljubljana, Denmark (2:1) - Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n- **Row 7:** November 15, Torino, Italy (0:2) - Yugoslavia scored 0 goals.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that Yugoslavia failed to score only once in the game against Italy on November 15 (0:2).\n\n### Step 2: Check for a World Cup qualification match with a result of 2:1 against Denmark\n\nWe need to identify if there was any row where:\n- The \"type of game\" is \"1982 wcq\" (World Cup Qualification).\n- The opponent is \"denmark\".\n- The \"results\" column shows a score of \"2:1\".\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Row 6:** September 27, Ljubljana, Denmark (2:1) - This match was a World Cup qualification (\"1982 wcq\") and Yugoslavia won against Denmark with a result of 2:1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"the Yugoslavian national team failed to score only 1 time\" which is true as they scored 0 goals only once, against Italy. The second part of the claim says \"drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against Denmark.\" However, they won the World Cup qualification match against Denmark with a result of 2:1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE** because although Yugoslavia failed to score only one time, they did not drop a World Cup qualifying match; they actually won it against Denmark.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games where Yugoslavia failed to score by checking 'results' column for scores of '0:x'.\",\n    \"Yugoslavia failed to score only once, in the game on November 15 against Italy (0:2).\",\n    \"Check if there was a World Cup qualification match with Denmark that ended 2:1.\",\n    \"The September 27 match against Denmark was a World Cup qualification ('1982 wcq') and Yugoslavia won 2:1.\",\n    \"Conclude the claim is false because although they failed to score once, they did not drop the match against Denmark.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
