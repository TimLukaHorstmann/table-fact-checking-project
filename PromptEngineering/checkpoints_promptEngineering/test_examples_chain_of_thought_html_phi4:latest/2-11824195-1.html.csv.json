    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game against the Miami Dolphins having an attendance of 34,063 is true or false, we need to analyze the table for the relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We are interested in two columns: \"opponent\" and \"attendance\".\n   - The \"opponent\" column tells us against which team the game was played.\n   - The \"attendance\" column provides the number of attendees for each game.\n\n2. **Locate the Rows with Miami Dolphins as Opponent:**\n   - We need to find all instances where \"miami dolphins\" appears in the \"opponent\" column.\n\n3. **Check Attendance for These Games:**\n   - Once we identify the rows, we will check the corresponding \"attendance\" values for these games to see if any match 34,063.\n\n4. **Review the Table Rows:**\n\n   - **Row 10**:\n     - Opponent: \"miami dolphins\"\n     - Attendance: 34,063\n   - **Row 14**:\n     - Opponent: \"miami dolphins\"\n     - Attendance: 17,881\n\n5. **Verify Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim specifies an attendance of 34,063 for a game against the Miami Dolphins.\n   - From our analysis, there is indeed one match (Row 10) where the opponent was the Miami Dolphins and the attendance was exactly 34,063.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is accurate based on the data provided in the table. There is a game listed with the Miami Dolphins as the opponent and an attendance of 34,063.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'opponent' and 'attendance' columns.\",\n    \"Locate rows where the opponent is 'miami dolphins'.\",\n    \"Check the 'attendance' values for these games.\",\n    \"Verify if any of these attendances match 34,063.\",\n    \"Find that Row 10 matches this condition.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
