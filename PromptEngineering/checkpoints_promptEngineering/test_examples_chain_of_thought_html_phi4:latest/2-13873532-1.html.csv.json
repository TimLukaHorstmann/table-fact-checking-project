The table provides information across various tournament types for these years.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Columns:**\n   - The column headers represent different seasons:\n     - \"2007 / 08\" corresponds to the 5th column.\n     - \"2009 / 10\" corresponds to the 7th column.\n\n2. **Examine Liu Song's Performance in 2007/08 (Column 5):**\n   - Look for entries in the 5th column:\n     - The entry is \"nr\" (not ranked) under \"Rank after tournament.\"\n\n3. **Examine Liu Song's Performance in 2009/10 (Column 7):**\n   - Look for entries in the 7th column:\n     - The entry is \"lq\" (lost in qualifying round) under \"Variant format tournaments.\"\n     - Another entry is \"3r\" (third round) under \"Former non-ranking tournaments.\"\n\n4. **Interpretation of Rankings:**\n   - \"nr\" means not ranked, indicating no ranking was achieved.\n   - \"lq\" indicates a loss in the qualifying rounds, which implies no progress into the main tournament.\n   - \"3r\" signifies reaching the third round, indicating some success in that specific tournament.\n\n5. **Comparison of Rankings:**\n   - In 2007/08, Liu Song did not achieve any ranking (\"nr\").\n   - In 2009/10, although he lost in qualifying for one type of tournament (\"lq\"), he reached the third round in another type (\"3r\").\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since reaching the third round (\"3r\") is a better performance than not being ranked at all (\"nr\"), Liu Song's ranking was higher in 2009/10 compared to 2007/08.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"liu song be not rank higher in 2007 / 2008 than in 2009 / 2010\" is FALSE because he did rank higher in 2009/10.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row corresponding to \"Rank after tournament,\" Column \"2007 / 08\": \"nr\"\n- Row corresponding to \"Variant format tournaments,\" Column \"2009 / 10\": \"lq\"\n- Row corresponding to \"Former non-ranking tournaments,\" Column \"2009 / 10\": \"3r\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the relevant columns for 2007/08 and 2009/10.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Liu Song's ranking is true, we need to analyze the table data for the specified years: 2005/06 and 2009/10.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Columns**:\n   - The column \"2005 / 06\" corresponds to the year range 2005-2006.\n   - The column \"2009 / 10\" corresponds to the year range 2009-2010.\n\n2. **Locate Liu Song's Ranking in Each Year**:\n   - We need to find the row where Liu Song's ranking is explicitly mentioned for each of these years.\n\n3. **Analyze Rankings**:\n   - In the column \"2005 / 06\", search for any explicit ranking number or indicator that suggests a specific rank.\n   - Similarly, do this for the column \"2009 / 10\".\n\n4. **Calculate Rank Difference**:\n   - Determine if there is a numerical difference of exactly 40 places between the two years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **2005/06 Column**:\n  - The relevant entry in row 14 indicates \"nh\" (not held), and in row 15, it shows \"a\". These are not explicit rankings.\n  - No direct numeric ranking is given for Liu Song in 2005/06.\n\n- **2009/10 Column**:\n  - In row 13, the entry is \"3r\", which suggests a third-round appearance. This implies a specific position but does not provide an exact rank number.\n  - There are no explicit numeric ranks provided directly in this column for Liu Song.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since there are no explicit numeric rankings provided for either year (2005/06 or 2009/10), we cannot determine a precise rank difference of 40 places.\n- The claim requires specific numerical data to verify, which is not present in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not provide explicit numeric rankings for Liu Song in either 2005/06 or 2009/10.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Liu Song's best ranking being in 2008/09 when he made it into the top 50 is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand Table Structure**: The table appears to represent a player's performance across different categories of tournaments over several years (from 2004/05 to 2011/12). Each row corresponds to a category like \"ranking tournaments,\" \"variant format tournaments,\" etc., while each column corresponds to a year.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Category**: The claim specifically refers to Liu Song's ranking, which suggests we should focus on the \"ranking tournaments\" category because rankings are typically associated with these types of tournaments in snooker or billiards contexts.\n\n3. **Locate the \"Ranking Tournaments\" Row**:\n   - According to the table, the row labeled \"ranking tournaments\" is the first row.\n\n4. **Analyze Data for 2008/09**:\n   - Look at the cell corresponding to the intersection of the \"ranking tournaments\" row and the 2008/09 column.\n   - The value in this cell is `72`. This indicates Liu Song's ranking was 72nd place in that year.\n\n5. **Determine if Ranking Was Within Top 50**:\n   - To be within the top 50, Liu Song would need a ranking number less than or equal to 50.\n   - Since his ranking for 2008/09 is 72, he did not make it into the top 50 that year.\n\n6. **Compare with Other Years**:\n   - Although the claim specifically mentions 2008/09, it\u2019s prudent to check other years within the same category for completeness and context.\n   - For instance, in 2004/05, his ranking was `119` which is lower than 72; in 2007/08, he ranked `60`, still not in the top 50.\n   - In 2011/12, his ranking improved to `43`, indicating a better performance than 2008/09 but beyond the scope of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, Liu Song's best ranking was indeed not achieved during 2008/09 as he did not make it into the top 50 that year. The table shows his ranking in 2008/09 was 72nd, which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'ranking tournaments' row indicates Liu Song's yearly rankings from 2004/05 to 2011/12.
