All three are from either the United States or South Africa.\n\n3. **Check Nationalities**:\n   - Billy Casper is from the United States.\n   - Arnold Palmer is from the United States.\n   - Gary Player is from South Africa.\n   - Ben Hogan is from the United States.\n\n4. **Determine if Any are from South America**:\n   - None of the top 3 finishers (Billy Casper, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Ben Hogan) are from South America.\n   - The only player from outside the United States among the top 3 is Gary Player, who is from South Africa.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since none of the top 3 finishers are from South America, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that Billy Casper (United States) finished 1st, and Arnold Palmer (United States), Gary Player (South Africa), and Ben Hogan (United States) tied for 2nd place.
