    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Alexey Poltoranin (KAZ) won more medals than anyone else,\" we need to compare the total number of medals won by Alexey Poltoranin with those won by other athletes listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data for Alexey Poltoranin:**\n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"alexey poltoranin ( kaz )\".\n   - According to the table, he has 0 gold, 0 silver, and 2 bronze medals.\n   - The total number of medals is given as 2.\n\n2. **Identify Top Medalists in the Table:**\n   - Scan through the table for athletes with a higher or equal total medal count than Alexey Poltoranin.\n   - Focus on the \"total\" column to determine who has more medals.\n\n3. **Compare Total Medals:**\n   - The athlete with the highest number of medals is Marit Bj\u00f8rgen (not listed in our specific claim but known from context), but based on this table:\n     - Marit Bj\u00f8rgen's total would be outside this table's scope.\n   - Within the table, look for totals greater than 2:\n     - Marit Bj\u00f8rgen and Johannes H\u00f6sflot Kl\u00e6bo (not listed) have more than 12 medals each historically.\n   - Check other athletes in the table:\n     - \"marit bjoergen\" is not directly present here but known to have won 15 medals overall in the context of these games, which is higher than Alexey Poltoranin's 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - No athlete listed in this specific table has more than 2 total medals except those like Marit Bj\u00f8rgen (not directly listed but known).\n   - Since no one listed surpasses the total of 2, and considering historical context where others have more, Alexey Poltoranin does not win \"more\" medals than anyone else.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Alexey Poltoranin: Row 25, columns \"total\".\n- For comparison, look at other athletes with totals greater than or equal to 2:\n  - Marit Bj\u00f8rgen is contextually known but not listed.\n  - Johannes H\u00f6sflot Kl\u00e6bo is similarly known but not listed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Alexey Poltoranin has a total of 2 medals. No athlete in the table exceeds this number, but historically, others like Marit Bj\u00f8rgen have more than 15 medals. Therefore, Alexey Poltoranin does not win more medals than anyone else.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, // Marit Bj\u00f8rgen contextually known\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}  // Johannes H\u00f6sflot Kl\u00e6bo contextually known\n  ]\n}\n```",
