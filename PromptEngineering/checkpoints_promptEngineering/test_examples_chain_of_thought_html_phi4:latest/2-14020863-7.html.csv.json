    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if the players mentioned are indeed not Canadian and have been listed in round 3. Let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Players in Round 3:**\n   - According to the table, the players selected in round 3 are:\n     - Miloslav Guren\n     - Martin Hohenberger\n\n2. **Check Nationality for Round 3 Players:**\n   - **Miloslav Guren:** \n     - Position: Defence\n     - Nationality: Czechoslovakia (not Canada)\n   - **Martin Hohenberger:** \n     - Position: Left Wing\n     - Nationality: Austria (not Canada)\n\n3. **Verify the Claimed Non-Canadian Players for Round 3:**\n   - The claim states that Miloslav Guren and Martin Hohenberger are not Canadian, which is true based on their nationalities.\n\n4. **Identify Niklas Anger's Details:**\n   - According to the table, Niklas Anger was selected in:\n     - Round: 5\n     - Nationality: Sweden (not Canada)\n   - Niklas Anger was not part of round 3, so he cannot be considered under this specific round claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is partially correct. While Miloslav Guren and Martin Hohenberger are indeed non-Canadian players selected in round 3, Niklas Anger was selected in a different round (round 5), not round 3. Therefore, the statement that all three mentioned players were selected in round 3 and are non-Canadians is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Miloslav Guren:**\n  - Row Index: 1\n  - Columns: \"round\" (value: 3), \"nationality\" (value: Czechoslovakia)\n\n- **Martin Hohenberger:**\n  - Row Index: 2\n  - Columns: \"round\" (value: 3), \"nationality\" (value: Austria)\n\n- **Niklas Anger:**\n  - Row Index: 4\n  - Columns: \"round\" (value: 5), \"nationality\" (value: Sweden)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players in round 3 and checked their nationalities.
