    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about teams tied on aggregate in a football competition is true or false, we will analyze the provided table for any instances where two teams have an equal aggregate score across two legs of their matches.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table lists multiple rows, each representing a match between two teams.\n   - Each row includes columns: `team 1`, `agg` (aggregate), `team 2`, `1st leg`, and `2nd leg`.\n   - The aggregate score (`agg`) shows the combined result from both legs of the match.\n\n2. **Identify Aggregate Ties:**\n   - We need to find rows where the `agg` column indicates a tied score.\n   - A tie in football means both teams have the same number of total goals over two matches, typically noted with terms like \"5-5\" or similar formats indicating equality.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for Aggregate Ties:**\n   - **Row 1:** Sloga Jugomagnat vs. Pobeda \u2014 Aggregate is `2 - 1`. Not a tie.\n   - **Row 2:** Pelister vs. Sileks \u2014 Aggregate is `( a ) 5 - 5`. This indicates a tie, and the notation `( a )` typically signifies that there was an additional criterion (e.g., away goals) to decide the winner, but here it confirms they tied on aggregate.\n   - **Row 3:** Rabotni\u010dki vs. \u0160kendija HB \u2014 Aggregate is `3 - 3`. This indicates a tie; however, it is noted with `(1 - 3 p)` which likely refers to penalties deciding the outcome after an aggregate tie.\n   - **Row 4:** Belasica vs. Bregalnica \u0160tip \u2014 Aggregate is `7 - 1`. Not a tie.\n   - **Row 5:** Karaorman vs. Borec MHK \u2014 Aggregate is `( a ) 4 - 4`. Another indication of an aggregate tie, with `( a )` suggesting additional criteria for determining the winner.\n   - **Row 6:** Vardar vs. Napredok \u2014 Aggregate is `7 - 1`. Not a tie.\n   - **Row 7:** Alumina vs. Ba\u0161kimi \u2014 Aggregate is `2 - 4`. Not a tie.\n   - **Row 8:** Cementarnica vs. Mad\u017eari Solidarnost \u2014 Aggregate is `8 - 0`. Not a tie.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We identified two rows with aggregate ties:\n     - Row 2: Pelister vs. Sileks with `( a ) 5 - 5`.\n     - Row 5: Karaorman vs. Borec MHK with `( a ) 4 - 4`.\n\nThus, there are indeed two teams that have tied on aggregate in the provided table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each row of the table to identify where the aggregate score was tied between the two teams.
