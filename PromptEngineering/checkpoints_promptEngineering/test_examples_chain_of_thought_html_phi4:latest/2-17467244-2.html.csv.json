In football (soccer), a draw typically means the match result was tied at full-time.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Match Result:**\n   - Look through the \"result\" column to identify results indicating a draw.\n\n3. **Check Specific Dates Mentioned in the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies three dates for matches ending in a draw: 1995-06-06, 1996-07-25, and 1999-07-10.\n   - We will verify these specific dates to see if they correspond to draws.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Relevant Match:**\n   - **1995-06-06:** \n     - The result is \"3 - 3\", which indicates a draw.\n     - This matches the first date in the claim.\n   \n   - **1996-07-25:** \n     - The result is \"0 - 0\", which is also a draw.\n     - This matches the second date in the claim.\n\n   - **1999-07-10:**\n     - The result is \"0 - 0 (Pso 5 - 4)\", indicating that the match went to penalties after a draw at full-time.\n     - Despite winning on penalties, the full-time result was a draw. This matches the third date in the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - All three dates mentioned in the claim correspond to matches that ended in a draw either at full-time or proceeded to extra time/penalties after a draw.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is true. Tisha Venturini had 3 career matches end in a draw on the specified dates.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified matches with results indicating a draw by examining the 'result' column for tied scores at full-time.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we will compare each element of the claim to the data presented in the HTML table.\n\n**Claim:**\n\"1996 - 08 - 01 athens , ga start 2 - 1 gold medal match\"\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the row related to the date \"1996 - 08 - 01\":**\n   - From the table, we can see that there is a row with the date \"1996 - 07 - 28\" and another with \"1996 - 08 - 01\".\n   - We focus on the row with the date \"1996 - 08 - 01\".\n\n2. **Check each element of the claim against this specific row:**\n   - **Date:** The first element in the claim is \"1996 - 08 - 01\", which matches the \"date\" column for row index 11.\n   \n   - **Location:** The second element in the claim is \"athens, ga\". In row index 11 of the table, the \"location\" is also listed as \"athens, ga\".\n   \n   - **Lineup:** The third element in the claim is \"start\". For row index 11, the \"lineup\" is specified as \"start\".\n   \n   - **Result:** The fourth element in the claim is \"2 - 1\". In row index 11, the \"result\" column shows \"2 - 1\", which matches.\n   \n   - **Competition:** The final element of the claim is \"gold medal match\".
