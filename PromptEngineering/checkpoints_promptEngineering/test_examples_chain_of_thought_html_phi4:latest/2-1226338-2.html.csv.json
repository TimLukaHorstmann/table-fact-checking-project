    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in 3 races in 1982\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data for the year 1982:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Entries from 1982**: \n   - Look at each row within the table and check if the \"year\" column contains the value \"1982\". This helps us filter entries relevant to the claim.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - From the identified rows for 1982, extract information about the team or entrant, chassis used, engine type, and points scored.\n\n3. **List of Entries from 1982**:\n   - The table has two rows where \"year\" is 1982:\n     - Row with `team ensign racing`: \n       - Chassis: arrows a4\n       - Engine: cosworth v8\n       - Points: 3\n     - Row with the same team (`ensign racing`): \n       - Chassis: arrows a5\n       - Engine: cosworth v8\n       - Points: 3\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in three races during 1982.\n   - From the extracted data, there are only two entries for 1982 both having the same points (3). There is no third entry with equal points to confirm the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we have only two rows from 1982 and each row has the same points scored by a team (ensign racing), but not three, the claim that Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in three races is FALSE.\n   - Additionally, there's no direct mention or indication in the table regarding Marc Surer driving these cars. The analysis relies solely on point distribution among teams for 1982.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row index 6 (0-based): \n  - Columns: `year` = \"1982\", `points` = 3\n- Row index 7 (0-based):\n  - Columns: `year` = \"1982\", `points` = 3\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified entries from 1982 with points.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Marc Surer's points scoring record is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table for entries associated with him. The claim states: \"Marc Surer scored 6 points 2 times more than he scored 2 points in total.\" Here are the steps and reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: We need to find any rows in the table that mention Marc Surer as part of the entrant.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry**:\n   - The table has no explicit mention of Marc Surer by name; it lists team names like \"team ensign,\" \"ensign racing,\" etc.\n   - Since we don't have direct information on individual drivers, we need to rely on external knowledge or assumptions based on typical historical data for Formula 1 teams.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:\n   - Marc Surer is known to have driven for Arrows in the early 1980s.\n   - We check entries related to \"Arrows Racing Team\" from 1982 to 1986.\n\n4. **Analyze Points for Arrows Entries**:\n   - In 1982, \"arrows racing team\" has two rows with \"arrows a4\" and \"arrows a5,\" both scoring 3 points.\n   - In 1983, \"arrows racing team\" with \"arrows a6\" scored 4 points.\n   - In 1984, \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" has entries for \"arrows a6\" (1 point) and \"arrows a7\" (1 point).\n   - In 1986, \"barclay arrows bmw\" with \"arrows a8\" scored 0 points.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Points**:\n   - For Arrows in the years mentioned, Surer could have participated in races that contributed to these scores.\n   - Summing up all points for Arrows from 1982 to 1986: \n     - 1982: 3 + 3 = 6\n     - 1983: 4\n     - 1984: 1 + 1 = 2\n     - 1986: 0\n   - Total points for these years = 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 12\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states Surer scored 6 points twice more than he scored 2 points.\n   - From our analysis, Arrows (potentially including Surer) scored 6 points once in 1982 and never exactly 6 points again as a single entry.\n   - They scored 4 points once (1983), which is not relevant to the claim.\n   - They scored 2 points once in total (1984).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Surer did not score 6 points twice, nor does any combination of scores match the condition set by the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified entries related to Marc Surer's known team (Arrows) and calculated their total points.
