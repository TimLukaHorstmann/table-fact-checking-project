This corresponds to the second row of data (row index 1 if starting from zero).\n\n2. **Locate the Win Percentage Column**: \n   - The table has columns with headers: \"games\", \"won\", \"lost\", \"tied\", \"points\", \"pct %\", \"goals for\", \"goals against\", and \"standing\".\n   - We need to find the column labeled \"pct %\" which denotes win percentage.\n\n3. **Extract the Win Percentage Value**:\n   - Once we locate the correct row and column, extract the value present there.\n   - For the 1948 - 49 season (row index 1), in the \"pct %\" column (column index of 'pct %'), verify what number is listed.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value**:\n   - The claim states that the win percentage for the 1948 - 49 season is 0.552.\n   - Compare this value to the one extracted from the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- From the data in the table, the \"pct %\" column under the row labeled \"1948 - 49\" has the value of 0.552.\n- This matches exactly with the win percentage claimed in the statement.\n\nThus, based on the information provided and the analysis conducted, the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists seasons chronologically.
