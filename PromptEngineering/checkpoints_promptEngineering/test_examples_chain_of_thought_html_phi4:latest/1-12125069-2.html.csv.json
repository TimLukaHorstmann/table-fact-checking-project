It shows that the winning pitcher is indeed listed as \"chris young\".\n  \n- Therefore, the claim that \"Chris Young was the winning pitcher on June 25\" matches the information in the table.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row where date = 'june 25'.
