Here are all the attendance figures from the table:\n\n   - Week 1: 70,255\n   - Week 2: 57,310\n   - Week 3: 74,553\n   - Week 4: 54,006\n   - Week 5: 52,101\n   - Week 6: 70,187\n   - Week 7: 73,096\n   - Week 8: 66,210\n   - Week 9: 59,662\n   - **Week 11 (Nov 28, 2004): 46,905**\n   - Week 12: 77,447\n   - Week 13: 65,395\n   - Week 14: 65,858\n   - Week 15: 72,489\n   - Week 16: 57,330\n   - Week 17: 64,920\n\n3. **Determine the Minimum Attendance:**  \n   We compare all attendance figures to identify the smallest one:\n   \n   - The minimum attendance in the list is 52,101 (Week 5).\n   - The attendance for Week 11 (November 28, 2004) is 46,905.\n\n4. **Conclusion on the Claim:**\n   Since 46,905 (Week 11) is indeed the smallest attendance figure among all listed games, the claim that \"on November 28, 2004 the game held the least amount of crowd attendance\" is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row index for Week 11: 11\n- Column name: \"attendance\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the relevant game on November 28, 2004 (Week 11).
