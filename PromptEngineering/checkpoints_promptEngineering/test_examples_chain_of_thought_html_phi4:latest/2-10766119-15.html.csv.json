    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more crowd watch glenferrie oval than arden street oval\" is true or false, we need to compare the audience attendance numbers for games played at these two venues based on the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - First, locate the rows in the table that correspond to the matches held at \"glenferrie oval\" and \"arden street oval\".\n\n2. **Locate Venue Data for Arden Street Oval:**\n   - From the first row of the table:\n     - `home team`: north melbourne\n     - `venue`: arden street oval\n     - `crowd`: 6000\n\n3. **Locate Venue Data for Glenferrie Oval:**\n   - From the fifth row of the table:\n     - `home team`: hawthorn\n     - `venue`: glenferrie oval\n     - `crowd`: 5000\n\n4. **Compare Audience Numbers:**\n   - The crowd at \"arden street oval\" is 6000.\n   - The crowd at \"glenferrie oval\" is 5000.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that more people watched the game at \"glenferrie oval\" than at \"arden street oval\".\n   - Comparing the numbers, 5000 (Glenferrie Oval) < 6000 (Arden Street Oval), which means fewer people attended the game at Glenferrie Oval.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because more crowd watched the game at Arden Street Oval than at Glenferrie Oval.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows corresponding to arden street oval and glenferrie oval.
