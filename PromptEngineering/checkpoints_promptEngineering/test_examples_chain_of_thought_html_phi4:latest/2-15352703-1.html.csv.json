    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the information provided in the table regarding draft pick number 155.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim refers to a specific draft pick number, which is 155.\n   - We need to locate this draft pick number in the \"pick\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Locate Draft Pick Number 155:**\n   - Scan through the rows in the table under the \"pick\" column to find the entry with value 155.\n\n3. **Extract Information from the Relevant Row:**\n   - Once we identify the row where pick number 155 appears, we need to check the corresponding values for the columns \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"college.\"\n   - Specifically, we are interested in the college attended by the player associated with this draft pick.\n\n4. **Verify the College Information:**\n   - In the table, locate the row where pick number 155 is found.\n   - Check the value under the \"college\" column for this row to see if it matches \"arizona university.\"\n\n5. **Analyze and Confirm:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row with pick 155 has the following details:\n       - Player: John Nies\n       - Position: Punter\n       - College: Arizona\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The college listed for draft pick number 155 is \"Arizona,\" which matches part of the claim (\"arizona university\").\n   - However, the precise name mentioned in the table is simply \"Arizona,\" not \"arizona university.\"\n   - Therefore, the claim as stated does not perfectly match the information provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is FALSE due to the difference between \"Arizona\" and \"arizona university.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was scanned for draft pick number 155 in the 'pick' column.
