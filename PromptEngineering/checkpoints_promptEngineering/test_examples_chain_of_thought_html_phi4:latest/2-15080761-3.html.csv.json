We will examine each row under the \"opponents\" column for this purpose.\n\n- **Row 5**: The opponent is \"notts county\".\n- **Row 6**: The opponent is \"notts county\".\n- **Row 7**: The opponent is \"the wednesday\".\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Appearances\n\nFrom the analysis above, \"the wednesday\" appears as an opponent in only one instance (Row 7).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Timing of the Appearance\n\nThe claim specifies that \"the wednesday\" appeared during the first game of the FC season. We need to check if Row 7 corresponds to the first game:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date is 12 December 1903, opponent is \"small heath\".\n- **Row 2**: Date is 16 December 1903, opponent is \"small heath\".\n- **Row 3**: Date is 21 December 1903, opponent is \"small heath\".\n- **Row 4**: Date is 11 January 1904, opponent is \"small heath\".\n- **Row 5**: Date is 6 February 1904, opponent is \"notts county\".\n- **Row 6**: Date is 10 February 1904, opponent is \"notts county\".\n- **Row 7**: Date is 20 February 1904, opponent is \"the wednesday\".\n\nThe first game listed in the table (by date) is on 12 December 1903 against \"small heath\". Therefore, \"the wednesday\" did not appear as an opponent during the first game of the season.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim states that \"the wednesday\" only appears as an opponent one time, which is correct.\n- However, it also claims this occurred during the first game of the FC season, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
