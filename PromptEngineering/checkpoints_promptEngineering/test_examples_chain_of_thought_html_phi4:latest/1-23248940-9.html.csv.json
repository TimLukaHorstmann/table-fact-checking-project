    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for each game played by the Bobcats. The specific task is to find if there was any game where a player recorded 20 or more rebounds, which would then be compared against all other games to see if this count of 20 rebounds is indeed the second highest.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rebounds Data**: Focus on the \"high rebounds\" column for each game.\n   \n2. **Extract and List Rebound Values**:\n   - Game 47: Gerald Wallace (10)\n   - Game 48: Nazr Mohammed (17)\n   - Game 49: Boris Diaw (8)\n   - Game 50: Nazr Mohammed (10)\n   - Game 51: Nazr Mohammed (20)\n   - Game 52: Gerald Wallace and Boris Diaw (10 each)\n   - Game 53: Tyrus Thomas (12)\n   - Game 54: Tyrus Thomas (11)\n   - Game 55: Gerald Wallace (12)\n   - Game 56: Gerald Wallace (8)\n\n3. **Identify Maximum Rebound Values**:\n   - From the extracted values, we identify that the maximum rebound count in a single game is 20 rebounds by Nazr Mohammed in Game 51.\n\n4. **Determine the Second Highest Value**:\n   - After identifying 20 as the highest, check for the next highest number of rebounds.\n   - The next highest value after 20 is 17 rebounds by Nazr Mohammed in Game 48.\n\n5. **Verify Claim Against Data**: \n   - The claim states that \"the second most rebound by a Bobcat player in one game be 20\".\n   - We identified the maximum as 20 and the second highest as 17.\n   - Therefore, the second highest value is not 20 rebounds, but rather 17 rebounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"the second most rebound by a Bobcat player in one game be 20\" is FALSE.
