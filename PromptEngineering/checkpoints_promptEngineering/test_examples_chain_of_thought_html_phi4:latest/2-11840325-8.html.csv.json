    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each component of the statement using the data provided.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \n- Year: 2012\n- Oakland Raiders lose\n- Kansas City Chiefs win\n- Location: Arrowhead Stadium\n- Result: 15 - 0\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Identify All 2012 Games**:\n   - Look for rows where the `year` column is \"2012\".\n\n2. **Check Each 2012 Game**:\n   - For each game in 2012, verify if it involves both Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs.\n   \n3. **Match Location**:\n   - Check if any of these games took place at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n4. **Determine Result**:\n   - Verify the score to see if it was 15 - 0 with the Kansas City Chiefs as winners (meaning they won, not lost).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Locate 2012 Rows**:\n   - The table has two rows for the year 2012.\n     - Row 5: Date \"october 28\", Winner \"oakland raiders\", Result \"26 - 16\", Loser \"kansas city chiefs\", Location \"arrowhead stadium\".\n     - Row 6: Date \"december 16\", Winner \"oakland raiders\", Result \"15 - 0\", Loser \"kansas city chiefs\", Location \"oco coliseum\".\n\n2. **Check for Arrowhead Stadium**:\n   - From the 2012 entries, only row 5 was played at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n3. **Verify Game Details in Row 5**:\n   - Winner: Oakland Raiders\n   - Loser: Kansas City Chiefs\n   - Result: 26 - 16\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies a loss for the Raiders and a win for the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a score of 15 - 0.\n   - In Row 5, the Raiders won, not lost, so this does not match the claim.\n\n5. **Check Other Rows for Matching Criteria**:\n   - Row 6 has a result of 15 - 0, but it was played at OCO Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium, and Raiders were the winners.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there is no record in 2012 where the Oakland Raiders lost to Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a score of 15 - 0. The game with that score occurred at OCO Coliseum with the Raiders winning.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all games in 2012, found the relevant match at Arrowhead Stadium (Row 5), confirmed Raiders won there, and no game fits the claim of a Chiefs win at Arrowhead Stadium.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\", \"value\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\", \"value\": \"oakland raiders\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"loser\", \"value\": \"kansas city chiefs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\", \"value\": \"arrowhead stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\", \"value\": \"26 - 16\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\", \"value\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\", \"value\": \"oakland raiders\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"loser\", \"value\": \"kansas city chiefs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\", \"value\": \"oco coliseum\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\", \"value\": \"15 - 0\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
