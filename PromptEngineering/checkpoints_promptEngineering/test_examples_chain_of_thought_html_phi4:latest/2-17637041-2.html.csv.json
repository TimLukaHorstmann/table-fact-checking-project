The absence of an explicit title does not negate the association if we accept that this label might be linked to 'fantasy black channel'.\n\n3. **Confirm the Format and Catalog:**\n   - Further details in the first row are:\n     - `format (s)`: CD\n     - `catalog`: Tocp - 66797\n   - These entries don't contain information about album titles but confirm a release occurred.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Available Data:**\n   - The table confirms that there was indeed a release in Japan by Toshiba EMI on 30 July 2008.\n   - Although the title \"fantasy black channel\" is not explicitly mentioned, no contrary evidence exists to refute the claim when assuming the label's association with this album.\n\nBased on these steps, the available data supports the claim that an album (potentially 'fantasy black channel') was first released in Japan on 30 July 2008.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains a row indicating a release in Japan by Toshiba EMI on 30 July 2008.
