Since there is no round information, we cannot verify this part from the table directly.\n\n4. **Score Difference**:\n   - Richmond's score: 16.14 (110)\n   - St Kilda's score: 8.8 (56)\n   - Calculate the difference in points: \n     - Convert scores to points: Richmond = 110, St Kilda = 56.\n     - Difference = 110 - 56 = 54 points.\n   - The claim states a point difference of \"7.34 (54)\" which is correct as 7 goals and 34 behinds equal 54 points.\n\n5. **Outcome**:\n   - Richmond's score (110) > St Kilda's score (56), so Richmond beat St Kilda.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- All parts of the claim that can be verified against the table are correct except for the round number, which is not provided in the table.\n- Since the only unverifiable part is the \"round\" information and all other details match, the claim is considered TRUE based on available data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies that Richmond beat St Kilda by a certain score at punt road oval.
