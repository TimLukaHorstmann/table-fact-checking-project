    "resp": "To determine whether the statement \"the record for June 13 be under 29 - 32\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table and follow a clear logical reasoning process:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date**:\n   - The claim pertains to a specific date: \"June 13\". However, our dataset does not include June 13. The closest dates available are June 12 and June 14.\n\n2. **Determine the Record on June 12**:\n   - Look at the record for June 12 in the table.\n   - From the table, on June 12, the record is \"33 - 31\".\n\n3. **Determine the Record on June 14**:\n   - Since June 13 is missing, we consider June 14 to assess any potential changes that might have affected the record before or after this date.\n   - On June 14, the record is \"34 - 31\".\n\n4. **Analyze the Records**:\n   - The record on June 12 is \"33 - 31\".\n   - The record on June 14 is \"34 - 31\".\n   - There is no data for June 13 itself.\n\n5. **Assess Claim Validity**:\n   - The claim states that the record should be under \"29 - 32\" for June 13.\n   - Since June 12 had a record of \"33 - 31\", which is not under \"29 - 32\", and June 14's record is \"34 - 31\", it implies that any potential record on June 13 would likely have been between these two dates unless there was an anomalous event (which the data does not suggest).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the absence of a record for June 13, we infer from surrounding records (June 12 and June 14) that it is unlikely the record on June 13 could have been under \"29 - 32\".\n   - Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim pertains to June 13, but there's no data for this date. The closest records are from June 12 (33 - 31) and June 14 (34 - 31).
