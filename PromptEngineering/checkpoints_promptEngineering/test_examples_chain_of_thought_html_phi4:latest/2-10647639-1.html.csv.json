    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the patriots have more losses than wins at Sullivan Stadium\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - We need to focus on games played at \"Sullivan Stadium.\" According to the table, the column for the game site is labeled as \"game site.\"\n\n2. **Extract Data for Sullivan Stadium:**\n   - We will list all rows where the \"game site\" is \"Sullivan Stadium.\"\n\n3. **Count Wins and Losses at Sullivan Stadium:**\n   - For each game at Sullivan Stadium, we need to determine if it was a win or loss by looking at the \"result\" column.\n   - A result starting with \"w\" indicates a win, while one starting with \"l\" indicates a loss.\n\n4. **Compare Wins and Losses:**\n   - Count the number of wins and losses from the extracted data to determine if there are more losses than wins.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Rows at Sullivan Stadium:**\n  - Week 1: Result is \"w 26 - 20\"\n  - Week 4: Result is \"l 35 - 20\"\n  - Week 6: Result is \"w 28 - 6\"\n  - Week 7: Result is \"w 20 - 13\"\n  - Week 9: Result is \"w 17 - 13\"\n  - Week 10: Result is \"w 34 - 15\"\n  - Week 14: Result is \"w 23 - 6\"\n  - Week 16: Result is \"w 34 - 23\"\n\n- **Count of Wins and Losses:**\n  - Wins at Sullivan Stadium: 7 (Weeks 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 16)\n  - Losses at Sullivan Stadium: 1 (Week 4)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Patriots have more wins (7) than losses (1) at Sullivan Stadium.
