    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the locomotives of class \"r 4 / 4\" being type \"c n2t\" and having numbers greater than 4000 is true, we need to evaluate each row corresponding to \"r 4 / 4\" in the table. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows for Class \"r 4 / 4\":**\n   - We look at the rows where the \"class\" column contains \"r 4 / 4\". There are two such rows.\n\n2. **Check the Type:**\n   - For each of these rows, we need to verify if the \"type\" is \"c n2t\".\n\n3. **Verify the Numbers:**\n   - We also need to check that all numbers listed in the \"number (s)\" column for these rows are greater than 4000.\n\n4. **Row Analysis:**\n\n   - **First Row of Class \"r 4 / 4\":**\n     - \"Number (s)\": 4151 - 4183\n     - \"Type\": d n2t\n     - The numbers range from 4151 to 4183, which are all greater than 4000.\n     - However, the type is \"d n2t\", not \"c n2t\".\n\n   - **Second Row of Class \"r 4 / 4\":**\n     - \"Number (s)\": 4184 - 4192\n     - \"Type\": d n2t\n     - The numbers range from 4184 to 4192, which are all greater than 4000.\n     - Again, the type is \"d n2t\", not \"c n2t\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both rows for class \"r 4 / 4\" have numbers greater than 4000, but neither has the type \"c n2t\". Instead, they both have the type \"d n2t\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those from the rows corresponding to class \"r 4 / 4\" with columns \"class\", \"number (s)\", and \"type\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows for class 'r 4 / 4'.
