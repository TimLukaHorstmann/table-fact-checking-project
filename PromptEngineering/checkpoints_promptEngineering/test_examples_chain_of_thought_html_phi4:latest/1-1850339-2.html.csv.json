    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"for the 2018 season, the air force - navy score be yet TBD,\" we need to analyze the provided table data related to the years and scores of matches between Air Force, Navy, and other teams.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The focus is on the year 2018 in the table. We look for any entries specifically mentioning this year.\n\n2. **Check Row for Year 2018**:\n   - There is a row for the year 2018 in the provided data.\n   - In this row, it states that all three matches (\"4 oct\", \"1 nov\", and \"13 dec\") have their outcomes marked as TBD (To Be Determined).\n\n3. **Assess Specific Mention of Air Force vs Navy**:\n   - The table does not separately list individual matches between Air Force and Navy in the 2018 row, but it implies all scores are TBD.\n   - In previous years, separate columns for each match were used to show specific outcomes.\n\n4. **Inference from Patterns**:\n   - Historically, when a year has all \"TBD\" entries like in 2009 or for future predictions (e.g., 2014, 2016), it indicates no scores have been decided at the time of data entry.\n   - The consistent use of TBD across multiple matches for 2018 implies none of them have occurred or had their scores determined yet.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Claim**:\n   - Since all entries for 2018 are marked as \"TBD,\" it logically follows that specific results, including the score between Air Force and Navy, remain undetermined at the time this data was compiled.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"for the 2018 season, the air force - navy score be yet TBD\" is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The row for 2018 contains all relevant cells indicating TBD status for matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The year 2018 in the table lists 'TBD' for all match scores.

This involves looking through each row of the table to identify if 1983 is mentioned.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Scores**:\n   If we locate a row for 1983, we must check the scores listed in that row to see if there are any matches with \"Air Force - Navy\" and specifically, if it shows \"44-17\".\n\n4. **Evaluate Findings**: \n   Based on the above steps, determine whether the specific score \"44-17\" was indeed recorded for Air Force vs. Navy in 1983.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Conclude with a boolean answer (TRUE or FALSE) based on the presence or absence of the specified score for the year 1983.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the data table:\n\n1. **Locate Year 1983**: \n   As we examine each row, we find that the first row contains the year \"1983\".\n\n2. **Check Scores for 1983**:\n   For October: \"Air Force - Navy\" score is \"44-17\".\n   This matches exactly with the claim provided in the statement.\n\n3. **Evaluate Findings**: \n   Since the score \"44-17\" for Air Force vs. Navy is present and correctly dated to 1983, the statement is supported by the data.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   The statement is TRUE based on the evidence from the table.\n\nFinally, we will structure this reasoning into a JSON format as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

Therefore, we need to focus on rows where either \"air force\" or \"navy\" is mentioned as the winner.\n\n2. **Review Each Year's Results:**\n   - From 2003 onwards, Navy has been listed as the winner in every year except for 2010 and 2011 when Air Force won.\n   - For each of these years (2003-2018), check if there is an \"ot\" (overtime) notation next to the score. An overtime match indicates that the game was not decided within regular playtime, meaning it went into extra time.\n\n3. **Check for Overtime Matches:**\n   - 2003: Navy won 31 - 6 (No overtime)\n   - 2004: Navy won 42 - 13 (No overtime)\n   - 2005: Navy won 42 - 23 (No overtime)\n   - 2006: Navy won 26 - 14 (No overtime)\n   - 2007: Navy won 38 - 3 (No overtime)\n   - 2008: Navy won 34 - 0 (No overtime)\n   - 2009: Navy won 17 - 3 (No overtime)\n   - 2010: Air Force won 31 - 17 (No overtime)\n   - 2011: Air Force won 27 - 21 (No overtime)\n   - 2012: Navy won 17 - 13 (No overtime)\n\n4. **Examine the Years 2014, 2016, and 2018:**\n   - For these years, \"tbd\" (to be decided) is listed under the winner column, indicating that the outcomes were not yet determined at the time of data entry.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - All matches from 2003 to 2012 between Air Force and Navy were decided within regular playtime or without any indication of overtime.\n   - The years 2014, 2016, and 2018 are marked as \"tbd,\" meaning their outcomes were not yet known.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement is true because all matches up to 2012 between Air Force and Navy were decided within regular playtime, and no match was left undecided due to overtime.
