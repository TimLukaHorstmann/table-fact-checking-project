The claim specifically states that in the 2004 Texas Ranger season's 9th game never have an attendance over 40,000.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Games:**\n   - The games against the Mariners are listed for June 22 to June 30.\n   - We need to verify if any of these games had an attendance figure exceeding 40,000.\n\n2. **Examine Attendance Figures:**\n   - **June 22:** Attendance is 32,364.\n   - **June 23:** Attendance is 30,418.\n   - **June 24:** Attendance is 26,266.\n   - **June 28:** Attendance is 28,253.\n   - **June 29:** Attendance is 34,844.\n   - **June 30:** Attendance is 32,754.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - None of these attendance figures exceed 40,000.\n   \n4. **Determine Game Count and Context:**\n   - The games listed are part of a sequence against the Mariners.\n   - Although the table does not explicitly number each game in chronological order with respect to all team matchups, based on the context provided by the dates alone (June 22-30), these six games can be logically sequenced as occurring consecutively within this timeframe.\n\n5. **Verify Against the Claim:**\n   - Since none of the attendance figures for the Texas Rangers' games against the Mariners exceed 40,000 during June 22 to June 30, and assuming these are indeed consecutive home games including what might be considered their 9th game in a broader season context:\n     - The claim that \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season's 9th game never have an attendance of over 40,000\" is supported by this data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven all the relevant data and analysis, no game against the Mariners between June 22-30 had an attendance exceeding 40,000.
