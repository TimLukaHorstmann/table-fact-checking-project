    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all 12 nations that have a win at the World Golf Championship have at least 1 team win\" is true or false, we need to analyze each nation's data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that every nation with at least one win (whether individual or team) must have at least one team win.\n\n2. **Identify Nations with Wins**:\n   - We need to identify all nations that have a non-zero value in either the \"total wins\", \"team wins\", or \"individual wins\" columns.\n   - From the table, these are: United States, Australia, England, South Africa, Northern Ireland, Germany, Canada, Fiji, Sweden, Italy, Japan, and Wales.\n\n3. **Check for Team Wins**:\n   - We need to verify if each of these nations has at least one team win.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Nation**:\n\n   - **United States**: \n     - Total wins: 32\n     - Team wins: 1 (Column \"team wins\")\n     - Meets the claim.\n   \n   - **Australia**:\n     - Total wins: 5\n     - Team wins: 0\n     - Does not meet the claim.\n\n   - **England**:\n     - Total wins: 5\n     - Team wins: 1\n     - Meets the claim.\n     \n   - **South Africa**:\n     - Total wins: 4\n     - Team wins: 2\n     - Meets the claim.\n   \n   - **Northern Ireland**:\n     - Total wins: 2\n     - Team wins: 0\n     - Does not meet the claim.\n\n   - **Germany**:\n     - Total wins: 2\n     - Team wins: 1\n     - Meets the claim.\n\n   - **Canada**:\n     - Total wins: 1\n     - Team wins: 0\n     - Does not meet the claim.\n\n   - **Fiji**:\n     - Total wins: 1\n     - Team wins: 0\n     - Does not meet the claim.\n     \n   - **Sweden**:\n     - Total wins: 1\n     - Team wins: 0\n     - Does not meet the claim.\n   \n   - **Italy**:\n     - Total wins: 1\n     - Team wins: 0\n     - Does not meet the claim.\n\n   - **Japan**:\n     - Total wins: 1\n     - Team wins: 1\n     - Meets the claim.\n     \n   - **Wales**:\n     - Total wins: 1\n     - Team wins: 1\n     - Meets the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Australia, Northern Ireland, Canada, Fiji, Sweden, and Italy have at least one win but do not have any team wins.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because there are nations with wins that do not have any team wins.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- United States: \n  - Total Wins (32), Team Wins (1)\n- Australia:\n  - Total Wins (5), Team Wins (0)\n- England:\n  - Total Wins (5), Team Wins (1)\n- South Africa:\n  - Total Wins (4), Team Wins (2)\n- Northern Ireland:\n  - Total Wins (2), Team Wins (0)\n- Germany:\n  - Total Wins (2), Team Wins (1)\n- Canada:\n  - Total Wins (1), Team Wins (0)\n- Fiji:\n  - Total Wins (1), Team Wins (0)\n- Sweden:\n  - Total Wins (1), Team Wins (0)\n- Italy:\n  - Total Wins (1), Team Wins (0)\n- Japan:\n  - Total Wins (1), Team Wins (1)\n- Wales:\n  - Total Wins (1), Team Wins (1)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that all nations with at least one win must have a team win.
