    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the toronto maple leaf be the only opponent with 63 point\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for each game where Toronto Maple Leafs are listed as opponents, check if their points tally is 63, and then confirm that no other opponent has exactly 63 points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Toronto Maple Leafs:**\n   - Look for rows in the table where \"opponent\" is \"toronto maple leafs\".\n   \n2. **Check Points for These Games:**\n   - For each game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, check the value in the \"points\" column to see if it equals 63.\n   \n3. **List Opponents and Their Corresponding Points:**\n   - List all opponents from the table and note their corresponding points.\n\n4. **Verify Uniqueness of the 63 Points Condition:**\n   - Ensure that no other opponent, besides Toronto Maple Leafs (if applicable), has exactly 63 points.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Toronto Maple Leafs:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Game 68: Opponent is \"toronto maple leafs\" with points = 63.\n     - Game 71: Opponent is \"toronto maple leafs\" with points = 66.\n\n2. **Check Points for These Games:**\n   - In game 68, the points are indeed 63.\n   - In game 71, the points are 66 (not relevant for the claim).\n\n3. **List All Opponents and Their Corresponding Points:**\n   - Detroit Red Wings: 59 points\n   - California Golden Seals: 60 points\n   - Minnesota North Stars: 60 points\n   - Pittsburgh Penguins: 61, 69 points\n   - New York Rangers: 61, 65 points\n   - Toronto Maple Leafs: 63, 66 points\n   - Boston Bruins: 65 points\n   - Montreal Canadiens: 66 points\n\n4. **Verify Uniqueness of the 63 Points Condition:**\n   - Only in game 68 against the Toronto Maple Leafs do we see 63 points.\n   - No other opponent has exactly 63 points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Toronto Maple Leafs are indeed the only team with a record that results in 63 points according to the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
