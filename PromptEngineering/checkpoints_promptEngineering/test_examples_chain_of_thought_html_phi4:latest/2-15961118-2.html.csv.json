    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data systematically:\n\n1. **Identify Entries Using `nsr250`:**\n   - The machine column should contain entries for \"nsr250\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 0: year = 1993, team = cup noodle - honda, machine = nsr250, points = 8\n     - Row 1: year = 1994, team = cup noodle - honda, machine = nsr250, points = 11\n\n2. **Check the Team and Points for `nsr250`:**\n   - For row 0 (1993):\n     - The team \"cup noodle - honda\" has 8 points.\n   - For row 1 (1994):\n     - The team \"cup noodle - honda\" has 11 points.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"cup noodle - honda be the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 point\".\n   - Both entries for `nsr250` are associated with the team \"cup noodle - honda\".\n   - In neither entry does this team have fewer than 8 points. Specifically, they have 8 and 11 points in the respective years.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no instance where \"cup noodle - honda\" used an `nsr250` with less than 8 points, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this reasoning are:\n- Row 0: year, team, machine, points\n- Row 1: year, team, machine, points\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries using 'nsr250' in the machine column.\",\n    \"Find that both relevant entries (rows 0 and 1) are for the team 'cup noodle - honda'.\",\n    \"Check points: row 0 has 8 points, and row 1 has 11 points.\",\n    \"Since neither entry has less than 8 points, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
