The construction/completion date is absent, indicating it was never completed.\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps to check these conditions for each row that mentions the year 1993:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Projects Proposed and Listed in 1993**:\n   - We need to look at both the \"proposed\" and \"listed\" columns to find entries where both dates fall within the year 1993.\n\n2. **Check for Absence of Completion**:\n   - For those projects identified in step 1, we must confirm that there is no date recorded under \"construction completed\". This indicates they were never completed.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - **Proposed Date**: 06 / 23 / 1993\n  - **Listed Date**: Not listed (empty cell)\n  - **Construction Completed**: Not available (empty cell)\n\n  This project was proposed in 1993 but not listed, so it doesn't meet the criteria.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - **Proposed Date**: 05 / 10 / 1993\n  - **Listed Date**: Not listed (empty cell)\n  - **Construction Completed**: Not available (empty cell)\n\n  This project was proposed in 1993 but not listed, so it doesn't meet the criteria.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter checking all rows for the year 1993, we find that none of the projects were both proposed and listed within that year. Therefore, there are no projects that satisfy all the conditions specified in the claim.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are zero projects that were proposed and listed during 1993 but never completed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify any project entries where both 'proposed' and 'listed' dates fall within the year 1993.
