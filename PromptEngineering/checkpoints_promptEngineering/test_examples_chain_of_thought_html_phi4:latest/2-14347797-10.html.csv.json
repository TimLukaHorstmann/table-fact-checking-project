    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to examine the table data for the specific entry related to the date April 14.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Column:**\n   - The table has a column named \"date\" where each row contains a specific date corresponding to a game.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with April 14:**\n   - We need to find the row where the \"date\" is \"april 14\".\n\n3. **Check the Opponent for That Date:**\n   - Once we locate the correct row, examine the \"opponent\" column in that row to see which team played on April 14.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - Compare the opponent listed for April 14 with the claim's statement that the opponent was the \"new jersey devils\".\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row Identification:**\n  - We find the row where the date is \"april 14\".\n  - This corresponds to the fourth row in the table (as rows are typically indexed starting from 1).\n\n- **Check the Opponent Column for April 14:**\n  - In the fourth row, under the \"opponent\" column, the entry is \"new jersey devils\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the opponent on April 14 was the \"new jersey devil\". The table confirms this as the opponent listed for April 14 is indeed \"new jersey devils\".\n\n- **Final Answer:**\n  - The claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'date' column to find when games occurred.\",\n    \"Locate the row where the date is 'april 14'.\",\n    \"Check the 'opponent' column in that row.\",\n    \"Verify if the opponent listed for April 14 matches 'new jersey devils'.\",\n    \"The table confirms the opponent on April 14 was indeed 'new jersey devils'.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\", \"value\": \"april 14\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\", \"value\": \"new jersey devils\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
