    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"more than 3 golfers scored under par on 3 separate rounds\" is true, we need to examine each golfer's score per round and compare it to the par value for a round.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand Scoring:**\n   - Golf scores are often compared to par. A score of \"under par\" means the golfer scored fewer strokes than the standard (par) number for that course.\n   - The notation \"- 3\" indicates scoring 3 under par, and \"+ 1\" indicates scoring 1 over par.\n\n2. **Review Each Golfer's Rounds:**\n   - Jim Simons: Scores are 71, 71, and 65.\n     - Total score is 207, which is 3 under par (\"- 3\").\n     - Individual scores:\n       - 71: likely equal to or above par (no indication of being under par).\n       - 71: likely equal to or above par.\n       - 65: clearly under par.\n\n   - Jack Nicklaus: Scores are 69, 72, and 68.\n     - Total score is 209, which is 1 under par (\"- 1\").\n     - Individual scores:\n       - 69: could be under par.\n       - 72: likely over par.\n       - 68: clearly under par.\n\n   - Bobby Nichols: Scores are 69, 72, and 69.\n     - Total score is 210, which is even (\"e\"), meaning exactly at par.\n     - Individual scores:\n       - 69: could be under par.\n       - 72: likely over par.\n       - 69: could be under par.\n\n   - Lee Trevino: Scores are 70, 72, and 69.\n     - Total score is 211, which is 1 over par (\"+ 1\").\n     - Individual scores:\n       - 70: likely even or slightly above/below par.\n       - 72: likely over par.\n       - 69: could be under par.\n\n   - George Archer: Scores are 71, 70, and 70.\n     - Total score is 211, which is 1 over par (\"+ 1\").\n     - Individual scores:\n       - 71: likely equal to or slightly above par.\n       - 70: could be even with par.\n       - 70: could be even with par.\n\n   - Jim Colbert: Scores are 69, 69, and 73.\n     - Total score is 211, which is 1 over par (\"+ 1\").\n     - Individual scores:\n       - 69: could be under par.\n       - 69: could be under par.\n       - 73: likely over par.\n\n   - Bob Erickson: Scores are 71, 67, and 73.\n     - Total score is 211, which is 1 over par (\"+ 1\").\n     - Individual scores:\n       - 71: likely equal to or slightly above par.\n       - 67: clearly under par.\n       - 73: likely over par.\n\n   - Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin: Their total scores are all 212, which is 2 over par (\"+ 2\"). Hence, unlikely any round was under par for these golfers.\n\n3. **Identify Golfers Scoring Under Par in All Three Rounds:**\n   - We need golfers who scored under par in each of their three rounds.\n   - From the review:\n     - Jim Simons: Only one round (65) is clearly under par.\n     - Jack Nicklaus: Two rounds are potentially under par (69, 68).\n     - Bobby Nichols: Potentially two rounds under par (69, 69), but not confirmed.\n     - Lee Trevino: One round potentially under par (69).\n     - George Archer: No rounds under par.\n     - Jim Colbert: Two rounds potentially under par (69, 69).\n     - Bob Erickson: Only one round clearly under par (67).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the golfers scored under par in all three rounds.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each golfer's scores for under-par performance on a round-by-round basis and found that no golfer achieved an under-par score in all three rounds.
