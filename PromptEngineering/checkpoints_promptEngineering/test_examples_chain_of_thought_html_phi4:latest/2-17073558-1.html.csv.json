The regional Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2007 should be 9432.\n2. The value for industry in 2007 should be listed as 1565.\n\nLet's verify each part of the claim step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Locate the Year 2007:**\n   - We need to find the row where the year is 2007. From the table, we can see that there is a row with the year \"2007\".\n\n2. **Check Regional GVA for 2007:**\n   - In the row corresponding to the year 2007, look at the column labeled \"regional gva\".\n   - The value in this cell is 9432.\n   - This matches the first part of the claim.\n\n3. **Check Industry Value for 2007:**\n   - Still in the same row (year 2007), look at the column labeled \"industry\".\n   - The value in this cell is 1565.\n   - This matches the second part of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are consistent with the data provided in the table for the year 2007.
