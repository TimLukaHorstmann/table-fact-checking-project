Let's break down the claim and examine each part step-by-step.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\n1. **Claim about Game 5 on October 13:**\n   - The claim states that \"game 5 on october 13\" has a time of 2:37.\n   - We need to check if there is an entry for game 5 in the table and whether it corresponds to the date October 13.\n\n2. **Claim about Game 6 on October 14:**\n   - The claim states that \"game 6 on october 14\" has a time of 2:37.\n   - We need to check if there is an entry for game 6 in the table and whether it corresponds to the date October 14.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Check Game 5:**\n   - From the table, we see that game 5 has a date of \"october 12\".\n   - The claim mentions October 13 for game 5, which does not match the actual date in the table.\n   - Therefore, the part of the claim regarding game 5 is incorrect.\n\n2. **Check Game 6:**\n   - From the table, we see that game 6 has a date of \"october 14\".\n   - The time for game 6 is indeed listed as \"2:37\".\n   - This part of the claim is correct.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim about game 5 being on October 13 and having a time of 2:37 is false.\n- The claim about game 6 being on October 14 with a time of 2:37 is true.\n- Since one part of the claim is incorrect, the entire claim is considered false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For Game 5:\n  - Date cell: Row index 4, Column name \"date\" (value: \"october 12\")\n  - Time cell: Row index 4, Column name \"time\" (value: \"2:37\")\n\n- For Game 6:\n  - Date cell: Row index 5, Column name \"date\" (value: \"october 14\")\n  - Time cell: Row index 5, Column name \"time\" (value: \"2:37\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about game 5 on October 13 having a time of 2:37 is incorrect because the table shows game 5 is on October 12.
