The row with the date \"24 october 1988\" corresponds to Row 7 in the table.\n\n2. For Row 7:\n   - **Date**: Matches \"24 october 1988\".\n   - **Opponent**: Listed as Steffi Graf.\n   - **Score**: Matches \"2 - 6, 0 - 6\".\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied for Row 7, the claim is correct.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate the row with the date '24 october 1988', verify Steffi Graf as the opponent, and confirm the score '2 - 6, 0 - 6'.

The process involves identifying the specific criteria: matches involving Sylvia Hanika played on a \"hard (i)\" surface and checking their outcomes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**:\n   - We are looking for matches that meet two conditions: being against Sylvia Hanika and taking place on a hard (i) court.\n   \n2. **Review Each Match Entry**:\n   - Examine each row of the table to find entries where \"Sylvia Hanika\" is listed in the 7th column (\"Opponent\").\n   - Simultaneously, check if the surface type listed in the 6th column (\"Surface\") matches \"hard (i)\".\n\n3. **Evaluate Outcomes**:\n   - For each identified match involving Sylvia Hanika on a hard (i) surface, determine the outcome by checking the 4th column (\"Outcome\").\n\n4. **Compile Results**:\n   - If there is at least one match with Sylvia Hanika on a hard (i) court where the \"Outcome\" is \"winner\", then we can confirm that such an occurrence exists.\n\n### Analysis of Table Data:\n\n- **Match 1**: \n  - Date: 18 February 1990\n  - Opponent: Sylvia Hanika\n  - Surface: Carpet (i)\n  - Outcome: Loser\n  - This match does not satisfy the conditions as it is on a carpet surface, not hard (i).\n\n- **Match 2**:\n  - Date: 11 March 1990\n  - Opponent: Sylvia Hanika\n  - Surface: Hard (i)\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - This match satisfies both conditions: opponent is Sylvia Hanika and the surface is hard (i), with an outcome of \"winner\".\n\nSince we have identified a match that meets all specified criteria, it confirms the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true because there is at least one instance where the player was the winner in a match against Sylvia Hanika on a hard (i) surface.
