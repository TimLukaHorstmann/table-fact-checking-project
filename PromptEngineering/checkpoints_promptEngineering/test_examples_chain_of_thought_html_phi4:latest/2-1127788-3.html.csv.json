    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions according to the table provided.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We are interested in two columns: \"goal\" and \"competition\". The \"goal\" column will tell us how many goals were scored, while the \"competition\" column specifies whether it was an international competition or not (such as qualifiers for the World Cup, FIFA World Cup, Concacaf Gold Cup).\n\n2. **Define What Counts as More Than One Goal**: For Rafael M\u00e1rquez to score more than one goal in a match, the entry under the \"goal\" column must reflect that he personally scored multiple goals.\n\n3. **Review Each Entry**: We need to check each row of the table for entries where more than one goal was scored and ensure it's part of an international competition.\n\n4. **Year 2000 Analysis**:\n   - Row 2: Date is \"13 February 2000\", Competition is \"2000 concacaf gold cup\". The score shows M\u00e1rquez contributed to a match with a total result of \"4 - 0\". However, the column for \"goal\" indicates only one goal (1 - 0). This means he scored once in this game.\n\n5. **Other Years Analysis**:\n   - Row 3: Date is \"3 September 2000\", Competition is \"2002 world cup qualifier\". The result was \"7 - 1\" with a score of \"5 - 1\". Here, Rafael M\u00e1rquez likely scored multiple goals as he contributed to a match where the total number of goals exceeds one.\n   - For other years: Check each row similarly:\n     - Row 6 (2004): Result \"3 - 0\", no indication of scoring more than one goal by him specifically.\n     - Row 7 (2005): Result \"5 - 0\" with score \"2 - 0\". Again, likely multiple contributions by M\u00e1rquez since total goals scored are greater than his own.\n     - Other rows do not show M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in any single match.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - In the year 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez only scores once in an international competition (Concacaf Gold Cup).\n   - In another year, specifically 2000 again, during a World Cup qualifier match, he contributed to a game where multiple goals were scored.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"2000 be the only year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" is false because he also did so in 2005 (as per the table's result of \"7 - 1\" and \"5 - 0\").\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each entry for years and competitions where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal.

The \"goal\" column indicates this by listing the number of goals he scored in each match.\n\n2. **Determine Competition Type**: Check whether the competition listed is an international competition. Generally, friendly matches and major tournaments like World Cup qualifiers or the FIFA World Cup itself are considered international competitions.\n\n3. **Check for Losses**: We need to identify if any of these matches resulted in a loss for Mexico. A match result where the opponent's score is greater than Mexico's indicates a loss.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (goal: 1)**:\n  - Competition: 1999 Carlsberg Cup\n  - Result: 3 - 0\n  - Since Mexico won, this does not indicate a loss.\n\n- **Row 2 (goal: 2)**:\n  - Competition: 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n  - Result: 4 - 0\n  - Since Mexico won, this does not indicate a loss.\n\n- **Row 3 (goal: 3)**:\n  - Competition: 2002 World Cup Qualifier\n  - Result: 7 - 1\n  - Since Mexico lost, we note that this is one match where M\u00e1rquez scored and Mexico lost.\n\n- **Row 4 (goal: 4)**:\n  - Competition: Friendly\n  - Result: 2 - 1\n  - This is not an international competition as it's a friendly match.\n\n- **Row 5 (goal: 5)**:\n  - Competition: 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n  - Result: 2 - 0\n  - Since Mexico won, this does not indicate a loss.\n\n- **Row 6 (goal: 6)**:\n  - Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualifier\n  - Result: 3 - 0\n  - Since Mexico won, this does not indicate a loss.\n\n- **Row 7 (goal: 7)**:\n  - Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualifier\n  - Result: 5 - 0\n  - Since Mexico lost, we note that this is another match where M\u00e1rquez scored and Mexico lost.\n\n- **Row 8 (goal: 8)**:\n  - Competition: 2006 FIFA World Cup\n  - Result: 1 - 2 (aet)\n  - Since Mexico lost, we note this as another loss when M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\n- **Row 9 (goal: 9)**:\n  - Competition: Friendly\n  - Result: 4 - 2\n  - This is not an international competition as it's a friendly match.\n\n- **Row 10 (goal: 10)**:\n  - Competition: 2010 World Cup Qualifier\n  - Result: 2 - 1\n  - Since Mexico won, this does not indicate a loss.\n\n- **Row 11 (goal: 11)**:\n  - Competition: 2010 FIFA World Cup\n  - Result: 1 - 1\n  - This is a draw, not a loss.\n\n- **Row 12 (goal: 12)**:\n  - Competition: 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n  - Result: 4 - 1\n  - Since Mexico won, this does not indicate a loss.\n\n- **Row 13 (goal: 13)**:\n  - Competition: Friendly\n  - Result: 4 - 2\n  - This is not an international competition as it's a friendly match.\n\nFrom the analysis, we identified three losses in international competitions when M\u00e1rquez scored:\n\n1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in international competitions during the year 2000 is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that in 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions.\n   - We need to identify if there are entries for the year 2000 where he scored multiple goals in a single match.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We focus on rows where the \"date\" falls within the year 2000.\n\n3. **Examine Each Entry from 2000**:\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Date: 13 February 2000\n     - Score: 1 - 0\n     - Result: 4 - 0\n     - Competition: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup\n     - M\u00e1rquez's goals are part of the total result (4 - 0). The \"score\" shows he scored one goal, contributing to a multiple-goal game.\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Date: 3 September 2000\n     - Score: 5 - 1\n     - Result: 7 - 1\n     - Competition: 2002 World Cup Qualifier\n     - M\u00e1rquez's goals are part of the total result (7 - 1). The \"score\" shows he scored one goal, contributing to a multiple-goal game.\n\n4. **Determine if More Than One Goal Was Scored in Any Match**:\n   - In both matches listed for 2000, Rafael M\u00e1rquez is credited with scoring one goal each time.\n   - There is no entry where he scores more than one goal in a single match during the year 2000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that he scored more than one goal in at least one match in 2000, but this is not supported by the data.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for matches in the year 2000.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez's performance in international competitions during specific years (2001, 2009, or 2012) is true or false, we must analyze the provided table for any goals scored by him during these years.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not remain scoreless (i.e., he scored at least one goal) in international competitions during 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\n2. **Examine Each Year Individually:**\n\n   - **For 2001:**\n     - Look through the table for any entries where the \"date\" falls within 2001.\n     - The table does not have any entry with a date in the year 2001, meaning there is no record of him scoring or playing in an international competition that year.\n\n   - **For 2009:**\n     - Look through the table for any entries where the \"date\" falls within 2009.\n     - The closest entries are on 28 March 2007 and 10 September 2008. There is no entry for 2009, indicating there was no recorded goal or game in that year.\n\n   - **For 2012:**\n     - Look through the table for any entries where the \"date\" falls within 2012.\n     - The closest entries are on 30 October 2013 and 11 June 2010. There is no entry for 2012, indicating there was no recorded goal or game in that year.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - Since there are no table entries for the years 2001, 2009, or 2012, we cannot find any evidence of Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring during these specific years.\n   - The absence of records implies he did not score in international competitions during those years.\n\n4. **Determine Truth Value:**\n   - The claim states that he \"did not remain scoreless,\" which means he must have scored at least one goal.\n   - As there is no evidence of him scoring during these years, the statement is false because we cannot confirm that he did not remain scoreless; rather, it appears he did.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim asserts Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in international competitions during 2001, 2009, or 2012.

These are the matches in which Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored:\n     - Goal 1 on 5 February 1999\n     - Goal 2 on 13 February 2000\n     - Goal 3 on 3 September 2000\n     - Goal 4 on 12 May 2002\n     - Goal 5 on 24 July 2003\n     - Goal 6 on 19 June 2004\n     - Goal 7 on 7 September 2005\n     - Goal 8 on 24 June 2006\n     - Goal 9 on 28 March 2007\n     - Goal 10 on 10 September 2008\n     - Goal 11 on 12 June 2011\n     - Goal 12 on 30 October 2013\n\n2. **Determine the Result of Each Match:**\n   - For each identified goal, check the `result` column to see if Mexico won, lost, or drew:\n     - Goal 1: Result is 3 - 0 (Win)\n     - Goal 2: Result is 4 - 0 (Win)\n     - Goal 3: Result is 7 - 1 (Win)\n     - Goal 4: Result is 2 - 1 (Win)\n     - Goal 5: Result is 2 - 0 (Win)\n     - Goal 6: Result is 3 - 0 (Win)\n     - Goal 7: Result is 5 - 0 (Win)\n     - Goal 8: Result is 1 - 2 (aet) (Loss)\n     - Goal 9: Result is 4 - 2 (Win)\n     - Goal 11: Result is 1 - 1 (Draw)\n     - Goal 12: Result is 4 - 1 (Win)\n\n3. **Count the Number of Losses in International Competitions:**\n   - We focus on matches that are part of an \"international competition\" as per the `competition` column. The competitions listed include:\n     - 1999 Carlsberg Cup\n     - 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n     - 2002 World Cup Qualifier\n     - 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n     - 2006 World Cup Qualifier\n     - 2006 FIFA World Cup\n     - 2010 World Cup Qualifier\n     - 2010 FIFA World Cup\n     - 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n\n   - Check for losses in these competitions:\n     - Goal 8 (24 June 2006): Result is 1 - 2 (aet) and competition is the 2006 FIFA World Cup (Loss)\n     - No other matches listed as a loss.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Mexico lost only once when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in an international competition.\n   - There is no record of a second loss under these conditions.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified matches where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored and checked the results.
