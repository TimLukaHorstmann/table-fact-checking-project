    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the 2 round match held in South Dakota, United States, the opponent's name be Brian Dunn\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant information from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Held in South Dakota:**\n   - We first locate all entries where the location includes \"South Dakota, United States.\"\n\n2. **Check for 2-Round Matches:**\n   - From the matches identified as held in South Dakota, we then check if they were completed in 2 rounds.\n\n3. **Verify Opponent's Name:**\n   - Finally, from the list of 2-round matches held in South Dakota, we need to confirm if Brian Dunn was the opponent.\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n- **Row Identification for Location \"South Dakota, United States\":**\n\n  - Row with record `10 - 6 - 1`:\n    - Opponent: Hank Weis\n    - Method: Submission (guillotine choke)\n    - Event: Kickdown - Sturgis\n    - Round: 1\n    - Location: South Dakota, United States\n\n  - Row with record `5 - 1 - 1`:\n    - Opponent: Brian Dunn\n    - Method: Submission (rear naked choke)\n    - Event: MSF - Total Destruction\n    - Round: 2\n    - Location: South Dakota, United States\n\n- **Verification of Conditions:**\n\n  - The only match held in \"South Dakota, United States\" that is a 2-round match involves the opponent Brian Dunn.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim matches the condition found in the table. There is indeed a 2-round match held in South Dakota with the opponent being Brian Dunn.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all matches held in 'South Dakota, United States.'
