We need to find all rows in the table where the \"government\" column mentions \"cumann na ngaedheal\".\n\n2. **Check for 27.0% Vote Share**:\n   - Locate rows with a \"share of votes\" value of \"27.0%\".\n   - From the table, we see that the row for the election year \"1927 (jun)\" has a \"share of votes\" of \"27.0%\".\n\n3. **Check for 46 Seats**:\n   - In the same row (\"1927 (jun)\"), check if the \"seats\" column is \"46\".\n   - The table confirms that there are indeed \"46\" seats in this row.\n\n4. **Verify the D\u00e1il Number**:\n   - Check if the \"d\u00e1il\" column for the \"1927 (jun)\" election year indicates it as the \"4th\" D\u00e1il.\n   - The table shows that the \"d\u00e1il\" number is actually \"5th\" for this row.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the \"cumann na ngaedheal government\" did receive 27.0% of votes and hold 46 seats, these correspond to the 5th D\u00e1il, not the 4th.\n   - Therefore, the claim that these figures pertain to the 4th D\u00e1il is incorrect.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row for \"1923\": \n  - election: \"1923\", d\u00e1il: \"4th\", government: \"cumann na ngaedheal government\"\n- Row for \"1927 (jun)\":\n  - election: \"1927 (jun)\", share of votes: \"27.0%\", seats: \"46\", d\u00e1il: \"5th\", government: \"cumann na ngaedheal government\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the cumann na ngaedheal government gained 27.0% of the vote, held 46 seats, and this was during the 4th D\u00e1il.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 6th D\u00e1il share of vote be 30.1%\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim refers to the 6th D\u00e1il. We need to find the row in the table that corresponds to the 6th D\u00e1il.\n   - From the table, we see:\n     - The first row has \"4th\" under the 'd\u00e1il' column.\n     - The second row has \"5th\".\n     - The third row has \"6th\".\n\n2. **Locate the Share of Votes for the 6th D\u00e1il:**\n   - Once we identify the row with the 6th D\u00e1il, we need to look at the 'share of votes' column for that specific row.\n   - For the 6th D\u00e1il (third row), the 'share of votes' is listed as \"38.7%\".\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the share of vote for the 6th D\u00e1il should be \"30.1%\".\n   - From our analysis, the actual share of votes for the 6th D\u00e1il is \"38.7%\", not \"30.1%\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"38.7%\" does not equal \"30.1%\", the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that for the 6th D\u00e1il, the share of votes is 38.7%.
