The lowest home team score on that date is 4.17 (41).\n2. The highest home team score on that date is 13.18 (96).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how to verify this:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Date\nThe claim specifies the date as 15 August 1908. All entries in the table are for this date, so we consider all rows.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Home Team Scores\nWe need to look at the \"home team score\" column for each row:\n- Row 1 (University): 13.18 (96)\n- Row 2 (St Kilda): 4.7 (31)\n- Row 3 (South Melbourne): 5.8 (38)\n- Row 4 (Melbourne): 4.8 (32)\n- Row 5 (Richmond): 4.17 (41)\n\n### Step 3: Convert Scores to a Comparable Format\nThe scores are given in two formats: numerical and AFL points format (e.g., 13.18 = 13 goals and 18 behinds). To compare them, we use the numerical values:\n- University: 96\n- St Kilda: 31\n- South Melbourne: 38\n- Melbourne: 32\n- Richmond: 41\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Lowest and Highest Scores\n- **Lowest Score**: Among the numerical scores (96, 31, 38, 32, 41), the lowest is 31 (St Kilda).\n- **Highest Score**: The highest score is 96 (University).\n\n### Step 5: Verify Against the Claim\n- The claim states the lowest home team score is 4.17 (41). However, we found that the lowest numerical score is 4.7 (31) for St Kilda.\n- The claim correctly identifies the highest home team score as 13.18 (96) for University.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is partially correct: it accurately states the highest score but incorrectly identifies the lowest score.
