    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify two main components from the provided data:\n\n1. **Identify games ending by a rear naked choke submission:**\n   - We will look through the \"method\" column for entries that mention \"submission (rear naked choke).\"\n\n2. **Check if the game against Kori Trussell was one of these and confirm its round count:**\n   - Verify the details in the record corresponding to Kori Trussell, particularly focusing on the \"round\" and \"time.\"\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Locate rear naked choke submissions:**\n\n   From the table:\n   - Row 4 (Mark Sinclair): Method is \"submission (rear naked choke).\" Time is 1:22. Round is 1.\n   - Row 5 (Kori Trussell): Method is \"submission (rear naked choke).\" Time is 2:20. Round is 1.\n\n   We have identified two games ending by a rear naked choke submission, occurring in rows 4 and 5.\n\n2. **Check the game against Kori Trussell:**\n\n   - From Row 5:\n     - Record: \"1 - 0\"\n     - Opponent: \"kori trussell\"\n     - Method: \"submission (rear naked choke)\"\n     - Round: \"1\"\n     - Time: \"2:20\"\n\n   The game against Kori Trussell ended by a rear naked choke submission, but it was in round 1, not round 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that the game against Kori Trussell is one of two games ending with a rear naked choke submission and occurred in \"round 3.\" While it is true that this game is one of two submissions by a rear naked choke, it did not occur in round 3; instead, it was in round 1. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nHere's how we format the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified all games that ended with 'submission (rear naked choke)' as two: against Mark Sinclair and Kori Trussell.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Matches Lasting 3 Rounds\nThe claim states that there were 3 games lasting for 3 rounds. We will look at the \"round\" column in each row to find matches with a duration of 3 rounds.\n\n- **Row 1**: Round = 3\n- **Row 2**: Round = 3\n- **Row 3**: Round = 3\n\nThere are indeed three matches that lasted for 3 rounds: rows 1, 2, and 3.\n\n### Step 2: Check Locations of the Matches Lasting 3 Rounds\nThe claim further specifies that all these games occurred in \"Hammond, Indiana\". We will verify this by checking the \"location\" column for each of the identified rows.\n\n- **Row 1**: Location = \"hammond , indiana , united states\"\n- **Row 2**: Location = \"valparaiso , united states\"\n- **Row 3**: Location = \"hoffman estates , illinois , united states\"\n\nOnly row 1 matches the location \"Hammond, Indiana\". Rows 2 and 3 are located in Valparaiso, United States, and Hoffman Estates, Illinois, respectively.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is false because not all three games lasting for 3 rounds were held in Hammond, Indiana.
