Verify if Ted Appelman is listed under the \"third / vice skip\" column.\n\nLet's go through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Ted Appelman in the Table**:\n   - Search each row for a name matching \"Ted Appelman\".\n   - Ted Appelman is found in the 11th row (index 10, considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Verify Ted Appelman's Position**:\n   - In row 11, check the column \"third / vice skip\" to see if it contains \"Ted Appelman\". \n   - The cell at row index 10 and column \"third / vice skip\" is indeed filled with \"ted appelman\".\n\n3. **Locate Brendan Melnyk in the Table**:\n   - Search each row for a name matching \"Brendan Melnyk\".\n   - Brendan Melnyk is found in the 11th row (index 10).\n\n4. **Verify Brendan Melnyk's Position**:\n   - In row 11, check the column \"lead\" to see if it contains \"Brendan Melnyk\". \n   - The cell at row index 10 and column \"lead\" is filled with \"brendan melnyk\".\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- Ted Appelman is in the \"third / vice skip\" position.\n- Brendan Melnyk is in the \"lead\" position.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"Brendan Melnyk be lead and Ted Appelman be third / vice skip\" is TRUE based on the data provided in the table.
