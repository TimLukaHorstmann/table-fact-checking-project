Additionally, the venue is \"Punt Road Oval,\" which is exactly what we are looking for.\n\n3. **Analyze the Match Outcome**:\n   - In Row 3, Richmond scored 16.16 (112) points.\n   - Hawthorn scored 14.16 (100) points.\n   - Since Richmond's score (112) is greater than Hawthorn's score (100), Richmond defeated Hawthorn in this match.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that \"Richmond be unable to defeat Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval.\" However, the data shows that Richmond did indeed defeat Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3: \n  - Home Team: \"Richmond\"\n  - Away Team: \"Hawthorn\"\n  - Venue: \"Punt Road Oval\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"16.16 (112)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"14.16 (100)\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is about a match between Richmond and Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval where Richmond should have been unable to defeat Hawthorn.
