We will look at both Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards since they are mentioned in the table under the \"award ceremony\" column.\n\n2. **Check the Category**:\n   - For each award ceremony, identify entries where the \"category\" is \"best play.\"\n\n3. **Identify Nominee(s)**:\n   - For these categories, check who the nominee(s) are and see if they match \"reason to be pretty.\"\n\n4. **Count Nominations**:\n   - Determine how many times \"reason to be pretty\" appears as a nominee in the \"best play\" category.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"reason to be pretty\" was nominated for \"best play\" more than once.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's break down the task step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\n\nThe claim states:\n- Before 2009, \"Reason to Be Pretty\" was the only year it had a nominee at the Drama Desk Award ceremony.\n\nThis implies two things:\n1. In 2009, there were nominees for \"Reason to Be Pretty\" at the Drama Desk Awards.\n2. Prior to 2009, no other years should have \"Reason to Be Pretty\" as a nominee in the Drama Desk Awards.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Table\n\nThe table provides information about awards related to \"Reason to Be Pretty\" for the year 2009:\n\n- **Drama Desk Award Nominees in 2009**:\n  - Outstanding Play\n  - Outstanding Actor in a Play (Thomas Sadoski)\n  - Outstanding Director of a Play (Terry Kinney)\n\nFrom this, we can infer that \"Reason to Be Pretty\" had nominees at the Drama Desk Awards in 2009.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Claim\n\n1. **Check for 2009 Nominees**:\n   - The table confirms that there were nominees for \"Reason to Be Pretty\" at the Drama Desk Awards in 2009.\n   \n2. **Check for Pre-2009 Entries**:\n   - The table only includes data for the year 2009, so there are no entries before this year.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the information from the table, we have confirmed that \"Reason to Be Pretty\" had nominees at the Drama Desk Awards in 2009. Since the table does not provide any data prior to 2009, we cannot find evidence of any nominations before this year. Therefore, based on the available data, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table confirms that 'Reason to Be Pretty' had nominees at the Drama Desk Awards in 2009.
