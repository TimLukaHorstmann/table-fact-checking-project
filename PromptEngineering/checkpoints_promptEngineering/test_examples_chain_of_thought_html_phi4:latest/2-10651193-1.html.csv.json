    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the data in the table according to the criteria specified by the claim. Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that there is no player draft from Tennessee State with a rank lower than 261.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to find all players who attended Tennessee State.\n   - For each of these players, we will check their \"overall\" ranking in the draft.\n\n3. **Extract Information from the Table**:\n   - The table lists players along with their overall draft number, player name, position, and school/club team.\n   - We are specifically interested in the rows where the \"school / club team\" is \"tennessee state\".\n\n4. **Locate Relevant Entries**:\n   - By examining the table, identify entries where \"school / club team\" is \"tennessee state\".\n   - Check the corresponding \"overall\" draft number for these players.\n\n5. **Check the Claim Against Data**:\n   - The claim specifies that no player from Tennessee State should have a rank lower than 261.\n   - Verify if any entry has an \"overall\" number greater than 261 (which would mean it is ranked lower).\n\n6. **Analyze the Table**:\n   - In the table, we find one entry where the \"school / club team\" is \"tennessee state\":\n     - Row with \"player\": \"john henry smith\"\n     - \"overall\": 261\n     - This is exactly rank 261 and does not violate the claim since it is not lower than 261.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no entries from Tennessee State with an overall draft number greater than 261, the claim holds true.\n\n8. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this analysis are those in the row where \"school / club team\" is \"tennessee state\":\n     - Row index: 10\n     - Columns: \"overall\", \"player\", \"school / club team\"\n\nHere's the final answer formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no player from Tennessee State should be drafted with a rank lower than 261. We identified the relevant row where the school/club team is 'tennessee state'. In this row, the overall draft number is exactly 261, which does not violate the claim as it is not lower than 261.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
