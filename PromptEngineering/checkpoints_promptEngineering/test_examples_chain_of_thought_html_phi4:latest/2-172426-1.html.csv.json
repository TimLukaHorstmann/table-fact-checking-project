    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Princess Anne being one of three princesses on the list who have a divorce is true or false, we need to analyze the table for information related to marital status changes, such as multiple entries under \"date married\" or changes in \"husband dates.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are interested in rows where there might be more than one entry for \"date married\" and/or different \"husband dates,\" which could indicate a divorce and remarriage.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n\n   - **Row 1 (Mary, Princess Royal):** \n     - Single entry for \"date married\" (1641) and single entry for \"husband dates.\"\n     - No indication of divorce.\n\n   - **Row 2 (Anne, Princess Royal):**\n     - Single entry for \"date married\" (1734) and single entry for \"husband dates.\"\n     - No indication of divorce.\n\n   - **Row 3 (Charlotte, Princess Royal):**\n     - Single entry for \"date married\" (1797) and single entry for \"husband dates.\"\n     - No indication of divorce.\n\n   - **Row 4 (Victoria, Princess Royal):**\n     - Single entry for \"date married\" (1858) and single entry for \"husband dates.\"\n     - No indication of divorce.\n\n   - **Row 5 (Louise, Princess Royal):**\n     - Single entry for \"date married\" (1889) and single entry for \"husband dates.\"\n     - No indication of divorce.\n\n   - **Row 6 (Mary, Princess Royal):**\n     - Single entry for \"date married\" (1922) and single entry for \"husband dates.\"\n     - No indication of divorce.\n\n   - **Row 7 & 8 (Anne, Princess Royal):**\n     - Two entries:\n       - First entry: \"date married\" is a range from 1973 to 1992.\n       - Second entry starts with \"date married\" in 1992 and has different husband dates (\"mark phillips 1948 -\" and \"sir timothy laurence 1955 -\").\n     - This indicates that Princess Anne was first married to Mark Phillips, then divorced, and remarried Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Divorces:**\n   - Only Princess Anne (Row 7 & 8) shows evidence of a divorce due to two separate entries for marriage dates and different husbands.\n   - No other princess in the table has multiple entries indicating a change in marital status.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Princess Anne is one of three princesses on the list who have a divorce. However, only Princess Anne shows evidence of having divorced.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false as there are not three but only one princess with a divorce indicated by the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Princess Anne (Row 7 & 8) has two separate entries for marriage dates and different husbands, indicating a divorce.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Princess Mary of Charles I died before she turned 25\" is true or false, we need to extract and analyze relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We are concerned with Princess Mary who was the daughter of Charles I. In the table, this corresponds to row 1.\n\n2. **Extract Birth and Death Years:**\n   - From the row for Princess Mary:\n     - \"name dates\" cell gives her lifespan as \"1631 - 1660\".\n     - This indicates she was born in 1631 and died in 1660.\n\n3. **Calculate Age at Death:**\n   - To find out how old she was when she died, subtract the birth year from the death year:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Age at death} = 1660 - 1631 = 29\n     \\]\n   - Princess Mary was 29 years old when she passed away.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Princess Mary died before she turned 25\". Based on our calculation, she lived to be 29, which means she did not die before turning 25.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The analysis of the relevant data shows that Princess Mary lived longer than 25 years.
