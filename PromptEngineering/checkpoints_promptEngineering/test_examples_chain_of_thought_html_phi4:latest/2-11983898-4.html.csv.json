    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date**: The claim mentions a game on April 29, 2012. We need to find this date in the \"date\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Check Opponent**: Once the row with the correct date is identified, verify if the \"opponent in the final\" is listed as Gilles Simon (note the spelling difference between \"giles\" and \"Gilles\").\n\n3. **Verify Outcome**: Check the \"outcome\" for this specific entry to ensure it matches the claim of being a \"runner-up\".\n\nNow, let's go through these steps with the table:\n\n1. **Locate the Date**:\n   - The first row in the table has the date as \"29 April 2012\". This matches the date mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Check Opponent**:\n   - In this row, the \"opponent in the final\" is listed as \"gilles simon\". Despite the lowercase 'g' in the claim (\"giles\"), it corresponds to Gilles Simon with a minor spelling difference (missing capitalization).\n\n3. **Verify Outcome**:\n   - The \"outcome\" for this entry is \"runner-up\", which matches exactly what is stated in the claim.\n\nBased on these steps, all parts of the claim are verified against the table data:\n\n- The date matches.\n- The opponent matches with a minor spelling difference that does not affect identity.\n- The outcome is correctly identified as \"runner-up\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
