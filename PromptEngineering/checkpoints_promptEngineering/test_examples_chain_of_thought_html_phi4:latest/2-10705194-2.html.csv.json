    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the record of jeremija sanders' opponent be 8 - 4\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided in the table. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Match Involving Jeremija Sanders:**\n   - We look for a row where \"Jeremija Sanders\" appears under the opponent column.\n   - From the table, we find that Jeremija Sanders is listed as an opponent in the match result with \"loss\" and at \"row index 7\".\n\n2. **Check Jeremija Sanders' Record:**\n   - In this row (index 7), we see that Jeremija Sanders' record before the fight was noted as \"7 - 2\".\n   - This means that prior to fighting the subject of this record, Jeremija Sanders had a record of seven wins and two losses.\n\n3. **Determine Record After the Fight:**\n   - Since Jeremija Sanders lost in this match (the subject won), we need to update his record by adding one loss.\n   - Adding one loss to the prior record \"7 - 2\" results in a new record of \"7 wins and 3 losses\", or \"7 - 3\".\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Record:**\n   - The claim states that Jeremija Sanders' record should be \"8 - 4\".\n   - However, based on our calculations from the table data, his updated record is \"7 - 3\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"7 - 3\" does not match the claimed \"8 - 4\", the claim is false.\n\nThe reasoning steps and conclusion lead us to the following JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
