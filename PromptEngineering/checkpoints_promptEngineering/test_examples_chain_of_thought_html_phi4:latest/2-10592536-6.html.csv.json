Check if Mark Hughes is listed as the manager for that particular team.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the provided HTML table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Team with \"bet 24\" Sponsor:**\n   - Look through each row in the table to find where \"bet 24\" appears under the `shirt sponsor` column.\n   - In the table, we see:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>blackburn rovers</td>\n       <td>mark hughes</td>\n       <td>ryan nelsen</td>\n       <td>umbro</td>\n       <td>bet 24</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n   - This indicates that \"Blackburn Rovers\" has \"bet 24\" as their shirt sponsor.\n\n2. **Verify the Manager for Blackburn Rovers:**\n   - Now, check if Mark Hughes is listed as the manager for Blackburn Rovers.\n   - In the same row identified above:\n     ```html\n     <td>mark hughes</td>\n     ```\n   - This confirms that Mark Hughes is indeed the manager of Blackburn Rovers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied: \"bet 24\" is the shirt sponsor for Blackburn Rovers, and Mark Hughes is their manager. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo support this conclusion, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n- The team with \"bet 24\" as a shirt sponsor (Row Index: 3, Column Name: `shirt sponsor`)\n- The manager of that team (Row Index: 3, Column Name: `manager`)\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row where 'bet 24' appears under the shirt sponsor column.
