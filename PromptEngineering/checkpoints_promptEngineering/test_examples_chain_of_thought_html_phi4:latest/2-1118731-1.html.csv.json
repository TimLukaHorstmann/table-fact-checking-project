    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the specific row related to the 1972 engine and check if the power value is not provided.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim refers to the \"1972\" year in the 'years' column.\n   - Locate this entry within the table's rows.\n\n2. **Examine Power Column**:\n   - For the row corresponding to 1972, check the value under the 'power' column.\n   - According to the table structure given: \n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>i</td>\n       <td>1972</td>\n       <td>455in cubic oldsmobile v8</td>\n       <td>-</td>\n       <td>n /a</td>\n       <td>4bbl carburetor</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n3. **Interpret the Power Value**:\n   - The 'power' column for the 1972 engine shows a value of \"-\".\n   - This indicates that the power is not specified, as \"-\" typically denotes missing or unavailable data.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - The claim states \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\".\n   - Since the power information for the 1972 engine is indeed missing (as indicated by \"-\"), this aligns with what the claim describes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table confirms that no power value is provided for the 1972 engine, making the claim true based on available data.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell information needed to verify the claim includes:\n     - Row index: 2 (assuming a zero-based index)\n     - Column name: 'power'\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row for the year 1972 in the table shows a '-' under the 'power' column, indicating that no power value is given. This matches the claim that the power of the 1972 engine is not provided in hp (kw). Therefore, the claim is true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"power\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
