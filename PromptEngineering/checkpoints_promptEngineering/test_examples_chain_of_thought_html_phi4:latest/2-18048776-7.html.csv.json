    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Vijay Singh winning the 1998 PGA Championship by finishing 9 under par, 2 strokes ahead of Steve Stricker, is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Vijay Singh's Performance:**\n   - Locate Vijay Singh in the table.\n   - According to the table, Vijay Singh's performance is:\n     - Place: 1\n     - Score: 70 + 66 + 67 + 68 = 271\n     - To Par: 9\n     - Money: $540,000\n\n2. **Identify Steve Stricker's Performance:**\n   - Locate Steve Stricker in the table.\n   - According to the table, Steve Stricker's performance is:\n     - Place: 2\n     - Score: 69 + 68 + 66 + 70 = 273\n     - To Par: 7\n     - Money: $324,000\n\n3. **Calculate Stroke Difference:**\n   - Compare Vijay Singh's total score (271) with Steve Stricker's total score (273).\n   - The difference in strokes is \\(273 - 271 = 2\\) strokes.\n\n4. **Verify 'To Par' Information:**\n   - Check that Vijay Singh finished 9 under par, which matches the table data.\n   - Verify that Steve Stricker finished 7 under par, as stated in the table.\n\n5. **Determine Championship Outcome:**\n   - Since Vijay Singh is listed first (Place: 1) and has a lower total score than Steve Stricker, he indeed won the championship.\n   - The claim states that Vijay Singh was \"2 strokes in front of Steve Stricker,\" which aligns with our calculation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- All parts of the claim are verified by the table data:\n  - Vijay Singh finished 9 under par.\n  - He won by finishing 2 strokes ahead of Steve Stricker.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Vijay Singh's performance: Place = 1, Score = 271, To Par = 9.\",\n    \"Identify Steve Stricker's performance: Place = 2, Score = 273, To Par = 7.\",\n    \"Calculate stroke difference between them: 273 - 271 = 2 strokes.\",\n    \"Verify 'To Par' information matches the claim: Singh is 9 under par; Stricker is 7 under par.\",\n    \"Confirm Vijay Singh won by finishing first and with a 2-stroke lead over Steve Stricker.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

For four rounds, this would be:\n\\[ \\text{Par for the Course} = 4 \\times 72 = 288 \\]\n\n- Vijay Singh's total score: 271\n\nCalculate his score relative to par:\n\\[ \\text{To Par} = \\text{Total Score} - \\text{Course Par} = 271 - 288 = -17 \\]\n\nThe \"to par\" value in the table is given as 9. This represents how many strokes over or under par Vijay Singh was compared to a typical professional's expectation (or adjusted for this specific tournament), not his actual score relative to course par.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Margin of Victory\n- **Relevant Data**:\n  - Steve Elkington's Score: 274\n  - To Par: 6\n\nCalculate the difference in scores between Vijay Singh and Steve Elkington:\n\\[ \\text{Score Difference} = 274 - 271 = 3 \\]\n\nThe claim states a victory margin of \"2 strokes,\" but the actual score difference is 3 strokes.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Vijay Singh did win the tournament.\n- He finished 17 under par, not 2 under par, based on the course par calculation. The table's \"to par\" value likely reflects a different context or adjusted scoring system for professional tournaments.\n- He won by 3 strokes over Steve Elkington, not 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false due to incorrect statements about his score relative to par and the margin of victory.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Vijay Singh is listed as the winner in the table.
