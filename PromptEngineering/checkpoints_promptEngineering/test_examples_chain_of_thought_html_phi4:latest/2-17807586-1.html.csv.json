Therefore, only entries within these years need consideration.\n  \n2. **Locate Matthew Silver's Entries**:\n   - Examine the \"winners\" column for mentions of Matthew Silver.\n   - From the table:\n     - In 2007: `aune mitchell & matthew silver (ct)` \n     - In 2011: `alex li & jackson smylie (on)` with no mention of Matthew Silver.\n\n3. **Locate Thomas Bao's Entries**:\n   - Examine the \"winners\" column for mentions of Thomas Bao.\n   - From the table:\n     - In 2004: `thomas bao & eric johnston (ca)`\n\n4. **Count Wins for Each Individual**:\n   - Matthew Silver appears once as a winner in 2007.\n   - Thomas Bao appears once as a winner in 2004.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states both Matthew Silver and Thomas Bao each won twice from 2003 to 2013.\n   - However, based on our findings:\n     - Matthew Silver has 1 win (in 2007).\n     - Thomas Bao has 1 win (in 2004).\n\nThe evidence shows that neither individual won the championship twice within the specified timeframe.
