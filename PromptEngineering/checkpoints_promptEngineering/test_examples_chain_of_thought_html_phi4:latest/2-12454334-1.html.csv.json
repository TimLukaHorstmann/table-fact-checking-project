    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states there are 2 class B stations with a frequency of 91.1 FM.\n\n2. **Identify Class B Stations**:\n   - We need to locate all entries in the table where the \"class\" column is 'b'.\n\n3. **Check Frequencies for Class B Stations**:\n   - For each identified Class B station, check its frequency in the \"frequency\" column.\n   \n4. **Count How Many Class B Stations Have 91.1 FM Frequency**:\n   - Count how many of these stations have a frequency of 91.1 FM.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n- **Locate Class B Entries**: \n  - Look at each row and check if the \"class\" column is 'b'.\n\n- **Row Analysis**:\n  1. Row 1: Call sign WMHI, class A.\n  2. Row 2: Call sign WMHN, class A.\n  3. Row 3: Call sign WMHQ, class A.\n  4. Row 4: Call sign WMHR, class B.\n     - Frequency is 102.9 FM.\n  5. Row 5: Call sign WMHU, class A.\n\n- **Count Class B with 91.1 FM**:\n  - Only one station (Row 4) is of class B, and its frequency is 102.9 FM, not 91.1 FM.\n  - There are no stations of class B with a frequency of 91.1 FM.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim states there are 2 Class B stations with a frequency of 91.1 FM.\n- We found only one Class B station (Row 4) with a different frequency (102.9 FM).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim asserts there are 2 class B stations with a frequency of 91.1 FM.\",\n    \"Identify all entries in the table where the 'class' column is 'b'.\",\n    \"For each identified Class B station, check its frequency in the 'frequency' column.\",\n    \"Count how many of these Class B stations have a frequency of 91.1 FM.\",\n    \"There is only one Class B station with a frequency of 102.9 FM.\",\n    \"No Class B stations have a frequency of 91.1 FM.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\", \"value\": \"b\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\", \"value\": \"102.9 fm\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
