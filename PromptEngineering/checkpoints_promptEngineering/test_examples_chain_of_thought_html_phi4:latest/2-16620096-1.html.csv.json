From 15 June 1977 to 16 July 1979 is an additional 2 years and about 1 month.\n     - Total Duration: Approximately 5 years and 1 month.\n\n   - **\u00c9mile Krieps (Second Term)**\n     - Start Date: 16 July 1979\n     - End Date: 20 July 1984\n     - Duration: From 16 July 1979 to 16 July 1982 is 3 years. From 16 July 1982 to 20 July 1984 is an additional 2 years and about 4 days.\n     - Total Duration: Approximately 5 years and 4 days.\n\n   - **Marc Fischbach**\n     - Start Date: 20 July 1984\n     - End Date: 14 July 1989\n     - Duration: From 20 July 1984 to 20 July 1987 is 3 years. From 20 July 1987 to 14 July 1989 is an additional almost 2 years.\n     - Total Duration: Approximately 4 years and 11 months.\n\n   - **Jacques Poos**\n     - Start Date: 14 July 1989\n     - End Date: 13 July 1994\n     - Duration: From 14 July 1989 to 14 July 1992 is 3 years. From 14 July 1992 to 13 July 1994 is an additional almost 2 years.\n     - Total Duration: Approximately 5 years.\n\n   - **Alex Bodry (First Term)**\n     - Start Date: 13 July 1994\n     - End Date: 26 January 1995\n     - Duration: From 13 July 1994 to 13 July 1997 would be 3 years, but the term ends on 26 January 1995.\n     - Total Duration: Approximately 10 months.\n\n   - **Alex Bodry (Second Term)**\n     - Start Date: 26 January 1995\n     - End Date: 7 August 1999\n     - Duration: From 26 January 1995 to 26 January 1998 is 3 years. From 26 January 1998 to 7 August 1999 is an additional almost 1 year and about 6 months.\n     - Total Duration: Approximately 4 years and 6 months.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: None of the ministers served exactly a 3-year term. Each minister's duration varies, with some serving significantly more or less than 3 years.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Calculated each minister's term based on their start and end dates.
