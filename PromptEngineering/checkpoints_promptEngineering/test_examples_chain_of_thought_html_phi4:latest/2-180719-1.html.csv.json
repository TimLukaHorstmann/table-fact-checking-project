    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Eurovision Song Contest results is true or false, we need to examine the table for information on placement and points received by each entry. The claim specifically addresses the point difference between the first place winner and the runner-up (second place) in 1961.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify First Place Winner:**\n   - We look at the \"place\" column to find which song finished in 1st place.\n   - According to row 14, Jean-Claude Pascal with the song \"Nous les amoureux\" placed first.\n\n2. **Determine Points for First Place:**\n   - In row 14 of the table under the \"points\" column, we see that the first-place winner received 31 points.\n\n3. **Identify Runner-Up (Second Place):**\n   - We continue to examine the \"place\" column to find which song finished in 2nd place.\n   - Row 15 shows The Allisons with the song \"Are You Sure?\" placed second.\n\n4. **Determine Points for Second Place:**\n   - In row 15 under the \"points\" column, we see that the runner-up received 24 points.\n\n5. **Calculate Point Difference:**\n   - Subtract the points of the second-place entry from those of the first-place entry to determine the difference:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 31 - 24 = 7\n     \\]\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there is \"only a small point difference\" between the winner and the runner-up.\n   - A point difference of 7 can be considered relatively small in many competitive settings, particularly when compared to the total number of possible points (up to 31 in this contest).\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- The first-place winner received 31 points.\n- The second-place finisher received 24 points.\n- The point difference is 7.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the claim about the small point difference between the winner and runner-up is **TRUE**. \n\nRelevant cells from the table for this analysis include those with row indices 14 and 15 in both the \"place\" and \"points\" columns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identified that Jean-Claude Pascal was first place with 31 points (row 14). The runner-up was The Allisons with 24 points (row 15). Calculating the point difference gives us 7 points.
