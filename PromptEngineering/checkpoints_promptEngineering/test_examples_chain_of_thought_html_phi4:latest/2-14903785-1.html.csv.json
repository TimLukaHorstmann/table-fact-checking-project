    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table for the year 2003 across specific columns: men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Let's break down each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Men's Doubles in 2003**:\n   - We locate the row for the year 2003.\n   - Under the \"men 's doubles\" column, it states \"no competition\".\n   - This confirms that there was no competition for men's doubles in 2003.\n\n2. **Women's Doubles in 2003**:\n   - Again, using the row for 2003 and checking under the \"women 's doubles\" column.\n   - It also states \"no competition\".\n   - This confirms that there was no competition for women's doubles in 2003.\n\n3. **Mixed Doubles in 2003**:\n   - We check the \"mixed doubles\" column for the year 2003.\n   - The cell contains \"no competition\".\n   - This indicates that there was no mixed doubles competition, and therefore Edgar Eremian did not play in this category.\n\nThe claim states that \"edgar eremian play in the mixed double\" in 2003. However, since there was no mixed doubles competition that year, Edgar Eremian could not have participated.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because while it correctly identifies the lack of competitions for men's and women's doubles, it incorrectly states that Edgar Eremian played in mixed doubles when there was no event held.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Men's Doubles (2003): Row index 7, Column \"men 's doubles\"\n- Women's Doubles (2003): Row index 7, Column \"women 's doubles\"\n- Mixed Doubles (2003): Row index 7, Column \"mixed doubles\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. For the year 2003, under 'men 's doubles', it states 'no competition'.\\n2. Under 'women 's doubles' for 2003, it also states 'no competition'.\\n3. In the 'mixed doubles' column for 2003, it indicates 'no competition'.\\n4. The claim incorrectly asserts that Edgar Eremian played in mixed doubles in a year with no competition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
