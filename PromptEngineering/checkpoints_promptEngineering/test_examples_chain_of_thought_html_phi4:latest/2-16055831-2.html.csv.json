    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to carefully analyze the table data to verify whether there are three wins for the fighter in 1999 in Itapeua, Brazil.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Wins:**  \n   We first focus on rows where the \"result\" is \"win\". This helps us filter out only those records that count as victories.\n\n2. **Filter by Year (1999):**  \n   Among these winning entries, we further narrow down to those with the \"date\" column showing the year 1999.\n\n3. **Check Location:**  \n   We need to ensure that all filtered wins took place in \"Itapeua, Brazil\". This means checking the \"location\" column for each relevant row.\n\n4. **Count Wins in 1999 at Itapeua, Brazil:**  \n   Finally, count how many of these filtered records meet all criteria: win, year 1999, and location Itapeua, Brazil.\n\n### Applying Steps to the Table:\n\n- **Row Analysis:**\n  - **Row 1 (win):** Date is 1995, not 1999.\n  - **Row 2 (win):** Date is 1995, not 1999.\n  - **Row 3 (win):** Date is 1995, not 1999.\n  - **Row 4 (win):** Date is 1996, not 1999.\n  - **Row 5 (win):** Date is 1999, and location is Itapeua, Brazil. This row meets all criteria.\n  - **Rows 6 to 8:** These are losses, so they do not meet the win criterion.\n\n- **Count of Wins in 1999 at Itapeua, Brazil:**\n  - Only Row 5 matches all specified conditions (win, year 1999, location Itapeua, Brazil).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that there were three wins in 1999 at Itapeua, Brazil. However, only one such win is found in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We first identified all winning records from the table.
