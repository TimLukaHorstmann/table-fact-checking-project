The date column will help us find when the game occurred, and the week column will confirm which week this corresponds to.\n\n2. **Locate the row with the specific date**: Search for the row where the date is \"December 6, 1964\".\n\n3. **Check the corresponding week number**:\n   - Find the value in the \"week\" column of the identified row.\n   - Verify if it matches week 13.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim**: Determine if the information confirms or contradicts the claim.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Locate the date \"December 6, 1964\"**:\n  - We find this date in row 13 of the table.\n  \n- **Check the corresponding week number**:\n  - In row 13, under the column \"week\", the value is indeed \"13\".\n\nThe claim states that the game played on December 6, 1964, was during week 13.
