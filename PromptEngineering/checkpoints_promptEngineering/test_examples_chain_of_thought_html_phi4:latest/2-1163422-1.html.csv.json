    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Evansville Triplet baseball team is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the Team in Question**: The claim mentions \"evansville triplet baseball team\". We will locate this entry in the table:\n   - The row with `team` as \"evansville triplets\" corresponds to the Evansville Triplet baseball team.\n\n2. **Verify Class and League**:\n   - According to the table, the Evansville Triplets are classified as class \"aaa\".\n   - They played in the \"american association\", not the Three-I League.\n   \n3. **Check for Championships Mentioned**:\n   - The claim states that the team won championships in 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957. We need to verify if these championships are associated with the Evansville Triplets.\n   - From the table, the row for \"evansville braves\" lists championships for the years 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957 in the Three-I League.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim incorrectly associates the Evansville Triplet team with class AAA status in the Three-I League title championships of 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957.\n   - In fact, these titles were won by the \"evansville braves\" team, not the \"evansville triplets\".\n   - Furthermore, the Evansville Triplets played in a different league (American Association) as class AAA.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. \n\nHere's the structured reasoning and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The Evansville Triplet baseball team is found under 'evansville triplets' in the table.\",\n    \"The Evansville Triplets are classified as class AAA and played in the American Association league, not the Three-I League.\",\n    \"The championships for the years 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957 were won by the Evansville Braves in the Three-I League.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly associates the Evansville Triplets with achievements of another team.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
