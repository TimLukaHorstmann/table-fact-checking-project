It might refer to a person (Rupert Murdoch) rather than a location.\n   - **\"road to germany\"**: Germany is a country in Europe.\n   - **\"road to the multiverse\"**: The term \"multiverse\" refers to multiple universes and does not correspond to any real-world geographic category.\n   - **\"road to the north pole\"**: The North Pole is a polar region, which could be considered a geographic location.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that all episodes have a \"different geographic category mention in the title.\"\n   - From our analysis:\n     - Titles like \"road to rhode island,\" \"road to europe,\" and \"road to germany\" clearly specify known geographic categories (state, continent, country).\n     - \"road to rupert\" does not fit a typical geographic category as it likely refers to a person.\n     - \"road to the multiverse\" refers to a concept outside real-world geography.\n     - \"road to the north pole\" could be considered a specific location in terms of polar regions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The titles do not all include different geographic categories since \"road to rupert\" and \"road to the multiverse\" do not fit conventional geographic categories like state, country, or continent.\n\nTherefore, based on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each episode title was analyzed for a geographic location.
