Since the home team Collingwood has a higher score than the away team Geelong, Geelong lost this game.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Richmond, as an away team, won its game against Fitzroy.\n   - Geelong, as an away team, lost its game against Collingwood.\n\n5. **Final Assessment of the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that both Richmond and Geelong won their games as away teams on May 27th. However, while Richmond did win, Geelong did not. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's summarize this in a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim involves checking if Richmond and Geelong, both as away teams, won their games on May 27th.\",\n    \"For Richmond: They played against Fitzroy at Junction Oval.
