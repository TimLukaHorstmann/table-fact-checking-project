The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Bob Rule's High Points**: \n   - We need to examine each game entry and check if Bob Rule was the \"high points\" player.\n   - For each instance of Bob Rule being the high scorer, note his score.\n\n2. **Record Bob Rule's Scores**:\n   - Game 10: Bob Rule scored 27 points.\n   - Game 16: Bob Rule scored 29 points.\n   - Game 19: Bob Rule scored 27 points.\n   - Game 20: Bob Rule scored 47 points.\n   - Game 21: Bob Rule scored 26 points.\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Score by Bob Rule**:\n   - The scores recorded for Bob Rule are 27, 29, 27, 47, and 26.\n   - The highest score among these is 47 points (from game 20).\n\n4. **Compare with Other Players' High Points**:\n   - We need to check if any other player scored more than 47 points in a single game during the season.\n   - Review each \"high points\" entry for all players across the games.\n\n5. **Review All High Points Entries**:\n   - Game 9: Al Tucker scored 23 points.\n   - Game 10: Bob Rule scored 27 points.\n   - Game 11: Walt Hazzard scored 19 points.\n   - Game 12: Bob Weiss scored 20 points.\n   - Game 13: Walt Hazzard scored 20 points.\n   - Game 14: Walt Hazzard scored 33 points.\n   - Game 15: Walt Hazzard scored 26 points.\n   - Game 16: Bob Weiss scored 27 points.\n   - Game 17: Three players scored 20 points each (not a single highest score).\n   - Game 18: Walt Hazzard scored 19 points.\n   - Game 19: Bob Weiss scored 27 points.\n   - Game 20: Bob Rule scored 47 points.\n   - Game 21: Bob Rule scored 26 points.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The highest score by any player in a single game is 47 points, achieved by Bob Rule in game 20.\n   - No other player has a higher individual high point total than 47 in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"Bob Rule in the 1967-68 Seattle Supersonics season had the highest high points\" is true.
