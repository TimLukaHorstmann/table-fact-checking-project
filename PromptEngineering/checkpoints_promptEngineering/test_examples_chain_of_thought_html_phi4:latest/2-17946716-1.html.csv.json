Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Week 3 Row:**\n   - The table lists rows by week number in ascending order.\n   - Locate row corresponding to \"week\" with the value of 3.\n\n2. **Verify Date for Week 3:**\n   - Once the correct row is identified, check the \"date\" column for that specific row.\n   - Confirm if the date listed matches October 9, 1960.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- The table has a row where the \"week\" is 3. This row is:\n  ```html\n  <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>october 9 , 1960</td>\n      <td>washington redskins</td>\n      <td>l 14 - 26</td>\n      <td>griffith stadium</td>\n      <td>0 - 3</td>\n      <td>21142.0</td>\n  </tr>\n  ```\n\n- In this row, the \"date\" column indeed has the value \"october 9 , 1960\".\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- The claim states: \"the date of the week 3 game be october 9 , 1960\".\n- Our verification shows that for week 3, the date is exactly October 9, 1960.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Row index: 2 (considering a zero-based index as per typical programming convention)\n- Column name: \"week\" with value \"3\"\n- Column name: \"date\" with value \"october 9 , 1960\"\n\nThe final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
