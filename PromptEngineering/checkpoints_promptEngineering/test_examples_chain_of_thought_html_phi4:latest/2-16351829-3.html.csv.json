    "resp": "To determine whether there are a total of 14 tie replays in the 1995-96 FA Cup, we will analyze each row from the provided table to identify instances where a match resulted in a replay.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Replays:**\n   - A \"replay\" is indicated by the first column labeled \"Round\". If this column contains the word \"Replay\", then it represents a tie that was replayed due to an initial draw or indecisive result.\n\n2. **Extracting Relevant Rows:**\n   - We'll identify rows where the \"Round\" column is marked as \"Replay\".\n   \n3. **Counting Replays:**\n   - Count each instance of a row with \"Replay\" in the \"Round\" column to get the total number of replays.\n\n4. **Validating Against Claim:**\n   - Compare the counted number of replay rows against the claim stating there are 14 replays.\n\n### Examination:\n\n- We need to manually go through each row and check for the presence of \"Replay\" in the \"Round\" column.\n\n1. Row Index 2: Round is \"Replay\"\n2. Row Index 5: Round is \"Replay\"\n3. Row Index 8: Round is \"Replay\"\n4. Row Index 11: Round is \"Replay\"\n5. Row Index 14: Round is \"Replay\"\n6.

Row Index 32: Round is \"Replay\"\n\nWe found 11 instances of replays from the above steps.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The total count of replays in the table is 11, not 14.\n- Therefore, the claim that there are a total of 14 tie replays in the 1995-96 FA Cup is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows where 'Round' column is marked as 'Replay'.
