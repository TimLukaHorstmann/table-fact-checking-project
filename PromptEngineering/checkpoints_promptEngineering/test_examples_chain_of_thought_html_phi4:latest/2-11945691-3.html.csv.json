    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Colorado's home record is true, let's go through a step-by-step analysis using the provided HTML table.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Claim\nThe claim states: \"on November 22 the colorado avalanche record their 3rd home loss of the 1995 - 96 season.\" This means we need to find out if this specific game was a home loss for Colorado and verify that it was indeed their third home loss by November 22.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the Relevant Game\nFirst, identify the row corresponding to November 22 in the table:\n\n- **Row 11**: \n  - Date: November 22\n  - Visitor: Chicago\n  - Score: 2 - 6 (Chicago vs. Colorado)\n  - Home: Colorado\n  - Record: 14 - 4 - 3\n\nThis row indicates that on November 22, the game was played at home by Colorado, and they won with a score of 6-2.\n\n### Step 3: Verify if it was a Loss\nSince the score is listed as \"2 - 6\" with Chicago being the visitor and the home team being Colorado, Colorado won this game. Therefore, this cannot be considered a loss.\n\n### Step 4: Count Home Losses Up to November 22\nTo confirm whether it was their third home loss by November 22, we need to count the number of home losses for Colorado up to that date:\n\n- **Home Game Results**:\n  - November 1 (Calgary vs. Colorado): Score 1 - 6 (Loss)\n  - November 3 (Winnipeg at Colorado): Score 5 - 2 (Win)\n  - November 5 (Chicago at Colorado): Score 7 - 3 (Win)\n  - November 9 (Dallas vs. Colorado): Score 1 - 1 (Tie)\n  - November 11 (Vancouver at Colorado): Score 8 - 4 (Win)\n  - November 15 (Anaheim vs. Colorado): Score 3 - 7 (Loss)\n  - November 17 (Calgary at Colorado): Score 5 - 3 (Win)\n  - **November 22 (Chicago at Colorado)**: Score 2 - 6 (Win)\n\nBy counting the home losses:\n- November 1: Loss\n- November 15: Loss\n\nThere are only two home losses by November 22. The game on November 22 was a win, not a loss.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is false because Colorado did not record their third home loss on November 22; instead, they won that game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze each game involving Colorado from the given table for November 1995 and count how many times they played against each team.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Colorado's Games:**\n   - The table lists games where either 'visitor' or 'home' includes 'colorado'.\n   - Extract all rows relevant to Colorado:\n     - November 3: ColoradovsWinnipeg\n     - November 5: Coloradovschicago\n     - November 9: DallaskvColorado\n     - November 11: Coloradovsvancouver\n     - November 15: Coloradovsanahm\n     - November 17: Coloradovscalgary\n     - November 18: CalgaryvsColorad\n     - November 20: Coloradovedmonton\n     - November 22: ChicagovsColorado\n     - November 25: MontrealsvColorado\n     - November 28: Coloradovsnyislanders\n     - November 29: Coloradosvnewjersey\n\n2. **Count Games Against Each Team:**\n   - Calgary:\n     - November 1: calgary vs colorado\n     - November 17: colorado vs calgary\n     - November 18: calgary vs colorado\n     - Total games against Calgary = 3\n   \n   - Chicago:\n     - November 5: colorado vs chicago\n     - November 22: chicago vs colorado\n     - Total games against Chicago = 2\n\n   - Winnipeg:\n     - November 3: colorado vs winnipeg\n     - Total games against Winnipeg = 1\n\n   - Vancouver:\n     - November 11: colorado vs vancouver\n     - Total games against Vancouver = 1\n\n   - Anaheim:\n     - November 15: colorado vs anaheim\n     - Total games against Anaheim = 1\n\n   - Edmonton:\n     - November 20: colorado vs edmonton\n     - Total games against Edmonton = 1\n\n   - Montreal:\n     - November 25: montreal vs colorado\n     - Total games against Montreal = 1\n\n   - NY Islanders:\n     - November 28: colorado vs ny islanders\n     - Total games against NY Islanders = 1\n\n   - New Jersey:\n     - November 29: coloradosvnewjersey\n     - Total games against New Jersey = 1\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Calgary and Chicago are the only teams Colorado played more than 6 times in November 1995.\n   - From our count, Colorado did not play any team more than 3 times.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant cells:\n- All rows involving 'colorado' as visitor or home to determine their opponents and count games: \n  - Rows 2 to 13 (1-indexed).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Extract all relevant rows where Colorado is either the visitor or the home team.\",\n    \"Count the number of times each opponent appears in those rows.\",\n    \"Calgary: 3 games, Chicago: 2 games, Winnipeg: 1 game, Vancouver: 1 game, Anaheim: 1 game, Edmonton: 1 game, Montreal: 1 game, NY Islanders: 1 game, New Jersey: 1 game.\",\n    \"Since no team was played more than 6 times, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
