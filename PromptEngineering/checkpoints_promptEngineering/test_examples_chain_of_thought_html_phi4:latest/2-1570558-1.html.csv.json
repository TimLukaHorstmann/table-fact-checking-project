    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Sherdrick's interceptions (INTs) in the years 2005 and 2006 is true or false, we need to examine the specific data from the table for those years.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** \n   - The claim mentions two specific pieces of information:\n     - In 2006, Sherdrick had 14 interceptions.\n     - In 2005, Sherdrick had 10 interceptions.\n\n2. **Locate the Year 2005 in the Table:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the year 2005.\n   - Check the value under the column labeled \"int 's\" (interceptions) for this year.\n\n3. **Verify Data for 2005:**\n   - In the table, the row for the year 2005 shows:\n     - `int 's`: 10\n   - This matches the claim that Sherdrick had 10 interceptions in 2005.\n\n4. **Locate the Year 2006 in the Table:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the year 2006.\n   - Check the value under the column labeled \"int 's\" for this year.\n\n5. **Verify Data for 2006:**\n   - In the table, the row for the year 2006 shows:\n     - `int 's`: 16\n   - The claim states that Sherdrick had 14 interceptions in 2006, but the table indicates he actually had 16.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the data for 2005 is correct according to the claim, but the data for 2006 does not match (the claim says 14 INTs while the table shows 16), the overall claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- For 2005:\n  - Row index: 11\n  - Column name: \"int 's\"\n  - Value: 10\n\n- For 2006:\n  - Row index: 12\n  - Column name: \"int 's\"\n  - Value: 16\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states Sherdrick had 14 INTs in 2006 and 10 INTs in 2005.
