Assuming an approximate conversion rate (for illustrative purposes) of 1 USD = 22,000 VND (based on historical rates), this would be approximately $681.82.\n   - **December 2009 (Bolivia Special):** The budget is \"$3500.\"\n   - **December 2010 (Middle East Special):** The budget is \"$3500,\" with an additional note that \"may spent 3966.\" However, the given budget remains $3500 for comparison.\n   - **December 2011 (India Special):** The budget is \"$7000.\"\n   - **March 2013 (Africa Special):** The budget is \"$1500.\"\n\n2. **Compare All Given Budgets:**\n   - Convert all budgets to a common unit if necessary.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the second smallest budget being 1000 for the US special show in February 2007 is true or false, we need to analyze the budgets provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Budgets from Table:**\n   - Extract all non-null budget values from the table:\n     - February 2007 (US Special): 1000\n     - November 2007 (Botswana Special): 1500\n     - December 2008 (Vietnam Special): 15,000,000\u20ab\n     - December 2009 (Bolivia Special): 3500\n     - December 2010 (Middle East Special): May spent 3966 (ignoring the 3500 as a separate value)\n     - December 2011 (India Special): 7000\n     - March 2013 (Africa Special): 1500\n\n2. **Convert Non-Uniform Budgets:**\n   - Convert all budget values to a common unit if necessary. For simplicity, assume the Vietnamese dong is not directly comparable due to lack of conversion rate.\n   - List budgets in numerical order:\n     - 1000\n     - 1500 (appears twice)\n     - 3500\n     - 3966\n     - 7000\n\n3. **Determine Second Smallest Budget:**\n   - Sort the budget values in ascending order:\n     - 1000, 1500, 1500, 3500, 3966, 7000\n   - Identify the second smallest value: 1500\n\n4. **Verify Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the second smallest budget is 1000 for the US Special in February 2007.\n   - From our sorted list, the second smallest budget is actually 1500.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because the second smallest budget is not 1000; it is 1500.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- February 2007 (US Special) Budget: `row_index` 1, `column_name` \"budget\"\n- November 2007 (Botswana Special) Budget: `row_index` 3, `column_name` \"budget\"\n- December 2009 (Bolivia Special) Budget: `row_index` 5, `column_name` \"budget\"\n- December 2010 (Middle East Special) May's Spending: `row_index` 6, `column_name` \"budget\"\n- December 2011 (India Special) Budget: `row_index` 7, `column_name` \"budget\"\n- March 2013 (Africa Special) Budget: `row_index` 8, `column_name` \"budget\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted budgets from the table and sorted them in ascending order.
