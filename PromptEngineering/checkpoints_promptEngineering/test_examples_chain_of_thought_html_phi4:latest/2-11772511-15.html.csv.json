Based on the `<thead>`, the column labeled \"nationality\" is the third one.\n\n3. **Check Brett Bellemore's Nationality:**\n   - Look at the entry under the \"nationality\" column for the row where Brett Bellemore is listed.\n   - For Brett Bellemore in the 6th row, the nationality specified is \"canada.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"brett bellemore be from canada.\"\n   - Since his nationality is listed as \"canada,\" this matches the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe information confirms that Brett Bellemore is indeed from Canada, making the claim true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table provided. The claim states: \"the position for round 3 be lw\". Let's break down the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The claim refers to \"round 3\", so we first locate the row in the table where the value of the column `round` is 3.\n\n2. **Extract Player Position**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct row for round 3, we extract the player's position from that row by looking at the value in the `position` column.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies that the position should be \"lw\" (left wing). We compare the extracted position against this claimed position to determine if they match.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps using the table:\n\n- **Step 1: Locate Row for Round 3**:\n  - In the table, the row with `round` value of 3 is:\n    ```\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>drayson bowman</td>\n      <td>c / rw</td>\n      <td>united states</td>\n      <td>spokane chiefs (whl)</td>\n    </tr>\n    ```\n\n- **Step 2: Extract Position**:\n  - From this row, the value in the `position` column is \"c / rw\", which stands for center/right wing.\n\n- **Step 3: Compare with Claim**:\n  - The claim states that the position should be \"lw\". Comparing \"c / rw\" (center/right wing) to \"lw\" (left wing), we see they do not match.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is false.\n\nFinally, let's format our findings into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row for round 3. In that row, extract the player's position which is 'c / rw'. Compare this with the claimed position 'lw' and find they do not match.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
