    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Canon Yaound\u00e9 scoring zero points against their opponent is true or false, we will analyze the provided table step by step.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Locate Canon Yaound\u00e9's Row:**\n   - We need to find the row in the table where \"Canon Yaound\u00e9\" appears under the column labeled \"team 1.\" This is because the claim is specifically about their performance against their opponent.\n   - The relevant row is identified by scanning through the rows and finding:\n     ```html\n     <td>canon yaound\u00e9</td>\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the Aggregated Score:**\n   - In the same row, look at the \"agg\" column to see the aggregated score between Canon Yaound\u00e9 and their opponent.\n   - The relevant cell in this row is:\n     ```html\n     <td>9 - 4</td>\n     ```\n   - This indicates that Canon Yaound\u00e9 scored a total of 9 points across both legs against AS Solidarit\u00e9.\n\n3. **Check the Individual Leg Scores:**\n   - For further confirmation, examine the \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\" columns to see how many points were scored in each match.\n   - The relevant cells are:\n     ```html\n     <td>7 - 3</td>\n     <td>2 - 1</td>\n     ```\n   - These scores confirm that Canon Yaound\u00e9 scored 7 points in the first leg and 2 points in the second leg, totaling 9 points.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Canon Yaound\u00e9 score zero point against their opponent.\"\n   - Based on the aggregated score of 9-4 and the individual leg scores (7-3 and 2-1), Canon Yaound\u00e9 clearly scored points in both legs.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analysis shows that Canon Yaound\u00e9 did not score zero points; instead, they scored a total of 9 points against their opponent AS Solidarit\u00e9. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row for Canon Yaound\u00e9 and checked both the aggregated score (9-4) and individual leg scores (7-3, 2-1).
