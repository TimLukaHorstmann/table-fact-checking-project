    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Galina Voskoboeva:**\n   - We look for rows where \"Galina Voskoboeva\" is mentioned as the player, which would typically be in the 'opponent' column since the table lists matches against her.\n\n2. **Check Surface Type:**\n   - For each match involving Galina Voskoboeva, we need to check if it was played on a \"hard\" surface. The 'surface' column provides this information.\n   \n3. **Count Total Games Played:**\n   - If the match was on a hard court, we count the total number of games played in that match by summing up the numbers in the 'score' column.\n\n4. **Aggregate the Total:**\n   - Sum the total number of games from all matches on hard courts to verify if it equals 3.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Opponent: Matea Mezak\n  - Surface: Hard (i)\n  - Score: 6 - 4, 4 - 6, 4 - 6\n  - Total games = 6 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 30\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Opponent: Oleksandra Kravets\n  - Surface: Hard (i)\n  - Score: 6 - 4, 6 - 2\n  - Total games = 6 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 18\n\n- **Rows 3 and 4:** \n  - Neither row lists Galina Voskoboeva as the opponent.\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Opponent: Alice Canepa\n  - Surface: Clay\n  - Not relevant for hard courts.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGalina Voskoboeva played two matches on a hard court, with total games of 30 and 18 respectively.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Galina Voskoboeva's winrate on clay and hard courts is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table and evaluate each part of the claim step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches and Outcomes:**\n   - We examine each row in the table to determine the surface type (clay or hard) and the outcome for Galina Voskoboeva (either \"winner\" or \"runner-up\").\n\n2. **Count Wins on Clay Courts:**\n   - Look at rows with the surface column marked as \"clay.\"\n   - Row 3: Outcome is \"runner-up,\" opponent is Roberta Vinci, score is 3-6, 4-6.\n   - Row 5: Outcome is \"winner,\" opponent is Alice Canepa, score is 6-1, 6-2.\n   - Count of wins on clay courts = 1 (Row 5).\n\n3. **Count Wins on Hard Courts:**\n   - Look at rows with the surface column marked as \"hard\" or \"hard (i)\" which are variations of hard court surfaces.\n   - Row 1: Outcome is \"runner-up,\" opponent is Matea Mezak, score is 6-4, 4-6, 4-6.\n   - Row 2: Outcome is \"winner,\" opponent is Oleksandra Kravets, score is 6-4, 6-2.\n   - Row 4: Outcome is \"runner-up,\" opponent is Lilia Osterloh, score is 6-7, 4-6.\n   - Count of wins on hard courts = 1 (Row 2).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim about Winrate:**\n   - The claim states that Voskoboeva has an equal winrate between both clay and hard courts.\n   - We found 1 win each on clay and hard surfaces, indicating an equal number of wins.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Additional Part of the Claim:**\n   - The claim also states that she \"never win.\"\n   - This is false because we have identified matches where she won (Rows 2 and 5).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim about Galina Voskoboeva having an equal winrate on clay and hard courts is true, but the part stating she never wins is false. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells include:\n- Rows with outcomes: Row 1 (Runner-up), Row 2 (Winner), Row 3 (Runner-up), Row 4 (Runner-up), Row 5 (Winner).\n- Columns for surface type and outcome are particularly relevant.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the outcomes and surfaces in each row.
