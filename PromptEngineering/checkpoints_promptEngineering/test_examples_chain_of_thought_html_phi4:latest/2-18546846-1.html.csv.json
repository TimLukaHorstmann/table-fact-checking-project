    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 49ers play the los angeles dones 1 time in the 1947 season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for occurrences of games against the Los Angeles Dons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The column \"opponent\" contains information about which team was played against each week.\n   \n2. **Search for \"los angeles dons\"**:\n   - We need to check each row in the \"opponent\" column to see if it lists \"los angeles dons.\"\n\n3. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Go through the rows and count how many times \"los angeles dons\" appears.\n\n4. **Verify Each Instance**:\n   - Ensure that each occurrence corresponds to a unique game by checking the \"week\" column for different numbers.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - If \"los angeles dons\" appears exactly once, the claim is true.\n   - If it appears more than once or not at all, the claim is false.\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n\n- **Row 2**: The opponent is \"los angeles dons\" (week 2).\n- **Row 9**: The opponent is again \"los angeles dons\" (week 9).\n\nThe Los Angeles Dons are listed as an opponent in two different weeks: week 2 and week 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the Los Angeles Dons appear twice in the table, the claim that they were played against only once during the 1947 season is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The column 'opponent' was checked for occurrences of 'los angeles dons'.
