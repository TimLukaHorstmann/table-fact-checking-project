    "resp": "To determine if the claim about Ireland's medal count is true, we need to examine the data from the table for Ireland:\n\n1. **Identify Ireland's Medal Counts:**\n   - The table provides rows where each row corresponds to a country and its medal counts.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"Ireland.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data for Ireland:**\n   - According to the table, the data for Ireland is as follows:\n     - Gold Medals (Column 1): `0`\n     - Silver Medals (Column 2): `1`\n     - Bronze Medals (Column 3): `0`\n     - Total Medals (Column 4): `1`\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Ireland score only 1 silver medal and no other medal.\"\n   - This means Ireland should have:\n     - Exactly 1 Silver Medal\n     - 0 Gold Medals\n     - 0 Bronze Medals\n\n4. **Compare Extracted Data with the Claim:**\n   - For Ireland, the data matches the claim perfectly:\n     - Gold Medals = `0` (matches \"no other medal\")\n     - Silver Medals = `1` (matches \"only 1 silver medal\")\n     - Bronze Medals = `0` (matches \"no other medal\")\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since all conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data for Ireland, the claim is true.\n\nNow, we format this reasoning into a JSON object as required:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row for Ireland in the table and extract its medal counts. The data shows that Ireland has 0 gold medals, 1 silver medal, and 0 bronze medals, resulting in a total of 1 medal. This matches the claim that Ireland scored only 1 silver medal and no other medals.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": \"ireland_row\",\n      \"column_name\": \"Gold Medals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": \"ireland_row\",\n      \"column_name\": \"Silver Medals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": \"ireland_row\",\n      \"column_name\": \"Bronze Medals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The exact row index isn't specified numerically in the table, so it's referred to as `\"ireland_row\"` for clarity.",
