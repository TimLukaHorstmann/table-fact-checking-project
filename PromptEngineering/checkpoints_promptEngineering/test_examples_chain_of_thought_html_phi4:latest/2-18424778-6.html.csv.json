We must find any row in the table that mentions \"iTunes.\"\n   - The relevant entry is found in the last row of the table:  \n     - `country`: \"global ( itunes )\"\n     - `date`: \"19 november 2012\"\n     - `label`: \"columbia\"\n     - `format`: \"digital download\"\n     - `catalogue no`: \"88697338292\"\n\n2. **Analyze Release Date**:\n   - The release date for the iTunes version is \"19 November 2012.\"\n   - We need to check if there are any earlier releases (by date) before this date in other regions or formats.\n\n3. **Check Earlier Releases**:\n   - Review all previous rows to see if any have an earlier release date than \"19 November 2012\":\n     - Europe: \"17 October 2008\"\n     - Australia: \"18 October 2008\"\n     - United Kingdom: \"20 October 2008\" and \"1 December 2008\"\n     - United States: \"20 October 2008\"\n     - Japan: \"22 October 2008\"\n     - Germany: \"5 December 2008\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - All these earlier releases are dated before \"19 November 2012.\"\n   - Therefore, the iTunes release is not the first; it occurred several years after other regional releases.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"Black Ice be first release on iTunes, internationally\" is FALSE because there were earlier releases in various regions well before the iTunes release date of \"19 November 2012.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains a row for an 'iTunes' release dated '19 November 2012'.

This indicates that in Europe, it was released as both a CD and a double LP.\n   - Row 2: `format` is \"cd\". No LP mentioned.\n   - Row 3: `format` is \"cd , double lp\". In the United Kingdom, it was released as both a CD and a double LP.\n   - Row 4: `format` is \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\". No LP mentioned.\n   - Row 5: `format` is \"cd\".
