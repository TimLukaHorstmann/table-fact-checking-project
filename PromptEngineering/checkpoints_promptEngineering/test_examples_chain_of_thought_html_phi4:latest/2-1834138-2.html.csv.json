Therefore, the condition specified by the claim (population being 45,803) does not match the data in the table.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE** because the population number does not align with the given traditional name.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row for 'xingshan district' has a population of 44,803, not 45,803 as claimed.
