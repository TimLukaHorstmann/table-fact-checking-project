The table shows \"honorius iii\" as the elevator, not \"gregory ix.\"\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because while the title did go to a Spanish cardinal-deacon, it was elevated by Honorius III, not Gregory IX.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the title 'deacon of ss cosma e damiano' in the table.\",\n    \"Locate the row with this title and verify the details: nationality is Spanish, order is cardinal - deacon.\",\n    \"Check who elevated them; it was Honorius III, not Gregory IX as implied by the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"order\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"elevator\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
