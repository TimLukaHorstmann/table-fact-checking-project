    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 point\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for each year Team Lotus participated and check their points.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify All Entries for Team Lotus:**\n   - Look at all rows in the table where \"entrant\" is \"team lotus.\"\n\n2. **Analyze Points for Each Year:**\n\n   - **1963:**\n     - Check the row with `year = 1963`.\n     - Points are listed as `0` which is less than 10.\n\n   - **1964:**\n     - Check the row with `year = 1964`.\n     - Points are listed as `11` which is not less than 10.\n\n   - **1966:**\n     - There are three entries for the year 1966. We need to sum up the points from all these entries.\n     - First entry (`row 2`): Points = `1`\n     - Second entry (`row 3`): Points = `1`\n     - Third entry (`row 4`): Points = `1`\n     - Total points for 1966 = `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is less than 10.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 1963 is the only year where Team Lotus scored less than 10 points.\n   - We found that in 1966, they also had less than 10 points (total of 3).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 1966 also has a total of less than 10 points, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For 1963: \n  - Row index 0, column \"points\": `0`\n- For 1964:\n  - Row index 1, column \"points\": `11`\n- For 1966 (all entries):\n  - Row index 2, column \"points\": `1`\n  - Row index 3, column \"points\": `1`\n  - Row index 4, column \"points\": `1`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify all rows for Team Lotus and check points per year.
