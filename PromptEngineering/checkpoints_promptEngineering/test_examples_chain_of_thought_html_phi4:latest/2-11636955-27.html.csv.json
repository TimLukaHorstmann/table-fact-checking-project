Here's how I will approach it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table includes columns such as \"rd\", \"pick\", \"player\", \"team (league)\", \"reg gp\" (regular season games played), and \"pl gp\" (playoff games played).\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We are interested in the \"pl gp\" column because it indicates how many playoff games each player participated in.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for Playoff Participation:**\n   - Go through each row to check the value in the \"pl gp\" column:\n     - For \"Peter Schaefer\", located in row 3, \"pl gp\" is 3.\n     - For \"Brent Sopel\", located in row 6, \"pl gp\" is 42.\n   - These values indicate that both players participated in playoff games.\n\n4. **Check Other Players:**\n   - Inspect the \"pl gp\" column for all other rows to verify if there are any other players with a value greater than zero:\n     - Row 1 (Chris McCallister) has \"pl gp\" as 0.\n     - Row 2 (Larry Courville) has \"pl gp\" as 0.\n     - Row 4 (Lloyd Shaw) has \"pl gp\" as 0.\n     - Row 5 (Todd Norman) has \"pl gp\" as 0.\n     - Row 7 (Stu Bodtker) has \"pl gp\" as 0.\n     - Row 8 (Tyler Willis) has \"pl gp\" as 0.\n     - Row 9 (Jason Cugnet) has \"pl gp\" as 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Peter Schaefer and Brent Sopel have non-zero values in the \"pl gp\" column, confirming they are indeed the only players who participated in playoff games according to this table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'pl gp' column shows how many playoff games each player played.
