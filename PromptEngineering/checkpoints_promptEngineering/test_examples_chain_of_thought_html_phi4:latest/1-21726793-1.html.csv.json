We'll search for an episode titled \"credit where credit's due.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Title**: By examining the `title` column, find the row with the title \"credit where credit 's due.\" According to the table, this is found at:\n   - Row 2\n\n3. **Check the Writer Information**: Once we've identified the correct row, look at the `written by` column to see who is credited as the writer for this episode.\n\n4. **Verify Rob Thomas's Involvement**:\n   - For row 2 (the relevant episode), the `written by` entry lists \"Rob Thomas.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim states that Rob Thomas wrote the song, but in fact, he was credited with writing the episode itself.
