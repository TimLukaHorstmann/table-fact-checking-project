The claim states that 4 of the tallest buildings have been on 6th Avenue, and 3 have been on 5th Avenue.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Buildings on 6th Avenue:**\n   - Examine the \"street address\" column for entries containing \"6th avenue.\"\n   - Count the number of such entries.\n\n2. **Identify Buildings on 5th Avenue:**\n   - Similarly, examine the \"street address\" column for entries containing \"5th avenue.\"\n   - Count these as well.\n\n3. **Cross-reference with Years as Tallest:**\n   - Ensure that the buildings identified in steps 1 and 2 were actually among the tallest during their respective time periods.\n   - Check the \"years as tallest\" column to confirm this.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Buildings on 6th Avenue:**\n  - Wells Fargo Building: Address is \"309 sw 6th avenue\", Years as Tallest: 1907 - 1911\n  - Public Service Building: Address is \"920 sw sixth avenue\", Years as Tallest: 1927 - 1962\n  - Hilton Portland Hotel: Address is \"921 sw sixth avenue\", Years as Tallest: 1963 - 1965\n\n- **Buildings on 5th Avenue:**\n  - Yeon Building: Address is \"522 sw 5th avenue\", Years as Tallest: 1911 - 1913\n  - Standard Insurance Center: Address is \"900 sw fifth avenue\", Years as Tallest: 1970 - 1972\n  - Wells Fargo Center: Address is \"1300 sw 5th avenue\", Years as Tallest: 1972 - present\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **6th Avenue Count:** There are 3 buildings listed on 6th Avenue that were among the tallest during their respective periods.\n- **5th Avenue Count:** There are 3 buildings listed on 5th Avenue that were among the tallest.\n\nThe claim states there should be 4 buildings on 6th Avenue, but our analysis shows only 3.
