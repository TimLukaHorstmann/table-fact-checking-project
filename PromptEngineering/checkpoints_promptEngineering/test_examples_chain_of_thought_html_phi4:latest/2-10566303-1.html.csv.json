This is found in the last row of the table.\n\n3. **Extract Qualifying Times**:\n   - **Qual 1 Time**: For Dan Selznick, this is listed as `1:37.696`.\n   - **Qual 2 Time**: For Dan Selznick, this is listed as `1:35.133`.\n\n4. **Determine Best Time**:\n   - The \"Best\" time column directly provides the best qualifying time for each driver.\n   - For Dan Selznick, the \"Best\" time is given as `1:35.133`.\n\n5. **Analyze the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that Dan Selznick's best time should be over `1:35.133`.\n   - However, according to the table, his actual best time is exactly `1:35.133`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since his best time matches `1:35.133` and not over it, the claim is incorrect.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**: \n   - The relevant cells for this analysis are in row 20, columns \"Qual 2\" and \"Best\".\n\nBased on these steps, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Dan Selznick's qualifying times are '1:37.696' for Qual 1 and '1:35.133' for Qual 2.
