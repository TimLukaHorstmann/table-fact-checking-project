    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Game on December 20th is true, we need to analyze the specific row corresponding to that game date.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - Locate the row for \"Game\" where the column \"date\" equals \"December 20\".\n\n2. **Extract the High Points Value:**\n   - In this row, identify the value in the \"high points\" column to determine how many high points were achieved.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the high point get more than 25\". This means we need to check if the extracted value from step 2 is greater than 25.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - If the high points value is greater than 25, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Applying Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. Locate the row where \"date\" = \"December 20\". This corresponds to Game number 26.\n\n2. Extract the value from the \"high points\" column for this row:\n   - The \"high points\" value for Game 26 (December 20) is 23.\n\n3. Compare with the claim:\n   - The claim states that high points should be more than 25.\n   - Since 23 is not greater than 25, the claim does not hold true.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The claim \"for game on December 20, the high point get more than 25\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate the row for Game 26 (December 20) and check the 'high points' value.
