Looking at the \"governments\" column of each row, find where \"31\" appears.\n   \n2. **Locate Government 31:**\n   - The row with `tzipi livni` as minister contains `31` in the \"governments\" column.\n\n3. **Check the party affiliation for Government 31:**\n   - In the same row, under the \"party\" column, check which political party is listed.\n   - For government number 31, the \"party\" cell shows `kadima`.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since government number 31 has the Kadima party associated with it, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are found in the row where `tzipi livni` is listed as the minister.\n- Specifically, these are:\n  - Row index 19, \"governments\" column: contains \"31\".\n  - Row index 19, \"party\" column: contains \"kadima\".\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row where government number 31 is listed.\",\n    \"Locate the entry for 'tzipi livni' which includes government 31 in its 'governments' cell.\",\n    \"Check the 'party' column of this row to determine the party affiliation for government 31.\",\n    \"Confirm that the 'kadima' party is associated with government number 31.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"governments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"government 31 start before 18 january 2006\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant part of the table that lists the start dates for each government.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We are looking for information about government number 31.\n   \n2. **Locate Government 31 in the Table:**\n   - In the table, the entry for government 31 is found in row 21 (considering the first row as index 0):\n     ```\n     <tr>\n       <td>tzipi livni</td>\n       <td>kadima</td>\n       <td>31</td>\n       <td>18 january 2006</td>\n       <td>1 april 2009</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n3. **Check the Start Date:**\n   - For government 31, the start date listed is \"18 January 2006\".\n   \n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that government 31 starts before 18 January 2006.\n   - However, the table shows that it actually starts on 18 January 2006.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the start date is exactly on 18 January 2006 and not before, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Government 31's row was located (row 21) with a start date of '18 january 2006'.
