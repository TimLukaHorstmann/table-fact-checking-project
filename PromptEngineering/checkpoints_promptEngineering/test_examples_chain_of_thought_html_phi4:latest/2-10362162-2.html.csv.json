The format used is \"outcome score-opponent's score\" (e.g., \"w 15 - 0\").\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Zero Points Allowed:**\n   - Go through each row of the table to check if there are any results where the opponent scored zero points. This means we need to find entries in the `result` column where the score following the hyphen is \"0\".\n\n3. **Check Each Game Result:**\n\n    - **Week 1:** Result = \"l 24 - 7\" (Opponent scored 7)\n    - **Week 2:** Result = \"w 10 - 7\" (Opponent scored 7)\n    - **Week 4:** Result = \"w 15 - 13\" (Opponent scored 13)\n    - **Week 5:** Result = \"l 38 - 19\" (Opponent scored 19)\n    - **Week 6:** Result = \"w 15 - 0\" (Opponent scored 0) \u2192 This is one week where the opponent was held to zero points.\n    - **Week 8:** Result = \"w 19 - 12\" (Opponent scored 12)\n    - **Week 9:** Result = \"l 30 - 27\" (Opponent scored 27)\n    - **Week 10:** Result = \"l 30 - 17\" (Opponent scored 17)\n    - **Week 11:** Result = \"w 26 - 23\" (Opponent scored 23)\n    - **Week 12:** Result = \"l 23 - 10\" (Opponent scored 10)\n    - **Week 13:** Result = \"l 17 - 14\" (Opponent scored 14)\n    - **Week 14:** Result = \"w 13 - 0\" (Opponent scored 0) \u2192 This is another week where the opponent was held to zero points.\n    - **Week 15:** Result = \"l 37 - 20\" (Opponent scored 20)\n    - **Week 16:** Result = \"w 21 - 17\" (Opponent scored 17)\n    - **Week 17:** Result = \"w 30 - 10\" (Opponent scored 10)\n    - **Week 18:** Result = \"w 14 - 9\" (Opponent scored 9)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - From the analysis, there are two weeks where the Minnesota Vikings held their opponent to zero points: Week 6 and Week 14.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'result' column was checked for entries where the opponent's score is zero.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the 1993 Minnesota Vikings season is true, we need to verify if there was any missing week where a game should have been scheduled according to a typical NFL regular season schedule.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that during the 1993 season for the Minnesota Vikings, there were no weeks without a scheduled game. This implies they played in every week from Week 1 through Week 18 as per the standard NFL regular season format at that time.\n\n2. **Review the Table**: The table contains data on each game the team played, including week number and opponent details. We need to ensure that all weeks from 1 to 18 are accounted for in this schedule.\n\n3. **Check Each Week**:\n   - **Week 1**: Present (vs. Los Angeles Raiders)\n   - **Week 2**: Present (vs. Chicago Bears)\n   - **Week 3**: Missing\n   - **Week 4**: Present (vs. Green Bay Packers)\n   - **Week 5**: Present (vs. San Francisco 49ers)\n   - **Week 6**: Present (vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n   - **Week 7**: Missing\n   - **Week 8**: Present (vs. Chicago Bears)\n   - **Week 9**: Present (vs. Detroit Lions)\n   - **Week 10**: Present (vs. San Diego Chargers)\n   - **Week 11**: Present (vs. Denver Broncos)\n   - **Week 12**: Present (vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n   - **Week 13**: Present (vs. New Orleans Saints)\n   - **Week 14**: Present (vs. Detroit Lions)\n   - **Week 15**: Present (vs. Dallas Cowboys)\n   - **Week 16**: Present (vs. Green Bay Packers, MILW)\n   - **Week 17**: Present (vs. Kansas City Chiefs)\n   - **Week 18**: Present (vs. Washington Redskins)\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are two weeks missing from the table: Week 3 and Week 7.\n   - The claim is that there were no weeks without a game, which contradicts our finding of these two missing entries.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis above, the statement \"during the 1993 minnesota viking season there be no week in which the team do not play\" is FALSE because there are indeed two weeks (Weeks 3 and 7) without a game listed in the table.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells would be those that document each of the games played, specifically highlighting the missing entries for Weeks 3 and 7, which are absent from this dataset.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is FALSE because there are two weeks (Weeks 3 and 7) without a game listed in the table, indicating not every week had a scheduled game.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
