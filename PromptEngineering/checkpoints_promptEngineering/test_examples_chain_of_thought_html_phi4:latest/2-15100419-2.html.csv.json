    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, let's break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Check for a defensive end pick:**\n   - We need to look at the \"position\" column to identify if there are any entries labeled as \"defensive end.\"\n\n2. **Verify that no such defensive end pick has an overall number smaller than 2:**\n   - For each identified defensive end, check the corresponding value in the \"overall\" column and ensure it is not less than 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Locate Defensive Ends:**\n\n   - Examine each row to find any entry under the \"position\" column that matches \"defensive end.\"\n\n2. **Verify Overall Number for Each Identified Defensive End:**\n   \n   - For each defensive end found, check the corresponding value in the \"overall\" column.\n   - Ensure these values are not less than 2.\n\n### Table Examination:\n\n- **Row 1:** Position is \"linebacker,\" so it's irrelevant to our claim.\n- **Row 2:** Position is \"defensive end.\" The overall number here is 33. Since 33 is greater than 2, this condition holds.\n- **Rows 3 through 9:** Check other rows for any defensive ends and their corresponding overall numbers:\n  - Row 3: Position is \"center.\"\n  - Row 4: Position is \"cornerback.\"\n  - Row 5: Position is \"guard.\"\n  - Row 6: Position is \"defensive back.\"\n  - Row 7: Position is \"wide receiver.\"\n  - Row 8: Position is \"wide receiver.\"\n  - Row 9: Position is \"wide receiver.\"\n\nFrom the table, only **Row 2** contains a defensive end pick with an overall number of 33, which satisfies our condition since it's greater than 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There is exactly one defensive end pick (Row 2), and its overall number (33) is not less than 2.\n- Thus, the claim \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2\" is TRUE because there is no such pick that violates this condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify any rows with 'defensive end' in the position column. Then check if these have an overall number less than 2. In this table, Row 2 has a defensive end with an overall of 33, which is greater than 2. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\", \"value\": \"defensive end\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\", \"value\": 33}\n  ]\n}\n```",
