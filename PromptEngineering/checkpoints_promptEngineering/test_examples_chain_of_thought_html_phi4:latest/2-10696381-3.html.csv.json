The goal is to identify the second-highest number of points scored by the Patriots in a single game.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Extract Points Scored by the Patriots:**\n   - For each row, parse the 'result' column to determine how many points the Patriots scored.\n   - This can be done by splitting the result string at \" - \" and taking the first element (before the dash) as the Patriots' score.\n\n2. **List of Points Scored in Each Game:**\n   - Week 1: 16 points\n   - Week 2: 19 points\n   - Week 3: 13 points\n   - Week 4: 3 points\n   - Week 5: 28 points (win)\n   - Week 6: 24 points (win)\n   - Week 7: 17 points\n   - Week 8: 23 points\n   - Week 10: 13 points\n   - Week 11: 11 points\n   - Week 12: 16 points (win)\n   - Week 13: 9 points\n   - Week 14: 30 points (win)\n   - Week 15: 17 points\n   - Week 16: 13 points (win)\n   - Week 17: 24 points\n\n3. **Sort the Scores in Descending Order:**\n   - The scores are: [30, 28, 24, 23, 21, 19, 17, 17, 16, 16, 13, 13, 13, 11, 9]\n\n4. **Identify the Second-Highest Score:**\n   - The highest score is 30 points.\n   - The second-highest score is 28 points.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the second most point score by the Patriots in a single game was 30, which is incorrect as per our calculation (the correct value is 28).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"the second most point score by the 2000 Patriot in a single game be 30\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted points scored from 'result' column for each game, listed scores: [16, 19, 13, 3, 28, 24, 17, 23, 13, 11, 16, 9, 30, 17, 13, 24].
