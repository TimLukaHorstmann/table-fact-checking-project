    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine whether Corinthians had any losses when they scored more than 25 points. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to Corinthians in the table.\n   - The relevant columns are \"lost\" and \"against\" (which presumably indicates goals scored).\n\n2. **Locate Corinthians' Row:**\n   - From the table, we identify that Corinthians is listed at position 6.\n\n3. **Extract Data for Analysis:**\n   - For Corinthians, extract the number of games lost (`lost`) and the total points they conceded (`against`).\n   - According to the table:\n     - Lost = 10\n     - Against = 51\n\n4. **Interpretation of \"Against\" Column:**\n   - The column \"against\" is typically used in sports tables to denote goals or points conceded by a team, not scored.\n   - Therefore, we need to clarify what \"scored over 25 points\" means in this context. It usually refers to the number of goals they have scored.\n\n5. **Determine Goals Scored:**\n   - We don't have direct data on goals scored for Corinthians. However, we can infer it using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Points} = (\\text{Wins} \\times 2) + \\text{Draws}\n     \\]\n   - From the table:\n     - Points = 22\n     - Drawn = 2\n   - Using the formula, we can find Wins:\n     \\[\n     22 = (2 \\times \\text{Wins}) + 2 \\\\\n     20 = 2 \\times \\text{Wins} \\\\\n     \\text{Wins} = 10\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Goals Scored:**\n   - Total games played = 22\n   - Wins = 10, Drawn = 2, Lost = 10\n   - Assuming a typical scoring system where a win gives 3 points:\n     - Points from wins = \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n     - Total points from draws = \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n   - Goals scored can be estimated by considering the goal difference and goals conceded:\n     - Goal Difference = Goals Scored - Goals Conceded\n     - From the table, Goal Difference = -20\n     - Goals Conceded = 51\n     - Therefore, Goals Scored = Goals Conceded + Goal Difference = 51 - 20 = 31\n\n7. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Corinthians scored 31 goals in total.\n   - We need to determine if there were any losses among these matches where they scored more than 25 goals.\n   - Since they lost 10 games and scored a total of 31 goals, it is statistically improbable that all losses occurred when scoring fewer than or equal to 25 goals.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without specific match-by-match data, we cannot definitively say there were no losses when scoring over 25 points.\n   - However, given the high number of total goals (31) and the number of losses (10), it is reasonable to conclude that they likely scored more than 25 goals in some matches where they did not lose.\n\nThus, the claim \"there be zero loss that corinthians received when they score over 25 points\" cannot be confirmed as true based on the available data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify Corinthians' row and extract 'lost' and 'against' values. The 'against' column indicates goals conceded. Calculate goals scored using total points, wins, draws, and goal difference.
