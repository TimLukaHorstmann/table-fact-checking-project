Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components**:\n   - Year: 2000\n   - Theme: Steam Buggy\n   - Artist: John Mardon (note the spelling discrepancy with \"mordon\" in the claim)\n   - Issue Price: $59.95\n\n2. **Examine the Table for Relevant Data**:\n   - Locate entries for the year 2000.\n   - Check if there is a theme called \"steam buggy\".\n   - Verify the artist associated with this theme.\n   - Confirm the issue price.\n\n3. **Check Each Component Against the Table**:\n   - **Year**: The first row of the table shows the year as 2000, which matches the claim.\n   - **Theme**: The same row indicates the theme is \"steam buggy\", matching the claim.\n   - **Artist**: The artist listed in this row is \"john mardon\". The claim mentions \"john mordon\", which seems to be a typographical error. However, for logical purposes, we consider it as referring to the same person given the context and similarity of names.\n   - **Issue Price**: The issue price in the table is $59.95, exactly matching the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - All components of the claim match the data in the table when considering the likely typographical error in the artist's name. Therefore, the claim can be considered true.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for this verification is from the first row of the table with columns \"year\", \"theme\", \"artist\", and \"issue price\".\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a 2000 steam buggy theme coin by artist John Mordon priced at $59.95.
