    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"james hunt ran on grid 2 for 73 lap\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two aspects of the claim using the table: the starting position (grid) of James Hunt and the number of laps he completed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - Look through the 'driver' column in the table for \"james hunt\" to find his corresponding row. The first row contains \"james hunt\".\n\n2. **Verify Grid Position**:\n   - Check the 'grid' column in the identified row (Row 1) for James Hunt.\n   - According to the table, in Row 1 under the 'grid' column, it states \"2\". This confirms that James Hunt started on grid position 2.\n\n3. **Verify Number of Laps**:\n   - Check the 'laps' column in the identified row (Row 1) for James Hunt.\n   - According to the table, in Row 1 under the 'laps' column, it states \"73\". This confirms that James Hunt completed 73 laps.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Both parts of the claim are verified by the data in the table: James Hunt started on grid position 2 and ran for 73 laps.\n- Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row Index 1, Column 'driver': \"james hunt\"\n- Row Index 1, Column 'grid': \"2\"\n- Row Index 1, Column 'laps': \"73\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row for James Hunt by searching the 'driver' column.

Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Grid Position:**\n   - Locate the row in which the \"grid\" column has the value \"23\".\n\n2. **Check Retire Time/Laps for Grid 23:**\n   - Once located, observe the corresponding entry in the \"time / retired\" column to see if it matches \"+ 4 laps\".\n\n3. **Verification of Claim:**\n   - The claim is \"+ 4 lap be not the time / retire for grid 23\".
