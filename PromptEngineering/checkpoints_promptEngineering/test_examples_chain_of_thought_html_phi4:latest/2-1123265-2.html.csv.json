    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Tarso Marques's starting grid position.\n2. The number of laps completed by Tarso Marques.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the HTML table provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Tarso Marques in the Table:**\n   - We need to locate Tarso Marques within the list of drivers to gather information about his performance and starting position.\n   \n2. **Locate Relevant Row for Tarso Marques:**\n   - By scanning through the rows, we find that Tarso Marques is mentioned at the last row in the table.\n\n3. **Check the Starting Grid Position (\"grid\" Column):**\n   - In the identified row for Tarso Marques, look under the \"grid\" column to determine his starting position.\n   - The value found here is `21`, which indicates that he started from grid position 21.\n\n4. **Check the Number of Laps Completed (\"laps\" Column):**\n   - In the same row where Tarso Marques's name appears, check the \"laps\" column to see how many laps he completed.\n   - The value listed is `0`, indicating that Tarso Marques did not complete any laps.\n\n5. **Compare Findings with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Tarso Marques started on grid 13 but did not complete any laps.\n   - From our findings, we see that he actually started from grid position 21 and completed 0 laps.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The starting grid position stated in the claim (grid 13) is incorrect according to the table data (grid 21).\n   - Although the part of the claim stating that he did not complete any laps is correct, the incorrect grid start makes the entire claim false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- For Tarso Marques:\n  - Laps: \"0\" found at row index 16 and column name \"laps\".\n  - Grid: \"21\" found at row index 16 and column name \"grid\".\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates Tarso Marques started from grid position 21 and completed 0 laps.
