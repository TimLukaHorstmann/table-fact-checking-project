We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: Look through the `type` column in the table to find any row that mentions \"2650i\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each row, check if the `type` is \"2650i\".\n   - If a match is found, verify the value in the `scratch` column for that row.\n\n3. **Check the Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - The claim specifies a scratch of 750 GB for the type \"2650i\".\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with Table Data**:\n   - Compare any findings from step 2 with the claim to determine its validity.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**:\n   - We will examine each row in the `type` column for \"2650i\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: The type is \"l5520\".\n   - **Row 2**: The type is \"l5520\".\n   - **Row 3**: The type is \"l5640\".\n   - **Row 4**: The type is \"l5640\".\n   - **Row 5**: The type is \"2650l\".\n\n3. **Check the Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - We are looking for a type \"2650i\", but none of the rows have this exact type.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with Table Data**:\n   - Since there is no row with the type \"2650i\", we cannot verify the claim that it has a scratch of 750 GB.\n   - The closest match found in the table is \"2650l\" which has a scratch of 750 GB, but this does not satisfy the condition for \"2650i\".\n\nBased on these steps, there is no entry for type \"2650i\" in the table.

The slight difference in formatting (inclusion of \"5.86\" and spacing) does not change the fundamental information.\n\n4. **Check the \"Clock\" Column:**\n   - The value under the \"clock\" column for \"number 32\" is:\n     ```html\n     <td>2.26 ghz</td>\n     ```\n   - This indicates a clock speed of \"2.26 GHz\", which does not match the claim's \"226 GHz\". There seems to be an error in the units or representation in the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The memory information matches the claim, but the clock speed is incorrect according to the table data.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE due to the discrepancy in the clock speed.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For \"number 32\", the relevant cells are:\n  - Row index: 2 (considering the first row as index 0)\n  - Column name for memory: \"memory\"\n  - Column name for clock: \"clock\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row where 'number' is 32.\",\n    \"Extract and verify the values of the 'memory' and 'clock' columns for this row.\",\n    \"'Memory' matches the claim as '24 gb qpi 5.86 gt / s'.\",\n    \"'Clock' value from the table is '2.26 ghz', which does not match '226 ghz' in the claim.\",\n    \"The discrepancy in clock speed makes the claim FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"memory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"clock\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
