Barron\".\n\n4. **Cross-Check Second \"Us Representative - At - Large\" Row**:\n   - This step ensures thoroughness by checking if William E. Barron is also listed in the second occurrence.\n   - In the second \"us representative - at - large\" row, under the \"law preservation ticket\", the candidate listed is \"Dorothy Frooks\".\n   - William E. Barron does not appear here.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is true because William E. Barron is indeed running for the \"representative - at - large\" office under the \"law preservation ticket\" in the first row of that category.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For the first \"us representative - at - large\" position, check:\n  - Row index: 9\n  - Column name: \"law preservation ticket\"\n  \n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the rows for 'us representative - at - large'.

Sears was on the Republican ticket.\n\n**Claim:** \"There wasn't a constitutional ticket when Charles B. Sears be on the Republican ticket.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Position of Charles B. Sears:**\n   - Look through the table to find where Charles B. Sears is listed.\n   - He appears in the row for \"judge of the court of appeals\" under the column \"republican ticket\".\n\n2. **Check the Constitutional Ticket for the Same Row:**\n   - Once we locate the row where Charles B. Sears is on the Republican ticket, check the \"constitutional ticket\" column in that same row.\n   - The relevant row is:\n     - `office`: judge of the court of appeals\n     - `republican ticket`: Charles B. Sears\n     - `constitutional ticket`: (none)\n\n3. **Interpretation:**\n   - In this row, under \"constitutional ticket\", it states \"(none)\", indicating that there was no candidate from the constitutional ticket for this position.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no constitutional ticket listed when Charles B. Sears is on the Republican ticket, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Charles B.

Merritt ran as a candidate from the Law Preservation ticket.\n   - Based on the table, he did not; he ran for the Democratic ticket.\n\n5. **Conclude**:\n   - Since Matthew J.

He appears in the row corresponding to the \"attorney general.\"\n\n2. **Check the Constitutional Ticket for the Same Row:**\n   - In the same row (attorney general), we examine the constitutional ticket column.\n   - The entry here is \"(none),\" indicating no candidate from the constitutional ticket.\n\n3. **Generalize Across All Rows:**\n   - We need to ensure that this pattern holds true for all rows where a socialist ticket candidate is listed, not just the attorney general row.\n   - For each position (row) in the table:\n     - Locate the name of the candidate under the socialist ticket column.\n     - Check if there is an entry in the constitutional ticket column for that same row.\n\n4. **Verify Across All Rows:**\n   - **Governor:** Socialist Ticket - Charles Solomon, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **Lieutenant Governor:** Socialist Ticket - Herman Kobbe, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **Comptroller:** Socialist Ticket - Fred Sander, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **Attorney General:** Socialist Ticket - William Karlin, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **Chief Judge:** Socialist Ticket - Jacob Hillquit, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **Judge of the Court of Appeals (first instance):** Socialist Ticket - Darwin J Meserole, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **Judge of the Court of Appeals (second instance):** Socialist Ticket - Julian H Weiss, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **US Senator:** Socialist Ticket - Norman Thomas, Constitutional Ticket - Henry Breckinridge\n   - **US Representative - At-Large (first instance):** Socialist Ticket - Charles W Noonan, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n   - **US Representative - At-Large (second instance):** Socialist Ticket - August Claessens, Constitutional Ticket - (none)\n\n5. **Identify Exceptions:**\n   - The only exception is in the row for \"US Senator,\" where Norman Thomas is on the socialist ticket and Henry Breckinridge is on the constitutional ticket.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that no one should be on the constitutional ticket when William Karlin is on the socialist ticket.
