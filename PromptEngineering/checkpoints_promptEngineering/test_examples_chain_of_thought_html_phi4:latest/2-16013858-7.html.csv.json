    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the match on June 8 being the only one to go to four sets during the 2001 FIVB Volleyball World League season, we will analyze the provided table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Four Set Results:**\n   - Look for rows where all five columns (set results) have values other than \"NA\". This indicates that the match went to four sets.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row in the Table:**\n   - Check each row for a pattern where there are results in all five set columns.\n\n3. **Identify Matches Going Beyond Three Sets:**\n   - A match going beyond three sets will have results in at least four of the set columns (including the possible fifth set).\n\n4. **Check June 8 Match:**\n   - Locate the row for June 8 and verify that it has results in all five columns.\n\n5. **Verify Uniqueness:**\n   - Ensure no other matches besides June 8 have results filled in four or more of the set result columns.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **June 8 Match (Row 19):** \n  - Results are: \"25 - 18\", \"25 - 18\", \"27 - 29\", \"23 - 25\", \"15 - 10\".\n  - All five columns have values, indicating the match went to a fifth set.\n\n- **Check Other Rows for Similar Patterns:**\n  - Go through each row and check if all five set result columns are filled.\n  \n- **Findings from Other Matches:**\n  - June 9 (Row 20): Results in four columns (\"25 - 18\", \"17 - 25\", \"18 - 25\", \"25 - 27\") with the fifth column as NA. This match went to five sets, but since it's not filled, we consider only those fully filled.\n  - June 15 (Row 24): Results in all four columns (\"25 - 16\", \"21 - 25\", \"25 - 20\", \"25 - 22\") with the fifth column as NA. This indicates a match that went to five sets but not completely filled for a conclusion of four.\n  - June 16 (Rows 25 and 26): Both have results in all four columns and fifth set results, indicating they went to five sets.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Only the match on June 8 has results filled in all five columns, confirming it went to a fifth set.
