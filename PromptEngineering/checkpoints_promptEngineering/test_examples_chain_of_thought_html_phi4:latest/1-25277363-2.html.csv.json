This corresponds to the episode number in the entire series.\n\n2. **Check the Writer Information**:\n   - Once the correct row for episode 149 is identified, check the \"written by\" column for that row to see who wrote the episode.\n   \n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - Determine if Bob Sand's name appears in the writer information for episode 149.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Scan the \"no in series\" column and find the entry with the value 149. This corresponds to the row index 4 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n- **Step 2**: Check the \"written by\" column at this row index:\n  - The cell contains the text: `Bob Sand`.\n\n- **Conclusion**:\n  - Since Bob Sand is listed as a writer for episode 149, the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row where 'no in series' equals 149.\",\n    \"Check the 'written by' column for that row to see who wrote the episode.\",\n    \"Confirm that Bob Sand's name appears in the writer information for episode 149.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
