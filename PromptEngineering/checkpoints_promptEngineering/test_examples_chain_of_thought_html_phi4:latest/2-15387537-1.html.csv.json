    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corinthians not tying any game in the 1924 season is true or false, we need to examine the specific data provided in the table regarding the team's performance.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Team:**\n   - The claim pertains to \"Corinthian.\" In the table, this team is listed as \"corinthians.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row for Corinthians:**\n   - Look at each row in the table and find the one where the team name matches \"corinthians.\"\n   - In the first row (row index 0), the team name is \"corinthians.\"\n\n3. **Check 'Drawn' Column:**\n   - The column labeled \"drawn\" represents the number of games that were tied.\n   - Locate this column in the table, which is positioned fourth from the left.\n\n4. **Examine the Data for Corinthians:**\n   - In the first row (row index 0), under the \"drawn\" column, the value is `1`.\n   - This indicates that Corinthians had one game tied.\n\n5. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Corinthian didn't tie any game,\" which would mean the number in the 'drawn' column should be 0.\n   - Since the table shows `1`, it contradicts the claim, indicating that Corinthians did indeed tie one game.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because the data indicates that Corinthians tied one game during the season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify if Corinthians didn't tie any games, locate 'corinthians' in the table.
