    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The claim pertains to which venue (home ground) corresponds to a specific team. Therefore, we need to look at both the \"home team\" and \"venue\" columns.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for Carlton:**\n   - Find the row where the \"home team\" is listed as \"carlton.\" This will help us identify their home venue.\n   \n3. **Check the Venue for Carlton:**\n   - Once we locate the row with \"carlton\" in the \"home team\" column, examine the corresponding entry in the \"venue\" column to see if it matches \"princes park.\"\n\n4. **Review the Data:**\n   - In the table:\n     - Row 3 has \"carlton\" listed as the home team.\n     - The venue for this row is \"princes park.\"\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"carlton\" is indeed associated with \"princes park\" in the table, the claim that \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the relevant columns 'home team' and 'venue.' Locate the row where 'carlton' is listed as the home team. Check the corresponding venue for this row. It shows 'princes park,' confirming the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
