The column with date information is labeled \"Date.\"\n\n2. **Find the Corresponding Attendance**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct date, we will check the value in the \"Attendance\" column for this specific row.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - Compare the retrieved attendance number from April 29 with the claim of 49,194 to verify its accuracy.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- **Locate April 29**: \n  - Search through the \"Date\" column and find the entry that reads \"April 29.\"\n\n- **Retrieve Attendance for April 29**:\n  - Once we locate the row for April 29, check the value in the \"Attendance\" column of this row.\n\n- **Compare with Claimed Value**:\n  - The table shows that on April 29, the attendance is recorded as 49,194. \n\n- **Conclusion**:\n  - Since the retrieved attendance matches exactly with the claimed value, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row for April 29**:\n  - The row index where \"Date\" is April 29 and \"Attendance\" is 49,194 needs to be identified.\n  \nAfter examining the table, here's how it translates into specific data:\n\n- **Relevant Data**:\n  - Row with Date: \"April 29\"\n  - Attendance in this row: 49194\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim about attendance on April 29, we locate the date within the table and check its corresponding attendance value.
