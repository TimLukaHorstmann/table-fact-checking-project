Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - \"high points\": Andre Miller (28). No mention of Lamarcus Aldridge. Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 11:**\n  - \"high points\": Martell Webster (28). No mention of Lamarcus Aldridge. Not relevant.\n\n- **Row 12:** \n  - \"high points\": Lamarcus Aldridge, Juwan Howard (16).\n  - Result: Portland lost (97-98). Not a win for the claim.\n\n- **Row 13:**\n  - \"high points\": Lamarcus Aldridge (25).\n  - Result: Portland lost (95-106). Not a win for the claim.\n\n- **Row 14:**\n  - \"high points\": Rudy Fernandez (25). No mention of Lamarcus Aldridge. Not relevant.\n\n- **Summary:**\n  - Instances where Lamarcus Aldridge leads or ties:\n    - Row 12: Tied with Juwan Howard, lost the game.\n    - Row 13: Led alone, lost the game.\n  - Total instances found = 2 (less than three required by claim).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Lamarcus Aldridge led or tied for the highest score in three games and that Portland won all those games.
