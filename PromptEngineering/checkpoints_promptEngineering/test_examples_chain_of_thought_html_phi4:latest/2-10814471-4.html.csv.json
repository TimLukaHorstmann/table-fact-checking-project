We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches at Wilderspool**: Scan the \"Date\" column to find all entries where the \"Venue\" is listed as Wilderspool.\n2. **Count Matches at Wilderspool**: Count how many times Wilderspool appears as a venue in the table.\n3. **Verify the Specific Date**: Check if there is indeed a match on 9/9/01 at Wilderspool.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Entries with Wilderspool Venue**:\n   - Scan through each row to find entries where \"Venue\" equals \"Wilderspool\".\n\n2. **List Matches at Wilderspool**:\n   - From the table, we can identify the following rows with Wilderspool as the venue:\n     - Row 34: Date is \"4 / 8 / 01\", Result is \"l\" (loss), and Venue is \"wilderspool\".\n     - Row 44: Date is \"9 / 9 / 01\", Result is \"w\" (win), and Venue is \"wilderspool\".\n\n3. **Count the Matches**:\n   - There are two matches listed at Wilderspool.\n\n4. **Check for Match on 9/9/01**:\n   - The entry in Row 44 shows a match on \"9 / 9 / 01\" with Wilderspool as the venue, confirming it is one of the matches played there.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"9 / 9 / 01 be 1 of 3 match at the wilderspool venue.\"\n   - We found only two matches at Wilderspool, not three.\n   - Therefore, the specific part of the claim stating it is one of \"three\" matches is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"9/9/01 be 1 of 3 match at the wilderspool venue\" is false because there are only two matches at Wilderspool, not three.
