    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"every player with a position of center have been from the United States\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table to find all players listed under the position \"center\" (or positions including \"center\") and check their nationality.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Center Position:**\n   - Look through the 'position' column for entries that include the word \"center\".\n   - From the table, relevant rows are:\n     - Row 3: Chris Gatling (Position: \"forward - center\")\n     - Row 7: Marcin Gortat (Position: \"center\")\n     - Row 8 & 9: Horace Grant (Position: \"forward - center\" for both entries)\n\n2. **Check Nationality for Each Relevant Player:**\n   - For each player identified in step 1, check the 'nationality' column to determine if they are from the United States.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Each Row:**\n   - **Row 3 (Chris Gatling):** \n     - Position includes \"center\".\n     - Nationality is \"united states\". This satisfies the claim.\n   - **Row 7 (Marcin Gortat):**\n     - Position is \"center\".\n     - Nationality is \"poland\". This does not satisfy the claim, as Marcin Gortat is not from the United States.\n   - **Rows 8 & 9 (Horace Grant):**\n     - Position includes \"center\" for both entries.\n     - Nationality is \"united states\" for both entries. These satisfy the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of Marcin Gortat, who plays as a center and is from Poland, contradicts the claim that every player with a position including center has been from the United States.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3:\n  - Position: \"forward - center\"\n  - Nationality: \"united states\"\n  \n- Row 7:\n  - Position: \"center\"\n  - Nationality: \"poland\"\n\n- Rows 8 and 9:\n  - Position: \"forward - center\" (both rows)\n  - Nationality: \"united states\" (both rows)\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify players with the position 'center'. Check their nationality. Chris Gatling and Horace Grant are from the United States, but Marcin Gortat is not.
