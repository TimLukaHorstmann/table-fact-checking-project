This implies that we are looking for a win (\"w\") where our team scored more than 109 points.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Date**: We need to check if there is any entry in the table corresponding to the date \"April 18\".\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**: Go through each row of the table to find the game on April 18 and compare its score with \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\".\n\n4. **Check for Missing Dates**: If no row corresponds to April 18, then there is no game on that date, making the claim FALSE by default.\n\n5. **Evaluate Scores**: If a game exists on April 18, check if it was a win and whether the score of our team exceeds 109 points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Examination:\n\n- **Row 1 (April 1)**: Score is \"w 119 - 107 (ot)\".\n- **Row 2 (April 3)**: Score is \"l 103 - 113 (ot)\".\n- **Row 3 (April 6)**: Score is \"l 74 - 104 (ot)\".\n- **Row 4 (April 8)**: Score is \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\".\n- **Row 5 (April 9)**: Score is \"l 97 - 110 (ot)\".\n- **Row 6 (April 11)**: Score is \"l 90 - 94 (ot)\".\n- **Row 7 (April 12)**: Score is \"w 105 - 93 (ot)\".\n- **Row 8 (April 15)**: Score is \"l 90 - 101 (ot)\".\n- **Row 9 (April 17)**: Score is \"l 98 - 103 (ot)\".\n- **Row 10 (April 19)**: Score is \"w 127 - 109 (ot)\".\n- **Row 11 (April 20)**: Score is \"l 95 - 104 (ot)\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There is no row corresponding to April 18 in the table.
