    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"James Campbell be 2 pick ahead of Rodney McCray in round 1\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for both players with respect to their draft rounds and pick numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows from the table:**\n   - For **Rodney McCray**, find his row:\n     - Round: 1\n     - Pick: 3\n\n   - For **James Campbell**, find his row:\n     - Round: 9\n     - Pick: 185\n\n2. **Check if both players are in the same round (Round 1):**\n   - Rodney McCray is indeed in Round 1.\n   - James Campbell, however, is listed under Round 9.\n\n3. **Assess the claim based on rounds and picks:**\n   - The claim states that James Campbell should be \"2 pick ahead of Rodney McCray\" specifically in \"round 1\".\n   - Since James Campbell was not selected in Round 1 (he was picked in Round 9), it is impossible for him to have any pick number relative to Rodney McCray's pick in Round 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim cannot be true because the condition of both players being in Round 1 is not met.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Rodney McCray was picked at position 3 in Round 1, whereas James Campbell was picked at position 185 in Round 9. The claim requires both players to be in the same round for their pick numbers to be compared directly. Since they are not in the same round, the claim cannot be true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
