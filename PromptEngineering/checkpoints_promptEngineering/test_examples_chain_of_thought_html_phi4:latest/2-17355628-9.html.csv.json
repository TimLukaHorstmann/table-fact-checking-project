    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Oklahoma City Thunder do not break 100 points at all during March 2009\" is true or false, we will examine each game played by the team in March 2009 according to the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to look for games played by Oklahoma City Thunder (assumed from context) in March 2009 and check their scores.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Game**:\n   - For each game listed, locate the \"Score\" column under the team score (the score before the hyphen). This represents the points scored by the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n3. **Check for Scores Over 100 Points**:\n   - Go through each row in the table and identify if any of the scores are greater than or equal to 100.\n   \n4. **Game-by-Game Analysis**:\n   - Game 67 (March 7 vs. New Orleans): Score = 98\n   - Game 68 (March 9 vs. Denver): Score = 107\n   - Game 69 (March 11 vs. Golden State): Score = 92\n   - Game 70 (March 13 vs. Sacramento): Score = 99\n   - Game 71 (March 15 vs. L.A. Clippers): Score = 104\n   - Game 72 (March 17 at Portland): Score = 107\n   - Game 73 (March 19 vs. Dallas): Score = 96\n   - Game 74 (March 21 at Houston): Score = 99\n   - Game 75 (March 23 vs. Phoenix): Score = 102\n   - Game 76 (March 25 at L.A. Lakers): Score = 97\n   - Game 77 (March 27 vs. Denver): Score = 103\n   - Game 78 (March 29 vs. Milwaukee): Score = 100\n   - Game 79 (March 31 at Utah): Score = 101\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Games where the team scored over 100 points are: March 9, March 15, March 17, March 23, March 29, and March 31.\n   - Therefore, the claim that they did not break 100 points in any game during March is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games played by Oklahoma City Thunder in March 2009.\",\n    \"Check each game's score to see if it exceeds or equals 100 points.\",\n    \"List all scores greater than or equal to 100 points.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is false because there are multiple instances where they scored over 100 points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 75, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 76, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 77, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 78, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 79, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
