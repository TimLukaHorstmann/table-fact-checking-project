    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to carefully examine the specific details provided within it. The claim states: \"north melbourne's away team score be 13.11 (89).\"\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**:\n   - We are looking for a match involving North Melbourne as the \"away team.\" In the context of the table, this means checking each row to see if North Melbourne is listed under the column labeled \"away team.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - The first row lists Footscray as the home team and Hawthorn as the away team.\n   - The second row lists Fitzroy as the home team and Geelong as the away team.\n   - The third row lists Essendon as the home team and South Melbourne as the away team.\n   - The fourth row lists St Kilda as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team. This is our relevant row for checking the claim.\n\n3. **Verify the Away Team Score**:\n   - In the fourth row, where North Melbourne is listed as the away team, we check the \"away team score\" column.\n   - The entry in this column reads \"13.11 (89),\" which matches exactly with what the claim states for North Melbourne's away team score.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the score of 13.11 (89) is indeed listed under the fourth row in the \"away team score\" column where North Melbourne is the away team, the claim is accurate.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells Identification**:\n   - The relevant cell containing this information is found at:\n     - Row index: 4\n     - Column name: \"away team score\"\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row where North Melbourne is listed as the away team.\",\n    \"Check that row for the 'away team score' column to verify if it matches 13.11 (89).\",\n    \"In the fourth row, North Melbourne is indeed the away team with a score of 13.11 (89), matching the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
