This means there should be a record with more than 78 wins or fewer than 84 losses.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Row for the Month of September**:\n   - We will go through each row to identify the win-loss record for games played in September and compare them to \"78-84.\"\n\n4. **Extract Records from Table**:\n   - **September 24**: Record is \"73 - 84\" (Lower wins, higher losses).\n   - **September 25**: Record is \"74 - 84\" (Lower wins, same losses).\n   - **September 26**: Record is \"75 - 84\" (Lower wins, same losses).\n   - **September 27**: Record is \"76 - 84\" (Lower wins, same losses).\n   - **September 28**: Record is \"77 - 84\" (Lower wins, same losses).\n   - **September 29**: Record is \"78 - 84\" (This matches the record in question).\n\n5. **Identify Any Higher Records**:\n   - The highest win count found for September is 78 (on September 29), with no records exceeding this number.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since no other month has more than 78 wins and all other September records have fewer wins, \"78-84\" is indeed the highest record in September.
