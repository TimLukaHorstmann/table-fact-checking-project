We will first locate this specific entry within the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for 7 April 1987**:\n   - Examine each row in the `<tbody>` section to find a match with the date \"7 April 1987\".\n\n3. **Verify the Opponent in Final**:\n   - Once we locate the row corresponding to 7 April 1987, check the value under the column labeled \"opponent in final\" to see if it matches \"John McEnroe\".\n\n4. **Check Consistency with Other Details (Optional)**:\n   - As a further verification step, ensure that other details like the tournament and surface match expected values for cross-verification.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Row Analysis**:\n  - Row 7 corresponds to the date \"7 April 1987\".\n  - In this row, the \"opponent in final\" column contains \"John McEnroe\".\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied (the opponent on that date is indeed John McEnroe), the claim is confirmed as true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row Index**: 6 (since rows are zero-indexed in most programming contexts)\n- **Columns**:\n  - `date`: \"7 April 1987\"\n  - `opponent in final`: \"John McEnroe\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies the date as '7 April 1987'.

Therefore, Ivan Lendl is not mentioned as the opponent for this date.\n\n   #### b. Seoul Olympics:\n   - Look for a row with the tournament name \"seoul olympics\".\n   - The table shows:\n     - Date: 20 September 1988\n     - Tournament: Seoul Olympics\n     - Surface: Hard\n     - Opponent in Final: Tim Mayotte\n     - Score in Final: 3 - 6, 6 - 2, 6 - 4, 6 - 2\n\n   This indicates that the tournament \"Seoul Olympics\" occurred on \"20 September 1988\", with Tim Mayotte as the opponent. Ivan Lendl is not mentioned for this event.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim combines two different tournaments/dates incorrectly.\n- There is no single entry in the table where both conditions (13 March 1989 and Seoul Olympics) are satisfied simultaneously, nor is Ivan Lendl listed as an opponent on either date or tournament mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n1. **Row for \"13 march 1989\":**\n   - Row index: 10\n   - Column name: \"tourney\", \"opponent in final\"\n\n2. **Row for \"seoul olympics\":**\n   - Row index: 9\n   - Column name: \"date\", \"opponent in final\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is checked against the table by looking at each part of it separately.
