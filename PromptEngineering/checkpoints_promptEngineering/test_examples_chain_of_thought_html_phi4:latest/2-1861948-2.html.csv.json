The claim involves both a specific date (\"September 15, 1992\") and a specific label (\"Warner Bros Records\").\n\n2. **Locate Entries with the Specific Date**:\n   - Examine each row in the table to find entries where the 'date' is \"September 15, 1992\".\n\n3. **Check Labels for the Specific Date**:\n   - For any entry found in step 2, check the 'label' column to see if it matches \"Warner Bros Records\".\n   \n4. **Verify Uniqueness**:\n   - Ensure that \"September 15, 1992\" is the only date associated with the label \"Warner Bros Records\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"September 15, 1992 be the earliest date with catalogue CAD 2014 CD\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for entries where the catalog number matches \"CAD 2014 CD\" and identify their corresponding dates.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Entries with Catalogue 'CAD 2014 CD':**\n   - Look at the \"catalogue\" column for any entries that match \"cad 2014 cd\" (case-insensitive comparison).\n   \n2. **Examine Dates Associated with These Entries:**\n   - For each entry found in step 1, note down the corresponding date from the \"date\" column.\n\n3. **Compare Dates to Determine Earliest Entry:**\n   - Compare the dates identified in step 2 to see which is the earliest.\n   \n4. **Check Against Claimed Date (September 15, 1992):**\n   - The claim states that September 15, 1992 should be the earliest date for catalogue \"CAD 2014 CD\". Verify this by checking if there are any entries with a date earlier than September 15, 1992.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n\n- **First Entry:**\n  - Catalogue: \"cad 2014 cd\"\n  - Date: September 14, 1992\n  - This entry matches the catalogue and has an earlier date than September 15, 1992.\n\n- **Other Entries with 'CAD 2014 CD':**\n  - Second entry (same country) on September 14, 1992, but different format.\n  - Third entry on July 6, 1998, which is a reissue and does not match the date claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe earliest date for catalogue \"CAD 2014 CD\" is September 14, 1992, not September 15, 1992. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified entries with catalogue 'cad 2014 cd'.
