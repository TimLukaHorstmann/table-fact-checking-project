    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Santos and Cruzeiro qualify for the same number of tournaments\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to count how many tournaments each team qualified for based on the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate the rows corresponding to Santos and Cruzeiro in the table.\n   - For Santos, this is the 10th row (index 9).\n   - For Cruzeiro, this is the 4th row (index 3).\n\n2. **Check Qualifications for Each Tournament:**\n   - A team qualifies if their entry in a tournament column is anything other than \"did not qualify\" or \"n / a\".\n\n3. **Cruzeiro's Qualifications:**\n   - Copa Libertadores 1993: \"Did not qualify\"\n   - Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: \"Quarterfinals\" (Qualified)\n   - Copa Conmebol 1993: \"Did not qualify\"\n   - Recopa Sudamericana 1993: \"Runner-up\" (Qualified)\n   - Intercontinental Cup 1993: \"n / a\"\n\n   Cruzeiro qualified for 2 tournaments.\n\n4. **Santos' Qualifications:**\n   - Copa Libertadores 1993: \"Did not qualify\"\n   - Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: \"Round of 16\" (Qualified)\n   - Copa Conmebol 1993: \"Did not qualify\"\n   - Recopa Sudamericana 1993: \"n / a\"\n   - Intercontinental Cup 1993: \"n / a\"\n\n   Santos qualified for 1 tournament.\n\n5. **Compare the Number of Qualifications:**\n   - Cruzeiro qualified for 2 tournaments.\n   - Santos qualified for 1 tournament.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the number of qualifications differs (Cruzeiro has 2, and Santos has 1), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For Cruzeiro:\n  - Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: \"Quarterfinals\"\n  - Recopa Sudamericana 1993: \"Runner-up\"\n\n- For Santos:\n  - Supercopa Sudamericana 1993: \"Round of 16\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the rows for Santos and Cruzeiro in the table.\",\n    \"Check each tournament column to see if they qualified (i.e., anything other than 'did not qualify' or 'n/a').\",\n    \"Cruzeiro qualifies for Supercopa Sudamericana 1993 and Recopa Sudamericana 1993, totaling 2 qualifications.\",\n    \"Santos qualifies only for Supercopa Sudamericana 1993, totaling 1 qualification.\",\n    \"Since the number of qualifications differs, the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"supercopa sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"recopa sudamericana 1993\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"supercopa sudamericana 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
