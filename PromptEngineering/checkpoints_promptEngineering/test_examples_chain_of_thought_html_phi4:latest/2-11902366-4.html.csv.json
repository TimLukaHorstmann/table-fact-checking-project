These are the games played by New Jersey at home.\n   - The relevant rows for home games are:\n     - November 2: New Jersey vs. Toronto (Attendance: 14523)\n     - November 8: New Jersey vs. Philadelphia (Attendance: 14948)\n     - November 17: New Jersey vs. Philadelphia (Attendance: 19621)\n     - November 21: New Jersey vs. Pittsburgh (Attendance: 17132)\n     - November 23: New Jersey vs. Atlanta (Attendance: 18545)\n     - November 24: New Jersey vs. Tampa Bay (Attendance: 19077)\n     - November 28: New Jersey vs. Dallas (Attendance: 13665)\n     - November 30: New Jersey vs. Montreal (Attendance: 15081)\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures for Home Games:**\n   - List the attendance figures for these games:\n     - November 2: 14523\n     - November 8: 14948\n     - November 17: 19621\n     - November 21: 17132\n     - November 23: 18545\n     - November 24: 19077\n     - November 28: 13665\n     - November 30: 15081\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - Compare the attendance figures to find the lowest one:\n     - The lowest attendance is 13665 on November 28 against Dallas.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the game with the lowest attendance was played against New Jersey Devils.\n   - Since the lowest attendance (13665) was for a home game against Dallas, and not against any other team, this means the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"the lowest attendance game be play against the new jersey devil\" is TRUE because the game with the lowest attendance listed in the table was indeed played by New Jersey at home.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games where New Jersey is listed as 'home'.\",\n    \"Extract the attendance figures for these home games.\",\n    \"Compare the attendance figures to find the lowest one.\",\n    \"Verify if the game with the lowest attendance was indeed a home game against New Jersey.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is true since the lowest attendance game (13665) was a home game against Dallas.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
