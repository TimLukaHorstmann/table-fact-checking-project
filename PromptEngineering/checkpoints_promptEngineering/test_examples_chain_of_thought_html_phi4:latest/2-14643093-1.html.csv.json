The first row indicates this: \"tian pengfei be rank\" followed by specific ranks for each year.\n\n2. **Extract Rankings for 2008/09 and 2012/13:**\n   - From the first row, locate the columns corresponding to the years:\n     - For 2008/09, the cell value is `11`.\n     - For 2012/13, the cell value is `69`.\n\n3. **Calculate Rank Change:**\n   - Determine the difference in ranks between these two years.\n   - The rank in 2008/09 is `11`, and in 2012/13 it is `69`.\n   - Calculate the change: \\( 69 - 11 = 58 \\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Tian Pengfei was ranked \"11 rank higher\" in 2008/09 than in 2012/13.\n   - A rank \"higher\" implies a lower numerical value, so being 11 ranks higher would mean a difference of `-11`.\n   - However, the actual change is `+58`, indicating he ranked significantly lower in 2012/13 compared to 2008/09.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that Tian Pengfei was ranked 11 ranks higher in 2008/09 than in 2012/13 is false based on the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify Tian Pengfei's ranking for the years 2008/09 and 2012/13 from the table.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I'll approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are looking for occurrences of \"2r\" and \"lq\" across all rows for Tian Pengfei.\n\n2. **Scan Each Row:**\n   - For each row in the table, identify and count the number of times \"2r\" appears.\n   - Similarly, identify and count the number of times \"lq\" appears.\n\n3. **Compare Counts:**\n   - Compare the total counts of \"2r\" and \"lq\" to see which is greater.\n\n4. **Determine the Result:**\n   - If the count of \"2r\" is greater than \"lq\", then Tian Pengfei has more 2r finishes.\n   - Otherwise, he does not have more 2r finishes than lq finishes.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Contains \"nr\" and \"2r\". (1 occurrence of \"2r\")\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Contains \"lq\" (3 occurrences)\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Contains \"lq\" (5 occurrences)\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Contains \"2r\" (1 occurrence)\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Contains \"2r\" (2 occurrences)\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Contains \"1r\", no \"2r\" or \"lq\"\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Contains \"lq\" (3 occurrences)\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Contains \"lq\" (4 occurrences)\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - No relevant data\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - No relevant data\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - No relevant data\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - Contains \"2r\" (1 occurrence), \"lq\" (3 occurrences)\n\n- **Row 12:**\n  - Contains \"lq\" (7 occurrences)\n\n- **Row 13:**\n  - Contains \"a\", no \"2r\" or \"lq\"\n\n- **Row 14:** \n  - No relevant data\n\n- **Row 15:** \n  - No relevant data\n\n- **Row 16:** \n  - Contains \"1r\", no \"2r\" or \"lq\"\n\n- **Row 17:**\n  - Contains \"a\", no \"2r\" or \"lq\"\n\n- **Row 18:**\n  - No relevant data\n\n- **Row 19:**\n  - Contains \"not held\", no \"2r\" or \"lq\"\n\n- **Row 20:**\n  - Contains \"not held\", no \"2r\" or \"lq\"\n\n- **Row 21:**\n  - No relevant data\n\n- **Row 22:**\n  - Contains \"a\", \"sf\", and \"ranking\", no \"2r\" or \"lq\"\n\n**Count of occurrences:**\n\n- Total \"2r\": 5 (Rows 0, 3, 4, 11)\n- Total \"lq\": 21 (Rows 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12)\n\nWith this information:\n\n- Tian Pengfei has 5 finishes in the second round (\"2r\").\n- He has lost in the qualifying rounds (\"lq\") a total of 21 times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTian Pengfei does not have more \"2r\" finishes than \"lq\" finishes.
