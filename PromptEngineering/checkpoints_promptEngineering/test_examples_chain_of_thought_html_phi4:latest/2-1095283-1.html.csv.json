Here\u2019s a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Cyanogen Bromide Row**: \n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"cyanogen bromide\" within the table.\n\n2. **Field Stability**:\n   - Find the value for \"field stability\" in the cyanogen bromide row.\n   - According to the table, this value is `5`.\n\n3. **Effectiveness as Blood Agent**:\n   - Locate the entry for \"effectiveness as blood agent\" in the cyanogen bromide row.\n   - The table lists this effectiveness as `9`.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that cyanogen bromide has a field stability of 5 and an effectiveness as a blood agent of 9.\n   - We observe from the table: \n     - Field Stability = 5 (matches the claim)\n     - Effectiveness as Blood Agent = 9 (also matches the claim)\n\nBased on these observations, both parts of the claim are accurate according to the data in the table.\n\nHere is the final output with the relevant details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row for cyanogen bromide.
