    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"week 13 have the most crowd attend\" is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance figures for each week listed in the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Week 13 Attendance:**  \n   - From the table, locate row corresponding to week 13.\n   - Row 12 (considering zero-based indexing) has an attendance of 30,936.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Weeks' Attendances:**\n   - Check each row for its attendance value and compare it to 30,936 (attendance for Week 13).\n\n3. **List of Attendance Values:**  \n   - Week 1: 44,773\n   - Week 2: 46,460\n   - Week 3: 59,983\n   - Week 4: 80,291\n   - Week 5: 47,583\n   - Week 6: 46,751\n   - Week 7: 44,487\n   - Week 8: 56,191\n   - Week 9: 52,060\n   - Week 10: 46,264\n   - Week 11: 46,032\n   - **Week 13**: 30,936\n   - Week 14: 65,649\n   - Week 15: 42,202\n   - Week 16: 51,064\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum Attendance:**\n   - The maximum attendance is found in Week 4 with 80,291 attendees.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   - Week 13 does not have the most crowd attend since its attendance (30,936) is lower than several other weeks, particularly Week 4 which has the highest attendance of 80,291.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Attendance for each week needs to be checked:\n     - Week 1: Row 0, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 2: Row 1, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 3: Row 2, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 4: Row 3, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 5: Row 4, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 6: Row 5, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 7: Row 6, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 8: Row 7, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 9: Row 8, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 10: Row 9, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 11: Row 10, Column \"attendance\"\n     - **Week 13**: Row 12, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 14: Row 13, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 15: Row 14, Column \"attendance\"\n     - Week 16: Row 15, Column \"attendance\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We compared the attendance for week 13 with all other weeks and found that week 4 has the highest attendance of 80,291.
