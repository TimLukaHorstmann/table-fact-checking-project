    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 2 goaltenders were selected between pick numbers 43 and 63\" is true or false, we will examine the relevant portion of the table for each pick number from 43 to 63.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** We need to focus on the rows with pick numbers ranging from 43 to 63.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Row's Position Column:** For these rows, check if the \"position\" column indicates that a goaltender was selected.\n\n3. **Count Goalkeepers:** Keep a count of how many times the position is listed as \"goaltender.\"\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step analysis of each row between pick numbers 43 and 63:\n\n- **Pick 43**: Position is \"left wing\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 44**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 45**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 46**: Position is \"centre\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 47**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 48**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 49**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 50**: Not in the table. \n- **Pick 51**: Not in the table.\n- **Pick 52**: Not in the table.\n- **Pick 53**: Not in the table.\n- **Pick 54**: Not in the table.\n- **Pick 55**: Not in the table.\n- **Pick 56**: Position is \"goaltender\". (First goaltender)\n- **Pick 57**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 58**: Position is \"centre\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 59**: Position is \"centre\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 60**: Position is \"right wing\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 61**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 62**: Position is \"defence\". (Not a goaltender)\n- **Pick 63**: Position is \"centre\". (Not a goaltender)\n\nAfter examining the rows, we find that only one player with the position of \"goaltender\" was selected between picks 43 and 63.\n\nTherefore, the claim that more than two goalies were selected in this range is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows from pick numbers 43 to 63.\",\n    \"Check the 'position' column for each of these rows to see if it is 'goaltender'.\",\n    \"Count how many times 'goaltender' appears in this range.\",\n    \"There is only one goaltender selected (pick 56).\",\n    \"The claim states more than two, but only one was found.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
