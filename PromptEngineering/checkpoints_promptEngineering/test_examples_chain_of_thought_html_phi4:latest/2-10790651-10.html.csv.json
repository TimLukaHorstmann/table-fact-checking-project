    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the spectator count at venues on June 29, 1935, is true or false, we will examine each row of the table for the relevant information regarding the crowd sizes. Here's how to approach it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The claim pertains to spectator counts, so we focus on the \"crowd\" column.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - We need to check each row for the crowd size and compare it against 7000 spectators.\n\n3. **Row-by-Row Analysis**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Home Team: Geelong\n     - Venue: Corio Oval\n     - Crowd: 7000\n     - Since this is exactly 7000, it does not exceed the threshold.\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Home Team: Fitzroy\n     - Venue: Brunswick Street Oval\n     - Crowd: 11000\n     - This exceeds 7000 spectators. Therefore, the claim is false based on this row alone.\n   - Since we've found a counterexample in Row 2, further rows do not need to be checked for crowd size exceeding 7000 because one instance of exceeding invalidates the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that \"none of the venues have more than 7000 spectators,\" but at least one venue (Brunswick Street Oval) had a crowd of 11000, which contradicts the claim.\n\n5. **List Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 2 is relevant as it contains the counterexample with a crowd size exceeding 7000.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined row by row for spectator counts in the 'crowd' column. The claim was that none of the venues had more than 7000 spectators.
