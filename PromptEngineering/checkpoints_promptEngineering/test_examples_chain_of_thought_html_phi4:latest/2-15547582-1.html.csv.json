    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine each row related to the panels and verify if any industrial and commercial panel meets all three conditions specified:\n\n1. A labour panel greater than 1.\n2. Nominated by the Taoiseach less than or equal to 11.\n3. Cultural and educational panel smaller than 0.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n### Analysis of Each Row\n\n- **Fianna F\u00e1il:**\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 3\n  - Labour Panel = 2 (greater than 1)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach = 9 (less than or equal to 11)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel = 3 (not smaller than 0)\n\n- **Fine Gael:**\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 1\n  - Labour Panel = 1 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Labour Party:**\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 0\n\n- **Clann na Talmhan:**\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 0\n\n- **Clann na Poblachta:**\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 0\n\n- **Independent:**\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel = 3\n  - Labour Panel = 2 (greater than 1)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach = 0 (less than or equal to 11)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel = 0 (not smaller than 0)\n\n- **Total Row:**\n  - This row is a summation of all values, not applicable for individual conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- Fianna F\u00e1il has an industrial and commercial panel greater than 1 but fails the cultural and educational panel condition.\n- Independent meets the first two conditions (labour panel > 1, nominated by Taoiseach \u2264 11) but fails the third condition (cultural and educational panel < 0).\n\nNo row satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check each party to see if it meets all three conditions.\",\n    \"Fianna F\u00e1il: Industrial and Commercial = 3, Labour > 1, Nominated \u2264 11, but Cultural and Educational is not < 0.\",\n    \"Fine Gael: Industrial and Commercial = 1, Labour is not > 1.\",\n    \"Labour Party: Industrial and Commercial = 0.\",\n    \"Clann na Talmhan: Industrial and Commercial = 0.\",\n    \"Clann na Poblachta: Industrial and Commercial = 0.\",\n    \"Independent: Industrial and Commercial = 3, Labour > 1, Nominated \u2264 11, but Cultural and Educational is not < 0.\",\n    \"No party meets all conditions.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
