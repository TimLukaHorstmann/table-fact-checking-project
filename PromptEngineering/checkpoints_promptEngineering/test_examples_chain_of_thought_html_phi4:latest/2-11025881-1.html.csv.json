    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the points for the first-ranked participant and the last-ranked participant in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Points of the First-Ranked Participant:**\n   - The first rank corresponds to \"Mark Cockerell\" from the United States.\n   - According to the table, his score is 172.42 points.\n\n2. **Identify the Points of the Last-Ranked Participant:**\n   - The last rank in the provided data is 19, corresponding to \"Marc Franquet\" from Belgium.\n   - His score is 114.38 points.\n\n3. **Calculate the Gap Between First and Last:**\n   - Subtract the points of the last-ranked participant from those of the first-ranked participant:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gap} = 172.42 - 114.38 = 58.04\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the gap between first and last be less than 50 point.\"\n   - We calculated a gap of 58.04 points, which is greater than 50.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated gap (58.04) is not less than 50, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- First-ranked participant's score: \n  - Row index: 0\n  - Column name: \"points\"\n  - Value: 172.42\n\n- Last-ranked participant's score:\n  - Row index: 18\n  - Column name: \"points\"\n  - Value: 114.38\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the points for the first and last ranked participants.
