    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"4 of the competition be senior world championship\" is true or false, we need to analyze the given table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that 4 competitions in the table are \"senior world championships.\"\n\n2. **Identify Competitions in Table**:\n   - We will go through each row and check if the competition is a \"world championship\" for seniors.\n\n3. **Check Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Competition is \"world junior championships\", which is not a senior event.\n   - **Row 2**: Competition is \"european junior championships\", not related to world or senior level.\n   - **Row 3**: Competition is \"european u23 championships\", neither a world championship nor for seniors.\n   - **Row 4**: Competition is \"universiade\", which is not a world championship.\n   - **Row 5**: Competition is \"world championships\". This matches the senior level of the claim.\n   - **Row 6**: Competition is \"european championships\", not a world championship.\n   - **Row 7**: Competition is \"olympic games\", not a world championship.\n   - **Row 8**: Competition is \"world championships\". This is another match for the claim.\n   - **Row 9**: Competition is \"world championships\" again, matching the claim.\n   - **Row 10**: Competition is \"olympic games\", not a world championship.\n   - **Row 11**: Competition is \"world championships\", which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Count Matches**:\n   - We identified that there are three instances of \"world championships\" in the table (rows 5, 8, and 9).\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim Against Data**:\n   - The claim states there should be four competitions labeled as \"senior world championship.\" However, we only found three such entries.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because there are not four instances of \"world championships\" in the table; there are only three.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was checked row by row to identify competitions labeled as 'world championships.'

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich never threw for greater than 78 m\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant column in the table, which contains data under the \"notes\" section. This column shows the distances thrown by Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich in various competitions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of my reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The \"notes\" column provides the distance measurements for each competition year.\n2. **Examine Each Entry**:\n   - 1998: \"61.51 m\"\n   - 1999: \"64.20 m\"\n   - 2001: \"66.41 m\"\n   - 2003: \"71.26 m\"\n   - 2005: \"74.53 m\"\n   - 2006: \"73.77 m\"\n   - 2008: \"70.56 m\"\n   - 2009: \"74.47 m\"\n   - 2012: \"77.17 m\"\n   - 2013: \"79.36 m\"\n\n3. **Check for Distances Greater Than 78 m**: The last entry, from the year 2013, shows a distance of \"79.36 m,\" which is greater than 78 m.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich threw 79.36 m in 2013, he did indeed throw for greater than 78 m at least once.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells include:\n- The entry from 2013 under the \"notes\" column where it states \"79.36 m\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'notes' column contains distance measurements.
