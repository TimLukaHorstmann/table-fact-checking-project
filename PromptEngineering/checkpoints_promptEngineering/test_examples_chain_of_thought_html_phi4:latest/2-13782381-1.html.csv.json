    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about week 13's average result being \"l 28 - 17\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Week 13 Data**: \n   - Locate the row corresponding to week 13 in the table.\n   - Check the columns for `week`, `date`, `opponent`, `result`, `game site`, and `attendance`.\n\n2. **Extract Result for Week 13**:\n   - According to the table, for week 13, the result is \"l 28 - 17\".\n\n3. **Understand the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the average result for week 13 should be \"l 28 - 21\".\n   - Since there's only one game per week, the average result for any given week would be the same as the result of that single game.\n\n4. **Compare Extracted Result with Claim**:\n   - Week 13\u2019s actual result is \"l 28 - 17\", which matches exactly what is stated in the claim.\n   - There are no other results to average within a single week, so the concept of averaging doesn't apply beyond confirming that the single recorded result matches the claimed value.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim accurately reflects the data for week 13.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that for week 13, the result is 'l 28 - 17'.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about week 12 is true, we need to verify two things:\n\n1. **Verify Week 12 Details:** Check if the game result for week 12 is \"28 - 17\".\n2. **Average Calculation:** Calculate the average of all game results in terms of points scored by the team and compare it with the week 12 result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### Step 1: Verify Week 12 Details\n- Locate the row for week 12 in the table.\n- Check the \"result\" column to see if it matches \"28 - 17\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Week 12 Result:** The result listed is \"31 - 20\". This does not match \"28 - 17\".\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate Average Game Result\nTo calculate the average, we need to extract and process each game's score:\n\n1. Extract scores for both teams from each week.\n2. Calculate the total points scored by the team in all games.\n3. Calculate the total points scored against the team in all games.\n4. Compute the average points scored by the team per game.\n5. Compute the average points scored against the team per game.\n\n**Extracting Scores:**\n- Week 1: Scored 23, Opponent 14\n- Week 2: Scored 23, Opponent 17\n- Week 3: Scored 43, Opponent 23\n- Week 4: Scored 28, Opponent 26\n- Week 5: Scored 28, Opponent 21\n- Week 6: Scored 17, Opponent 16\n- Week 7: Scored 24, Opponent 20\n- Week 8: Scored 28, Opponent 7\n- Week 9: Scored 20, Opponent 30\n- Week 10: Scored 17, Opponent 31\n- Week 11: Scored 5, Opponent 9\n- Week 12: Scored 20, Opponent 31\n- Week 13: Scored 17, Opponent 28\n- Week 14: Scored 10, Opponent 20\n- Week 15: Scored 21, Opponent 17\n- Week 16: Scored 21, Opponent 41\n\n**Calculating Totals and Averages:**\n- Total Points Scored by Team = 23 + 23 + 43 + 28 + 28 + 17 + 24 + 28 + 20 + 17 + 5 + 20 + 17 + 10 + 21 + 21 = 345\n- Total Games = 16\n- Average Points Scored by Team = 345 / 16 \u2248 21.56\n\n- Total Points Against Team = 14 + 17 + 23 + 26 + 21 + 16 + 20 + 7 + 30 + 31 + 9 + 31 + 28 + 20 + 17 + 41 = 351\n- Average Points Scored Against Team = 351 / 16 \u2248 21.94\n\nThe average result for the team is approximately \"22 - 22\" when rounded to whole numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Week 12's result (\"31 - 20\") does not match the calculated average result (\"22 - 22\").\n- Therefore, the claim that week 12 has a result of \"28 - 17\" and it being the average is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
