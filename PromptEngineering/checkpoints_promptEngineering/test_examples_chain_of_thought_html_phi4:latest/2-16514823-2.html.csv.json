    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"g\u00f6teborg be match up with ullevi as an opponent on september 19th 2015\" is true or false, we need to analyze the given table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The table has columns for `Date`, `Venue`, and `Opponent`. We need these to verify if G\u00f6teborg played at Ullevi against a specific opponent on September 19, 2015.\n\n2. **Locate the Date in the Table**: Search the table for an entry with the date \"2005 - 09 - 19\". This is crucial as it directly relates to the claim's specified date.\n\n3. **Examine the Row for the Date**:\n   - Find the row where `Date` is \"2005 - 09 - 19\".\n   - Check the corresponding `Venue` and `Opponent`.\n\n4. **Verify the Venue**: \n   - The claim specifies Ullevi as the venue. Confirm if the venue for this date matches Ullevi.\n\n5. **Verify the Opponent**:\n   - The claim mentions G\u00f6teborg as the opponent. Check if the opponent listed in the table is indeed G\u00f6teborg.\n\n6. **Check Year Consistency**: \n   - The claim states \"2015\", but our data is from 2005. This discrepancy needs to be noted, although it doesn't affect the truth value of the match occurrence itself on that date.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row for Date \"2005 - 09 - 19\"**:\n  - `Venue`: Ullevi\n  - `Opponent`: g\u00f6teborg\n\nThe table confirms that on September 19, 2005, there was a match at Ullevi against G\u00f6teborg. The year discrepancy (2015 vs. 2005) is noted but does not affect the occurrence of the event itself.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim about the match occurring at Ullevi with G\u00f6teborg as the opponent on September 19th is true for the year 2005.\n- However, since the claim specifies 2015, and there's no data provided for that year in the table, the claim as stated is false due to the incorrect year.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table confirms a match at Ullevi against G\u00f6teborg on September 19, 2005. However, the claim specifies 2015, and no data for that year is provided. Therefore, the claim is false due to the incorrect year.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"Date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"Venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
