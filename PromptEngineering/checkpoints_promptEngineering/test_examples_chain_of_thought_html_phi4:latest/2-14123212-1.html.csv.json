However, since the term \"translator\" is not explicitly used in this dataset and all FCC info entries are labeled as \"fcc,\" we'll assume it means any listed entry.\n\n2. **Check Frequency Ranges**:\n   - Frequencies in the 100s (i.e., between 100.0 MHz and 109.9 MHz).\n   - Frequencies in the 90s (i.e., between 90.0 MHz and 99.9 MHz).\n\n3. **Count Entries in Each Range**:\n\n   - **Frequencies in the 100s**:\n     - `w264bf`: 100.7 MHz\n     - `w276bm`: 103.1 MHz\n     - `w293al`: 106.5 MHz\n\n     There are 3 entries with frequencies in the 100s.\n\n   - **Frequencies in the 90s**:\n     - `w221by`: 92.1 MHz\n     - `w223au`: 92.5 MHz\n\n     There are only 2 entries with frequencies in the 90s, not 3 as claimed.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim**: The claim states there are 3 translators (entries) in both frequency ranges.

In radio terminology, a \"translator\" refers to a station that rebroadcasts another station's signal.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to find entries in the table where the city of license is \"Englewood, Illinois.\"\n   - The term \"translator\" isn't directly mentioned in the table; however, we can infer whether an entry might be a translator by looking for certain characteristics typically associated with translators (e.g., low ERP).\n\n3. **Locating Englewood, Illinois**:\n   - Check each row to see if the \"city of license\" is \"Englewood, Illinois.\"\n\n4. **Analyzing the Entry**:\n   - Locate the row where \"city of license\" is \"Englewood, Illinois\":\n     - Row 2: \n       - Call sign: `w264bf`\n       - Frequency MHz: `100.7`\n       - City of License: `englewood , illinois`\n       - ERP W: `2`\n       - Class: `d`\n       - FCC Info: `fcc`\n\n5. **Evaluating the Characteristics**:\n   - The entry for Englewood, Illinois has an ERP (Effective Radiated Power) of 2 watts.\n   - An ERP of 2 watts is typical for a translator station, as translators usually have low power output.\n\n6. **Counting Translators**:\n   - Since there is only one row with \"Englewood, Illinois\" as the city of license and it fits the characteristics of a translator, Englewood has only one translator listed in this table.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that Englewood, Illinois have 2 translators, but based on the table, there is only one entry for Englewood with characteristics suggesting it might be a translator.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Englewood, Illinois has 2 translators.
