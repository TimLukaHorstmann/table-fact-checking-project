    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the engine alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv have f tyre\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Engine**: The claim specifies an engine combination: \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv\". We need to find rows in the table where this exact engine is listed.\n\n2. **Check for Matching Engine**:\n   - Look through each row's \"engine (s)\" column.\n   - In the year 1971, we find the engine described as \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv\". This matches the specified combination in the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Tyre Type for the Matching Engine**:\n   - Once we have identified the row with the correct engine (row index 1), check the \"tyres\" column to see what tyre type is listed.\n   - For the year 1971, the \"tyres\" entry is \"f\", which matches the claim's specification of having an \"F\" tyre.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the only occurrence of the engine combination \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv\" in the table corresponds with an \"F\" tyre, the claim is verified as TRUE based on this evidence.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for the engine is at row index 1 under the column \"engine (s)\".\n   - The relevant cell for the tyres is at row index 1 under the column \"tyres\".\n\nThe final answer, along with the reasoning and relevant cells, is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the engine 'alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv' in the table's 'engine (s)' column. This occurs in row index 1 for the year 1971. Next, check the 'tyres' column for this row to verify if it matches the claim of having an 'F' tyre. The tyres entry is indeed 'f', confirming the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
