The character associated with this actor is \"Sam Belmontes\".\n\n2. **Locate Character Information**:\n   - In the table, we find that under the column \"character\", there's an entry for \"Sam Belmontes\" associated with Christian De La Fuente.\n\n3. **Verify Duration**:\n   - We check the duration specified in the row where Sam Belmontes is mentioned.\n   - The entry shows a duration of \"02x03 - 03x05\".\n\n4. **Check Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - The claim states that Christian De La Fuente's duration should be \"02x03 - 03x05\".\n   - This matches exactly with the duration listed in the table for Sam Belmontes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the specified duration in the claim aligns perfectly with what is recorded in the table, the claim is accurate.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant information can be extracted from the row where \"Sam Belmontes\" and \"Christian De La Fuente\" are listed.\n   - Specifically, we focus on the columns: \"character\", \"actor\", and \"duration\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains a row for 'Sam Belmontes', associated with actor 'Christian De La Fuente'.
