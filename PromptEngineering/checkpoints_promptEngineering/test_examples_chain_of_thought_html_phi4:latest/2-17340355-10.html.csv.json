We will compare the attendance figures for each game to identify the one with the highest number.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the attendance values:**\n   - Game 75 (Houston): Attendance = 18,422\n   - Game 76 (Sacramento): Attendance = 18,422\n   - Game 77 (Dallas): Attendance = 20,301\n   - Game 78 (New Orleans): Attendance = 17,781\n   - Game 79 (Memphis): Attendance = 15,908\n   - Game 80 (Minnesota): Attendance = 18,478\n   - Game 81 (Memphis): Attendance = 18,422\n   - Game 82 (Golden State): Attendance not specified.\n\n2. **Compare the attendance values:**\n   - The highest specified attendance is for Game 77 against Dallas with an attendance of 20,301.\n   - The attendance for Game 78 against New Orleans is 17,781.\n\n3. **Determine if the claim is true or false:**\n   - Since Game 77 (Dallas) has a higher attendance than Game 78 (New Orleans), the game against New Orleans does not have the highest attendance.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"the game against New Orleans has the highest attendance\" is FALSE.
