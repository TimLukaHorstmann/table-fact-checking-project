    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we will follow a systematic approach to analyze the data provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We are interested in games where \"Gold Coast Blaze\" is the away team. This means we need to look at rows where \"Gold Coast Blaze\" appears under the \"away team\" column.\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Gold Coast Blaze as Away Team:**\n   - Go through each row and check if \"Gold Coast Blaze\" is listed in the \"away team\" column.\n   \n3. **Extract Score Information:**\n   - For rows where \"Gold Coast Blaze\" is indeed the away team, note down the score mentioned.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Extracted Scores:**\n   - The claim states that when Gold Coast Blaze is the away team, the score should be \"101 - 92\". We need to compare this with the scores we extracted in step 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If any row with \"Gold Coast Blaze\" as the away team has a score of \"101 - 92\", then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, if none match or there are no such rows at all, the claim is false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Away Team: Sydney Spirit\n  - Score: 103 - 101 (Not relevant)\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Away Team: New Zealand Breakers\n  - Score: 101 - 92 (Not relevant)\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Away Team: Gold Coast Blaze\n  - Score: 98 - 96 (Relevant but not matching \"101 - 92\")\n\n- **Row 4 to Row 7:** \n  - Away Teams are Perth Wildcats, New Zealand Breakers, Townsville Crocodiles, and Cairns Taipans respectively.\n  - Scores do not match the criteria of interest.\n\n- **Row 8:**\n  - Away Team: Wollongong Hawks\n  - Score: 99 - 86 (Not relevant)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the analysis above, we find that there is one row where \"Gold Coast Blaze\" is the away team (Row 3), but the score in this case is \"98 - 96\", not \"101 - 92\". Therefore, the claim does not hold true.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where 'Gold Coast Blaze' is listed as the away team.
