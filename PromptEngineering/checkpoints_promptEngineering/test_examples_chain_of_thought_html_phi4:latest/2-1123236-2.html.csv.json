    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all drivers who completed 63 laps did so in a Ferrari\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with 63 Laps:**\n   - We need to find all entries where the \"laps\" column indicates that the driver completed 63 laps.\n\n2. **Extract Information for Each Driver who Completed 63 Laps:**\n   - For each row identified in step 1, extract the data from the \"constructor\" column to determine which car constructor was used by the driver.\n\n3. **Check Constructors of Drivers with 63 Laps:**\n   - Verify if all drivers who completed 63 laps were driving for Ferrari.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Relevant Entry:**\n\n   - Row 1:\n     - Driver: Damon Hill\n     - Constructor: Williams - Renault\n     - Laps: 63\n\n   - Row 2:\n     - Driver: Jean Alesi\n     - Constructor: Ferrari\n     - Laps: 63\n\n   - Row 3:\n     - Driver: Gerhard Berger\n     - Constructor: Ferrari\n     - Laps: 63\n\n   - Row 4:\n     - Driver: David Coulthard\n     - Constructor: Williams - Renault\n     - Laps: 63\n\n5. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - Among drivers who completed 63 laps, we have:\n     - Damon Hill and David Coulthard were driving for Williams - Renault.\n     - Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger were driving for Ferrari.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since not all drivers (specifically Damon Hill and David Coulthard) who completed 63 laps did so in a Ferrari, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows with 'laps' = 63.\",\n    \"Extract 'constructor' for these rows.\",\n    \"Check if all constructors are 'Ferrari'.\",\n    \"Damon Hill and David Coulthard were in Williams - Renault, not Ferrari.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 3 drivers have to retire because of a gearbox issue\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Retired Drivers**: \n   - We are interested in rows where drivers did not complete the race (i.e., they retired). In this context, \"retired\" refers to any reason listed other than a specific time or \"+X laps\". These entries have reasons such as \"wheel\", \"gearbox\", \"suspension\", etc.\n\n2. **Filter by Retire Reason**:\n   - Specifically, we want drivers who retired due to a \"gearbox\" issue. We need to identify rows where the \"time / retired\" column states \"gearbox\".\n\n3. **Count Gearbox Issues**:\n   - Count how many entries have \"gearbox\" as their reason for retirement.\n\n4. **Evaluate Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that more than 3 drivers retired due to a gearbox issue, so we are looking for at least 4 such instances.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n\n- We examine each row under the \"time / retired\" column for entries marked as \"gearbox\":\n\n  - **Row 15**: `bertrand gachot` with reason \"gearbox\".\n  - **Row 21**: `andrea montermini` with reason \"gearbox\".\n  - **Row 25**: `jos verstappen` with reason \"gearbox\".\n\n- Total entries with \"gearbox\" as the retirement reason: 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since only 3 drivers retired due to a gearbox issue, the claim that more than 3 drivers did so is false.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where drivers have retired by checking for reasons other than specific times or '+X laps'.\",\n    \"Filter these entries to find those with 'gearbox' as the reason for retirement.\",\n    \"Count the number of such entries: found 3 (bertrand gachot, andrea montermini, jos verstappen).\",\n    \"The claim states more than 3 drivers retired due to a gearbox issue.
