This indicates a tie for ninth place.\n\n3. **Verify Other Players Tied with Don Whitt:**\n   - Check other rows to see if there are any additional players tied at the same score.\n   - Row 8 has \"phil rodgers\" with the same 'place' value of \"t9\".\n\n4. **Confirm Scores and Tie Status:**\n   - Both \"don whitt\" (row 9) and \"phil rodgers\" (row 8) have a total score of 144.\n   - The 'to par' for both is \"+2\", confirming they are indeed tied.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Don Whitt's place is listed as \"t9\" and he shares this rank with another player at the same score, the claim that he finished in a tie for ninth place is true.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"after 1 round Gary Player be place t9\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table and extract relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**:\n   - The table lists players with their scores over two rounds (71 + 68, 70 + 69, etc.), total score, \"to par\" values, and current positions.\n   - Each player has a place (e.g., t1, t4, t7, t9).\n\n2. **Identify Gary Player's Current Position**:\n   - Locate Gary Player in the table: He is on row 6 with a total score of 142 and a \"to par\" value of \"e\".\n   - His current place is \"t4\", meaning he tied for fourth place.\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim refers to \"after 1 round,\" which implies we need to consider only the first round's scores.\n   - We need to determine Gary Player's position after just the first round.\n\n4. **Extract First Round Scores**:\n   - For each player, extract the score from the first round (before the \"=\" sign).\n   - Gary Player's first-round score is 71.\n\n5. **Determine Positions Based on First Round Scores**:\n   - List all players with their first-round scores and sort them to determine positions.\n   - Arnold Palmer: 71\n   - Bob Rosburg: 70\n   - Billy Maxwell: 71\n   - Bobby Nichols: 70\n   - Jack Nicklaus: 72\n   - Gary Player: 71\n   - Miller Barber: 73\n   - Gene Littler: 69\n   - Phil Rodgers: 74\n   - Don Whitt: 73\n\n6. **Rank Players by First Round Score**:\n   - Sort players by their first-round scores in ascending order (lower score is better):\n     1. Gene Littler: 69\n     2. Bob Rosburg, Bobby Nichols: 70\n     3. Arnold Palmer, Billy Maxwell, Gary Player: 71\n     4. Jack Nicklaus: 72\n     5. Miller Barber, Don Whitt: 73\n     6.
