We need to assess whether this corresponds to their first year of eligibility.\n\n2. **Examine Each Player:**\n   - **Alonzo Mourning:** Drafted in the 1st round as the 2nd pick of the 1992 draft (Hornets). Alonzo attended Georgetown, a four-year institution. Assuming he began college in 1989, his first eligible year would be 1991. However, he was drafted in 1992.\n   - **Chris Jackson:** Drafted in the 1st round as the 3rd pick of the 1990 draft (Nuggets). He attended LSU, a four-year institution. Assuming he began college in 1987, his first eligible year would be 1989. However, he was drafted in 1990.\n   - **Chris Mills:** Drafted in the 1st round as the 22nd pick of the 1993 draft (Cavs). He attended Kentucky and then Arizona. Assuming he started at Kentucky around 1991, his first eligible year would be 1992. However, he was drafted in 1993.\n   - **Billy Owens:** Drafted in the 1st round as the 3rd pick of the 1991 draft (Kings). He attended Syracuse, a four-year institution. Assuming he began college in 1988, his first eligible year would be 1990. However, he was drafted in 1991.\n   - **Kenny Williams:** Drafted in the 2nd round as the 46th pick of the 1990 draft (Pacers). He attended Barton Community College and then Elizabeth City State University. Assuming he started at a junior college around 1987, his first eligible year would be 1989. However, he was drafted in 1990.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - All players were drafted after their first season of eligibility, indicating they entered the draft the season following their initial eligibility.\n   - Therefore, none of the players were selected in the NBA draft in the same year they became eligible.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Alonzo Mourning was drafted in 1992, likely his second year of eligibility (eligible in 1991).\",\n    \"Chris Jackson was drafted in 1990, likely his first year of eligibility (eligible in 1989).\",\n    \"Chris Mills was drafted in 1993, likely his second year of eligibility (eligible in 1992).\",\n    \"Billy Owens was drafted in 1991, likely his first year of eligibility (eligible in 1990).\",\n    \"Kenny Williams was drafted in 1990, likely his first year of eligibility (eligible in 1989).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate whether only two players from the table were selected in the NBA draft during their eligible season.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify NBA Draft Information**: We examine the \"nba draft\" column for each player in the table.\n2. **Understand Eligibility Context**: The term \"eligible season\" typically refers to when a college basketball player is considered ready to enter the NBA draft, usually after their junior year or if they are at least three years removed from high school (one-year eligibility rule). However, without explicit information about each player's eligibility, we assume all listed drafts reflect selections made in an eligible season unless specified otherwise.\n\n3. **Examine Each Player's Draft Information**:\n   - **Alonzo Mourning**: Selected 1st round - 2nd pick of the 1992 draft by the Hornets.\n   - **Chris Jackson**: Selected 1st round - 3rd pick of the 1990 draft by the Nuggets.\n   - **Chris Mills**: Selected 1st round - 22nd pick of the 1993 draft by the Cavs.\n   - **Billy Owens**: Selected 1st round - 3rd pick of the 1991 draft by the Kings.\n   - **Kenny Williams**: Selected 2nd round - 46th pick of the 1990 draft by the Pacers.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Draft Selections**:\n   - All five players listed have been selected in an NBA draft as indicated by their \"nba draft\" column entry.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that only two players were selected in the NBA draft during their eligible season.\n   - Our analysis shows that all five players have entries indicating they were drafted, suggesting they were picked during what is presumably an eligible season for each.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all five players listed have been selected in the NBA draft and no additional information suggests otherwise, the claim that only two were selected is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row 1**: `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}` (Alonzo Mourning)\n- **Row 2**: `{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}` (Chris Jackson)\n- **Row 3**: `{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}` (Chris Mills)\n- **Row 4**: `{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}` (Billy Owens)\n- **Row 5**: `{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}` (Kenny Williams)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each player listed in the table has an entry under 'nba draft', indicating they were selected during a draft.
