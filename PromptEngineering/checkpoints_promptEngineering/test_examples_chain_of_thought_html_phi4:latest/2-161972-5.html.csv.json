    "resp": "To determine whether Richard Krajicek participated in 25 championship tennis matches based on the provided table, we will follow these logical steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table includes several columns: Date (dd.mm.yyyy), Tournament, Surface, Opponent, Score, and Result.\n   - Each row represents a match that Richard Krajicek played.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We need to count the number of rows where the result indicates either \"winner\" or \"runner-up,\" as these represent matches he participated in at championship level.\n\n3. **Count the Matches**:\n   - Go through each row and check the \"Result\" column.\n   - Count the number of times the value is either \"winner\" or \"runner-up.\"\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that no match entries are missed, including those at the beginning and end of the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Compare the total count from step 3 to the claim of 25 matches.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Counting Matches**:\n  - The \"Result\" column has the following values for each row:\n    - Winner: 14 times\n    - Runner-up: 11 times\n  - Total matches = 14 (Winner) + 11 (Runner-up) = 25\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - We have accounted for all rows in the table, ensuring no match is missed.\n\nBased on this analysis, Richard Krajicek participated in exactly 25 championship tennis matches as per the data provided.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists matches where Richard Krajicek was either a winner or runner-up.
