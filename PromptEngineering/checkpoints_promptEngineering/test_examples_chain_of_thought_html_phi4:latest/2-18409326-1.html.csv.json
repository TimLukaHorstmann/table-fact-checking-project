This is our first instance.\n- **Row 6**: Format is \"contemporary hits radio\" (not relevant).\n- **Row 7**: Format is \"adult contemporary\" (not relevant).\n- **Row 8**: Format is \"hot adult contemporary\" (not relevant).\n- **Row 9**: Format is \"adult hits\" (not relevant).\n- **Row 10**: Format is \"active rock\" (not relevant).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There is only one instance of a station with the format \"classic rock\" in row 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are more than one classic rock station is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'format' column as it indicates radio formats.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the information in the table regarding the ownership of radio stations by Bell Media compared to CBC.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Ownership Rows for CBC:**\n   - Look through each row and identify which ones are owned by \"canadian broadcasting corporation\" (CBC).\n   - Relevant rows:\n     - Row 2: Frequency `00 88.9 fm`, Call Sign `cbtk - fm`, Branding `cbc radio one`, Format `public news / talk`\n     - Row 3: Frequency `00 89.7 fm`, Call Sign `cbu - fm - 3`, Branding `cbc radio 2`, Format `public music`\n     - Row 4: Frequency `00 90.5 fm`, Call Sign `cbuf - fm - 2`, Branding `premi\u00e8re cha\u00eene`, Format `public news / talk`\n\n   These rows indicate that CBC owns three separate stations.\n\n2. **Identify Ownership Rows for Bell Media:**\n   - Similarly, identify which rows are owned by \"bell media\".\n   - Relevant rows:\n     - Row 6: Frequency `00 99.9 fm`, Call Sign `chsu - fm`, Branding `99.9 sun fm`, Format `contemporary hits radio`\n     - Row 7: Frequency `0 101.5 fm`, Call Sign `cilk - fm`, Branding `101.5 ez rock`, Format `adult contemporary`\n\n   These rows indicate that Bell Media owns two separate stations.\n\n3. **Compare the Number of Stations Owned:**\n   - CBC owns three stations (Rows 2, 3, and 4).\n   - Bell Media owns two stations (Rows 6 and 7).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Bell Media \"own 3 separate radio station like the cbc\".\n   - Since Bell Media only owns two stations, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because Bell Media does not own three separate radio stations as CBC does.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows where 'canadian broadcasting corporation' and 'bell media' are listed as owners.
