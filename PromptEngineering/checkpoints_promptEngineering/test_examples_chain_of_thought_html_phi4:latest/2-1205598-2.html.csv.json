While the table does not list NFL or NHL teams specifically, common knowledge tells us that Philadelphia hosts both the Eagles (NFL) and Flyers (NHL).\n\n6. **Confirm No Other City has a More Recent Year**:\n   - None of the other cities listed in the table have a more recent \"since\" year than 2010.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data from the table, Philadelphia is indeed the most recent market to gain teams that cover all four major league sports.
