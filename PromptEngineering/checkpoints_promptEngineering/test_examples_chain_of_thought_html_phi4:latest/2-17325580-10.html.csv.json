    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"game 75 - 82 take place in the month of March\" is true or false, we need to examine the \"date\" column for each game listed from game 75 to game 82.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column for determining the month of the games is the \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game's Date**:\n   - **Game 75**: Date is \"april 2\". This is in April, not March.\n   - **Game 76**: Date is \"april 3\". This is in April, not March.\n   - **Game 77**: Date is \"april 5\". This is in April, not March.\n   - **Game 78**: Date is \"april 8\". This is in April, not March.\n   - **Game 79**: Date is \"april 10\". This is in April, not March.\n   - **Game 80**: Date is \"april 12\". This is in April, not March.\n   - **Game 81**: Date is \"april 13\". This is in April, not March.\n   - **Game 82**: Date is \"april 15\". This is in April, not March.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - All the games from 75 to 82 are listed with dates in April. Therefore, none of these games took place in March.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim that \"game 75 - 82 take place in the month of March\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'date' column was examined for each game from 75 to 82.
