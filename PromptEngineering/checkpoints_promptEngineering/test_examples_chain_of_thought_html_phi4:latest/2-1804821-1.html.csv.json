    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the falcon shield animal comes with no external weapon,\" we need to perform a series of steps using the provided table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Shield Animals:**\n   - Look at the column titled `shield animal` in the HTML table. This is where we will find information about shield animals associated with each knight.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with Falcon as the Shield Animal:**\n   - Examine each row under the `shield animal` column to find the entry that matches \"falcon.\"\n\n3. **Find Corresponding External Weapon Information:**\n   - Once the row containing \"falcon\" is identified, look at the corresponding cell in the `external weapon` column for this knight.\n\n4. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there should be no external weapon associated with the falcon shield animal. Therefore, if the value under the `external weapon` column for the row containing \"falcon\" is \"none,\" then the claim is TRUE. If it contains any other weapon(s), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1:** Locate the \"shield animal\" column.\n- **Step 2:** Identify the row with \"falcon\":\n  - In this table, the knight `wally` has \"falcon\" as their shield animal (Row Index: 5).\n\n- **Step 3:** Check the corresponding cell in the \"external weapon\" column for Wally:\n  - For the knight `wally`, the `external weapon` is listed as \"two shortswords\" (Row Index: 5, Column Name: `external weapon`).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim asserts that there should be no external weapon associated with a falcon shield animal. However, for Wally, who has a falcon as his shield animal, the entry under `external weapon` is \"two shortswords.\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the knight with the falcon shield animal does have an external weapon.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column for 'shield animal'.\",\n    \"Locate the row where 'falcon' appears in the 'shield animal' column.\",\n    \"Find the corresponding cell in the 'external weapon' column for this knight.\",\n    \"Check if the value under 'external weapon' is 'none'.\",\n    \"If not, the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"shield animal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"external weapon\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
