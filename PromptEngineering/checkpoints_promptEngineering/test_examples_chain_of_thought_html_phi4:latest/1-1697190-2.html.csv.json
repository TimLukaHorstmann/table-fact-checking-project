Based on our comparison, the minimum earnings indeed occurred in multiple years (2001, 2002, 2003) at $0.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the lowest earnings value is $0, the claim is correct.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells are those under the \"earnings\" column for each year from 1998 to 2005:\n  - Row Index 0 (Year 1998), Column \"earnings\"\n  - Row Index 1 (Year 2000), Column \"earnings\"\n  - **Row Index 2 (Year 2001), Column \"earnings\"**\n  - **Row Index 3 (Year 2002), Column \"earnings\"**\n  - **Row Index 4 (Year 2003), Column \"earnings\"**\n  - Row Index 5 (Year 2004), Column \"earnings\"\n  - Row Index 6 (Year 2005), Column \"earnings\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we extracted earnings data for each year from 1998 to 2005.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Casey Martin never won a tournament\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: The table lists statistics for different years regarding tournaments played by an individual (presumably Casey Martin). Key columns include 'year', 'tournaments played', 'cuts made', 'wins', 'best finish', 'earnings', and 'money list rank'.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: To verify the claim about winning a tournament, we focus on the column labeled \"wins\". This column indicates how many tournaments were won in each year.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for Wins**:\n   - For 1998: The \"wins\" value is 0.\n   - For 2000: The \"wins\" value is 0.\n   - For 2001: The \"wins\" value is 0.\n   - For 2002: The \"wins\" value is 0.\n   - For 2003: The \"wins\" value is 0.\n   - For 2004: The \"wins\" value is 0.\n   - For 2005: The \"wins\" value is 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Data**: In every year listed, the number of wins is consistently 0. This indicates that Casey Martin did not win any tournament in these years.\n\n5. **Final Verification**: Since there are no entries indicating a positive number for wins across all provided years, it supports the claim that \"Casey Martin never won a tournament\" based on this data.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells Identification**:\n   - Each row's \"wins\" column is relevant to verify if there were any tournaments won.\n   - The relevant cells are from rows 0 to 6 in the \"wins\" column.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that the claim is true according to the data presented in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table provides yearly statistics for Casey Martin's golf performance.
