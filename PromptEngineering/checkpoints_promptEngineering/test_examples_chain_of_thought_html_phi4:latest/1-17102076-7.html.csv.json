    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Game 35's score being \"l90 - 98 (ot)\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**:\n   - We are looking for Game 35 in the table. This corresponds to the row where the game number is 35.\n   \n2. **Locate the Score Information**:\n   - In each row, the score of the game is listed under the \"score\" column.\n\n3. **Extract the Score for Game 35**:\n   - Find the row with `game` = 35 and look at the value in the \"score\" column.\n   \n4. **Compare the Extracted Score to the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the score is \"l90 - 98 (ot)\". We need to check if this matches exactly with what's recorded for Game 35.\n\n5. **Determine Truthfulness of the Claim**:\n   - If the extracted score matches \"l90 - 98 (ot)\", then the claim is true.\n   - If it does not match, then the claim is false.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- From the table:\n  - For `game` = 35, the row contains the following relevant information:\n    - **Row Index**: 10\n    - **Column Name**: \"score\"\n    - **Value**: \"l90 - 98 (ot)\"\n\n- The extracted score from Game 35 is exactly \"l90 - 98 (ot)\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim matches the recorded data for Game 35. Therefore, the statement about the score is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row corresponding to game number 35 and check the 'score' column value.
