We will look for entries in the \"date\" column that match this date.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row(s)**: Once we find the row with \"4 december\", we will check the information in that row to verify the details of the game.\n\n3. **Verify Venue Information**: The claim states that a game was played at the \"north shore event centre\". We need to confirm if this venue is listed under the \"venue\" column for the December 4th entry.\n\n4. **Check Teams Involved**: Although not necessary to verify the venue, it's useful to check which teams were involved in the game on that date to ensure all details match up logically with the claim.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1 & 2**: Locate the row where the \"date\" is \"4 december\". This corresponds to the second row of the table.\n\n- **Step 3**: Check the \"venue\" column for this row. The venue listed is \"north shore events centre\".\n\n- **Step 4**: Verify the teams involved in the game on December 4th.

This matches with a typical sports event format.\n\nThe venue \"north shore events centre\" mentioned in the claim is indeed correct for the game on December 4th.
