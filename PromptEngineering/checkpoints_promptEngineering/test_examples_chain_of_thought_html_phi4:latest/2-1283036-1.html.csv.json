    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the screening starting on March 29, 2006, and being completed by May 3, 2006, is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Screening Start Date in Question:**\n   - The claim mentions a screening start date of March 29, 2006.\n   - We need to look for this specific date in the \"screening started\" column.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row:**\n   - By scanning the table, we find that the row with the date \"27 march 2006\" (note the lowercase 'm') corresponds to a screening start date.\n   - This is likely a typo or formatting issue, but it matches closely enough to be considered as March 29, 2006.\n\n3. **Check the Corresponding Completion Date:**\n   - In this row, the \"screening completed\" column has the date \"5 may 2006\".\n   - We need to verify if this date is indeed May 3, 2006, as claimed.\n\n4. **Compare Dates:**\n   - The completion date of May 5, 2006, does not match the claim's stated completion date of May 3, 2006.\n   - Therefore, the screening was completed two days later than what the claim states.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the screening starting on March 29, 2006, was completed by May 3, 2006, is **FALSE**. The actual completion date in the table is May 5, 2006.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row corresponding to \"27 march 2006\" (likely intended as March 29, 2006):\n  - Screening started: \"27 march 2006\"\n  - Screening completed: \"5 may 2006\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states a screening starts on March 29, 2006, and completes by May 3, 2006.
