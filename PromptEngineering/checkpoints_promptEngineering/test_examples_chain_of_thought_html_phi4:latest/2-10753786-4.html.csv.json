    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tom Lehman spent more weeks at number 1 than any other US player\" is true, we need to analyze the table data for players from the United States and their respective weeks spent at number 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify US Players:**\n   - The column \"country\" indicates the country of each player. We are interested in players whose country is \"united states\".\n\n2. **Extract Weeks Data for US Players:**\n   - From the table, identify rows where \"country\" is \"united states\".\n   - Extract the number of weeks these players spent at number 1 from the \"weeks\" column.\n\n3. **Compare Tom Lehman's Weeks:**\n   - Locate Tom Lehman in the table and note his weeks at number 1.\n   - Compare his weeks to those of other US players.\n\n4. **Determine if Claim is True:**\n   - If Tom Lehman has more weeks than any other US player, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **US Players in Table:**\n  - Tiger Woods: 656 weeks\n  - Greg Norman: 331 weeks (Note: Although listed as \"australia\", he spent time at number 1 while being a US PGA Tour player, but we focus on the country column for this analysis)\n  - Fred Couples: 16 weeks\n  - David Duval: 15 weeks\n  - Tom Lehman: 1 week\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - Tiger Woods has significantly more weeks (656) than Tom Lehman (1).\n  - Fred Couples has more weeks (16) than Tom Lehman.\n  - David Duval also has more weeks (15) than Tom Lehman.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTom Lehman did not spend more weeks at number 1 than any other US player. Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, and David Duval all spent more weeks than him.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players from the United States by checking the 'country' column.\",\n    \"Extract the 'weeks' data for these players.\",\n    \"Locate Tom Lehman's entry and note his weeks at number 1.\",\n    \"Compare Tom Lehman's weeks with those of other US players: Tiger Woods (656), Fred Couples (16), David Duval (15).\",\n    \"Determine that Tom Lehman did not spend more weeks than any other US player.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
