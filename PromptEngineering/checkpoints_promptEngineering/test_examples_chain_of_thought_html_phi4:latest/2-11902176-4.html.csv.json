We need to locate the row corresponding to this date in the table.\n2. **Home Team Verification**: According to the claim, the home team should be \"Montreal\" on November 19. We will check the \"home\" column for that specific date.\n3. **Score Verification**: The score claimed is \"4 - 2\". We need to verify if this matches the \"score\" entry for Ottawa as the home team.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate November 19**:\n   - Look through the table rows and identify the row with the date \"November 19\".\n   \n2. **Check Home Team on November 19**:\n   - In the identified row, examine the \"home\" column to see if it lists \"Montreal\".\n\n3. **Verify Score on November 19**:\n   - Check the \"score\" column in the same row to confirm if Ottawa scored 4 and the visitor (Montreal) scored 2.\n\n### Relevant Table Data:\n\n- **Row for November 19**:\n  - Date: November 19\n  - Visitor: Montreal\n  - Score: 4 - 2\n  - Home: Ottawa\n  - Decision: Gerber\n  - Attendance: 21273\n  - Record: 16 - 3 - 0\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The date matches the claim.\n- The home team on November 19 is indeed \"Ottawa\", not \"Montreal\". Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n- The score \"4 - 2\" is correct when Ottawa is the home team.\n\nSince the home team was \"Ottawa\" and not \"Montreal\" as claimed, the overall statement in the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'on November 19, the home team be Montreal and the score be 4 - 2'.
