From the table, extract rows where `year` = 1997:\n\n   - Row 7: \n     - Category: best actor in leading role - drama series\n     - Recipients and nominees: david duchovny\n     - Role / Episode: david duchovny\n     - Result: nominated\n\n   - Row 8:\n     - Category: best actress in leading role - drama series\n     - Recipients and nominees: gillian anderson\n     - Role / Episode: gillian anderson\n     - Result: nominated\n\n   - Row 9:\n     - Category: best series - drama\n     - Recipients and nominees: best series - drama\n     - Role / Episode: best series - drama\n     - Result: won\n\n2.
