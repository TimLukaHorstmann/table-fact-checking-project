    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Categories of Awards Won by Black Actresses\n\nThe table contains multiple award categories. We are interested in those related to winning the Golden Globe as \"Best Actress.\" The relevant categories under which a black actress could win for Best Actress include:\n- Best Actress - Drama\n- Best Actress - Musical or Comedy\n\n### Step 2: Count Wins in Each Relevant Category\n\nWe need to go through each row and count how many times each category is won by black actresses.\n\n**Best Actress - Drama**\n- Halle Berry (2002) for \"Monster's Ball\"\n- Viola Davis (2012) for \"The Help\" (nominated, but not a win)\n- Gabourey Sidibe (2010) for \"Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire\" (nominated, but not a win)\n- Halle Berry again in 2011 for \"Frankie and Alice\" (nominated, but not a win)\n\n**Best Actress - Musical or Comedy**\n- Angela Bassett (1994) for \"What's Love Got to Do with It\"\n- Pam Grier (1998) for \"Jackie Brown\" (nominated, but not a win)\n- Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles (2007) for \"Dreamgirls\" (nominated, but not a win)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Frequency of Wins\n\nNow we identify which categories have been won:\n- **Best Actress - Drama**: Halle Berry is the only winner.\n- **Best Actress - Musical or Comedy**: Angela Bassett is the only winner.\n\nBoth categories \"Best Actress - Drama\" and \"Best Actress - Musical or Comedy\" have one win each for a black actress. Therefore, they are equally common in terms of wins (both with 1 win).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Claim\n\nThe claim states that winning as Best Actress is the least common Golden Globe for a black actress. Since there are two categories where the black actresses have won exactly once, neither category can be considered \"least common\" in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis, both relevant categories have an equal number of wins by black actresses (1 each), so no single Best Actress category is less common than the other.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified two relevant Golden Globe categories for 'Best Actress' wins: Best Actress - Drama and Best Actress - Musical or Comedy.

Therefore, we must verify if she has any recorded wins for this category and whether it happened in 1988.\n\n4. **Verify the Year of the Claim:**\n   Cross-check if there is a record for the year 1988 for any win in this category.\n\n5. **Check for Other Winners:**\n   Ensure no other individuals have won this award, aside from Whoopi Goldberg, according to the table.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- From the table:\n  - **Row 14:** Angela Bassett won \"best actress - musical or comedy\" in 1994.\n  - **Row 15:** Viola Davis was nominated for \"best supporting actress\" in 2009.\n  - **Row 16:** Mo'Nique won \"best supporting actress\" in 2010.\n  - **Row 17:** Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for \"best actress - drama\" in 2010.\n  - **Row 18:** Halle Berry was nominated for \"best actress - drama\" in 2011.\n  - **Row 19 & 20:** Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer have nominations or wins, but not under the category we are interested in.\n\n- There is no record of Whoopi Goldberg winning the award for \"best actress - musical or comedy.\" She was nominated in 1993 (row 12) but did not win.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that Whoopi Goldberg won this award in 1988, which is incorrect. There is no entry for her winning in 1988, nor does she have a recorded win for the specified category according to the table data.
