    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Don Freeland's average laps per year over eight years is true, we need to perform a few calculations using the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - The claim refers to \"laps\" completed each year.\n   - We will extract the 'laps' column from the table for all 8 years listed.\n\n2. **Extract Laps Data:**\n   - From the table, we have the following laps data:\n     - 1953: 76 laps\n     - 1954: 200 laps\n     - 1955: 178 laps\n     - 1956: 200 laps\n     - 1957: 192 laps\n     - 1958: 200 laps\n     - 1959: 136 laps\n     - 1960: 129 laps\n\n3. **Calculate Total Laps Over Eight Years:**\n   - Sum of all laps = 76 + 200 + 178 + 200 + 192 + 200 + 136 + 129\n   - Total laps = 1311\n\n4. **Calculate Average Laps Per Year:**\n   - To find the average, divide the total number of laps by the number of years (8).\n   - Average laps per year = 1311 / 8\n   - Average laps per year = 163.875\n\n5. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Don Freeland averaged 163.875 laps per year.\n   - Our calculation confirms this average.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The calculated average matches the claimed average of 163.875 laps per year over eight years.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells are those in the 'laps' column for each row (year) from 1953 to 1960:\n\n- Row 1, Column 'laps': 76\n- Row 2, Column 'laps': 200\n- Row 3, Column 'laps': 178\n- Row 4, Column 'laps': 200\n- Row 5, Column 'laps': 192\n- Row 6, Column 'laps': 200\n- Row 7, Column 'laps': 136\n- Row 8, Column 'laps': 129\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states an average of 163.875 laps per year over eight years.
