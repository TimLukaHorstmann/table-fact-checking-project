    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the wildcat kept the opposing team scoreless in 4 games\" is true, we need to analyze the table provided, focusing on the column labeled \"opponents,\" which contains the points scored by the opposing teams.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**  \n   The relevant information for determining if an opponent was kept scoreless is in the \"opponents\" column because this column records how many points were scored against the Wildcats.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game:**\n   - **Game 1:** Opponent scored 14 points.\n   - **Game 2:** Opponent scored 0 points.\n   - **Game 3:** Opponent scored 7 points.\n   - **Game 4:** Opponent scored 0 points.\n   - **Game 5:** Opponent scored 0 points.\n   - **Game 6:** Opponent scored 6 points.\n   - **Game 7:** Opponent scored 13 points.\n   - **Game 8:** Opponent scored 6 points.\n   - **Game 9:** Opponent scored 0 points.\n   - **Game 10:** Opponent scored 13 points.\n\n3. **Count Games with 0 Points Scored by Opponents:**\n   We need to count how many games have a score of 0 in the \"opponents\" column:\n   - Game 2 has 0 points.\n   - Game 4 has 0 points.\n   - Game 5 has 0 points.\n   - Game 9 has 0 points.\n\n   Therefore, there are exactly 4 games where the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The claim states that the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless in 4 games.

The relevant column is \"result,\" where a win is indicated.\n\n2. **Check Wildcats Points for Each Win:**\n   - For each row identified as a win, we need to examine the number of points scored by the Wildcats, found in the \"wildcats points\" column.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - According to the claim, the Wildcats never score more than 7 points in any game they win. We will check if this condition holds for all winning games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Result: Win\n  - Wildcats Points: 20\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Result: Win\n  - Wildcats Points: 20\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Result: Win\n  - Wildcats Points: 26\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Result: Win\n  - Wildcats Points: 14\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Result: Win\n  - Wildcats Points: 7\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Result: Win\n  - Wildcats Points: 15\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Result: Win\n  - Wildcats Points: 36\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the Wildcats never scored more than 7 points in any game they won.
