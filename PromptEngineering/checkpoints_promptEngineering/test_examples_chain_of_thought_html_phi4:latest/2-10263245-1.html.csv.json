    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Librado Andrade's oldest win being on August 27, 2011, is true or false, we need to follow these logical steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are specifically interested in the fights where Librado Andrade won.\n   - The data table provides information about each fight's date and outcome.\n\n2. **Filter Out Wins**:\n   - From the given dataset, we need to identify rows where the \"Winner\" column indicates that Librado Andrade was victorious. In this case, it should be marked with \"Andrade\".\n\n3. **List Dates of Wins**:\n   - Extract the dates corresponding to each win by checking the \"Date\" column for these specific rows.\n\n4. **Determine Oldest Win Date**:\n   - Among the extracted win dates, identify the earliest (oldest) date. This involves comparing all dates of wins and selecting the one that comes first chronologically.\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Date**:\n   - The claim states that August 27, 2011, is the oldest fight that Librado Andrade won.\n   - Compare this claimed date with the earliest win date identified from the data to verify if they match.\n\n### Execution\n\n- From the dataset, list all fights where Andrade is listed as \"Winner\":\n  - March 11, 2023\n  - November 26, 2022\n  - April 30, 2016\n  - August 27, 2011\n  - December 10, 2010\n\n- From these dates, the oldest date (the earliest one chronologically) is August 27, 2011.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"the oldest fight that Librado Andrade won be on 2011 - 08 - 27\" matches our findings from the dataset.

    "resp": "To determine whether Librado Andrade had a fight with Terry Smith before the fight with Marcus Harvey, we need to review the information provided in the table of boxing matches for Librado Andrade.\n\n1. **Identify Matches Against Terry Smith:**\n   - From the table, there is one match where Librado Andrade fought against Terry Smith.\n   - This match took place on April 13, 2000, and resulted in a win via knockout by Andrade in round 2.\n\n2. **Identify Matches Against Marcus Harvey:**\n   - There are two matches involving Marcus Harvey:\n     - The first fight was on August 17, 2000, which resulted in a unanimous decision (UD) victory for Librado Andrade.\n     - The second fight occurred earlier, on August 14, 1999, and also resulted in a UD victory for Andrade.\n\n3. **Chronological Order of Matches:**\n   - To confirm the sequence:\n     - On April 13, 2000: Fight against Terry Smith (Andrade won by KO).\n     - On August 14, 1999: First fight against Marcus Harvey (Andrade won by UD).\n     - On August 17, 2000: Second fight against Marcus Harvey (Andrade won by UD).\n\n4. **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the dates:\n     - The fight with Terry Smith happened after the first fight with Marcus Harvey in 1999.\n     - However, there is a subsequent fight against Marcus Harvey after the fight with Terry Smith.\n\nTherefore, Librado Andrade did not have a fight with Terry Smith before both of his fights with Marcus Harvey. He had the fight with Terry Smith between his two matches with Marcus Harvey.\n\nThe claim \"Librado Andrade have a fight with Terry Smith before the fight with Marcus Harvey\" is **FALSE** because there was an earlier fight against Marcus Harvey (August 14, 1999) prior to the fight with Terry Smith (April 13, 2000).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the entries for fights involving Terry Smith and Marcus Harvey.
