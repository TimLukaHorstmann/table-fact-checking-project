This means we are interested in rows where `position` is 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.\n   - For these positions, the claim asserts that all such teams have exactly `14 played` games.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Verification**:\n   - **Position 4**: \n     - Row: 4\n     - Played: 14\n   - **Position 5**:\n     - Row: 5\n     - Played: 14\n   - **Position 6**:\n     - Row: 6\n     - Played: 14\n   - **Position 7**:\n     - Row: 7\n     - Played: 14\n   - **Position 8**:\n     - Row: 8\n     - Played: 14\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - For all positions greater than 3 (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), the `played` games are indeed 14.\n   - Therefore, there is no team with a position larger than 3 that has less than 14 played games.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe claim is TRUE.
