    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"bate finish with a higher position than lokomotiv in 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data related to each team's finishing positions in the year 2003.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows for Each Team:**\n   - Look for the row corresponding to \"bate\".\n   - Look for the row corresponding to \"lokomotiv\".\n\n2. **Extract Positions from the Table:**\n   - For \"bate\":\n     - Locate the row where the team is listed as \"bate\".\n     - Check the column \"position in 2003\" to find its position.\n   - For \"lokomotiv\":\n     - Locate the row where the team is listed as \"lokomotiv\".\n     - Check the column \"position in 2003\" to find its position.\n\n3. **Compare Positions:**\n   - Determine if \"bate's\" position number is lower than \"lokomotiv's\" position number, since a lower numerical value indicates a higher finish in league standings.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **BATE:**\n  - Row Index: 1\n  - Column Name: \"position in 2003\"\n  - Value: 2\n\n- **LOKOMOTIV:**\n  - Row Index: 15\n  - Column Name: \"position in 2003\"\n  - Value: \"first league, 1\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- BATE finished in position 2.\n- LOKOMOTIV is listed as finishing in the \"first league, 1\", which indicates it was not in the top tier of the main league but rather in a lower division. Thus, BATE had a higher finish than LOKOMOTIV.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows for 'bate' and 'lokomotiv'. Extracted their positions from the table: BATE finished at position 2, while LOKOMOTIV was in the first league with a rank of 1. Since BATE's position is numerically lower than LOKOMOTIV's divisional ranking, BATE had a higher finish.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
