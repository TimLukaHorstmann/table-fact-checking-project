    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"player in the 1937 master tournament have to play 4 rounds\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Table Structure:**\n   - The table lists golf players' performance data.\n   - Columns include `place`, `player`, `country`, `score`, `to par`, and `money`.\n\n2. **Understand the Context of Scores:**\n   - Each player's `score` is presented in a format like \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\". This indicates scores from four rounds.\n   - The total score (e.g., 283) is derived by summing up these individual round scores.\n\n3. **Analyze the Score Column:**\n   - Each entry under `score` shows a breakdown of four separate numbers, which represent the scores for each of the four rounds.\n   - For example:\n     - Byron Nelson's score: \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\"\n     - Ralph Guldahl's score: \"69 + 72 + 68 + 76 = 285\"\n\n4. **Confirm Consistency Across Entries:**\n   - Each player in the table has four round scores listed, indicating they played four rounds.\n   - This pattern is consistent across all entries.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since every player's score is broken down into four components, it confirms that each player played 4 rounds in the tournament.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is true based on the analysis of the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each player's score in the table is presented as a sum of four individual round scores.
