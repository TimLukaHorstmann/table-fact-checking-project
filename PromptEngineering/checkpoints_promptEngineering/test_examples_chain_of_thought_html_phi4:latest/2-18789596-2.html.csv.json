We need to verify if Switzerland's total score is higher than any other country listed in the table.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - Locate Switzerland's total score.\n   - Compare this score with the total scores of all other countries in the table.\n\n3. **Extract Scores**:\n   - From the table, Switzerland's total score is 89.250 (row index 11).\n   - Extract the total scores for all other countries to compare:\n     - Russia: 99.251\n     - Spain: 98.334\n     - Japan: 97.167\n     - China: 96.334\n     - United States: 95.500\n     - Canada: 95.084\n     - Italy: 93.751\n     - Ukraine: 92.668\n     - Netherlands: 91.667\n     - Greece: 91.501\n     - France: 90.333\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Compare Switzerland's score (89.250) with each of the other countries' scores.\n   - All other countries have higher total scores than Switzerland.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all other countries listed have a higher total score than Switzerland, the claim that \"Switzerland score above Europe and Asia\" is FALSE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this analysis are those containing the total scores of each country, including Switzerland's.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that Switzerland scores higher than all countries from Europe and Asia.\",\n    \"Identify Switzerland's total score: 89.250 (row index 11).\",\n    \"Extract and compare this score with the total scores of other countries in the table.\",\n    \"All other countries have higher scores than Switzerland.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
