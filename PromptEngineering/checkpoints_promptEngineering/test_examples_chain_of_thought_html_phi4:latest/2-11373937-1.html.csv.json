This is found at the sixth row.\n\n2. **Locate the Serial Number**: In this sixth row, check the \"serial no\" column to confirm it reads \"83 - 1015\", which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Check the Gauge Column**: Look at the \"gauge\" column in the same row (sixth row) where locomotive \"bl31\" is listed.
