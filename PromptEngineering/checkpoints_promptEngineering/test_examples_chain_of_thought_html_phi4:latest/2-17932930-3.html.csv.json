Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - We look for rows where the column \"moving to\" has the value \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\".\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\n   - For each relevant row, note down the values in the columns \"name\" and \"type\".\n\n3. **Check Conditions of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there should be two names associated with Alianza Atl\u00e9tico, and both entries should have the type as \"loaned out\".\n\n4. **Analyze the Table Data:**\n\n   Let's examine each row:\n\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - \"moving to\": alianza atl\u00e9tico\n     - \"name\": v zapata\n     - \"type\": transfer\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - \"moving to\": alianza atl\u00e9tico\n     - \"name\": curiel\n     - \"type\": transfer\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n\n   - We found two rows where \"moving to\" is Alianza Atl\u00e9tico.\n   - However, both entries are of type \"transfer\", not \"loaned out\".\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because neither of the names moving to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico has a type of \"loaned out\". Instead, they are marked as \"transfer\".\n\n7. **Relevant Cells:**\n\n   The relevant cells for this analysis are:\n\n   - Row 2:\n     - Column \"moving to\": \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\"\n     - Column \"name\": \"v zapata\"\n     - Column \"type\": \"transfer\"\n\n   - Row 5:\n     - Column \"moving to\": \"alianza atl\u00e9tico\"\n     - Column \"name\": \"curiel\"\n     - Column \"type\": \"transfer\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
