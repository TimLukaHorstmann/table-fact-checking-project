    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the table data to verify whether Fitzroy was indeed the home team with the highest score on 20 May 1972.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions a game involving Fitzroy as the home team. We must locate any rows where \"fitzroy\" appears in the \"home team\" column.\n\n2. **Extract Home Team Scores:**\n   - For each row, check the score of the home team and note it down for comparison.\n\n3. **Compare Home Team Scores:**\n   - Compare all recorded scores to determine which is the highest among the games where Fitzroy was the home team.\n\n4. **Verify Details in Claim:**\n   - Ensure that Fitzroy's score of 18.11 (119) matches both the game date and their position as the home team.\n   \n### Analysis:\n\n- From the table:\n  - Row 3 lists \"fitzroy\" as the away team, with a score of 18.11 (119). Therefore, this row is relevant for verifying Fitzroy's highest score but not as the home team.\n  \n- Checking all other rows for home teams and their scores:\n  - Collingwood: 7.14 (56)\n  - Melbourne: 20.14 (134)\n  - South Melbourne: 9.7 (61)\n  - North Melbourne: 8.13 (61)\n  - St Kilda: 10.12 (72)\n  - Richmond: 11.25 (91)\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - The highest home team score is Melbourne's 20.14 (134), not Fitzroy\u2019s.\n  \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Fitzroy was the away team in their game with a score of 18.11, and not the home team, the claim stating \"fitzroy be the home team with the highest score\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'fitzroy' appears in the 'home team' column.\",\n    \"Find that Fitzroy does not appear as a home team, only as an away team (Row 3).\",\n    \"List all home team scores for comparison: Collingwood (56), Melbourne (134), South Melbourne (61), North Melbourne (61), St Kilda (72), Richmond (91).\",\n    \"Determine the highest score among these is Melbourne's 20.14 (134).\",\n    \"Since Fitzroy was not a home team and their score as an away team doesn't qualify, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
