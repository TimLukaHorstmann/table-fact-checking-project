However, it's important to note that Mercury Records originated in the UK and became part of Universal Music Group after being absorbed into PolyGram, which itself was later merged with Universal Music Group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states \"Mercury Records\" as an American label owned by Universal Music Group, but historically, while it is now under Universal's ownership, its origins are not strictly American. However, for the purpose of this table and general contemporary understanding, it can be considered correct that it is part of UMG.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim about the number of releases (4 times) by Mercury Records in different formats is TRUE.

However, the table does not provide explicit titles of albums; it only lists labels and countries.\n   - We need to infer from the context or external knowledge if any entry could be related to the INXS debut album.\n\n3. **Examine Labels and Countries**:\n   - The claim mentions that the album was released by different labels in various countries: Deluxe Records (Australia), Mercury Records (Europe, Australia), and Atco Records (USA).\n   - We need to see if any of these entries match with known information about INXS's debut album.\n\n4. **Analyze Table Entries**:\n   - For each entry, check the label and country:\n     - Entry 1: LP format, Australia, Deluxe Records, dated 30 October 1980.\n     - Entry 2: LP format, Europe, Mercury Records, dated 1980.\n     - Entry 3: LP format, USA, Atco Records, dated 1984.\n     - Entry 4: MC format, Europe, Mercury Records, dated 1980.\n     - Entry 5: MC format, USA, Atco Records, dated 1984.\n     - Entry 6: CD format, Australia, Mercury Records, dated 1989.\n     - Entry 7: CD format, Europe, Mercury Records, dated 1989.\n     - Entry 8: CD format, USA, Atco Records, dated 15 November 1987.\n\n5. **Cross-reference with Known Facts**:\n   - INXS's self-titled debut album was released in Australia by Deluxe Records on October 30, 1980.\n   - This matches Entry 1 exactly (LP format, Australia, Deluxe Records, date 30 October 1980).\n\n6. **Verify Other Claim Aspects**:\n   - The claim mentions recording at Trafalgar Studios in Sydney and co-production by the band and Duncan McGuire.
