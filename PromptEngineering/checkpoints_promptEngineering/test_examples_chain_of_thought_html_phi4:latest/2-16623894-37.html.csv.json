We will verify if this score matches what is listed under the \"1st leg\" for \"panathinaikos\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - According to the table, when \"team 1\" is \"panathinaikos\", the values in that row are:\n     - \"agg\": \"1 - 4\"\n     - \"team 2\": \"standard li\u00e8ge\"\n     - \"1st leg\": \"1 - 3\"\n     - \"2nd leg\": \"0 - 1\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The \"1st leg\" score for the match where \"panathinaikos\" is \"team 1\" is indeed \"1 - 3\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For this verification process, the relevant cells are those in row corresponding to \"panathinaikos\":\n     - Row index: 4 (since it's the fifth entry, and indices typically start from 0)\n     - Columns: \"team 1\" with value \"panathinaikos\", and \"1st leg\" with score \"1 - 3\".\n\nNow, let's format this into the required JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the first leg score for a match where 'team 1' is 'panathinaikos' should be '1 - 3'.
