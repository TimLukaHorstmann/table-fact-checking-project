    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the total score for the away team in 6 matches is 396\" is true or false, we need to calculate the total score of all away teams across the six listed matches.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Scoring Format:**\n   - Each entry in the \"away team score\" column uses a format like `X.Y (Z)`, where `X` is the number of goals, `Y` is the number of behinds, and `Z` is the total points scored.\n   - In Australian rules football, each goal is worth 6 points and each behind is worth 1 point.\n\n2. **Extract Away Team Scores:**\n   - From the table, extract the total score `(Z)` for each away team:\n     - Row 1: St Kilda scored `47`\n     - Row 2: Melbourne scored `84`\n     - Row 3: Essendon scored `52`\n     - Row 4: Fitzroy scored `85`\n     - Row 5: North Melbourne scored `42`\n     - Row 6: Footscray scored `93`\n\n3. **Calculate Total Score for All Away Teams:**\n   - Add up the total scores from each row:\n     \\[\n     47 + 84 + 52 + 85 + 42 + 93 = 403\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Total:**\n   - The claim states that the total score is `396`.\n   - Our calculated total score is `403`.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since `403` does not equal `396`, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1, \"away team score\": 47\n- Row 2, \"away team score\": 84\n- Row 3, \"away team score\": 52\n- Row 4, \"away team score\": 85\n- Row 5, \"away team score\": 42\n- Row 6, \"away team score\": 93\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, understand the scoring format where goals are worth 6 points and behinds are worth 1 point.
