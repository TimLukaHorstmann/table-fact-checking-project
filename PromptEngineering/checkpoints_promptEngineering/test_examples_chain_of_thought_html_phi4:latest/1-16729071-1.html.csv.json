For those games, check if any have a result of \"w 10 - 0\" and were played at \"mile high stadium\".\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Seattle Seahawks:**\n   - From the table, locate rows where the opponent is \"seattle seahawks\".\n   - The relevant entries are:\n     - Row 4: Result = \"w 37 - 34\", Game Site = \"mile high stadium\"\n     - Row 15: Result = \"l 23 - 28\", Game Site = \"kingdome\"\n\n2. **Check for Specific Result and Location:**\n   - For the game in Row 4 against the Seattle Seahawks:\n     - The result is \"w 37 - 34\", which does not match \"w 10 - 0\".\n     - The game site is \"mile high stadium\", which matches part of the claim.\n   - For the game in Row 15 against the Seattle Seahawks:\n     - The result is \"l 23 - 28\", which also does not match \"w 10 - 0\".\n     - The game site is \"kingdome\", which does not match \"mile high stadium\".\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no games where the opponent is \"Seattle Seahawks\" with a result of \"w 10 - 0\" at \"mile high stadium\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row 4:\n  - Opponent: \"seattle seahawks\"\n  - Result: \"w 37 - 34\"\n  - Game Site: \"mile high stadium\"\n\n- Row 15:\n  - Opponent: \"seattle seahawks\"\n  - Result: \"l 23 - 28\"\n  - Game Site: \"kingdome\"\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games against 'Seattle Seahawks' in rows 4 and 15.
