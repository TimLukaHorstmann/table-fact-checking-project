The claim states that all vessels except two should have a length of 20 m.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Length Column**: \n   - We are interested in the 'length' column to determine the lengths of each vessel.\n\n2. **Extract and Analyze Data**:\n   - Extract the length data for each vessel from the table:\n     - \"gallion\": 20 m\n     - \"gardian 1\": 20 m\n     - \"gardian 2\": 20 m\n     - \"gardian 7\": 20 m\n     - \"gardian 9\": 20 m\n     - \"marianarray\": 17 m\n     - \"smeaton array\": 20 m\n\n3. **Count the Vessels with Length 20 m**:\n   - Count how many vessels have a length of 20 m:\n     - \"gallion\", \"gardian 1\", \"gardian 2\", \"gardian 7\", \"gardian 9\", and \"smeaton array\" all have lengths of 20 m. This makes a total of 6 vessels with 20 m length.\n\n4. **Identify Vessels with Different Lengths**:\n   - Identify the vessel(s) that do not have a length of 20 m:\n     - \"marianarray\" has a length of 17 m, which is different from 20 m.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that all vessels except two should have a length of 20 m.\n   - We found only one vessel (\"marianarray\") with a length other than 20 m.\n   - Therefore, the number of vessels not having a length of 20 m is less than two.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because there is only one vessel that does not have a length of 20 m, not two as stated in the claim.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'length' column was examined for each vessel.
