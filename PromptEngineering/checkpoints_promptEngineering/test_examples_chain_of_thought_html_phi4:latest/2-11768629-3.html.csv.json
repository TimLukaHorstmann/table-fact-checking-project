Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - The column \"date\" needs to be examined to find the specific date mentioned in the claim, which is October 25.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with Date \"October 25\":**\n   - We need to find a row where the value under the \"date\" column matches \"25 october\".\n\n3. **Check the Corresponding Opponent:**\n   - Once we locate the row with the date, we must check the \"opponent\" column in that same row to see if it contains \"panathinaikos\".\n\n4. **Verification of Claim:**\n   - If both conditions (date and opponent) are satisfied, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n- Looking through the table under the \"date\" column:\n  - Row with index 2 has the date \"25 october\".\n  \n- In this row (index 2), check the \"opponent\" column:\n  - The opponent listed is indeed \"panathinaikos\".\n\nSince both conditions match, the claim is verified to be true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row with index 2:\n  - Column \"date\": Value \"25 october\"\n  - Column \"opponent\": Value \"panathinaikos\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined under the 'date' column to find the row where the date is '25 october'.
