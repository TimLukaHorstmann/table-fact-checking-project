    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table for information regarding which players were associated with \"tours vb\" in 2008.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The column of interest is \"2008 club,\" as it lists the clubs each player was affiliated with in 2008.\n\n2. **Locate the specific row for \"tours vb\"**:\n   - We need to find which players were part of \"tours vb.\"\n\n3. **Examine each row under \"2008 club\"**:\n   - Row 6: The entry is \"tours vb.\"\n     - Player: Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107\n   - Other rows do not mention \"tours vb,\" so we can conclude that no other players were associated with this club.\n\n4. **Count the number of players in \"tours vb\"**:\n   - Only one player, Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107, is listed as being part of \"tours vb.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the claim**: \n   - The claim states: \"only 1 of the 12 players was not in the club VB 2008 of Tour.\"\n   - This implies that 11 players were with \"tours vb\" and only one was not.\n   - From our examination, only Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107 is listed with \"tours vb,\" meaning 11 players were indeed not associated with this club.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is consistent with the data in the table: only 1 player (Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107) was with \"tours vb\" in 2008, and thus 11 were not.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant column for determining club affiliation in 2008 is '2008 club'. Upon examining each row under this column, only Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107 was associated with 'tours vb'. Therefore, 11 players were not part of 'tours vb', which matches the claim that only 1 player was in the club.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
