    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 2 goals in friendly matches\" is true or false, we will analyze the table for entries where Cho Jae-jin participated in friendly matches and count his goals.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Friendly Matches:**\n   - Look at the \"competition\" column to find rows labeled as \"friendly match.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Rows:**\n   - Row 3: Date is 19 December 2004, venue is Busan, score is 1 goal, result is 3 - 1, competition is friendly match.\n   - Row 5: Date is 26 May 2006, venue is Seoul, score is 1 goal, result is 2 - 0, competition is friendly match.\n   - Row 7: Date is 5 July 2007, venue is Seoul, score is 2 goals, result is 2 - 1, competition is friendly match.\n\n3. **Count Goals in Friendly Matches:**\n   - From Row 3: Cho Jae-jin scored 1 goal.\n   - From Row 5: Cho Jae-jin scored 1 goal.\n   - From Row 7: Cho Jae-jin scored 2 goals.\n   \n4. **Calculate Total Goals:**\n   - Add the goals from each relevant row:\n     - 1 (from Row 3) + 1 (from Row 5) + 2 (from Row 7) = 4 goals.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 2 goals in friendly matches.\n   - However, based on our calculation, he actually scored a total of 4 goals in friendly matches.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because Cho Jae-jin scored more than 2 goals (a total of 4) in friendly matches according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with 'friendly match' competition.
