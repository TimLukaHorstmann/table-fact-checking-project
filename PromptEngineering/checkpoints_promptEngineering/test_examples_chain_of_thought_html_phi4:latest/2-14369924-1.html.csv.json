Thus, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Claim for `w230av`\n\n- **Claim**: \"the erp w and class for w230av be 55 and d\"\n  - From the table:\n    - For `w230av`:\n      - ERP (Effective Radiated Power) is listed as 10 watts.\n      - Class is listed as 'd'.\n  - Conclusion: The ERP for `w230av` is not 55, it's 10.
