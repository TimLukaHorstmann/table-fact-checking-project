    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"none of the Latvian submissions were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided. The table contains information about films submitted by Latvia for the Best Foreign Language Film category at various Academy Awards ceremonies.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Table Content:**\n   - The table lists Latvian film submissions over several years with columns detailing the year (and ceremony number), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result of the nomination.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry for Nomination Results:**\n   - For each row in the table, check the \"result\" column to see if it indicates a nomination.\n   \n3. **Analyze Each Year's Result:**\n   - **1992 (65th):** The film \"the child of man\" was not nominated.\n   - **2008 (81st):** The film \"defenders of riga\" was not nominated.\n   - **2010 (83rd):** The film \"hong kong confidential\" was not nominated.\n   - **2012 (85th):** The film \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" was not nominated.\n   - **2013 (86th):** The film \"mother, I love you\" has a result marked as \"tbd,\" which means it is to be determined and thus does not currently indicate a nomination.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information provided in the table, all entries except for 2013 have a clear \"not nominated\" status.\n   - The entry for 2013 (\"mother, I love you\") has an undetermined result (\"tbd\"), but as of now, it does not indicate a nomination.\n\n5. **Determine the Truth Value:**\n   - Since all known results are either \"not nominated\" or undetermined (but not confirmed as nominated), the claim that none of the Latvian submissions were nominated is true based on current information.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists films submitted by Latvia for Best Foreign Language Film.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify two main points based on the table:\n\n1. **Number of Films Submitted**: The claim states that 5 Latvian films were submitted for consideration.\n2. **Time Frame**: These submissions occurred over an 11-year period.\n\nLet's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Each Film Submission**:\n   - The table lists five rows, each corresponding to a film submission from Latvia.\n   - Each row contains details about the year of submission (ceremony), the title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\n2. **Verify the Number of Submissions**:\n   - Count the number of entries in the table: There are 5 rows, each representing a different film submission for the \"Best Foreign Language Film\" category.\n   - Relevant cells:\n     - Row 1: `year (ceremony)` = 1992 (65th), `film title used in nomination` = the child of man\n     - Row 2: `year (ceremony)` = 2008 (81st), `film title used in nomination` = defenders of riga\n     - Row 3: `year (ceremony)` = 2010 (83rd), `film title used in nomination` = hong kong confidential\n     - Row 4: `year (ceremony)` = 2012 (85th), `film title used in nomination` = gulf stream under the iceberg\n     - Row 5: `year (ceremony)` = 2013 (86th), `film title used in nomination` = mother, i love you\n\n3. **Verify the Time Frame**:\n   - The submissions span from 1992 to 2013.\n   - Calculate the time difference between the first and last submission years: \n     - 2013 (last year) - 1992 (first year) = 21 years\n   - The claim states \"in 11 years,\" which implies a continuous period of 11 years, not necessarily from the first to the last submission. We need to check if there are any 11-year periods within this range where submissions occurred.\n   - Submissions occur in 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013:\n     - Between 2008 and 2013 is a span of 5 years.\n     - There are no continuous 11-year spans with multiple submissions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim that \"5 Latvian films in 11 years\" is partially true: there were indeed 5 submissions, but they did not occur within any single 11-year period. The longest consecutive span with submissions is from 2008 to 2013 (6 years).\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists five film submissions from Latvia for the 'Best Foreign Language Film' category.
