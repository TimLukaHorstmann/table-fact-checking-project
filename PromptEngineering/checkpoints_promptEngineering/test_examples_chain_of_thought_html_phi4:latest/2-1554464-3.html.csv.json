    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze it step-by-step based on the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Matches Lost by Olivier Rochus\n\nThe claim concerns matches lost by \"Olivier Rochus.\" We will first identify rows where the outcome is \"runner-up,\" meaning a loss.\n\n- **Rows with \"runner-up\":**  \n  - Row 2 (11 February 2002): Opponent Lars Burgsm\u00fcller, Surface Hard (i)  \n  - Row 3 (3 March 2003): Opponent Karol Ku\u010dera, Surface Hard (i)  \n  - Row 4 (15 January 2005): Opponent Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, Surface Hard  \n  - Row 6 (24 September 2007): Opponent Richard Gasquet, Surface Hard  \n  - Row 7 (25 October 2009): Opponent Marcos Baghdatis, Surface Hard (i)  \n  - Row 8 (11 July 2010): Opponent Mardy Fish, Surface Grass  \n  - Row 9 (10 July 2011): Opponent John Isner, Surface Grass  \n  - Row 10 (14 January 2012): Opponent David Ferrer, Surface Hard\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Condition on Hard Surfaces\n\nThe claim states that Olivier Rochus loses to David Ferrer every time they play on a hard surface. From the identified \"runner-up\" rows:\n\n- Matches played on Hard surfaces:\n  - Row 4 (Opponent: Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, Surface: Hard)\n  - Row 6 (Opponent: Richard Gasquet, Surface: Hard)\n  - Row 10 (Opponent: David Ferrer, Surface: Hard)\n\nFrom this list, there is only one match on a hard surface where Olivier Rochus lost to David Ferrer (Row 10). Therefore, this part of the claim holds true.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Condition on Carpeted Surfaces\n\nThe claim mentions that he loses to John Isner each time they play on a carpeted surface. However, there are no rows in the table where the surface is listed as \"carpet\" or \"carpeted.\" Hence, this part of the claim cannot be verified with the available data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The condition about losing to David Ferrer on hard surfaces holds true based on the available data.\n- There is no data for matches played on carpeted surfaces; thus, the statement about losing to John Isner on such a surface cannot be confirmed or denied due to lack of information.\n\nSince one part of the claim (about carpeted surfaces) cannot be verified due to missing information and could potentially invalidate the entire claim if false, the overall truthfulness of the claim remains uncertain based on available data. However, as per the provided table, we can confirm that Olivier Rochus lost only once to David Ferrer on a hard surface.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all 'runner-up' matches for Olivier Rochus. Verified he loses to David Ferrer only once on a hard surface. No data available for carpeted surfaces, making the claim about losing to John Isner unverifiable.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
