    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding a diesel engine, we must analyze the data provided in the HTML table systematically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to focus on rows that describe diesel engines.\n   - The header row is at index 0 and contains general information.\n   - The relevant sections for diesel engines start from the fourth row onward, as indicated by the \"diesel engines\" title in both the model and engine columns.\n\n2. **Locate the Specific Engine:**\n   - We are looking for a specific diesel engine with the model name \"2.0 jtd.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 7 has the model \"2.0 jtd.\"\n     - This matches the first part of our claim regarding the engine type.\n\n3. **Check Displacement:**\n   - The claim specifies an engine from 1997, which might imply a need for displacement similar to engines from that year.\n   - In row 7, the displacement is \"1997 cc,\" matching typical displacements around that era.\n\n4. **Verify Fuel System Type:**\n   - We need to check if this model uses multi-point fuel injection.\n   - Row 7 indicates the fuel system for \"2.0 jtd\" as \"common rail direct injection.\"\n   - Multi-point fuel injection is a distinct technology from common rail direct injection, which involves precise fuel delivery directly into each cylinder.\n\n5. **Conclude Based on Analysis:**\n   - Since the \"2.0 jtd\" engine uses common rail direct injection and not multi-point fuel injection, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table specifies that the '2.0 jtd' diesel engine has a 'common rail direct injection' system rather than 'multi - point fuel injection.' Therefore, the claim about this engine having multi-point fuel injection is incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a fuel system with multi-point fuel injection also have SOHC 8 volt\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Multi-Point Fuel Injection:**\n   - Scan through the table to find any rows where the \"fuel system\" column specifies \"multi-point fuel injection.\"\n\n2. **Check Valvetrain for Identified Rows:**\n   - For each row identified in step 1, check the \"valvetrain\" column to see if it matches \"SOHC 8v.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Based on Findings:**\n   - If all rows with \"multi-point fuel injection\" have a \"valvetrain\" of \"SOHC 8v,\" the claim is true.\n   - If any row with \"multi-point fuel injection\" does not have a \"valvetrain\" of \"SOHC 8v,\" the claim is false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Multi-Point Fuel Injection:**\n   - The table has one entry under the \"fuel system\" column that specifies \"multi-point fuel injection\": \n     - Row 3 (2.0 ie): \"multi - point fuel injection.\"\n\n2. **Check Valvetrain for This Entry:**\n   - For row 3, check the \"valvetrain\":\n     - The \"valvetrain\" is \"dohc 16v,\" not \"sohc 8v.\"\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the entry with \"multi-point fuel injection\" does not have a \"valvetrain\" of \"SOHC 8v,\" the claim is false.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified row with 'multi-point fuel injection' (Row 3).
