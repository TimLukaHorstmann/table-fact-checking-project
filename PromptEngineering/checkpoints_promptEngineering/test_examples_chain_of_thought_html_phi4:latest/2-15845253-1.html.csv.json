Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Column for Envelopment**: The relevant information about whether a virus is enveloped or not is found in the \"envelopment\" column.\n\n2. **Count Enveloped Viruses**:\n   - Go through each row and check the value under the \"envelopment\" column.\n   - Count how many entries are labeled as \"enveloped\".\n\n3. **Detailed Analysis**:\n   - **Row 1**: adenoviridae - non-enveloped\n   - **Row 2**: herpesviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 3**: papillomaviridae - non-enveloped\n   - **Row 4**: polyomaviridae - non-enveloped\n   - **Row 5**: poxviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 6**: hepadnaviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 7**: parvoviridae - non-enveloped\n   - **Row 8**: astroviridae - non-enveloped\n   - **Row 9**: caliciviridae - non-enveloped\n   - **Row 10**: picornaviridae - non-enveloped\n   - **Row 11**: coronaviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 12**: flaviviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 13**: togaviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 14**: hepeviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 15**: retroviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 16**: orthomyxoviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 17**: arenaviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 18**: bunyaviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 19**: filoviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 20**: paramyxoviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 21**: rhabdoviridae - enveloped\n   - **Row 22**: unassigned - enveloped\n   - **Row 23**: reoviridae - non-enveloped\n\n4. **Total Count of Enveloped Viruses**:\n   - From the detailed analysis, we find that there are 15 entries labeled as \"enveloped\".\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"8 of the viral diseases possess an enveloped\". However, our count shows that 15 viral diseases are enveloped.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because more than 8 viruses are enveloped; specifically, there are 15.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells for Enveloped Viruses**:\n   - Row indices with \"envelopment\" as \"enveloped\": 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 8 viral diseases are enveloped.
