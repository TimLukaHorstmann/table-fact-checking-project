    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"multiple people be prison escapist and each leave the cube alive\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for specific information about individuals with the occupation of \"prison escapist\" and their status after exiting the cube.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Individuals with Occupation as \"Prison Escapist\":**\n   - Look through the column labeled \"occupation\" to find entries that match \"prison escapist.\"\n\n2. **Check Their Status After Exiting the Cube:**\n   - For each individual identified in step 1, check their corresponding entry in the \"status\" column to see if they are listed as \"alive after exiting the cube.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that multiple individuals with the occupation of \"prison escapist\" left the cube alive. Therefore, we need at least two entries under the \"occupation\" column as \"prison escapist\" and both must have a status of \"alive after exiting the cube.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Occupation: \"prison escapist\"\n  - Status: \"dead\"\n\nFrom this analysis, there is only one individual with the occupation \"prison escapist,\" and they did not leave the cube alive. Therefore, the claim that multiple people were prison escapees who left the cube alive is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains only one person with the occupation 'prison escapist' (Rennes), and their status is 'dead,' not 'alive after exiting the cube.' Therefore, there are no multiple people fitting the criteria of the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"occupation\", \"value\": \"prison escapist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"status\", \"value\": \"dead\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
