Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Ticket Price Column**: The column labeled \"Ticket Prices\" contains the ticket price data for each concert date and location.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Entry**:\n   - For each row, extract the values listed under \"Ticket Prices\".\n   - Note that some entries have multiple prices separated by slashes (e.g., \"18.50 / 16.50\"), indicating a range of ticket prices available on that date/location.\n\n3. **Determine Minimum Price for Each Entry**:\n   - For entries with a single price, this is the minimum price.\n   - For entries with two prices, select the lower value as the minimum price for that entry.\n\n4. **Find the Overall Lowest Ticket Price**:\n   - Compare all the minimum ticket prices identified from each row to find the lowest ticket price overall.\n\n5. **Compare With 17.50**:\n   - Check if any of the extracted minimum ticket prices are less than 17.50.\n   - If a price lower than 17.50 is found, then the statement \"the lowest ticket price be 17.50\" is false.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - After reviewing all entries in the table, we identify that there are several instances where the minimum ticket price for an entry is less than 17.50 (e.g., prices like 16.50, 15.95, etc.).\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The statement \"the lowest ticket price be 17.50\" is **FALSE** because there are multiple entries with a lower minimum ticket price.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify and extract all values from the 'Ticket Prices' column.\",\n    \"Determine the minimum ticket price for each entry, considering any range provided by slashes.\",\n    \"Compare all extracted minimum prices to find the absolute lowest price.\",\n    \"Verify if there are any prices lower than 17.50.\",\n    \"Conclude that the statement is false since there are prices below 17.50.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Prices\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
