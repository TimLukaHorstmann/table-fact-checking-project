This indicates that Ablett had a total of 27 disposals in 4 games during the 2005 season.\n   - For 2007:\n     - The \"disposals\" value is 191 (9.1). This indicates that Ablett had a total of 191 disposals in 21 games during the 2007 season.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Disposals:**\n   - To find out if there are 150 more disposals in 2007 compared to 2005, we calculate:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{Disposals in 2007} - \\text{Disposals in 2005} = 191 - 27 = 164\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there are \"150 more disposals\" between 2005 and 2007.\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of 164 disposals, which is indeed greater than 150.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since the calculated difference (164) is greater than the claimed difference (150), the statement is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells for this analysis are:\n  - Row index 0, column \"disposals\" for 2005.\n  - Row index 2, column \"disposals\" for 2007.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'disposals' data for 2005 and 2007.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Nathan Ablett's best year for points with Geelong being 2008 is true or false, we need to analyze the table data related to his performance across different seasons.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in Nathan Ablett's performance specifically during his time with the Geelong team.\n   - The relevant columns for calculating points are \"goals\" and \"behinds\", as AFL points are typically calculated as (Goals \u00d7 6) + (Behinds \u00d7 1).\n\n2. **Extract Data for Geelong Seasons:**\n   - Look at each row where the \"team\" column is \"geelong\".\n   - Extract the data from the columns \"goals\" and \"behinds\" for these seasons.\n\n3. **Calculate Points for Each Season:**\n   - For each season with Geelong, calculate the total points using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Points} = (\\text{Goals} \\times 6) + (\\text{Behinds} \\times 1)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform Calculations:**\n   - **2005 Season:**\n     - Goals: 8, Behinds: 2\n     - Points = (8 \u00d7 6) + (2 \u00d7 1) = 48 + 2 = 50 points\n\n   - **2006 Season:**\n     - Goals: 4, Behinds: 3\n     - Points = (4 \u00d7 6) + (3 \u00d7 1) = 24 + 3 = 27 points\n\n   - **2007 Season:**\n     - Goals: 34, Behinds: 18\n     - Points = (34 \u00d7 6) + (18 \u00d7 1) = 204 + 18 = 222 points\n\n   - **2008 Season:**\n     - Data is missing (\"-\") for all columns including goals and behinds.\n     - Therefore, no points can be calculated.\n\n5. **Determine Best Year by Points:**\n   - Compare the calculated points from each season:\n     - 2005: 50 points\n     - 2006: 27 points\n     - 2007: 222 points\n     - 2008: No data available\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Nathan Ablett's best year for points was in 2008.\n   - Since there is no data for 2008, it cannot be considered his best year based on the information provided.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Ablett's best year for points was 2008\" is FALSE because there is no available data to calculate points for 2008.
