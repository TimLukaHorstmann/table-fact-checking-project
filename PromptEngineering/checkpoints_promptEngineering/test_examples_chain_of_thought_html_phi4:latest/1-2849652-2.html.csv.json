This requires checking the \"1st tournament\" column for the starting year of each winter sport and comparing it with 1978.\n   \n4. **Cross-Reference Information**:\n   - Ensure no additional conditions are violated, such as other sports having exactly one division within a different time frame.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Row 4 (Bowling)**: \n  - \"season\": winter\n  - \"of divisions\": 2\n  - The first tournament in 2007, so it is not relevant for the year 1978.\n  \n- **Row 5 (Gymnastics)**:\n  - \"season\": winter\n  - \"of divisions\": 1\n  - First tournament in 1977, meaning gymnastics was already established by 1978. This row matches the condition of being a winter season with exactly 1 division.\n\n- **Row 6 (Swimming and Diving)**:\n  - \"season\": winter\n  - \"of divisions\": 2\n  - First tournament in 1977, but it has 2 divisions, so it does not satisfy the condition for having exactly 1 division.\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that there is indeed one winter sport (gymnastics) which started before 1978 and has exactly one division.
