Extra innings are indicated by a score containing parentheses, showing the final inning.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Extra Inning Games**: We'll look at each row of the table and identify any game with a score that indicates it was an extra inning game (e.g., \"14 - 11 (13)\" or \"9 - 4 (13)\").\n\n2. **Count Wins and Losses in Extra Innings**:\n   - For each identified extra inning game, determine if it is a win or loss for the team.\n   - A win would be indicated by the first number (team's score) being greater than the second number (opponent's score).\n   - Conversely, a loss would have the team's score lower than the opponent\u2019s.\n\n3. **Calculate Record**:\n   - Track how many extra inning games were won and lost.\n   - Verify if the record is \"0 - 3\" as claimed, meaning zero wins and three losses in such games.\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n\n- **July 21 vs. Angels**: Score \"5 - 2\". Not an extra inning game.\n  \n- **July 23 vs. Angels**: Score \"14 - 11 (13)\". This is an extra inning game:\n  - Team's score: 14, Opponent\u2019s score: 11\n  - Result: Win for the team.\n\n- **July 25 vs. Twins**: Score \"5 - 4\". Not an extra inning game.\n  \n- **July 30 vs. Tigers**: Score \"14 - 12 (13)\". This is an extra inning game:\n  - Team's score: 14, Opponent\u2019s score: 12\n  - Result: Win for the team.\n\n- **July 31 vs. Tigers**: Score \"9 - 4\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Indians were 1 - 3 in extra inning games in July 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for each game played in July 2008 that went into extra innings. An extra innings game is identified by having more than 9 runs scored in total or an indication such as \"(13)\" next to the score.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the relevant games:\n\n1. **Identify Extra Innings Games**: \n   - Look for games with scores that indicate extra innings, either through a higher-than-usual number of runs (suggesting multiple innings) or explicit notation like \"(13)\".\n   \n2. **Game on July 25**:\n   - Score: \"5 - 4\"\n   - There is no indication of extra innings in the score itself. Thus, this game does not count as an extra innings game.\n\n3. **Game on July 30**:\n   - Score: \"14 - 12 (13)\"\n   - The notation \"(13)\" indicates that this game went into 13 innings, which confirms it is an extra innings game.\n   - Outcome: Loss for the Indians (\"46 - 60\").\n   \n4. **Game on July 31**:\n   - Score: \"9 - 4\"\n   - No indication of extra innings in the score.\n   - This game does not count as an extra innings game.\n\nAfter analyzing all games, we find only one game that went into extra innings (July 30). The Indians lost this game. Since there is only one extra innings game and they lost it, their record for extra innings games in July 2008 is 0 - 1.\n\n**Conclusion**: \nThe claim states the record was \"1 - 3\".
