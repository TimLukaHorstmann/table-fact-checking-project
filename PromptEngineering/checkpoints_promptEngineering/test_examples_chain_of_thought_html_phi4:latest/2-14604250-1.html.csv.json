The attendance is `NaN`.\n   - This confirms that week 8 was indeed a bye week.\n\n3. **Count Total Games Played**:\n   - Exclude the bye week (week 8) from the total weeks.\n   - Weeks with game results are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. \n   - Counting these gives us a total of 16 games played.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The team indeed had a schedule for 17 weeks with one week being a bye (week 8).\n- They played 16 games in those 17 weeks.\n  \nThus, the claim \"in 2003, the Washington Redskins play 17 weeks with 1 bye\" is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The table has entries for weeks 1 through 17, indicating a total of 17 weeks.\",\n    \"Week 8 has no game information (all fields are dashes or 'NaN'), confirming it as a bye week.\",\n    \"Counting the weeks with games gives us 16 games played in total.\",\n    \"Therefore, the schedule included 17 weeks with one being a bye.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant column for identifying home games is the \"game site\" column since it indicates where each game was played.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games**:\n   - A home game can be identified by checking if the \"game site\" corresponds to \"fedex field,\" as this is the home stadium for Washington Redskins during 2003.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - We will go through each row of the table, checking the value in the \"game site\" column.\n   - If it matches \"fedex field,\" we count that game as a home game.\n\n3. **Count Home Games**:\n   - Go through each entry from week 1 to week 17 (as there are no games listed for week 8).\n\n4. **Detailed Examination**:\n   - Week 1: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n   - Week 2: Game site is \"georgia dome\" \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 3: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n   - Week 4: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n   - Week 5: Game site is \"lincoln financial field\" \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 6: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n   - Week 7: Game site is \"ericsson stadium\" (now known as Bank of America Stadium) \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 8: No data available, ignore.\n   - Week 9: Game site is \"pro player stadium\" \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 10: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n   - Week 11: Game site is \"ericsson stadium\" \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 12: Game site is \"giants stadium\" (now known as MetLife Stadium) \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 13: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n   - Week 14: Game site is \"giants stadium\" \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 15: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n   - Week 16: Game site is \"soldier field\" \u2192 Away game.\n   - Week 17: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game.\n\n5. **Total Count**:\n   - From the above analysis, the Redskins played home games in weeks: 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, and 17.\n   - This totals to 8 home games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the Redskins played 10 home games in 2003.
