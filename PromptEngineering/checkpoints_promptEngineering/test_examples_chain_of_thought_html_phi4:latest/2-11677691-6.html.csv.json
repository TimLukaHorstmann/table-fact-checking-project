    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Lessburg High School\" is true or false, let's examine the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Columns:**\n   - We are interested in three columns to verify the claim:\n     - `player`: To find the specific player mentioned.\n     - `position`: To confirm that the position is \"linebacker.\"\n     - `college`: To check if the college attended was \"Stanford.\"\n\n2. **Locate Lessburg High School:**\n   - Look through each row to find a player whose high school is \"Lessburg High School.\"\n\n3. **Verify Player's Position and College:**\n   - Once we locate Lessburg High School, verify that the position listed for this player is \"linebacker.\"\n   - Confirm that the college column indicates \"Stanford\" as their attended college.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Table Rows:**\n\n- Row 1: \n  - `player`: Mario Edwards, Jr.\n  - `position`: defensive line\n  - `school`: Ryan High School\n  - This row is not relevant because the school does not match \"Lessburg.\"\n\n- Row 2:\n  - `player`: Ellis McCarthy\n  - `position`: defensive line\n  - `school`: Monrovia High School\n  - Again, this is not relevant.\n\n- Rows 3 to 5: \n  - These rows mention different high schools and positions (all \"defensive line\"), so they are irrelevant for our claim.\n\n- Row 6:\n  - `player`: Vince Biegel\n  - `position`: linebacker\n  - `school`: Lincoln High School\n  - The school does not match, thus not relevant here.\n\n- Row 7:\n  - `player`: Scott Starr\n  - `position`: linebacker\n  - `school`: Norco High School\n  - This is not the correct high school.\n\n- **Row 8:**\n  - `player`: Noor Davis\n  - `position`: linebacker\n  - `school`: Lessburg High School\n  - `college`: Stanford\n  - This row matches all criteria:\n    - The player attended Lessburg High School.\n    - The position is \"linebacker.\"\n    - The college attended was Stanford.\n\n- Rows 9 to 12: \n  - These rows are not relevant since they don't match the high school \"Lessburg.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on row 8, we can confirm that there is indeed a player (Noor Davis) who is listed as a linebacker from Lessburg High School and attended Stanford. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the relevant columns for the claim: player, position, and college.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the data provided in the table. The claim states: \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Columns**:\n   - We need to focus on three columns based on the claim: `college`, `position`, and `school`.\n   - Specifically, we are looking for entries where `college` is \"Stanford\", `position` is \"linebacker\", and `school` is \"Norco High School\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - We will check each row to see if it matches the criteria mentioned above.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Entry**:\n   - For each row, identify the values in the columns of interest:\n     - Row 1: `college` = \"Florida State\", `position` = \"defensive line\", `school` = \"Ryan High School\".\n     - Row 2: `college` = \"UCLA\", `position` = \"defensive line\", `school` = \"Monrovia High School\".\n     - Row 3: `college` = \"Ohio State\", `position` = \"defensive line\", `school` = \"Bishop McDevitt High School\".\n     - Row 4: `college` = \"Ohio State\", `position` = \"defensive line\", `school` = \"Glenbard West High School\".\n     - Row 5: `college` = \"Rutgers\", `position` = \"defensive line\", `school` = \"Don Bosco Preparatory High School\".\n     - **Row 6**: `college` = \"Wisconsin\", `position` = \"linebacker\", `school` = \"Lincoln High School\".\n     - **Row 7**: `college` = \"Southern California\", `position` = \"linebacker\", `school` = \"Norco High School\". (This row matches the position and school but not the college.)\n     - Row 8: `college` = \"Stanford\", `position` = \"linebacker\", `school` = \"Lessburg High School\". (This row matches the college and position but not the school.)\n     - Row 9: `college` = \"Washington\", `position` = \"defensive back\", `school` = \"Grant Union High School\".\n     - Row 10: `college` = \"Alabama\", `position` = \"defensive back\", `school` = \"Dutchtown High School\".\n     - Row 11: `college` = \"Southern California\", `position` = \"defensive back\", `school` = \"Armwood High School\".\n     - Row 12: `college` = \"Miami (FL)\", `position` = \"defensive back\", `school` = \"Miramar High School\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - No row satisfies all three conditions simultaneously (`college` = \"Stanford\", `position` = \"linebacker\", `school` = \"Norco High School\").\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires a Stanford linebacker from Norco High School.
