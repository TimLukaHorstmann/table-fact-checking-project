    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Gene Borek from New Zealand be tie for 3rd place\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Gene Borek's Placement:**\n   - Locate the row with \"gene borek\" in the \"player\" column.\n   - In this row, check the \"place\" and \"country\" columns.\n\n2. **Check Gene Borek's Place:**\n   - The row for Gene Borek shows his place as \"t6\". This indicates that he is tied for 6th place, not 3rd.\n\n3. **Verify Country Information:**\n   - In the same row, verify Gene Borek's country.\n   - The table lists his country as \"united states\", not New Zealand.\n\n4. **Identify Players Tied for 3rd Place:**\n   - Look at the rows with place \"t3\" to see who is tied for 3rd place.\n   - Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, and Bob Charles are listed as tied for 3rd place, all from the United States.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Gene Borek is not tied for 3rd place; he is tied for 6th place.\n   - Additionally, Gene Borek is not from New Zealand; he is from the United States.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row with \"gene borek\": \n  - Place: \"t6\"\n  - Country: \"united states\"\n\n- Rows with place \"t3\":\n  - Players: Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, Bob Charles\n  - Countries: United States (for all)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Gene Borek's row shows his place as 't6', indicating he is tied for 6th place.\",\n    \"Gene Borek's country is listed as 'united states', not New Zealand.\",\n    \"Players tied for 3rd place are Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, and Bob Charles from the United States.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
