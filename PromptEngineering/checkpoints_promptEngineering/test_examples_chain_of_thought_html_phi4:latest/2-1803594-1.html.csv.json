    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the rankings provided for each school in both the 1-year and 5-year categories.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"the lowest rank shown in either the 1 year or 5 year ranking be 30\". This implies that no school should have a ranking lower than 30 in both lists combined (i.e., the minimum value across all rankings must be 30).\n\n2. **Identify Rankings**:\n   - For each row, check the values under the columns \"1 - year ranking of 727\" and \"5 - year ranking of 693\".\n   \n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - 1-year: 63\n     - 5-year: 22\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - 1-year: 265\n     - 5-year: 281\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - 1-year: 330\n     - 5-year: 246\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - 1-year: 717\n     - 5-year: 688\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - 1-year: 197\n     - 5-year: 148\n\n   - **Row 6** (Key Row):\n     - 1-year: 16\n     - 5-year: 30\n     \n   - **Row 7**:\n     - 1-year: 181\n     - 5-year: 165\n\n   - **Row 8**:\n     - 1-year: 126\n     - 5-year: 343\n\n   - **Row 9**:\n     - 1-year: 181\n     - 5-year: 194\n\n   - **Row 10**:\n     - 1-year: 371\n     - 5-year: 426\n\n   - **Row 11**:\n     - 1-year: 478\n     - 5-year: 343\n\n4. **Identify the Minimum Ranking**:\n   - From the analysis above, row 6 has a 1-year ranking of 16, which is lower than 30.\n   - All other rankings are higher than 16 and some are equal to or higher than 30.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is at least one rank (16 in row 6 for the 1-year category) that is less than 30, the claim is false.
