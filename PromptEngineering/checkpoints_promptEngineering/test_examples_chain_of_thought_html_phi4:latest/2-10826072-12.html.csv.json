We need to consider only those rows where the 'date' column matches this value.\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Rows**:\n   - All rows in the table have the date \"19 june 1971\". Therefore, all games are relevant for this analysis.\n\n3. **Check Crowd Sizes**:\n   - For each game (row), we will check the 'crowd' column to see if the number of attendees is greater than 20,000.\n   \n4. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Home Team: Carlton\n     - Away Team: North Melbourne\n     - Venue: Princes Park\n     - Crowd: 13,300 (not greater than 20,000)\n   \n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Home Team: St Kilda\n     - Away Team: Geelong\n     - Venue: Moorabbin Oval\n     - Crowd: 14,181 (not greater than 20,000)\n   \n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Home Team: Richmond\n     - Away Team: Fitzroy\n     - Venue: MCG\n     - Crowd: 24,831 (greater than 20,000)\n   \n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Home Team: Hawthorn\n     - Away Team: Essendon\n     - Venue: Glenferrie Oval\n     - Crowd: 14,181 (not greater than 20,000)\n   \n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Home Team: Footscray\n     - Away Team: Collingwood\n     - Venue: Western Oval\n     - Crowd: 21,188 (greater than 20,000)\n   \n   - **Row 6**: \n     - Home Team: Melbourne\n     - Away Team: South Melbourne\n     - Venue: VFL Park\n     - Crowd: 12,528 (not greater than 20,000)\n\n5. **Count Games with Crowds Greater Than 20,000**:\n   - From the evaluation above, rows 3 and 5 have crowds greater than 20,000.\n   - This means there are exactly 2 games with a crowd size greater than 20,000.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states \"only 2 games on 19 June 1971 have a crowd greater than 20,000\".

We convert these into decimal form by multiplying the goals by 6 (since each goal is worth 6 points) and adding the behinds.\n\n   - Carlton: \\(16 \\times 6 + 18 = 114\\)\n   - St Kilda: \\(14 \\times 6 + 15 = 99\\)\n   - Richmond: \\(6 \\times 6 + 11 = 47\\)\n   - Hawthorn: \\(14 \\times 6 + 20 = 104\\)\n   - Footscray: \\(8 \\times 6 + 15 = 63\\)\n   - Melbourne: \\(6 \\times 6 + 13 = 49\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the Average**: Sum all the decimal scores and divide by the number of games to find the average.\n\n   - Total score = 114 + 99 + 47 + 104 + 63 + 49 = 476\n   - Number of games = 6\n   - Average score = \\( \\frac{476}{6} \\approx 79.33\\)\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states the average home team score should be 13.82.
