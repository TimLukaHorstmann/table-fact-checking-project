    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to verify two aspects:\n\n1. Identify the team with a record of 34 - 27.\n2. Check if this team has 7 high assists by N. McMillan.\n\nLet's go through these steps systematically using the table provided:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Team with Record 34 - 27\n\n- We need to find the row in the table where the \"record\" column matches \"34 - 27\".\n- By examining each row, we see that the record \"34 - 27\" appears in Row 8.\n\n### Step 2: Check High Assists by N. McMillan for This Team\n\n- In Row 8, we need to check the \"high assists\" column.\n- The high assists value is recorded as \"R Pierce (5)\".\n- There are no mentions of N. McMillan having any assists in this row.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the team with a record of 34 - 27 has 7 high assists by N. McMillan, but from our analysis:\n\n- The team with record 34 - 27 does not have any high assists attributed to N. McMillan.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row 8, Column \"record\": \"34 - 27\"\n- Row 8, Column \"high assists\": \"R Pierce (5)\"\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on March 19 having a score of 112 - 91 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Row for March 19**: We will first identify which row in the table corresponds to the date \"March 19\". This involves scanning through the 'date' column.\n\n2. **Check the Score for that Date**: Once we have identified the correct row, we need to verify the score recorded on that specific date. This requires looking at the 'score' information from the 'team_score' and 'opponent_score' columns derived from the 'score' cell content.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claimed Score**: After extracting the actual scores, compare them to the claimed scores of 112 - 91 to determine if they match.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Row for March 19**:\n   - From the table, we find that in row indexed at \"67\" (considering the first game starts at index \"58\"), the 'date' column has the value \"March 19\".\n\n2. **Check the Score for March 19**:\n   - The cell under 'score' for this row contains \"112 - 91\". This means the team scored 112 points and their opponent scored 91 points.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claimed Score**:\n   - The claimed score is also \"112 - 91\", which matches exactly what's recorded in the table for March 19.\n\nThus, the claim that the game on March 19 had a score of 112 - 91 is accurate based on the data provided in the table.\n\nFinally, we provide our conclusion in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row with 'date' as 'March 19', which is row index 67.
