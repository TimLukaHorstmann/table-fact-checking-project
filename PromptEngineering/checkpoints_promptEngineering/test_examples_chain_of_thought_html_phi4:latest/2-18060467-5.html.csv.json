    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we will go through the data step-by-step to verify whether the statement \"the only player with a total score of 141 be jay haas\" is true or false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify all players' scores:**\n   - We need to look at each row in the table and check the 'score' column for the value `141`.\n\n2. **Check rows with a score of 141:**\n\n   - Row 9: \n     - Player: Mark Calcavecchia\n     - Score: 74 + 67 = 141\n   \n   - Row 10:\n     - Player: Jay Haas\n     - Score: 71 + 70 = 141\n\n   - Row 11:\n     - Player: Davis Love III\n     - Score: 70 + 71 = 141\n\n   - Row 12:\n     - Player: Tom Watson\n     - Score: 71 + 70 = 141\n\n3. **Analyze the claim:**\n   - The claim states that Jay Haas is \"the only player\" with a total score of 141.\n   - However, from our examination above, we found four players (Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, and Tom Watson) who all have a score of 141.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are multiple players with the same score of 141, the claim that \"the only player with a total score of 141 be jay haas\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells in the table for this analysis include:\n\n- Row 9, Column 'score': 74 + 67 = 141\n- Row 10, Column 'score': 71 + 70 = 141\n- Row 11, Column 'score': 70 + 71 = 141\n- Row 12, Column 'score': 71 + 70 = 141\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states Jay Haas is the only player with a score of 141. However, upon examining the table, four players (Mark Calcavecchia, Jay Haas, Davis Love III, and Tom Watson) have scores of 141. Therefore, the statement is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
