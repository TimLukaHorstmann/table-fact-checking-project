    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Poland was slower than Belarus by more than a minute\" is true or false, we need to examine the time entries for both Poland and Belarus from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Rows:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Poland:\n     - Poland's entry is in the first row with `rank = 1`.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Belarus:\n     - Belarus' entry is in the sixth row with `rank = 6`.\n\n2. **Extract Time Entries:**\n   - Extract the time for Poland:\n     - The time for Poland is `5:51.29` (from the row with `rank = 1`).\n   - Extract the time for Belarus:\n     - The time for Belarus is `6:06.80` (from the row with `rank = 6`).\n\n3. **Convert Times to a Comparable Format:**\n   - Convert both times from minutes and seconds into total seconds for easier comparison.\n     - For Poland: \n       \\[\n       5 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} + 51.29 \\text{ seconds} = 300 + 51.29 = 351.29 \\text{ seconds}\n       \\]\n     - For Belarus:\n       \\[\n       6 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} + 6.80 \\text{ seconds} = 360 + 6.80 = 366.80 \\text{ seconds}\n       \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Determine the difference in time between Belarus and Poland:\n     \\[\n     366.80 \\text{ seconds (Belarus)} - 351.29 \\text{ seconds (Poland)} = 15.51 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n   - Convert this difference back into minutes to see if it exceeds one minute:\n     - Since \\(15.51\\) seconds is less than 60 seconds, the time difference is not more than a minute.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Poland was slower by more than a minute compared to Belarus.\n   - However, we found that Poland's time was actually faster (less in total seconds) than Belarus's time, and the time difference of 15.51 seconds is less than one minute.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Poland was slower than Belarus by more than a minute\" is FALSE because Poland was faster, not slower, and the time difference was less than a minute.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
