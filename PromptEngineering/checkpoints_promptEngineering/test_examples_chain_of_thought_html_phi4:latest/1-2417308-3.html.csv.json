    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided for relevant information regarding successors and their installation dates.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The columns that are relevant to this task are \"successor\" and \"date of successors formal installation\". These will tell us who succeeded and when they were formally installed.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Installation Dates**:\n   - Look at each row in the table to find the installation dates for successors between 1855 and 1857.\n   \n3. **Row-by-Row Analysis**:\n\n   - **Row 1 (New Hampshire)**:\n     - Successor: John Parker Hale (R)\n     - Date of Installation: July 30, 1855\n     - This date is within the range 1855 to 1857.\n\n   - **Row 2 (Alabama)**:\n     - Successor: Benjamin Fitzpatrick (D)\n     - Date of Installation: November 26, 1855\n     - This date is also within the range 1855 to 1857.\n   \n   - **Row 3 (Pennsylvania)**:\n     - Successor: William Bigler (D)\n     - Date of Installation: January 14, 1856\n     - This date falls within the specified range.\n\n   - **Row 4 (California)**:\n     - Successor: William M. Gwin (D)\n     - Date of Installation: January 13, 1857\n     - This date is in 1857 and thus within the range.\n   \n   - **Row 5 (Indiana)**:\n     - Successor: Graham N. Fitch (D)\n     - Date of Installation: February 4, 1857\n     - This date also falls within 1857.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Successors**:\n   - From the above analysis, we have successors installed in each row from January 14, 1856, to February 4, 1857.\n   - Therefore, there are five instances where successors were formally installed between 1855 and 1857.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"there be 2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857\".\n   - We have identified 5 successors within this period.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because there are more than two successors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of each row's data for installation dates, we found five successors installed during the specified period. Thus, the claim that there were only \"2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857\" is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant columns 'successor' and 'date of successors formal installation'.
