This row matches the chassis requirement but not the entrant.\n   - **1959, British Racing Partnership (twice)**: The chassis in both instances is \"Cooper T51\" (not Lotus 12).\n\n3. **Check for Entrant Ivor Bueb**:\n   - No row lists \"Ivor Bueb\" as an entrant at any point from 1957 to 1959.\n\n4. **Determine Frequency of Lotus 12 Usage by Ivor Bueb**:\n   - Since there is no mention of Ivor Bueb as an entrant in the table, he did not race a Lotus 12 chassis at all according to this data.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that \"Ivor Bueb raced both the Lotus 12 chassis multiple times between 1957 and 1959\" is false based on the provided information.\n   - Ivor Bueb is not listed as an entrant, nor is there any indication of him racing a Lotus 12 chassis in this table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not mention 'Ivor Bueb' as an entrant.
