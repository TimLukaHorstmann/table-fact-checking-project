This is labeled \"production_code.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Row with Production Code 3t7458:**\n   - Search through the rows to find which one has the production code 3t7458.\n\n3. **Check the Writer(s) for That Row:**\n   - Once we have identified the row with the production code 3t7458, examine the \"writer(s)\" column for that specific row.\n\n4. **Verify if Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson are Listed:**\n   - Ensure both names are present in the \"writer(s)\" field for the corresponding row.\n\n### Applying the Steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** The \"production_code\" column is identified.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Look through each row:\n  - In Row 169, we find that the production code is 3t7458.\n\n- **Step 3:** Check the \"writer(s)\" for Row 169:\n  - The writer listed in this row is Genevieve Sparling.\n\n- **Step 4:** Verify if Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson are listed:\n  - Neither Don Whitehead nor Holly Henderson is listed as writers for production code 3t7458. Instead, it's Genevieve Sparling.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the information from the table, Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson did not write for the production code 3t7458.
