    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to compare the attendance numbers for two specific games: one against Dallas and another against LA Clippers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows**:\n   - The game versus Dallas is in row 6.\n   - The game versus LA Clippers is in row 5.\n\n2. **Extract the 'location attendance' values**:\n   - For the Dallas game (row 6), the attendance is \"14898\".\n   - For the LA Clippers game (row 5), the attendance is \"18089\".\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in attendance**:\n   - Subtract the attendance for the Dallas game from the attendance for the LA Clippers game:  \n     \\( 18089 - 14898 = 3191 \\).\n\n4. **Analyze the claim**:\n   - The claim states there were \"3191 more people in attendance at the game versus Dallas than at the game versus the LA Clipper\".\n   - However, our calculation shows that there were 3191 more people at the game versus the LA Clippers than at the game versus Dallas.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states which game had higher attendance by 3191 people.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the reasoning and answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant rows for Dallas (row 6) and LA Clippers (row 5).\",\n    \"Extract 'location attendance' values: Dallas game has 14898, LA Clippers game has 18089.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference: 18089 - 14898 = 3191.\",\n    \"The claim states there were 3191 more at the Dallas game than the LA Clippers game, which is incorrect as it's actually more at the LA Clippers game.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
