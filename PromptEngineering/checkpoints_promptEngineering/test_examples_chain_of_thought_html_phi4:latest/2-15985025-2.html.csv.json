    "resp": "To determine whether David Bielkhed's highest record win happened in Stockholm, Sweden against Nikola Matic, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Matches\n\nFirst, identify all matches involving David Bielkhed from the table:\n\n- **Row 8**: Match against Tom Haddock - WIN in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n- **Row 9**: Match against Valdas Pocevicius - WIN in Stockholm, Sweden.\n- **Row 10**: Match against Ryuta Sakurai - LOSS in Tokyo, Japan.\n- **Row 11**: Match against Sigitas Antanavicius - WIN in Helsinki, Finland.\n- **Row 12**: Match against Charles McCarthy - WIN in Ft Lauderdale, Florida, USA.\n- **Row 13**: Match against Kimmo Nurkse - WIN in Turku, Finland.\n- **Row 14**: Match against Joni Kyllonen - WIN in Helsinki, Finland.\n- **Row 15**: Match against Kai Rintakorpi - WIN in Turku, Finland.\n- **Row 16**: Match against Arben Lafti - LOSS in Turku, Finland.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Wins\n\nFrom the list above, identify all matches that resulted in a win for David Bielkhed:\n\n1. **Tom Haddock** (WIN) - Record becomes 1-0\n2. **Valdas Pocevicius** (WIN) - Record becomes 2-1\n3. **Sigitas Antanavicius** (WIN) - Record becomes 3-1\n4. **Charles McCarthy** (WIN) - Record becomes 4-1\n5. **Kimmo Nurkse** (WIN) - Record becomes 5-1\n6. **Joni Kyllonen** (WIN) - Record becomes 6-1\n7. **Kai Rintakorpi** (WIN) - Record becomes 7-1\n\n### Step 3: Highest Record Win\n\nDavid Bielkhed's highest record win is the last match listed above, against Kai Rintakorpi, with a record of 7-1.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Match in Stockholm Against Nikola Matic\n\nNow, check if there was any match involving Nikola Matic:\n\n- **Row 5**: Match against Nikola Matic - WIN in an event called \"lot,\" which does not specify the location.\n\nThis match is NOT listed as occurring in Stockholm, Sweden. It happened in an unspecified location labeled \"lot.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe highest record win for David Bielkhed (7-1) was against Kai Rintakorpi and did not involve Nikola Matic. Therefore, the claim that his highest record win happened in Stockholm, Sweden against Nikola Matic is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all matches involving David Bielkhed.
