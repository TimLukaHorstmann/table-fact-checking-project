However, upon reviewing the data:\n  - Only one game with zero points occurred on September 2.\n  - No game with zero points occurred on September 5.\n\nThus, the claim is false because it incorrectly identifies September 5 as having a zero-point game, and there are no other games with zero points besides September 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for games where either team scored zero points.
