Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can verify this using the table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We focus on the `march` and `opponent` columns to track when games against Minnesota North Stars occur.\n   - The claim specifies \"after March 2\", so we need to find entries in the `march` column greater than 2.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for March Dates Greater Than 2:**\n   - Game 64 (March 2) is played against Buffalo Sabres, not Minnesota North Stars.\n   - Game 65 (March 5) is played against Vancouver Canucks.\n   - Game 66 (March 8) is against Chicago Black Hawks.\n   - Game 67 (March 11) is against Detroit Red Wings.\n   - Game 68 (March 12) is against California Golden Seals.\n   - Game 69 (March 15) is against Chicago Black Hawks.\n   - Game 70 (March 16) is against Detroit Red Wings.\n   - Game 71 (March 18) is against Philadelphia Flyers.\n   - Game 72 (March 19) is against Toronto Maple Leafs.\n   - Game 73 (March 23) is against Boston Bruins.\n   - Game 74 (March 25) is against Montreal Canadiens.\n\n3. **Check for Minnesota North Stars:**\n   - None of the games listed above, with a `march` date greater than 2 and before game 75, are against Minnesota North Stars.\n   - The first mention of Minnesota North Stars occurs at Game 75 (March 26).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, there are no entries for Minnesota North Stars as an opponent after March 2 until Game 75.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each game entry with a 'march' date greater than 2 and checked if Minnesota North Stars were listed as the opponent.
