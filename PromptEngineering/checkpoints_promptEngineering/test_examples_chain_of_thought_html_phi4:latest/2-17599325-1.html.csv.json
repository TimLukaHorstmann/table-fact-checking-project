    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's follow a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states that there are only two drivers who have won more than one race. According to the claim, these drivers are Stan Jones and Alec Mildren.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Data\nWe need to identify all instances of winners in the table to determine how many races each driver has won.\n\n### Step 3: Count Wins for Each Driver\nLet's go through each row of the table and count the number of wins for each driver:\n\n- **Row 1**: Winner is Jack Brabham.  \n  - Total wins for Jack Brabham = 1\n\n- **Row 2**: Winner is Stan Jones.  \n  - Total wins for Stan Jones = 1\n\n- **Row 3**: Winner is Ted Gray.  \n  - Total wins for Ted Gray = 1\n\n- **Row 4**: Winner is Len Lukey.  \n  - Total wins for Len Lukey = 1\n\n- **Row 5**: Winner is Alec Mildren.  \n  - Total wins for Alec Mildren = 1\n\n- **Row 6**: Winner is Alec Mildren.  \n  - Total wins for Alec Mildren = 2 (incremented by 1)\n\n- **Row 7**: Winner is Lex Davison.  \n  - Total wins for Lex Davison = 1\n\n- **Row 8**: Winner is Stirling Moss.  \n  - Total wins for Stirling Moss = 1\n\n- **Row 9**: Winner is Stan Jones.  \n  - Total wins for Stan Jones = 2 (incremented by 1)\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Results\nFrom the count, we observe:\n\n- Jack Brabham has won 1 race.\n- Stan Jones has won 2 races.\n- Ted Gray has won 1 race.\n- Len Lukey has won 1 race.\n- Alec Mildren has won 2 races.\n- Lex Davison has won 1 race.\n- Stirling Moss has won 1 race.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Claim\nThe claim is that only Stan Jones and Alec Mildren have won more than one race. Based on our analysis, this is correct because:\n\n- Stan Jones has 2 wins.\n- Alec Mildren has 2 wins.\n- No other driver has more than 1 win.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is TRUE as no other drivers besides Stan Jones and Alec Mildren have won more than one race.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all instances of winners from the table.
