    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Cleveland scored 100 or more points in 9 games\" is true, we need to analyze the table for each game where Cleveland was listed as either the home team (\"home\") or the visiting team (\"visitor\"). For each of these games, we will check the score column to see if Cleveland scored 100 or more points.\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows step-by-step:\n\n1. **March 1:**  \n   - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 92 - 95 (Cleveland scored 92)  \n   - Not 100 or more points.\n\n2. **March 3:**  \n   - Home: Cleveland, Score: 120 - 97 (Cleveland scored 97)  \n   - Not 100 or more points.\n\n3. **March 5:**  \n   - Home: Cleveland, Score: 91 - 85 (Cleveland scored 85)  \n   - Not 100 or more points.\n\n4. **March 7:**  \n   - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 101 - 97 (Cleveland scored 101)  \n   - This is a game where they scored 100 or more.\n\n5. **March 10:**  \n   - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 94 - 92 (Cleveland scored 94)  \n   - Not 100 or more points.\n\n6. **March 11:**  \n   - Home: Cleveland, Score: 99 - 88 (Cleveland scored 88)  \n   - Not 100 or more points.\n\n7. **March 13:**  \n   - Home: Cleveland, Score: 124 - 100 (Cleveland scored 100)  \n   - This is a game where they scored 100 or more.\n\n8. **March 14:**  \n   - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 118 - 96 (Cleveland scored 118)  \n   - This is a game where they scored 100 or more.\n\n9. **March 17:**  \n   - Home: Cleveland, Score: 82 - 73 (Cleveland scored 73)  \n   - Not 100 or more points.\n\n10. **March 20:**  \n    - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 100 - 108 (Cleveland scored 100)  \n    - This is a game where they scored 100 or more.\n\n11. **March 21:**  \n    - Home: Cleveland, Score: 90 - 98 (Cleveland scored 90)  \n    - Not 100 or more points.\n\n12. **March 25:**  \n    - Home: Cleveland, Score: 93 - 105 (Cleveland scored 93)  \n    - Not 100 or more points.\n\n13. **March 27:**  \n    - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 105 - 94 (Cleveland scored 105)  \n    - This is a game where they scored 100 or more.\n\n14. **March 28:**  \n    - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 93 - 97 (Cleveland scored 93)  \n    - Not 100 or more points.\n\n15. **March 31:**  \n    - Visitor: Cleveland, Score: 112 - 108 (Cleveland scored 112)  \n    - This is a game where they scored 100 or more.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can count the games where Cleveland scored 100 or more:\n\n- March 7\n- March 13\n- March 14\n- March 20\n- March 27\n- March 31\n\nThis totals to 6 games.
