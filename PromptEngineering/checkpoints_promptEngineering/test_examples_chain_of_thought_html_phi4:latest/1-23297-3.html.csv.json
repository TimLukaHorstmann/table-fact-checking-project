Additionally, there is no entry for the 1998 Rome championship in the table, making that part of the claim irrelevant to the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- All cells from the \"surface\" column are relevant to determine the number of championships with a hard surface.\n- There are no relevant cells for the 1998 Rome championship as it does not exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified all championships with a hard surface.
