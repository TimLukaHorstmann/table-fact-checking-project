    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ivana Abramovic never played in the Mexico City tournament\" is true or false, we need to examine the provided table for any entries related to both \"Mexico City\" as a tournament location and \"Ivana Abramovic.\"\n\nHere are the steps of reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tournament Location**: Look through the table's \"Tournament\" column for occurrences of \"Mexico City.\"\n2. **Check Player Name for Each Entry**:\n   - For each entry where the tournament is \"Mexico City,\" check if \"Ivana Abramovic\" (or any variant) is listed as a partner in the \"Partner\" column.\n3. **Conclusion Based on Findings**: If there are no entries with \"Mexico City\" and \"Ivana Abramovic,\" then the claim is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Examination:\n\n1. **First Occurrence of Mexico City**:\n   - **Row 14**: \n     - Tournament: Mexico City\n     - Outcome: Runner-Up\n     - Partner: Maria Abramovic\n     - Relevant Check: The partner listed is \"Maria Abramovic,\" not \"Ivana Abramovic.\"\n\n2. **Second Occurrence of Mexico City**:\n   - **Row 22**:\n     - Tournament: Mexico City\n     - Outcome: Runner-Up\n     - Partner: Maria Abramovic\n     - Relevant Check: Again, the partner is \"Maria Abramovic.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- In both instances where \"Mexico City\" is listed as a tournament location, the partner named is \"Maria Abramovic,\" not \"Ivana Abramovic.\"\n- Therefore, based on the data available in the table, there are no entries that show \"Ivana Abramovic\" playing at the Mexico City tournament.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was checked for occurrences of 'Mexico City' in the 'Tournament' column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ivana Abramovic always win when she play with Maria Abramovic\" is true or false, we need to analyze each instance where Ivana Abramovic played with Maria Abramovic according to the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rows Involving Both Ivanas:**\n   - We will look for rows in the table where one of the partners is \"maria abramovic\" and check if the other partner is \"Ivana Abramovic\". However, the table only mentions \"Maria Abramovic,\" which suggests she's the only player named Abramovic involved. The claim might be referring to Ivana as a different partner.\n\n2. **List Relevant Matches:**\n   - We will identify all matches where Maria Abramovic is mentioned as a partner and record the outcomes (whether they are wins or losses).\n\n3. **Check Outcomes of These Matches:**\n   - We need to verify whether in every instance, Ivana Abramovic won when playing with Maria Abramovic.\n\n4. **Cross-reference All Relevant Data Points:**\n\nLet's identify these relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - \"Tournament\": Puebla\n  - \"Outcome\": Runner-up (Loss)\n  - \"Date\": 15-05-2006\n\n- **Row 12:**\n  - \"Tournament\": Saint Gaudens\n  - \"Outcome\": Winner (Win)\n  - \"Date\": 31-07-2006\n\n- **Row 13:**\n  - \"Tournament\": Martina Franca\n  - \"Outcome\": Winner (Win)\n  - \"Date\": 14-11-2006\n\n- **Row 14:**\n  - \"Tournament\": Mexico City\n  - \"Outcome\": Runner-up (Loss)\n  - \"Date\": 21-11-2006\n\n- **Row 15:**\n  - \"Tournament\": San Diego\n  - \"Outcome\": Winner (Win)\n  - \"Date\": 28-07-2007\n\n- **Row 16:**\n  - \"Tournament\": Dnipropetrovsk\n  - \"Outcome\": Runner-up (Loss)\n  - \"Date\": 23-09-2007\n\n- **Row 17:**\n  - \"Tournament\": Podgorica\n  - \"Outcome\": Runner-up (Loss)\n  - \"Date\": 20-10-2007\n\n- **Row 18:**\n  - \"Tournament\": Mexico City\n  - \"Outcome\": Runner-up (Loss)\n  - \"Date\": 29-11-2007\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the analysis, we observe that Ivana Abramovic and Maria Abramovic have played together in several matches. Among these instances:\n- They won in Saint Gaudens (Row 12), Martina Franca (Row 13), and San Diego (Row 15).\n- They lost in Puebla (Row 11), Mexico City (Row 14), Dnipropetrovsk (Row 16), Podgorica (Row 17), and another match in Mexico City (Row 18).\n\nSince there are instances where they did not win, the claim that Ivana Abramovic always wins when playing with Maria Abramovic is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was analyzed to identify all matches involving Maria Abramovic as a partner.
