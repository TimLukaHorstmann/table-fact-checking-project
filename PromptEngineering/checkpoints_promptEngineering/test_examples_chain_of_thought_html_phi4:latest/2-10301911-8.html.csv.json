    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the table is true, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states, \"the rider in third position have a time of 1:19.02.8.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Third Position**: \n   - In the given HTML table, each row corresponds to a different place or position.\n   - We need to find the row where `place` is 3.\n\n3. **Examine Row for Place 3**:\n   - The row corresponding to `place` = 3 contains the following data:\n     - Rider: Gunter Bartusch\n     - Country: East Germany\n     - Machine: MZ\n     - Speed: 85.93 mph\n     - Time: 1:19.02.8\n     - Points: 10\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim is about the time of the rider in third position.\n   - From the data, the time for the third place rider (Gunter Bartusch) is indeed \"1:19.02.8\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since the time recorded for the rider in the third position matches the claimed time, the statement is true.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row corresponding to place = 3. Examine the 'time' column in that row to verify if it matches the claimed time of '1:19.02.8'.
