    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the given table and specifically focus on two parts:\n\n1. Identify if there was a game played on October 30, 1977.\n2. Verify if any other game is listed with a greater week number than Week 7.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- **Check for the game on October 30, 1977:**\n  - Look at each row in the table and check the \"date\" column.\n  - In Row 7, we find the entry \"october 30 , 1977\", confirming that a game was indeed played on this date. The corresponding week number is Week 7.\n\n- **Determine if there are any games with a week number greater than Week 7:**\n  - Examine the \"week\" column for all rows in the table.\n  - Weeks listed after Week 7 include Weeks 8 through 14, confirming that there are multiple weeks with numbers greater than 7.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim states that there is no game played on October 30, 1977, which is listed as a week greater than Week 7. This is false because the game on October 30, 1977, is indeed listed in Week 7.\n  \n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n- Row 7 with columns \"week\" and \"date\" confirms that October 30, 1977, corresponds to Week 7.\n- Rows 8 through 14 in the \"week\" column confirm there are weeks greater than 7.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
