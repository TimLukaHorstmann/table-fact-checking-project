    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the match held on January 26, 2006, having a result of 2 - 1 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are looking for a specific row where the `date` column matches \"January 26, 2006\".\n\n2. **Locate the Row with the Specified Date:**\n   - From the table, we find that there is an entry in the second-to-last row with the date \"January 26, 2006\".\n\n3. **Verify the Result for the Identified Row:**\n   - For this row, check the `result` column to see if it matches the claimed result of \"2 - 1\".\n   - The `result` value is indeed \"2 - 1\".\n\n4. **Cross-Check Additional Details (Optional but Helpful):**\n   - Verify other details such as the `competition` and `score` to ensure consistency, though not necessary for this claim.\n   - The competition listed is \"friendly\", which matches typical context for a friendly match result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on these steps, the entry for January 26, 2006, confirms that the match result was indeed \"2 - 1\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The date 'January 26, 2006' corresponds to a row where the result is listed as '2 - 1'. The competition type also matches a friendly match. Thus, the claim about the match result on that date being '2 - 1' is confirmed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
