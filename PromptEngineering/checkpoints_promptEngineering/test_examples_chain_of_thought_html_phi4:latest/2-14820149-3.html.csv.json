However, the table shows they had 121 points each year.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the points for both years are not 61 as claimed but rather 121, the statement is false.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into the required JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 'ducados - yamaha' had 61 points in both 1990 and 1991 for the 500cc class.
