    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only 1st time minister of Albania be Pandeli Evangjeli\" is true, we need to analyze the table for information about who served as a prime minister of Albania for the first time during the period 1928 - 1939.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify First-Time Ministers:**\n   - We look at each row under the \"name\" column that includes \"(1st time)\" to identify those who were serving as a prime minister for the first time.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Relevant Row:**\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Name: Kostaq Kota (1st time)\n     - This indicates that Kostaq Kota served as prime minister for the first time from 5 September 1928 to 5 March 1930.\n   - **Row 3:** \n     - Name: Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time)\n     - This shows that Pandeli Evangjeli was serving his second term, not his first.\n   - **Row 4:** \n     - Name: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time)\n     - Indicates that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri served as prime minister for the first time from 22 October 1935 to 9 November 1936.\n\n3. **Conclusion on First-Time Ministers:**\n   - From the analysis, Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri both served as prime ministers for the first time during this period.\n   - Pandeli Evangjeli did not serve a first term; he was in his second term.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Pandeli Evangjeli was the only 1st time minister, which is incorrect based on our findings.\n   - Both Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri also served as first-time ministers.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis of the table, the claim is FALSE.
