    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to assess if both Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska are no longer active athletes based on their information from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Athletes in the Table:**\n   - Search for \"Enza Barilla\" and \"Snez Veljanovska\" within the table.\n\n2. **Analyze Enza Barilla's Data:**\n   - Enza Barilla is listed with:\n     - Column 1: \"20\"\n     - Column 2: \"(5)\"\n     - Column 3: \"20\"\n     - Column 4: \"(5)\"\n     - Column 5: \"0 (0)\"\n     - Column 6: \"0\"\n     - Column 7: \"2008\"\n   - The year \"2008\" indicates the last year of activity, suggesting that Enza Barilla is no longer active.\n\n3. **Analyze Snez Veljanovska's Data:**\n   - Snez Veljanovska is listed with:\n     - Column 1: \"8 (4)\"\n     - Column 2: \"7 (3)\"\n     - Column 3: \"1 (1)\"\n     - Column 4: \"0\"\n     - Column 5: \"2010 - present\"\n   - The entry in the last column, \"2010 - present,\" indicates that Snez Veljanovska is currently active.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Enza Barilla is no longer active as her data ends with the year 2008.\n- Snez Veljanovska is still active, as indicated by \"2010 - present.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim that both athletes are no longer active is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Enza Barilla's last year of activity is listed as 2008, indicating she is no longer active.
