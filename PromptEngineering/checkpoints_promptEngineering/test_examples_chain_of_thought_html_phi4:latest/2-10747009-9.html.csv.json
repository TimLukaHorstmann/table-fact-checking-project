We must ensure all matches listed are from that year.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**: The match involves Essendon playing against South Melbourne.\n\n3. **Outcome of the Match**: Essendon lost to South Melbourne according to the claim.\n\n4. **Venue**: The game took place at Windy Hill.\n\n5. **Date Consistency**: All matches should occur on the same date, which is 25 June 1927, as specified in the table header and all rows.\n\nLet's verify these components:\n\n- **Year Verification**: \n  - Each row in the table includes a \"date\" column with the value \"25 june 1927\", confirming that all matches are from the correct year.\n  \n- **Teams Involved**:\n  - In the second row, we find Essendon as the home team and South Melbourne as the away team.\n\n- **Outcome Verification**:\n  - The scores for this match in the table are: Essendon with \"12.12 (84)\" and South Melbourne with \"15.9 (99)\". Converting these to their numerical values:\n    - Essendon: \\(12 \\times 6 + 12 = 72 + 12 = 84\\)\n    - South Melbourne: \\(15 \\times 6 + 9 = 90 + 9 = 99\\)\n  - Since 99 (South Melbourne's score) is greater than 84 (Essendon's score), Essendon lost to South Melbourne.\n\n- **Venue Verification**:\n  - The venue for this match, as stated in the second row under \"venue\", is \"windy hill\".\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n1.
