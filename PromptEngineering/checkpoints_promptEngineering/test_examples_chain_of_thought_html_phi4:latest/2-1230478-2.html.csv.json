This suggests they might be the same song or versions of the same song charting together.\n\n4. **Determine if the Same Song Charted Twice**:\n   - Since \"I Don't Know\" and \"I Like You\" have identical chart positions in all categories (US Hot 100: \"61\", US Dance: \"1\", US R&B: \"65\"), it is reasonable to conclude that they are the same song or related entries.\n   - This indicates that Phyllis Nelson had a song that charted more than once in 1985.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"in 1985, Phyllis Nelson was able to chart two times with her song\" is TRUE based on the evidence from the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
