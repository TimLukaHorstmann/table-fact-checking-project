We should check if there are any entries in the table for this year.\n   \n2. **Person Mentioned (Jerry Traino):**  \n   The claim mentions Jerry Traino. We need to verify whether his name appears in any of the relevant columns, particularly under \"work\" or \"award.\"\n   \n3. **Award Type (Australian Kids' Choice Award):**  \n   The table should contain entries for the 2008 Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\n   \n4. **Number of Categories:**  \n   The claim states that there were nominations in two different categories. We need to check if there are multiple categories listed for this award and year.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Checking Year:**\n   - Review the \"year\" column for any entry marked as 2008.\n   - The table does not contain any rows where the year is 2008.\n\n2. **Person Mentioned (Jerry Traino):**\n   - Since there are no entries for the year 2008, we do not need to check for Jerry Traino specifically in this case.
