    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 1 match result in the result of a draw\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table's contents for any matches with the result labeled as a \"draw\". Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify the Column**: The column that indicates the result of each match is named \"res\".\n2. **Search for Draw Results**: We will go through each row in the table and check if there is a value \"draw\" under the \"res\" column.\n3. **Count the Number of Draws**: As we find any occurrences of \"draw\", we will count them to see how many matches have resulted in a draw.\n\nLet's walk through each step:\n\n- The table consists of 15 rows, including the header row. We need to check rows from index 1 (first data row) to index 14 (last data row).\n- **Row-by-row Analysis**:\n  - Row 1: `res` is \"loss\"\n  - Row 2: `res` is \"loss\"\n  - Row 3: `res` is \"win\"\n  - Row 4: `res` is \"win\"\n  - Row 5: `res` is \"loss\"\n  - Row 6: `res` is \"loss\"\n  - Row 7: `res` is \"win\"\n  - Row 8: `res` is \"loss\"\n  - **Row 9**: `res` is \"draw\" (This is the first and only draw found)\n  - Row 10: `res` is \"loss\"\n  - Row 11: `res` is \"win\"\n  - Row 12: `res` is \"win\"\n  - Row 13: `res` is \"win\"\n  - Row 14: `res` is \"win\"\n\n- **Count**: There is only one occurrence of the result being a draw, specifically in row 9.\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that there is exactly one match with a result of a draw. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cell where this occurs is:\n- Row index: 9\n- Column name: \"res\"\n\nHere's the JSON formatted answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table has 15 rows including headers.
