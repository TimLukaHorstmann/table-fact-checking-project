    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the data given under the column labeled \"goals for.\" The task involves verifying if there are any instances where the number of goals scored by a team (i.e., \"goals for\") is less than 30.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"goals for\" column since it indicates how many goals each team has scored in their games.\n\n2. **Examine Each Team's \"Goals For\":**\n   - Ottawa Hockey Club: 90 goals\n   - Montreal Wanderers: 74 goals\n   - Montreal Victorias: 76 goals\n   - Quebec Hockey Club: 57 goals\n   - Montreal Hockey Club: 49 goals\n   - Montreal Shamrocks: 30 goals\n\n3. **Check for Values Less Than 30:**\n   - Ottawa Hockey Club scored more than 30 goals (90).\n   - Montreal Wanderers scored more than 30 goals (74).\n   - Montreal Victorias scored more than 30 goals (76).\n   - Quebec Hockey Club scored more than 30 goals (57).\n   - Montreal Hockey Club scored more than 30 goals (49).\n   - Montreal Shamrocks scored exactly 30 goals.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - All teams have \"goals for\" values of 30 or higher.\n   - No team has a \"goals for\" value less than 30.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are no instances in the table where a team's \"goals for\" is less than 30.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'goals for' column was examined for each team. All values were 30 or greater, indicating that no game resulted in fewer than 30 goals being scored by any team.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
