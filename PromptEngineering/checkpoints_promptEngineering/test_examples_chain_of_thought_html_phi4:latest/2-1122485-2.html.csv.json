Therefore, a position of 1 is higher than a position of 24 or 25.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim incorrectly suggests that Alex Soler-Roig's position at 25 is the \"highest\" on the grid, which is not true as lower numbers indicate higher positions.\n- The correct interpretation based on traditional racing grid positions would place Jackie Stewart in the highest position (1), followed by Howden Ganley (24), and then Alex Soler-Roig (25).\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests an incorrect order of grid positions.
