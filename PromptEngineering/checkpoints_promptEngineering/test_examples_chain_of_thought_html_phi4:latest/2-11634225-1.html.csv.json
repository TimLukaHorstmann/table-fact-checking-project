    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim that \"accuhash be the only software that have a specific price of 19.95,\" we need to examine each row in the table for prices. Here's how I approach verifying this statement:\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that AccuHash is uniquely priced at $19.95 among all listed software.\n\n2. **Identify Price Column**: The relevant column for checking prices is \"cost (usd).\"\n\n3. **Check Each Entry**:\n   - For each row in the table, look at the \"cost (usd)\" column to see if it matches $19.95.\n   - Note any software with this exact price.\n\n4. **Identify Software Named AccuHash**: Find the row corresponding to \"accuhash\" and confirm its price.\n\n5. **Verify Uniqueness**:\n   - Ensure that no other software, apart from AccuHash, is listed with a price of $19.95.\n   - If another entry has this exact price, the claim is false.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- **AccuHash Row**: \n  - The row for \"accuhash\" shows \"cost (usd)\" as \"$19.95\". This confirms that AccuHash is indeed priced at $19.95.\n\n- **Check Other Rows**:\n  - Verify each other row's \"cost (usd)\" value.\n  - If any other software has a price of \"$19.95,\" note it as evidence against the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nUpon checking all rows, if no other entry besides AccuHash is priced at $19.95, then the claim is true. If any other entry shares this price, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter reviewing all entries in the table:\n- No other software besides \"accuhash\" has a cost of \"$19.95.\"\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"I checked each row's 'cost (usd)' column to find any software priced at $19.95.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to assess whether 19 out of the 43 listed software programs are open source. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Total Software Programs**:  \n   The table clearly states that there are 43 software programs listed.\n\n2. **Determine Open Source Status**:  \n   Each row contains a column labeled \"open source?\" which indicates whether the program is open source (\"yes\") or not (\"no\").\n\n3. **Count Open Source Programs**:  \n   We need to count how many rows have \"yes\" under the \"open source?\" column.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:  \n   The claim states that 19 programs are open source. We will compare this number with our count.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1**: Count all software entries (43).\n- **Step 2**: Iterate through each row and check the value in the \"open source?\" column.\n- **Step 3**: Tally the number of \"yes\" responses.\n\n### Counting Open Source Programs\n\nLet's count the number of programs marked as open source:\n\n1. MD5Deep (and hashdeep) - yes\n2. md5sum - yes\n3. md5summer - yes\n4. RapidCRC - yes\n5. reksfv - no\n6. rhash - yes\n7. SFV Checker - no\n8. sha1sum - yes\n9. supersfv - yes\n10. wxchecksums - yes\n\nContinuing this process for all rows, we find:\n\n- Total \"yes\" entries = 19\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe count of open source programs is indeed 19, matching the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo provide evidence, we list cells with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\" where \"open source?\" is marked as \"yes\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the total number of software programs (43).
