    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the game with the lowest attendance was played against the Athletics\" is true, we need to follow a structured approach:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to examine each row of the table to find two key pieces of information for every game: the opposing team and the attendance.\n\n2. **Locate All Games Against Athletics:**\n   - From the table, identify all games where the opponent was \"Athletics\":\n     - June 22\n     - June 23\n     - June 24\n     - June 25\n\n3. **Check Attendance for These Games:**\n   - Extract attendance figures for these games:\n     - June 22: 21418\n     - June 23: 27795\n     - June 24: 39659\n     - June 25: 49219\n\n4. **Determine the Game with the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - Compare all the attendance figures from every game in the table to identify the lowest:\n     - The smallest number is 21418, which occurred on June 22 against the Athletics.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Since the game with the lowest attendance (21418) was indeed played against the Athletics, the claim holds true.\n\n6. **Compile Relevant Cells for Documentation:**\n   - Identify cells from the table that are relevant to this analysis:\n     - For June 22 (\"Athletics\" opponent and \"21418\" attendance), extract both the \"Date\", \"Opponent\", and \"Attendance\".\n     - Additionally, confirm by checking all other attendances in other rows.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is supported by data as the game with the lowest attendance was against the Athletics.
