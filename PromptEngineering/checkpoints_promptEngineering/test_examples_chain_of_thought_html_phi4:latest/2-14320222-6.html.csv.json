    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the buffalo sabre and the los angeles king have a total of 80 points\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate the rows corresponding to games against the Buffalo Sabres and Los Angeles Kings.\n   - From the table, the row for the Buffalo Sabres (game 56) has a score of \"4 - 0\".\n   - The row for the Los Angeles Kings (game 60) has a score of \"5 - 3\".\n\n2. **Extract Points Data:**\n   - For each identified game, extract the number of points from the 'points' column.\n   - Game 56 against Buffalo Sabres results in a record update to \"37 - 15 - 4\" and earns the team 78 points.\n   - Game 60 against Los Angeles Kings updates the record to \"40 - 16 - 4\" with a total of 84 points.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Points:**\n   - The claim is about the total points after both games, not just their sum. Thus, we use the 'points' column directly from each game.\n   - Buffalo Sabres (Game 56): 78 points\n   - Los Angeles Kings (Game 60): 84 points\n\n4. **Sum of Points:**\n   - Add the points from these two games:\n     \\[\n     78 + 84 = 162\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Total:**\n   - The claim states a total of 80 points, but our calculation shows 162 points.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The calculated total (162) does not match the claimed total (80).\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games against Buffalo Sabres and Los Angeles Kings, extracted points from 'points' column for each game, summed these points to compare with the claim.
