    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Collingwood and St Kilda have an average away team score below 14\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - Locate rows where Collingwood and St Kilda are playing as the away teams.\n\n2. **Extract Away Team Scores**:\n   - For each relevant row, extract the \"away team score\".\n\n3. **Convert Scores to Numerical Format**:\n   - Convert the scores from their string format (e.g., \"12.14\") into a numerical format that can be averaged.\n\n4. **Calculate Average Score for Each Team**:\n   - Compute the average away team score for Collingwood.\n   - Compute the average away team score for St Kilda.\n\n5. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - Check if both averages are below 14.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - **Collingwood**: In row 3, Collingwood is listed as the away team.\n   - **St Kilda**: In row 4, St Kilda is listed as the away team.\n\n2. **Extract Away Team Scores**:\n   - Row 3: Collingwood's score is \"12.14\".\n   - Row 4: St Kilda's score is \"18.14\".\n\n3. **Convert Scores to Numerical Format**:\n   - The scores are in a format where the first number represents goals and the second number represents behinds.\n   - Convert using the formula: Total Score = (Goals \u00d7 6) + Behind\n     - Collingwood's score: \\(12 \\times 6 + 14 = 86\\)\n     - St Kilda's score: \\(18 \\times 6 + 14 = 122\\)\n\n4. **Calculate Average Score for Each Team**:\n   - Since each team has only one game in the dataset, their average score is simply their single game score.\n   - Collingwood's average score: 86\n   - St Kilda's average score: 122\n\n5. **Convert Average Scores to Goal Format**:\n   - Convert back to goals and behinds for comparison with \"14\":\n     - Collingwood: \\( \\text{Goals} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{86}{6} \\right\\rfloor = 14 \\), Behind = 2\n     - St Kilda: \\( \\text{Goals} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{122}{6} \\right\\rfloor = 20 \\), Behind = 2\n\n6. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - Collingwood's average score in goals is exactly 14, not below.\n   - St Kilda's average score in goals is 20, which is above 14.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that both teams have an average away team score below 14 is false because:\n- Collingwood's average score is exactly 14.\n- St Kilda's average score is 20.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows where Collingwood and St Kilda are the away teams.
