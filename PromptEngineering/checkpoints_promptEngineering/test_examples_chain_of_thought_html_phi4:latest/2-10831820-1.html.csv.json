    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the actor of the character ariadne oliver be hugh fraser\" is true or false, we need to verify which actor plays the character Ariadne Oliver according to the provided table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Character:**\n   - We are interested in finding out who plays the character \"Ariadne Oliver.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Character in the Table:**\n   - Look through the rows of the table to find where the character name matches \"Ariadne Oliver.\"\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information:**\n   - Once we locate the row with \"Ariadne Oliver\" as the character, identify which actor is listed for this role.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Actor:**\n   - The claim states that Hugh Fraser plays Ariadne Oliver. We need to check if Hugh Fraser is indeed listed in the relevant cell under the \"actor\" column for Ariadne Oliver's row.\n\n5. **Verify and Conclude:**\n   - If Hugh Fraser is not listed as the actor for Ariadne Oliver, then the claim is false.\n   - If anyone other than Hugh Fraser is listed, it confirms that the claim is incorrect.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Check each row of the table:\n  - Row 1: \"Ariadne Oliver\" does not match the character \"Hercule Poirot.\"\n  - Row 2: \"Ariadne Oliver\" does not match the character \"Arthur Hastings.\"\n  - Row 3: \"Ariadne Oliver\" does not match the character \"James Japp.\"\n  - Row 4: \"Ariadne Oliver\" does not match the character \"Felicity Lemon.\"\n  - **Row 5:** Character is \"Ariadne Oliver.\" The actor listed here is \"Zo\u00eb Wanamaker.\"\n  - Row 6: \"Ariadne Oliver\" does not match the character \"George.\"\n\n- From row 5, we see that Zo\u00eb Wanamaker is the actor for Ariadne Oliver.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states Hugh Fraser plays the role of Ariadne Oliver, but according to the table, it is Zo\u00eb Wanamaker who plays this role.
