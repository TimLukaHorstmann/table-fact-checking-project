We need to check both the \"date\" and \"result\" columns.\n\n2. **Search for Specific Date:**\n   - Look through the \"date\" column for an entry matching \"10 september 2013.\"\n\n3. **Locate Corresponding Row:**\n   - Once the correct date is identified, find which row it belongs to in order to check other related details such as the result.\n\n4. **Verify Match Result:**\n   - Examine the \"result\" column for the same row where the date matches \"10 september 2013.\"\n   - Check if the result recorded is \"3 - 2.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If both conditions (date and result) match the claim, then the statement is true.\n   - Otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Applying the Reasoning\n\n- **Identifying Relevant Date:**\n  - From the table:\n    - Row 1: \"24 march 2007\"\n    - Row 2: \"3 march 2010\"\n    - Row 3: \"9 july 2011\"\n    - **Row 4:** \"22 may 2013\"\n    - **Row 5:** \"10 september 2013\" (Matches the claim)\n\n- **Verify Result in Corresponding Row:**\n  - For **Row 5**:\n    - The result is listed as \"3 - 2.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe match on \"10 september 2013\" indeed had a result of \"3 - 2.\" Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we identified and checked the 'date' column for an entry matching '10 september 2013'.
