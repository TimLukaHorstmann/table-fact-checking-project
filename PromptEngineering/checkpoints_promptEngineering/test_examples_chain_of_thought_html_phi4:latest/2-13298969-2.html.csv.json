    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the statement, we need to examine whether both matches against Sultan Aliev and Lavar Johnson were decided by submission. We'll do this by analyzing each relevant match from the dataset.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Against Sultan Aliev:**\n   - Search for a match where \"sultan aliev\" is listed as the opponent.\n   - Locate the row in the table that lists Sultan Aliev:\n     - Row 10 shows a fight against Sultan Aliev with the outcome \"submission (strikes)\".\n\n2. **Determine the Decision Method for Sultan Aliev:**\n   - The decision method for this match is \"submission (strikes)\", which indicates it was decided by submission.\n\n3. **Identify Matches Against Lavar Johnson:**\n   - Search for a match where \"lavar johnson\" is listed as the opponent.\n   - Locate the row in the table that lists Lavar Johnson:\n     - Row 15 shows a fight against Lavar Johnson with the outcome \"tko (corner stoppage)\".\n\n4. **Determine the Decision Method for Lavar Johnson:**\n   - The decision method for this match is \"tko (corner stoppage)\", which indicates it was decided by TKO, not submission.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The match against Sultan Aliev was decided by submission.\n   - The match against Lavar Johnson was not decided by submission; it was a TKO.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the statement \"the match against sultan aliev and lavar johnson be both decide by submission\" is false because only one of these matches was decided by submission.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
