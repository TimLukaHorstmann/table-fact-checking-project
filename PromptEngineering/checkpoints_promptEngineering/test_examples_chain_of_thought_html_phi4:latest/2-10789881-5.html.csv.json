We need to check if there's any match involving either Hawthorn or Richmond at this venue.\n   - In row 3, Carlton plays Collingwood at Princes Park. There is no mention of Hawthorn or Richmond in this match.\n\n4. **Attendance**: The claim states the attendance should be \"9000\".\n   - Row 1 has an attendance of 11000.\n   - Row 2 has an attendance of 15000.\n   - Row 3 has an attendance of 35000.\n   - None of these matches involve Hawthorn or Richmond, and none have an attendance of 9000.
