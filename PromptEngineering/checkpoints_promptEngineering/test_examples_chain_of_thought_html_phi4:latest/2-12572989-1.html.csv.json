The total number of releases following the first one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the First Release:**\n   - According to the table, each row represents a distinct volume with its corresponding details such as \"vol\", \"english title\", \"japanese title\", \"release date (japan)\", and \"sony catalog no\".\n   - The first release is in the first row of the table:\n     - **Row Index 0** (since indexing starts at 0 in most data structures):\n       - Volume: 1\n       - English Title: \"garou : mark of the wolves\"\n       - Japanese Title: \"\u9913\u72fc - mark of the wolves -\"\n       - Release Date (Japan): June 30, 2005\n       - Sony Catalog No: slps - 25509\n\n2. **Verify the Release Date:**\n   - The claim states that the first release is on June 30, 2005.\n   - From Row Index 0:\n     - Release Date (Japan) matches exactly with \"June 30, 2005\".\n\n3. **Count Subsequent Releases:**\n   - We need to count all entries following the first one and verify if there are indeed 12 more releases.\n   - The table has a total of 12 rows (from vol 1 to vol 12).\n   - Subtracting the first release, we have:\n     - Total entries = 12\n     - Subsequent releases after the first = 12 - 1 = 11\n\n4. **Verify Number of Following Releases:**\n   - The claim states that there are \"12 others\" following the first one.\n   - We counted only 11 subsequent releases, not 12.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe release date for the first volume is correct as per the claim, but the number of subsequent releases (11) does not match with what was stated in the claim (12).
