    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to assess two specific parts:\n\n1. Verify if Dave Hynek and Robin Lang are from Canada.\n2. Determine whether they were part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n#### Step 1: Check Nationalities of Dave Hynek and Robin Lang\n- **Dave Hynek**:\n  - According to row 4, the column \"nationality\" is filled with \"Canada\". Therefore, Dave Hynek is from Canada.\n  \n- **Robin Lang**:\n  - According to row 5, the column \"nationality\" is also filled with \"Canada\". Thus, Robin Lang is from Canada.\n\nBoth players are indeed from Canada. \n\n#### Step 2: Determine if they were part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers\nThe provided table contains information about player rounds, names, positions, nationalities, and previous team affiliations but does not provide any historical data or specific information regarding which NHL teams these players played for during their careers.\n\nTherefore, from the given table, there is no evidence to confirm or deny whether Dave Hynek and Robin Lang were part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers. This particular detail would require external research beyond what is provided in the table.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that both players are from Canada, which is true according to the table data. However, it also includes a historical assertion about them being on the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers team, for which there is no information available in the table. Thus, we cannot verify this part of the claim with the given data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Dave Hynek and Robin Lang are both from Canada as per the table's nationality column.
