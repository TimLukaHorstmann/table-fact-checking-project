Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - We need to check if there are any entries in the table involving the Washington Redskins.\n   - Additionally, we must find any games played against the Dallas Cowboys (\"Cowboys\").\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Opponent Information:**\n   - Check each row under the \"opponent\" column to see if it mentions either the Washington Redskins or the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n3. **Determine Game Outcomes:**\n   - For any game involving the Redskins, check the \"result\" column to determine if they won.\n   - For any game involving the Cowboys, similarly, check for a win.\n\n4. **Count Wins Over Cowboys:**\n   - Specifically, count how many times (if at all) the Redskins have won against the Cowboys in 2001 as per the table.\n\n### Analysis of Table\n\n- **Row 5:** The opponent is \"Washington Redskin\" and the result is \"w 9 - 7\". This indicates a win by the team playing, but it doesn't involve the Cowboys.\n  \n- **Row 12:** Again, the opponent is \"Washington redskins\" with a result of \"w 20 - 14\", indicating another win by the team playing. No mention of the Cowboys here either.\n\n- **No Rows Involving Cowboys:**\n  - Upon reviewing all rows under the \"opponent\" column, there are no entries that list \"Dallas Cowboys\" or any variation thereof as an opponent in 2001.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there are no games involving the Dallas Cowboys listed in the table for the year 2001, it is impossible for the Redskins to have won two times over the Cowboys based on this data.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to examine the attendance figures for each game listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for verifying the claim is \"attendance\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry in the Attendance Column:**\n   - For each row, check the value in the \"attendance\" column to see if it exceeds 80,000.\n\n3. **Check Each Row Individually:**\n\n   - **Week 1:** \n     - Attendance: 61,521\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 2:**\n     - Attendance: 63,430\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 3:**\n     - Attendance: 66,621\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 4:**\n     - Attendance: 61,535\n     - Less than 80,000.\n\n   - **Week 5:**\n     - Attendance: 63,941\n     - Less than 80,000.\n\n   - **Week 7:**\n     - Attendance: 63,114\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 8:**\n     - Attendance: 78,673\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 9:**\n     - Attendance: 69,010\n     - Less than 80,000.\n\n   - **Week 10:**\n     - Attendance: 63,204\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 11:**\n     - Attendance: 64,104\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 12:**\n     - Attendance: 85,112\n     - Greater than 80,000. This is the first instance where attendance exceeds 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 13:**\n     - Attendance: 61,821\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 14:**\n     - Attendance: 63,366\n     - Less than 80,000.\n\n   - **Week 15:**\n     - Attendance: 48,883\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 16:**\n     - Attendance: 64,366\n     - Less than 80,000.\n   \n   - **Week 17:**\n     - Attendance: 77,512\n     - Less than 80,000.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is exactly one instance (week 12) where the attendance exceeded 80,000, which was 85,112.\n   - The claim states \"there be never more than 80000 in attendance\", implying no game had an attendance greater than 80,000.\n   - Since week 12 has an attendance of 85,112, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 11 (Week 12): Attendance = 85,112\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each entry in the 'attendance' column.
