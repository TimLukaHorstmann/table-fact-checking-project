    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kweku Adoboli work for UBS in London, United Kingdom\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We are looking for information related to \"Kweku Adoboli,\" so we find the row with his name.\n\n2. **Check Institution Column:**\n   - Once we locate Kweku Adoboli's row, check the \"institution\" column to verify if it mentions UBS.\n\n3. **Check Country/Location Column:**\n   - In addition to checking for UBS in the institution column, confirm the location by examining the \"country\" column to see if it lists \"London, United Kingdom.\"\n\n4. **Verification Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Kweku Adoboli worked for UBS and was located in London, United Kingdom. Both these conditions must be satisfied within his row.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step process:\n\n1. Locate the row corresponding to \"Kweku Adoboli.\" This is found in the second row of the table:\n   - **Row Index**: 2\n   - **Name Column**: \"kweku adoboli\"\n\n2. Check the \"institution\" column for this row to confirm the institution he worked for:\n   - **Institution Column**: \"ubs\"\n   - This confirms that Kweku Adoboli did work for UBS.\n\n3. Verify the \"country\" column to ensure his location was London, United Kingdom:\n   - **Country Column**: \"london , united kingdom\"\n   - This confirms that he was indeed in London, United Kingdom.\n\nSince both conditions specified in the claim are met (working for UBS and being located in London, United Kingdom), we conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere is the structured JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Kweku Adoboli's row. Verified 'institution' as UBS and 'country' as London, United Kingdom. Both conditions match the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
