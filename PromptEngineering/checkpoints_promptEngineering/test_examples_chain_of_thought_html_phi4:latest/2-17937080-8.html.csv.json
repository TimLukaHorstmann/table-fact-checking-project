    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the specific row corresponding to rank 11 and examine its value under the column \"goals per match.\"\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Rank 11:**\n   - The first step is to locate the row in the table where the `rank` is equal to 11.\n\n2. **Examine the \"Goals per Match\" Value:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row, we need to look at the value under the column labeled \"goals per match.\"\n\n3. **Compare with 1.237:**\n   - Compare this value with 1.237 to determine if it is less than 1.237.\n\n4. **Determine the Truth of the Claim:**\n   - If the \"goals per match\" value for rank 11 is indeed less than 1.237, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Applying the Steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Locate the row where `rank = 11`.\n  - From the table, we find that in row index 10 (0-based indexing), the player with `rank` 11 is \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano.\"\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the value under \"goals per match\" for this row.\n  - The value listed under \"goals per match\" for this player is 1.000.\n\n- **Step 3:** Compare 1.000 with 1.237.\n  - Since 1.000 is less than 1.237, this comparison supports the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analysis shows that the player on rank 11 has a \"goals per match\" value of 1.000, which is indeed less than 1.237. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row with rank 11 as alfredo di st\u00e9fano. Found 'goals per match' to be 1.000 for this player.
