    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about seasons 4 and 5 having an equal gap between total prize money and potential prize money is true or false, let's perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - Locate the rows corresponding to season 4 and season 5 in the table.\n   - Extract the values for \"total prize money\" and \"potential prize money\" for these seasons.\n\n2. **Calculate Gaps**:\n   - For each of these seasons, calculate the gap between potential prize money and total prize money using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Gap} = \\text{Potential Prize Money} - \\text{Total Prize Money}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compare Gaps**:\n   - Compare the calculated gaps for season 4 and season 5 to see if they are equal.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n- **For Season 4** (Row index: 3):\n  - Total Prize Money = 104,000\n  - Potential Prize Money = 531,000\n  - Gap Calculation:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Gap for Season 4} = 531,000 - 104,000 = 427,000\n    \\]\n\n- **For Season 5** (Row index: 4):\n  - Total Prize Money = 203,000\n  - Potential Prize Money = 539,000\n  - Gap Calculation:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Gap for Season 5} = 539,000 - 203,000 = 336,000\n    \\]\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - Gap for Season 4 is 427,000.\n  - Gap for Season 5 is 336,000.\n  - The gaps are not equal.\n\nThus, the claim that \"season 4 and 5 have an equal gap between total prize money and potential prize money\" is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant data for seasons 4 and 5.
