    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"queen do not have any single on the chart\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for entries related to the artist \"Queen.\" Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest**: The relevant columns in this context are \"artist\" and \"single,\" as they contain information about who performed a song.\n\n2. **Search for the Artist \"Queen\"**:\n   - Look through each row in the \"artist\" column to find any entry that matches \"queen.\"\n\n3. **Examine Relevant Rows**:\n   - The table has eight rows of data.\n   - Check each row's \"artist\" cell for an entry that reads \"queen.\"\n\n4. **Find Matching Entry**:\n   - In the 4th row, the \"artist\" column contains the entry \"queen.\"\n\n5. **Verify Details in the Relevant Row**:\n   - The corresponding \"single\" for this artist is \"bohemian rhapsody.\"\n   - The \"year\" entries are \"1975 / 76 & 1991 / 92,\" indicating multiple periods of chart presence.\n   - The \"weeks\" column shows \"14 weeks,\" confirming the duration on the chart.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is an entry for \"queen\" in the table with a corresponding single \"bohemian rhapsody\" and detailed chart information, the claim that \"Queen do not have any single on the chart\" is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's present this analysis in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for entries under the 'artist' column.
