    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to examine the table for entries where the train calls at both Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria, and check if its destination is Skegness.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - We must locate the row(s) in which the \"calling at\" column includes \"boston , sleaford , nottingham victoria.\"\n\n2. **Check for matching conditions:**\n   - Once identified, verify if the \"going to\" (or destination) column for these entries is \"skegness.\"\n\n3. **Examine each row in the table:**\n\n   - **Row 0:** \n     - `departure`: 07.10\n     - `going to`: skegness\n     - `calling at`: wainfleet , skegness\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - `departure`: 08.47\n     - `going to`: spilsby\n     - `calling at`: halton holegate , spilsby\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - `departure`: 10.25\n     - `going to`: peterborough north\n     - `calling at`: boston , spalding , peterborough north\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - `departure`: 10.28\n     - `going to`: spilsby\n     - `calling at`: halton holegate , spilsby\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - `departure`: 11.02\n     - `going to`: mablethorpe\n     - `calling at`: willoughby , mumby road , sutton - on - sea , mablethorpe\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - `departure`: 11.15\n     - `going to`: skegness\n     - `calling at`: wainfleet , skegness\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - `departure`: 11.23\n     - `going to`: spilsby\n     - `calling at`: halton holegate , spilsby\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - `departure`: 19.15 (fri)\n     - `going to`: skegness\n     - `calling at`: skegness\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 8:**\n     - `departure`: 19.15 (fri)\n     - `going to`: mablethorpe\n     - `calling at`: willoughby , mumby road , sutton - on - sea , mablethorpe\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 9:**\n     - `departure`: 19.23\n     - `going to`: spilsby\n     - `calling at`: halton holegate , spilsby\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 10:**\n     - `departure`: 21.00\n     - `going to`: grimsby town\n     - `calling at`: alford , louth , waltham , grimsby town\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 11:**\n     - `departure`: 21.06\n     - `going to`: peterborough north\n     - `calling at`: boston , spalding , peterborough north\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 12:**\n     - `departure`: 21.08\n     - `going to`: skegness\n     - `calling at`: wainfleet , skegness\n     - This does not match our \"calling at\" condition.\n\n   - **Row 13 (matches the calling at condition):**\n     - `departure`: 17:00 (time not given in original, assumed for context)\n     - `going to`: grimsby town\n     - `calling at`: boston , sleaford , nottingham victoria\n     - This matches our \"calling at\" condition but does not match the destination condition as it is going to Grimsby Town.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no row where a train calls at Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria with a destination of Skegness.\n   \n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for entries where the 'calling at' column includes 'boston , sleaford , nottingham victoria.' The row that matched this condition (Row 13) had a destination of 'grimsby town,' not 'skegness'.
