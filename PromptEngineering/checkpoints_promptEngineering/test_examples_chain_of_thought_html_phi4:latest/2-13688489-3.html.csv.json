Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row 16**: `season` = \"2008 clausura\", `score` = \"1:0\"\n- **Row 17**: `season` = \"2008 apertura\", `score` = \"1:0\"\n- **Row 23**: `season` = \"2006 clausura\", `score` = \"1:0\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each specified season for a match with score 1:0.
