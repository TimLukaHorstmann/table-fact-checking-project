    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to identify how many Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 30 games. We will do this by analyzing the data provided for each quarterback's wins.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table contains several columns relevant to our analysis:\n     - \"Name\" (quarterback names)\n     - \"Years\" (years active with Browns)\n     - \"Starts\" (games started)\n     - \"W-L\" (Wins-Losses record)\n     - \"Win%\" (Win Percentage)\n\n2. **Identify Wins:**\n   - We focus on the column that indicates wins, which is part of the \"W-L\" record.\n   - Extract the number of wins for each quarterback from this data.\n\n3. **Count Quarterbacks with More Than 30 Wins:**\n   - Go through each row and count how many quarterbacks have more than 30 wins.\n\n4. **Cross-Verify with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that only 10 Browns quarterbacks have won more than 30 games.\n   - Compare our count to this number.\n\n5. **List Relevant Data Points:**\n   - Identify rows where quarterbacks have more than 30 wins for verification purposes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From the table, we extract the wins from the \"W-L\" column for each quarterback:\n  - **Brian Sipe**: Wins = 66\n  - **Otto Graham**: Wins = 114\n  - **Milt Plum**: Wins = 45\n  - **Bobby Mitchell**: Wins = 39\n  - **Cecil Isbell**: Wins = 34\n  - **Sammy Baugh**: Wins = 31\n  - **Steve DeBerg**: Wins = 33\n  - **Paul Brown**: Wins = 107\n  - **Mike Phipps**: Wins = 32\n  - **Omar and Levi**: Combined Wins = 43 (considering they are listed together)\n  - **Bill Nelsen**: Wins = 37\n\n- Count the quarterbacks with more than 30 wins:\n  - Brian Sipe, Otto Graham, Milt Plum, Bobby Mitchell, Cecil Isbell, Sammy Baugh, Steve DeBerg, Paul Brown, Mike Phipps, Omar and Levi (considered together), Bill Nelsen.\n\n- Total count: 11 quarterbacks have more than 30 wins.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that only 10 quarterbacks have won more than 30 games. However, our analysis shows there are 11 such quarterbacks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified the 'W-L' column to extract the number of wins for each quarterback.
