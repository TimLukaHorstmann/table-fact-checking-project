    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about Arizona 8, we need to analyze the data in the table step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We are interested in the row corresponding to \"arizona 8\" to check the details related to its incumbent's first election and subsequent re-election.\n\n2. **Locate \"Arizona 8\" Row:**\n   - The table contains a row for each district, with one row dedicated to \"arizona 8\":\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>arizona 8</td>\n       <td>jim kolbe</td>\n       <td>republican</td>\n       <td>1984</td>\n       <td>retired democratic gain</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n3. **Check \"First Elected\" Year:**\n   - The \"first elected\" column for Arizona 8 shows the year 1984.\n\n4. **Analyze \"Results\":**\n   - The results for Arizona 8 indicate that the incumbent retired and there was a Democratic gain, meaning the seat did not remain with the incumbent or any subsequent election in which they participated.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the incumbent of Arizona 8 was first elected in 1994 and then re-elected.\n   - According to the table:\n     - First elected year is 1984, not 1994.\n     - There's no mention of a re-election for the incumbent as they retired.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim does not align with the data provided in the table because both the \"first elected\" year and the result (\"re-elected\") are incorrect based on the information given.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row for Arizona 8 shows that the incumbent was first elected in 1984, not 1994. Additionally, there is no record of re-election since the incumbent retired and the seat experienced a Democratic gain. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
