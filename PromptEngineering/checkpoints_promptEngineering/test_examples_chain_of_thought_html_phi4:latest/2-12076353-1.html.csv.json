    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data for \"Ottawa Hockey Club\":**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the \"ottawa hockey club.\"\n   - From this row, find the number of goals against: 26.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data for \"Montreal Shamrocks\":**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the \"montreal shamrocks.\"\n   - From this row, find the number of goals against: 56.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Goals Against:**\n   - Subtract the number of goals against by Ottawa from the number of goals against by Montreal Shamrocks:\n     \\[\n     56 - 26 = 30\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Difference:**\n   - The claim states that \"montreal shamrock have 20 more goal[s] against than ottawa hockey club.\"\n   - We calculated a difference of 30 goals, not 20.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim is false because the actual difference in goals against between Montreal Shamrocks and Ottawa Hockey Club is 30, not 20.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n- \"ottawa hockey club\" row: `goals against` (26)\n- \"montreal shamrocks\" row: `goals against` (56)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the goals against for both Ottawa Hockey Club and Montreal Shamrocks.
