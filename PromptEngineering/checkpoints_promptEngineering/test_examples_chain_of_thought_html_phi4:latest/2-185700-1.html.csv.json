    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtained higher points than croire,\" we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Song Entries:**\n   - Locate the row containing the song \"vivo (ti scrivo)\".\n   - Locate the row containing the song \"croire\".\n\n2. **Extract Points for Each Song:**\n   - Extract the number of points awarded to \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" from its respective row.\n   - Extract the number of points awarded to \"croire\" from its respective row.\n\n3. **Compare the Points:**\n   - Compare the extracted points for both songs to determine if \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" received more points than \"croire\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Song Entries in Table:**\n\n   - For \"vivo (ti scrivo)\":\n     - Found in row 18.\n     - Points are listed under the \"points\" column.\n\n   - For \"croire\":\n     - Found in row 17.\n     - Points are also listed under the \"points\" column.\n\n2. **Extract Points:**\n\n   - **vivo (ti scrivo)**\n     - Row Index: 18\n     - Column Name: points\n     - Points: 52\n\n   - **croire**\n     - Row Index: 17\n     - Column Name: points\n     - Points: 90\n\n3. **Compare the Points:**\n\n   - \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has 52 points.\n   - \"croire\" has 90 points.\n\nSince 52 is less than 90, \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" did not obtain higher points than \"croire\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtained higher point than croire\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the rows for 'vivo (ti scrivo)' and 'croire' in the table. Extracted their respective points: 52 for 'vivo (ti scrivo)' and 90 for 'croire'. Compared the points, finding that 52 is less than 90. Thus, 'vivo (ti scrivo)' did not obtain higher points than 'croire'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
