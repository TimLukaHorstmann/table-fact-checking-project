The competition was a \"friendly\".\n     2. The venue was \"lugo, emilia-romagna\".\n\n4. **Cross-reference with Table Data**:\n   - From the table data for 26 May 1999:\n     - The \"venue\" is listed as \"lugo, emilia-romagna\".\n     - The \"competition\" is listed as \"friendly\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both components of the claim are supported by the information in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, both aspects of the claim match the data provided in the table for 26 May 1999.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the data from the table based on the given statement: \n\n1. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The statement mentions a specific date: \"26 May 1999\".\n   - It specifies the competition as \"friendly\".\n   - It gives a venue: \"Lugo, Emilia-Romagna\".\n   - It describes the result of the match as \"2 - 4\".\n\n2. **Table Examination**:\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the date \"26 May 1999\" in the table.\n   - Check if the competition for this entry is labeled as \"friendly\".\n   - Verify that the venue is listed as \"Lugo, Emilia-Romagna\".\n   - Confirm the result of the match is \"2 - 4\".\n\n3. **Relevant Row Identification**:\n   - The row with the date \"26 May 1999\" corresponds to the 11th entry in the table.\n   - In this row, the competition is indeed marked as \"friendly\", matching the claim.\n   - The venue listed is \"Lugo, Emilia-Romagna\", which aligns with the statement.\n   - However, the result recorded is \"1 - 4\", not \"2 - 4\" as claimed.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While most parts of the claim (date, competition type, and venue) match the table data, the stated result does not.
