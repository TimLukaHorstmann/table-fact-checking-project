    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only Canada won more than 1 medal in football in the 2012 Summer Olympics\" is true or false, we need to carefully analyze the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - The table lists nations with their respective ranks and counts of gold, silver, bronze medals, and total medals won.\n   - There are entries for Mexico, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, South Korea, and a summary row labeled \"total.\"\n\n2. **Identify Total Medals per Nation:**\n   - For each nation (except the summary row), check the value in the \"total\" column to see how many medals were won.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Mexico: 1 total medal\n     - United States: 1 total medal\n     - Brazil: 1 total medal\n     - Japan: 1 total medal\n     - Canada: 1 total medal\n     - South Korea: 1 total medal\n\n3. **Assessing the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"only Canada won more than 1 medal.\"\n   - From our analysis, we see that all nations listed (Mexico, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, South Korea) have exactly 1 medal each.\n   - Therefore, no nation, including Canada, has won more than 1 medal.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because Canada did not win more than 1 medal; it won exactly 1 medal like all other listed nations.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells are those in the \"total\" column for each nation to verify their total medal count.\n- These cells are:\n  - Mexico: row index 0, \"total\"\n  - United States: row index 1, \"total\"\n  - Brazil: row index 2, \"total\"\n  - Japan: row index 3, \"total\"\n  - Canada: row index 4, \"total\"\n  - South Korea: row index 5, \"total\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows the medal counts for different nations. Each nation listed has exactly 1 total medal won. The claim that 'only Canada won more than 1 medal' is false because no nation in the list won more than 1 medal.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
