    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"out of the 10 players tied for third, 3 players are from Australia\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data in the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Tied Players:**\n   - The table indicates that multiple players have a rank of \"t3,\" meaning they are tied for third place.\n   - Specifically, there are 11 players listed with this designation (from Fred Couples to Scott Verplank).\n\n2. **Extract Country Information:**\n   - For each player tied at third place, we need to check their country.\n\n3. **Count Players from Australia:**\n   - We will specifically look for entries where the \"country\" column lists \"australia.\"\n\n4. **Relevant Data Extraction:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Mark Hensby (Row 2) is from Australia with a score of 67 and to par of 5.\n     - Peter Lonard (Row 8) is also listed as being from Australia with a score of 68 and to par of 4.\n\n5. **Count Verification:**\n   - The claim states that there are 3 players from Australia tied for third place, but based on the data:\n     - Only 2 players are identified as being from Australia among those tied for third place.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the table analysis, only 2 players out of the 11 tied for third place are from Australia.
