We need to locate the row in the table where this value appears under the column \"average % of vote per candidate\".\n\n- Checking each row:\n  - **1974 - 02**: 1.67\n  - **1974 - 10**: 0.91\n  - **1979**: 1.46\n  - **1983**: 1.04\n  - **1987**: 1.35\n  - **1992**: 1.27\n  - **1997**: 1.34\n  - **2001**: 2.75\n  - **2005**: 3.29\n\nThe value \"3.29\" appears in the row for the year 2005.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Number of Votes per Candidate\n\nThe claim states that for each candidate with a 3.29% average, the number of votes per candidate is \"1416.0\". We need to check the column \"average votes per candidate\" for the same row (year 2005).\n\n- In the year 2005:\n  - The value under \"average votes per candidate\" is 1416.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe claim specifies that if a candidate has an average of 3.29% of the vote, then the number of votes per candidate should be 1416.0. From our analysis, for the year 2005, where the \"average % of vote per candidate\" is indeed 3.29, the corresponding \"average votes per candidate\" is exactly 1416.\n\nThus, the claim is true based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row index: 8 (corresponding to the year 2005)\n- Column name: \"average % of vote per candidate\", value: 3.29\n- Column name: \"average votes per candidate\", value: 1416\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that for candidates with an average of 3.29% of the vote, the number of votes per candidate should be 1416.0.
