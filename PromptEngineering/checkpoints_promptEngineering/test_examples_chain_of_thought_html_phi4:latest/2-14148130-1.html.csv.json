On four occasions, there be a draw with never more than one game drawn.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n#### Step 1: Verify the total number of games\n- We need to check if each row represents a scenario where exactly 7 games have been played.\n- According to the table, every row has \"games\" = 7. This confirms that in all scenarios described by the table, there are indeed 7 games.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify rows with draws and their counts\n- A draw is indicated when the value in the \"drawn\" column is greater than 0.\n- We need to count how many such instances (rows) exist where there is at least one drawn game.\n  \nLet's analyze each row:\n1. **Row 1**: games = 7, drawn = 0, lost = 0\n   - No draw here.\n\n2. **Row 2**: games = 7, drawn = 0, lost = 2\n   - No draw here.\n\n3. **Row 3**: games = 7, drawn = 1, lost = 2\n   - This row has a draw (drawn = 1).\n\n4. **Row 4**: games = 7, drawn = 1, lost = 2\n   - This row also has a draw (drawn = 1).\n\n5. **Row 5**: games = 7, drawn = 1, lost = 3\n   - Another instance of a draw (drawn = 1).\n\n6. **Row 6**: games = 7, drawn = 0, lost = 5\n   - No draw here.\n\n7. **Row 7**: games = 7, drawn = 1, lost = 5\n   - This row has a draw (drawn = 1).\n\n8. **Row 8**: games = 7, drawn = 0, lost = 7\n   - No draw here.\n\n- From this analysis, we find that there are four rows where \"drawn\" > 0:\n  - Row 3: drawn = 1\n  - Row 4: drawn = 1\n  - Row 5: drawn = 1\n  - Row 7: drawn = 1\n\n- All these instances have exactly one game drawn, confirming the claim's condition of \"never more than one game drawn.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n1. Each scenario has exactly 7 games.\n2. There are four occasions with a draw, and each time there is only one game drawn.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Each row in the table represents scenarios where the total number of games played is 7.\",\n    \"We identified rows where there was at least one draw (drawn > 0).\",\n    \"Rows with draws: Row 3, Row 4, Row 5, and Row 7.\",\n    \"In each of these cases, only one game was drawn, satisfying the condition of 'never more than one game drawn.'\",\n    \"The claim is true as both conditions are met.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
