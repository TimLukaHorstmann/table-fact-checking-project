    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the game against Iowa took place at Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant row from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to locate the row where the opponent is \"iowa\". \n\n2. **Locate the Opponent in the Table:**\n   - The table lists several opponents and their corresponding details. By scanning through the \"opponent\" column, we find that one of the rows has \"iowa\" as the opponent.\n\n3. **Check the Details for the Game against Iowa:**\n   - Once we identify the row with \"iowa\", we need to check the \"site\" column to confirm where the game took place.\n   - The relevant row is:\n     - Date: 10/24/1931\n     - Opponent: iowa\n     - Site: memorial stadium minneapolis, mn\n     - Result: w34 - 0\n     - Attendance: 25000\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that the game against Iowa took place at Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN.\n   - According to the table, the site for this game is indeed \"memorial stadium minneapolis, mn\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the data confirms that the game against Iowa was held at Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains a row where the opponent is 'iowa'. In this row, the site listed for the game is 'memorial stadium minneapolis, mn', which matches the location mentioned in the claim.
