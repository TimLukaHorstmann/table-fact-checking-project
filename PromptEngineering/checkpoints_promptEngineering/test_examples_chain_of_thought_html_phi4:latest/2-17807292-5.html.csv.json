Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden.\n\n2. **Locate Their Scores and Places:**\n   - From the table:\n     - J.B. Holmes is listed with a score of `71 + 68 + 70 = 209` and is placed at `t2`.\n     - Henrik Stenson is also listed with a score of `71 + 70 + 68 = 209` and shares the same place `t2`.\n\n3. **Check Their 'To Par' Scores:**\n   - J.B. Holmes has `-1 to par`.\n   - Henrik Stenson also has `-1 to par`.\n\n4. **Determine Their Actual Place in the Ranking:**\n   - Both players are tied for 2nd place (`t2`) as indicated by their ranking.\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Place and To Par:**\n   - The claim states they tie for third place with `+1 to par`.\n   - However, according to the table:\n     - They are actually tied for 2nd place.\n     - Their 'to par' score is `-1`, not `+1`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that J.B.
