    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Muhsin Corbbrey have never lose a fight in Maryland\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the provided table for any fights that resulted in a loss (i.e., \"loss\") held in Maryland. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We are interested in rows where:\n   - The `result` column indicates a \"loss\".\n   - The `location` column includes \"Maryland\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Look for any row that meets both criteria above.\n\n3. **Analyze the Table**:\n   - **Row 1**: Result is \"win\", not relevant.\n   - **Row 2**: Result is \"win\", not relevant.\n   - **Row 3**: Result is \"loss\". Check the location: \"glen burnie, maryland, usa\" \u2014 this matches Maryland.\n   - **Row 4**: Result is \"win\", not relevant.\n   - **Row 5**: Result is \"win\", not relevant.\n   - **Row 6**: Result is \"win\", not relevant.\n   - **Row 7**: Result is \"win\", not relevant.\n   - **Row 8**: Result is \"loss\". Check the location: \"miami, florida, usa\" \u2014 this does not match Maryland.\n   - **Row 9**: Result is \"draw\", not relevant.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Row 3 shows a loss in Maryland (\"glen burnie, maryland, usa\"). Therefore, the claim that Muhsin Corbbrey has never lost a fight in Maryland is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for this determination is found in row index 2 (0-based indexing) under the `result` and `location` columns.\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if Muhsin Corbbrey has never lost a fight in Maryland, we checked each row for a 'loss' result where the location included 'Maryland'.

This is before 2006, so it does not concern us for this claim.\n\n4. **Analyze Tim Coleman's Match Outcome:**\n   - For the match involving Tim Coleman on `2006-06-15`, check the \"result\" column.\n   - The result is listed as \"loss,\" indicating that Tim Coleman lost this fight.\n\n5. **Determine if There was a Fight Between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006:**\n   - Since there are no entries showing both Tim Coleman and Ben Lock fighting each other in 2006, the claim about them not losing against each other in 2006 is vacuously true because they never fought.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim \"Tim Coleman have not lose a fight against Ben Lock in 2006\" is technically true because there was no fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in that year. Therefore, Tim Coleman did not lose to Ben Lock in 2006 simply because such a match did not occur.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
