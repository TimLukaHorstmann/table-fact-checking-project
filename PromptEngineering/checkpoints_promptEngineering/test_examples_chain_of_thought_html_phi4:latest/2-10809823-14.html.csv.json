Then, we will check if both Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away games were among these venues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - We need to find the crowd sizes for all games first.\n   - Specifically, locate the row where \"Melbourne\" is the away team and another row where \"North Melbourne\" is the away team.\n\n2. **Extract crowd data from each game:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Geelong vs North Melbourne at Kardinia Park with a crowd of 21,555.\n     - Footscray vs Melbourne at Western Oval with a crowd of 11,785.\n     - Hawthorn vs Fitzroy at Princes Park with a crowd of 8,209.\n     - Richmond vs Collingwood at MCG with a crowd of 64,054.\n     - South Melbourne vs Carlton at Lake Oval with a crowd of 12,362.\n     - St Kilda vs Essendon at VFL Park with a crowd of 20,485.\n\n3. **List the crowd sizes:**\n   - Geelong vs North Melbourne: 21,555\n   - Footscray vs Melbourne: 11,785\n   - Hawthorn vs Fitzroy: 8,209\n   - Richmond vs Collingwood: 64,054\n   - South Melbourne vs Carlton: 12,362\n   - St Kilda vs Essendon: 20,485\n\n4. **Determine the top 4 largest crowds:**\n   - Sort the crowd sizes in descending order:\n     - 64,054 (Richmond vs Collingwood)\n     - 21,555 (Geelong vs North Melbourne)\n     - 20,485 (St Kilda vs Essendon)\n     - 12,362 (South Melbourne vs Carlton)\n\n5. **Check if Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away venues are among the top 4:**\n   - Melbourne's away game was at Western Oval with a crowd of 11,785.\n   - North Melbourne's away game was at Kardinia Park with a crowd of 21,555.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - North Melbourne's venue (Kardinia Park) is among the top 4 largest crowds.\n   - Melbourne's venue (Western Oval) is not among the top 4 largest crowds.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away game venues be both among the top 4 crowd venue\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

From the HTML, it's clear that this is the \"crowd\" column.\n   \n2. **List Crowd Numbers for Each Match:**\n   - Extract the crowd numbers from each row:\n     - Row 1 (VFL Park): 21,555\n     - Row 2 (Western Oval): 11,785\n     - Row 3 (Princes Park): 8,209\n     - Row 4 (MCG): 64,054\n     - Row 5 (Lake Oval): 12,362\n     - Row 6 (VFL Park again): 20,485\n\n3. **Rank the Venues by Crowd Size:**\n   - Rank these numbers in descending order to determine which venues had the top crowds:\n     1.

Princes Park: 8,209\n\n4. **Determine Top 3 Venues by Crowd Size:**\n   - The venues with the top three crowd sizes are:\n     1. MCG\n     2. Kardinia Park (VFL Park first instance)\n     3. VFL Park (second instance)\n\n5. **Check if Both VFL Park and Lake Oval Are in Top 3:**\n   - VFL Park is indeed among the top three venues by crowd size.\n   - However, Lake Oval is not in the top three; it ranks fourth.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that both VFL Park and Lake Oval should be among the top 3, but only VFL Park qualifies.
