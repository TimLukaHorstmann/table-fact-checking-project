    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that 5 out of 7 players from the 2003 PGA Championship had a \"to par\" score of \"+11\".\n\n2. **Analyze the Table**:\n   - Look at the \"year won\" column to check if any player won in 2003.\n   - Check each row to determine the \"to par\" value for those who potentially could have won in 2003.\n\n3. **Check Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: Paul Azinger, Year Won = 1993, To Par = \"+9\"\n   - Row 2: Davis Love III, Year Won = 1997, To Par = \"+9\"\n   - Row 3: Mark Brooks, Year Won = 1996, To Par = \"+11\"\n   - Row 4: John Daly, Year Won = 1991, To Par = \"+11\"\n   - Row 5: Bob Tway, Year Won = 1986, To Par = \"+11\"\n   - Row 6: Jeff Sluman, Year Won = 1988, To Par = \"+14\"\n   - Row 7: Rich Beem, Year Won = 2002, To Par = \"+17\"\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - None of the players listed won in 2003.\n   - Therefore, it's impossible for any player from this table to be associated with the 2003 PGA Championship.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Since no players from the table won in 2003, the claim that \"5 of the 7 2003 PGA Championship players have a to par of +11\" cannot be true based on the given data.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because there are no entries for 2003 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 5 out of 7 players from the 2003 PGA Championship had a 'to par' score of '+11'.
