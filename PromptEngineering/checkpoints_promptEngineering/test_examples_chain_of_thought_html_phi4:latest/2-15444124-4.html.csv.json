    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, let's break down the statement and analyze it step-by-step using the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements of the Claim:**\n   - The claim involves two main parts:\n     1. In 2003, \"the gp / g\" is mentioned.\n     2. It states that whenever the number of total points is marked as \"did not play,\" there is always one goal.\n\n2. **Analyze the Year 2003:**\n   - According to the table, for the year 2003:\n     - `gp / gs` = \"did not play\"\n     - `goals` = \"did not play\"\n     - `assists` = \"did not play\"\n     - `total points` = \"did not play\"\n\n3. **Check Consistency with Total Points:**\n   - The claim states that when `total points` is \"did not play,\" there should always be exactly one goal.\n   - We need to verify this condition for every year where `total points` is marked as \"did not play.\"\n\n4. **Examine All Years Where Total Points = \"Did Not Play\":**\n   - **Year 2000:**\n     - `total points` = \"did not play\"\n     - `goals` = \"did not play\"\n   - **Year 2001:**\n     - `total points` = \"did not play\"\n     - `goals` = \"did not play\"\n   - **Year 2003:**\n     - `total points` = \"did not play\"\n     - `goals` = \"did not play\"\n   - **Year 2004:**\n     - `total points` = \"did not play\"\n     - `goals` = \"did not play\"\n\n5. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - In each year where `total points` is marked as \"did not play,\" the `goals` column also shows \"did not play.\"\n   - This means that there are no goals recorded (not even one) in these years.\n\n6. **Final Evaluation of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that whenever total points are \"did not play,\" there should always be exactly one goal.\n   - Our analysis shows that in every such instance, there are zero goals (\"did not play\"), contradicting the claim.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that whenever 'total points' is marked as 'did not play,' there should always be exactly one goal. By examining each year where 'total points' equals 'did not play' (2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004), we find that in all these cases, the 'goals' column also indicates 'did not play,' meaning zero goals were recorded. This contradicts the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
