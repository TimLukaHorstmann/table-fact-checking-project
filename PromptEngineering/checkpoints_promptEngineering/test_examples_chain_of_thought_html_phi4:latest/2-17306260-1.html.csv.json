This can be interpreted as claiming that Triumph defeated Telindus Oostende with a score involving a sequence where one team scored 68 and the other scored 71.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Row**: From the table, we need to find the row corresponding to \"triumph\" vs. \"telindus oostende\". This is found in the sixth row:\n   - `team 1`: triumph\n   - `team 2`: telindus oostende\n\n3. **Check Aggregate Score**: The aggregate score for this match is given as \"146 - 159\", indicating that Telindus Oostende won overall.\n\n4. **Examine Individual Leg Scores**:\n   - `1st leg` score: \"78 - 78\"\n   - `2nd leg` score: \"68 - 81\"\n\n5. **Analyze the Claimed Score**: The claim suggests a game where one team scored 68 and the other scored 71. We need to check if any of the legs match this pattern:\n   - In the first leg, both teams scored 78.\n   - In the second leg, Triumph scored 68, and Telindus Oostende scored 81.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim mentions a score involving \"68 71\", but neither leg matches this exact sequence.
