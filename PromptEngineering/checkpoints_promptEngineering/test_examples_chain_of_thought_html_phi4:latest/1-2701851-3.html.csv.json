    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the production code, series, season, title, and director is correct, we need to verify each component against the provided table data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Production Code:**\n   - The claim states \"201a\" as the production code.\n   - Check the \"Production Code\" column for a match: \n     - We find that there is indeed an entry with \"201a\".\n\n2. **Verify Series and Season:**\n   - The claim mentions \"14a series and 1a season\".\n   - Check the \"Series\" and \"Season\" columns:\n     - There is an entry with \"14a\" in the \"Series\" column.\n     - However, there is no corresponding entry for \"1a\" in the \"Season\" column. The row with production code \"201a\" has \"1b\" as its season.\n\n3. **Check Title:**\n   - The claim states the title as \"spontaneously combustible\".\n   - Verify against the \"Title\" column:\n     - The entry for production code \"201a\" is indeed titled \"spontaneously combustible\".\n\n4. **Verify Director:**\n   - The claim specifies \"igor kovalyov\" as the director.\n   - Check the \"Director\" column:\n     - The director listed for the row with production code \"201a\" is \"igor kovalyov\", matching the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The production code, title, and director are all correct according to the table data.\n- However, there is a discrepancy in the season: the claim mentions \"1a\" while the table lists \"1b\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe statement is partially true but contains an error regarding the season. Therefore, overall, it cannot be considered completely true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each part of the claim against the table data: production code '201a' matched; series '14a' matched; title 'spontaneously combustible' matched; director 'igor kovalyov' matched.
