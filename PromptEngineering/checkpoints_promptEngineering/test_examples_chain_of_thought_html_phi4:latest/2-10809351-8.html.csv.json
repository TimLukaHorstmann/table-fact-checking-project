    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the crowd numbers for the specified venues from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - We need to find the row where \"kardinia park\" appears in the \"venue\" column.\n   - Similarly, locate the row with \"lake oval\" in the \"venue\" column.\n\n2. **Extract crowd numbers for both venues:**\n   - For \"kardinia park,\" find the value in the \"crowd\" column.\n   - For \"lake oval,\" do the same to find its corresponding crowd number.\n\n3. **Compare the crowd numbers:**\n   - Subtract the crowd number of \"lake oval\" from that of \"kardinia park.\"\n   - Check if this difference equals 10,000 as claimed.\n\n4. **Verify the claim:**\n   - The claim is true if the difference in crowd numbers is exactly 10,000; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n- **Row for Kardinia Park (First Row):**\n  - Venue: \"kardinia park\"\n  - Crowd: 22,500\n\n- **Row for Lake Oval (Fifth Row):**\n  - Venue: \"lake oval\"\n  - Crowd: 12,500\n\n- **Calculate the difference:**\n  - Difference = 22,500 (Kardinia Park) - 12,500 (Lake Oval)\n  - Difference = 10,000\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated difference is exactly 10,000.
