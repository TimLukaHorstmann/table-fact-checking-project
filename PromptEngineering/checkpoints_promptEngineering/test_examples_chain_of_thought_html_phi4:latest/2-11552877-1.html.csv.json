Check if these drivers retired due to transmission or clutch issues.\n\nLet's go through the relevant parts of the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Drivers with Less Than 50 Laps\n\nWe will look at the \"laps\" column and identify any entries where the number of laps is less than 50.\n\n- **Jean-Pierre Jarier**: Completed 33 laps.\n- **Emerson Fittipaldi**: Completed 6 laps.\n- **Tony Trimmer**: Completed 54 laps (not less than 50, so we exclude this).\n- **Rolf Stommelen**: Completed 58 laps (not less than 50, so we exclude this).\n- **Vittorio Brambilla**: Completed 58 laps (not less than 50, so we exclude this).\n- **Jo Vonlanthen**: Completed 51 laps (not less than 50, so we exclude this).\n\nFrom this analysis, the drivers who completed fewer than 50 laps are Jean-Pierre Jarier and Emerson Fittipaldi.\n\n### Step 2: Check Reason for Retirement\n\nNext, we need to verify if these drivers retired due to transmission or clutch issues by examining the \"time / retired\" column.\n\n- **Jean-Pierre Jarier**: Retired due to \"transmission.\"\n- **Emerson Fittipaldi**: Retired due to \"clutch.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n1. Only two drivers completed fewer than 50 laps: Jean-Pierre Jarier and Emerson Fittipaldi.\n2. Both retired due to transmission (Jarier) and clutch (Fittipaldi).\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified drivers with less than 50 laps: Jean-Pierre Jarier and Emerson Fittipaldi.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. Every driver except Jacques Laffite used a Ford vehicle.\n2. Jacques Laffite drove a Ferrari.\n\nLet's examine these points step-by-step using the table provided.\n\n### Step 1: Check each driver for the constructor type\n\n- **Clay Regazzoni**: `Constructor` is \"ferrari\"\n- **Patrick Depailler**: `Constructor` is \"tyrrell - ford\"\n- **Jochen Mass**: `Constructor` is \"mclaren - ford\"\n- **Ronnie Peterson**: `Constructor` is \"lotus - ford\"\n- **John Watson**: `Constructor` is \"surtees - ford\"\n- **Carlos Pace**: `Constructor` is \"brabham - ford\"\n- **Tom Pryce**: `Constructor` is \"shadow - ford\"\n- **James Hunt**: `Constructor` is \"hesketh - ford\"\n- **Chris Amon**: `Constructor` is \"ensign - ford\"\n- **Jacques Laffite**: `Constructor` is \"williams - ford\"\n- **Vittorio Brambilla**: `Constructor` is \"march - ford\"\n- **Rolf Stommelen**: `Constructor` is \"hill - ford\"\n- **Tony Trimmer**: `Constructor` is \"maki - ford\"\n- **Jo Vonlanthen**: `Constructor` is \"williams - ford\"\n- **Jean-Pierre Jarier**: `Constructor` is \"shadow - ford\"\n- **Emerson Fittipaldi**: `Constructor` is \"mclaren - ford\"\n\n### Step 2: Verify the claim's statement\n\n1. **Every driver except Jacques Laffite used a Ford vehicle**:\n   - All drivers listed, except Clay Regazzoni who drove a Ferrari, are associated with constructors using \"ford\". Jacques Laffite is indeed driving a Williams-Ford.\n\n2. **Jacques Laffite drove a Ferrari**:\n   - Jacques Laffite's constructor is listed as \"williams - ford\", not Ferrari. This contradicts the claim that he drove a Ferrari.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement claims Jacques Laffite drove a Ferrari, which is false based on the table data. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Jacques Laffite's constructor: `Row 10`, `Column: Constructor`\n- Clay Regazzoni's constructor (since he is the only one driving non-Ford): `Row 1`, `Column: Constructor`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each driver's constructor.

Jean-Pierre Jarier retired after 33 laps and Emerson Fittipaldi after 6 laps.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Grid Positions of Top 2 Drivers\n- **Clay Regazzoni**: Completed 60 laps with a finishing time of \"1:01:25.34\" and started from grid position 3.\n- **Patrick Depailler**: Also completed 60 laps, his finish was \"+0:08.35\", starting from grid position 5.\n  \n#### Step 3: Verify the Claimed Drivers and Grid Positions\n- The claim mentions that the top two drivers have grid positions of 1 and 5:\n  - Clay Regazzoni has a grid position of 3, not 1.\n  - Tom Pryce completed only 59 laps (one lap down), indicating he did not finish in the top 2.\n\n#### Step 4: Check Actual Grid Positions for Top 2 Finishers\n- The actual grid positions for the top two drivers (Clay Regazzoni and Patrick Depailler) are:\n  - Clay Regazzoni: Grid position 3\n  - Patrick Depailler: Grid position 5\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false.
