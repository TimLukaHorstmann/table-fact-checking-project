    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tim Euhus be the last pick\" is true or false, we need to examine each row in the table to identify which player was selected with what pick number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table has columns: `round`, `pick`, `player`, `position`, and `college`.\n   - Each row represents a draft selection, showing the round, pick number, player name, position, and college.\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Pick Number**:\n   - We need to find the player with the highest pick number since that would indicate the last (or final) pick in this context.\n   \n3. **Examine Each Row for the Pick Number**:\n   - **Row 1**: Pick is `13` for Lee Evans.\n   - **Row 2**: Pick is `22` for JP Losman.\n   - **Row 3**: Pick is `74` for Tim Anderson.\n   - **Row 4**: Pick is `109` for Tim Euhus.\n   - **Row 5**: Pick is `207` for Dylan McFarland.\n   - **Row 6**: Pick is `214` for Jonathan Smith.\n\n4. **Compare Pick Numbers**:\n   - The pick numbers are: `13`, `22`, `74`, `109`, `207`, and `214`.\n   - Among these, the highest number is `214`.\n\n5. **Identify the Player with the Highest Pick Number**:\n   - Jonathan Smith has the highest pick number (`214`), not Tim Euhus.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim \"Tim Euhus be the last pick\" is false because the last (or final) pick was Jonathan Smith, not Tim Euhus.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if 'Tim Euhus be the last pick' is true or false, we examine each row for the pick number. The highest pick number in the table is 214, which corresponds to Jonathan Smith, not Tim Euhus (who has pick number 109).
