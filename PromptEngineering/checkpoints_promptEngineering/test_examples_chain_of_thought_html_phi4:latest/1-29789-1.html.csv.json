    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Russia receiving 25.7 million international tourist visits in 2012 is true, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"Russia\" and the year \"2012\". We need to locate the row that corresponds to Russia in the table.\n   - From the HTML table, we find a row with \"russia\" under the \"country\" column.\n\n2. **Check the Year 2012 Data:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row for Russia, we look at the column labeled \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\" to find the number of tourists in that year.\n   - The table shows that Russia has \"25.7 million\" under this column.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states \"25.7 million international tourist visits russia in 2012.\"\n   - This matches exactly with the data from the table for Russia's international tourist arrivals in 2012.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim is accurate based on the data provided in the table.\n- Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- We identified the relevant row and column for verification:\n  - Row index: 9 (since it corresponds to Russia)\n  - Column name: \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
