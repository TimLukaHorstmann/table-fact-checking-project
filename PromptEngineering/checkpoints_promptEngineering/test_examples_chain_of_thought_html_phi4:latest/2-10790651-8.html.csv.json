We will look through the table rows to find where \"collingwood\" is listed as the home team.\n   \n2. **Locate Collingwood**:\n   - In the fourth row, we see that \"collingwood\" is listed under the \"home team\" column.\n\n3. **Check the venue**:\n   - For this match (row four), the \"venue\" is listed as \"victoria park\". This matches the claim's mention of Victoria Park.\n\n4. **Identify the away team**:\n   - In the same row (fourth), under the \"away team\" column, we find \"north melbourne\".\n\n5. **Verify the claim details**:\n   - The claim states: \"North Melbourne be the away team against Collingwood at Victoria Park.\"\n   - From our findings in step 3 and step 4, North Melbourne is indeed listed as the away team when Collingwood played at Victoria Park.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim accurately describes the match details found in row four of the table.
