This matches our analysis:\n- Highest issue price found in the table is indeed $24.95.\n- Lowest issue price found in the table is indeed $15.95.\n\n### Step 5: List relevant cells\nRelevant cells are those that contain the highest and lowest values of the \"issue price\" column. We identify them by their row indices and column name:\n1. Row index 0, Column \"issue price\": $15.95 (one instance among several)\n2. Row index 1, Column \"issue price\": $24.95\n3. Row index 8, Column \"issue price\": $15.95 (another instance)\n\nThese cells are sufficient to demonstrate the range of issue prices.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is true based on our analysis of the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified 'issue price' column and extracted all values, found unique values as $15.95 and $24.95, verified highest and lowest match the claim, listed relevant cells containing these prices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
