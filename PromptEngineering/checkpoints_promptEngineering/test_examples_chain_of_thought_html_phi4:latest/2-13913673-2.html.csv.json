    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about postponements in the table is accurate, let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section**: We need to focus on the rows of the table where there might be a mention of postponed games.\n\n2. **Locate all instances of \"postponed\"**: We will scan through each row and look for any text mentioning a postponement.\n\n3. **Analyze each instance**:\n   - In April 23, under columns \"game\", \"pitcher\", and \"attendance\", there is an entry: \"postponed (rain) rescheduled for april 24\". This indicates that the game on April 23 was postponed.\n   - On April 24, two games are listed against the Royals. The first row shows a score of \"9 - 6\" with Tomko as the pitcher, and the second row shows a score of \"2 - 0\" with Bannister as the pitcher. This suggests that both games (the postponed game from April 23 and an additional scheduled game) took place on April 24.\n\n4. **Confirm the number of postponements**: The table only records one instance where a game was postponed, which is for the match on April 23 against the Royals.\n\n5. **Evaluate the claim**: The claim states that \"out of the whole season just 1 game be postpone , which be the april 23 match against the royal.\" Based on our analysis:\n   - There is indeed only one postponement mentioned in the table.\n   - This postponed game was rescheduled for April 24.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim accurately reflects the information provided in the table regarding postponed games.\n\nHere's the structured reasoning and conclusion in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows with 'postponed' to find any postponed games.\",\n    \"Locate the entry for April 23: it shows a postponement due to rain, rescheduled for April 24.\",\n    \"Check if there are other instances of postponements in the table. No other 'postponed' entries exist.\",\n    \"Confirm that only one game was postponed throughout the season, which aligns with the claim.\",\n    \"Conclude that the statement about the April 23 match against the Royals being the sole postponed game is correct.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
