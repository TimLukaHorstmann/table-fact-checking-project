Year: 1982, Entrant: Arrows Racing Team, Chassis: Arrows A4, Engine: Cosworth V8, Points: 2\n     2. Year: 1982, Entrant: Arrows Racing Team, Chassis: Arrows A5, Engine: Cosworth V8, Points: 2\n\n4. **Assess the Points for These Entries**:\n   - For both entries with a Cosworth V8 engine, points scored are listed as 2.\n\n5. **Check for Mauro Baldi's Association**:\n   - The table does not provide explicit information about drivers. It only lists the entrant and other technical details.\n   - To validate the claim, we need to verify whether Mauro Baldi was indeed driving in these entries (specifically for Arrows Racing Team during 1982).\n\n6. **External Verification**:\n   - Historical data indicates that Mauro Baldi did drive for the Arrows Racing Team in 1982 using cars with a Cosworth V8 engine.\n\n7. **Conclusion Based on Data and External Knowledge**:\n   - Given that both entries where a Cosworth V8 was used by Arrows Racing Team scored points (2 points each), and Mauro Baldi did drive for Arrows in those instances, the claim is false.\n   - The statement \"he didn't score any point\" is incorrect as he did score points.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that whenever Mauro Baldi drove with a Cosworth V8 engine, he scored no points.\",\n    \"Identify all table entries using a 'cosworth v8' engine: two entries in 1982 for Arrows Racing Team each scoring 2 points.\",\n    \"Verify if Mauro Baldi was associated with these entries; historical data confirms he drove for Arrows Racing Team in 1982.\",\n    \"Since the identified entries scored points and involved Baldi, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, based solely on this table, we cannot determine whether Mauro Baldi scored zero points or not.\n\n4. **Final Assessment of the Claim**: Since there is no mention of Mauro Baldi in the table, we do not have enough information to confirm or deny that he never scored 0 point. However, since none of the entries explicitly shows him scoring 0 points, based on this data alone, the claim cannot be disproven.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not mention Mauro Baldi by name; it only lists teams and their points.
