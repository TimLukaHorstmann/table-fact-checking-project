    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 1 submission of the night when Matt Wiman be the fighter\" is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table data for Matt Wiman.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matt Wiman's Row:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Matt Wiman in the table. The relevant cells are:\n     - `fighter`: \"Matt Wiman\"\n     - `wins_by KO/TKO`: 4\n     - `wins_by Submission`: 0\n     - `wins_by Decision`: 0\n     - `losses_by KO/TKO`: 1\n     - `losses_by Submission`: 1\n     - `losses_by Decision`: 0\n     - `draws`: 0\n     - `total fights`: 5\n     - `wins`: 4\n     - `losses`: 2\n     - `submission of the night bonuses`: 1\n     - `status`: \"active\"\n\n2. **Examine Submission Bonuses:**\n   - The cell for \"submissions of the night bonuses\" indicates that Matt Wiman has earned this bonus once.\n\n3. **Determine if the Bonus is from a Submission Win:**\n   - Since \"wins_by Submission\" is 0, Matt Wiman did not win any fights by submission.\n   - However, \"losses_by Submission\" is 1, indicating he lost one fight via submission.\n   - The \"submission of the night bonuses\" could be awarded in either a win or a loss scenario. Since there are no wins by submission and only one loss by submission, it's plausible that this bonus came from the fight where he was submitted (i.e., his loss).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that Matt Wiman has 1 \"submission of the night bonuses\" and considering the context of his records, it is reasonable to conclude that this bonus occurred during a fight where he was on the losing end via submission.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Matt Wiman's row shows 'submissions of the night bonuses': 1. He has no wins by submission but one loss by submission.
