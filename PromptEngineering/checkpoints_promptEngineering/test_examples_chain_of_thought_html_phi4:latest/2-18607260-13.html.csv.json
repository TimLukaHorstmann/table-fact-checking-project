Here\u2019s how I will approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Rows of Interest:**\n   - We are looking for rows with dates \"1998-06-18\" and \"1998-06-28\".\n\n2. **Check the Date Column for These Entries:**\n   - The table has a 'date' column, which we will examine.\n\n3. **Verify Presence or Absence of June 18th Entry:**\n   - Scan through each row to see if any entry matches \"1998-06-18\".\n   - If found, check the 'score' for that date.\n   - If not found, note its absence.\n\n4. **Check the Date Column for June 28th Entry:**\n   - Similarly, examine the table for an entry with \"1998-06-28\".\n   - Check the 'score' column if this row exists.\n\n5. **Examine Scores for Both Dates:**\n   - For any existing entries on these dates, check their 'score'.\n   - Compare these scores to \"2 - 0\" as claimed.\n\n6. **Draw a Conclusion:**\n   - If both (or either) of the specified scores are \"2 - 0\", the claim is true.\n   - If not, or if one date does not exist in the table at all, the claim is false.\n\n**Detailed Examination:**\n\n- **Row for June 18th:** \n  - Scan through each row in the table. We find no entry with a date of \"1998-06-18\". This indicates that there was no game on this date according to the table.\n  \n- **Row for June 28th:**\n  - Find the row where the 'date' column has \"1998-06-28\".\n  - Check the 'score' column for this entry. The score is \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Since there is no game recorded on June 18th, it's impossible for both games to have had scores of \"2 - 0\".\n- On June 28th, the score was not \"2 - 0\" but rather \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\".\n\nThus, the claim is false based on the information available in the table.
