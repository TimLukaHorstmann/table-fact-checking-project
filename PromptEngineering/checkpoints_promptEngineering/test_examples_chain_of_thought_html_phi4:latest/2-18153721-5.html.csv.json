The key term here is \"tie for 6th\", which corresponds to the row labeled `t6` in the table.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the `t6` rows\n\nLook at all entries where the `place` column has the value `t6`. These represent players tied for 6th place:\n\n1. **Howard Clark**: \n   - Row index: 5\n   - Country: England\n   - Score: 70 + 71 = 141\n   - To Par: +1\n\n2. **Bernhard Langer**:\n   - Row index: 6\n   - Country: West Germany\n   - Score: 72 + 69 = 141\n   - To Par: +1\n\n3. **Robert Lee**: \n   - Row index: 7\n   - Country: England\n   - Score: 68 + 73 = 141\n   - To Par: +1\n\n4. **Wayne Riley**:\n   - Row index: 8\n   - Country: Australia\n   - Score: 71 + 70 = 141\n   - To Par: +1\n\n5. **Emilio Rodr\u00edguez**:\n   - Row index: 9\n   - Country: Spain\n   - Score: 71 + 70 = 141\n   - To Par: +1\n\n6. **Peter Senior**: \n   - Row index: 10\n   - Country: Australia\n   - Score: 70 + 71 = 141\n   - To Par: +1\n\n7. **Ian Woosnam**:\n   - Row index: 11\n   - Country: Wales\n   - Score: 70 + 71 = 141\n   - To Par: +1\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of players tied for 6th place\n\nThere are exactly seven players listed in rows with `place` as `t6`.

This means no players are recorded as being tied for 2nd place.\n\n4. **Verify Claim about 3 Players Tied at 2nd Place:**\n   - Since there are no players listed with a 't2' in the place column, the claim of having \"3 player tie at 2nd place\" is incorrect.\n   - Additionally, even if there were such a tie, we would need to check their 'to par' values. However, since there's no 't2' entry, this step is moot.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim about \"3 player tie at 2nd place\" being \"even to par\" cannot be true because there are no players tied for 2nd place in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that three players are tied for 2nd place and are even to par.
