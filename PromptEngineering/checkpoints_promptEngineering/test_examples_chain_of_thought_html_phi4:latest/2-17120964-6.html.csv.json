    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the claim step-by-step and match it against the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Competition:** The claim mentions \"league / cup competition.\" We need to verify if there is a match where both 'league' and 'cup' are mentioned.\n2. **Opponent:** The claim specifies playing against \"swindon wildcat.\" We need to check for matches with the opponent named \"swindon wildcats.\"\n3. **Result:** The claim states that the result was \"lost 4 - 2.\" We need to find a match where the team lost with these exact scores.\n4. **Man of the Match:** The claim names \"neil liddiard\" as the man of the match for this game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n1. **Identify Matches Against Swindon Wildcats:**\n   - From the table, there are two matches against \"swindon wildcats\":\n     - 8th row: Result is \"won 6 - 3,\" venue is \"away.\"\n     - 9th row: Result is \"won 4 - 2,\" venue is \"home.\"\n\n2. **Check for League/Cup Matches:**\n   - Both the 8th and 9th rows have \"league / cup\" listed in the competition column.\n\n3. **Verify Match Result:**\n   - The claim specifies a loss of \"4 - 2.\" Neither of the matches against swindon wildcats (8th or 9th row) ended with this result; both were wins.\n\n4. **Man of the Match Verification:**\n   - In the 9th row, where the match was won 4 - 2, Neil Liddiard is indeed listed as the man of the match. However, the match did not end in a loss.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that the team lost to Swindon Wildcats with a score of 4 - 2 and Neil Liddiard as the man of the match. However, while Neil Liddiard was the man of the match in one game against Swindon Wildcats (9th row), the result was a win (4 - 2) at home, not a loss.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify matches against 'swindon wildcats': found in rows 8 and 9.\",\n    \"Check if these matches were part of the 'league / cup' competition: both are.\",\n    \"Verify match result for a loss of '4 - 2': no such result exists; both results are wins (6 - 3 and 4 - 2).\",\n    \"Check man of the match in relevant rows: Neil Liddiard was man of the match in row 9, but it was a win.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"man of the match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
