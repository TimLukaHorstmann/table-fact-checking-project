This will guide us to the specific row we need to examine.\n\n2. **Examine the Centerfold Model Column for this Date:**\n   - Once we locate the \"9 - 98\" row, check the value in the \"centerfold model\" column of that row.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Centerfolds:**\n   - The claim states there is one centerfold in the issue. We need to see if this entry contains a single name or multiple names. If it's a single name, then the claim is true; if it lists more than one name (or if no name is provided), then the claim is false.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on our analysis of the specific cell in the \"centerfold model\" column for the \"9 - 98\" row, we can conclude whether there is indeed one centerfold as claimed.\n\n### Applying the Steps to the Table:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The table shows that the row with \"date\" equal to \"9 - 98\" is located in the eighth position of the list (considering zero-based indexing, this would be index 7).\n\n2. **Examine the Centerfold Model Column for this Date:**\n   - For \"date\" = \"9 - 98\", the value in the \"centerfold model\" column is \"vanessa gleason\".\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Centerfolds:**\n   - The entry \"vanessa gleason\" indicates a single name, suggesting there is only one centerfold for this issue.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is exactly one person listed as the centerfold model for the \"9 - 98\" issue, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row with 'date' equal to '9 - 98'.

Linda Brava should appear as a subject in the \"20 questions\" column.\n2. The same row must have Laura Cover listed as the \"centerfold model\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Centerfold Model:**\n   - We need to find where Laura Cover is listed as the centerfold model.\n\n2. **Check Relevant Row for 20 Questions Column:**\n   - In the row identified in step 1, check if Linda Brava appears under the \"20 questions\" column.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row:**\n\n   - **Row 1 (Date: 2 - 98):** \n     - Centerfold Model: Julia Schultz\n     - 20 Questions: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\n   - **Row 2 (Date: 3 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Marliece Andrada\n     - 20 Questions: John Peterman\n\n   - **Row 3 (Date: 4 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Holly Joan Hart\n     - 20 Questions: Keith Olbermann\n\n   - **Row 4 (Date: 5 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Deanna Brooks\n     - 20 Questions: Ben Stiller\n\n   - **Row 5 (Date: 7 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Lisa Dergan\n     - 20 Questions: Craig Kilborn\n\n   - **Row 6 (Date: 8 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Angela Little\n     - 20 Questions: Bruce Willis\n\n   - **Row 7 (Date: 9 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Vanessa Gleason\n     - 20 Questions: Kevin Williamson\n\n   - **Row 8 (Date: 10 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Laura Cover\n     - 20 Questions: Tori Spelling\n     - Linda Brava is not listed in the \"20 questions\" column.\n\n   - **Row 9 (Date: 11 - 98):**\n     - Centerfold Model: Tiffany Taylor\n     - 20 Questions: Drew Pinsky\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Laura Cover appears as a centerfold model only in row 8.\n   - In row 8, the \"20 questions\" column lists Tori Spelling, not Linda Brava.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Linda Brava does not appear in the \"20 questions\" column for the issue where Laura Cover is the centerfold model.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires Linda Brava to be listed in the '20 questions' column for the same row where Laura Cover is the centerfold model.
