    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the given table based on specific criteria mentioned in the claim. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies three conditions:\n     1. \"1977 be the most recent build year\"\n     2. \"when the year of enter service be more recent than 2003\"\n     3. \"and the knot be less than 27\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - We need to look at the columns for \"built\", \"entered service\", and \"knots\" in order to verify the conditions.\n\n3. **Find Ships Built Before or In 1977:**\n   - Extract rows where the build year is less than or equal to 1977.\n\n4. **Filter by Entered Service After 2003:**\n   - From the filtered list, identify ships that entered service after 2003.\n\n5. **Check Knots Less Than 27:**\n   - Further filter those ships with knots speed less than 27.\n\n6. **Determine if 1977 is the Most Recent Build Year:**\n   - Check if the most recent build year from the filtered list is indeed 1977.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Ships Built by or Before 1977:**\n  - \"ms moby drea\" (Built in 1975, Entered service in 2003)\n  - \"ms moby otta\" (Built in 1976, Entered service in 2006)\n  - \"ms moby corse\" (Built in 1978, Entered service in 2010)\n\n- **Filter for Service Year After 2003:**\n  - \"ms moby otta\" (Entered service in 2006)\n  - \"ms moby corse\" (Entered service in 2010)\n\n- **Check Knots Less Than 27:**\n  - \"ms moby otta\" has knots = 27\n  - \"ms moby corse\" has knots = 21\n\n- **Determine Most Recent Build Year:**\n  - Among the filtered ships, the most recent build year is 1978 (for \"ms moby corse\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that 1977 should be the most recent build year under these conditions. However, we found that the most recent build year satisfying all conditions is 1978 (\"ms moby corse\").
