    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the university of southern california plays a round lower than 5\" is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement suggests that a player from the University of Southern California (USC) was drafted in a round number lower than 5.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We need to locate entries in the table where the \"school\" column is \"university of southern california\".\n   - Once identified, check the corresponding \"round\" value for that entry.\n   - The claim states that this player should have been drafted in a round lower than 5.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Look through each row to find where the \"school\" column matches \"university of southern california\".\n   - In this case, we find one such entry:\n     - Row with `round = 5`, `name = john herbst`, `position = lhp`, `school = university of southern california`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The player from USC is listed in round 5.\n   - Since the claim states that a player from USC was drafted in a round lower than 5, and we found them in round 5, this does not satisfy the condition of being drafted in a round lower than 5.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because there are no entries for a player from the University of Southern California drafted in a round number lower than 5.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for this evaluation is where `school = \"university of southern california\"` and `round = 5`.\n\nHere is the final answer formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that a player from the University of Southern California was drafted in a round lower than 5.
