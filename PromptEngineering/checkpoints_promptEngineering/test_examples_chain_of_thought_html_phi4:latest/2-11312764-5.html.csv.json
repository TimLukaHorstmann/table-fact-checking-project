    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the steps needed to verify it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Teams from the United States:**\n   - Look for entries under the \"nation\" column where the value is \"united states\".\n\n2. **Check Their Rankings:**\n   - For each team identified as being from the United States, check their ranking in the \"rank\" column.\n\n3. **Verify if All Rank Higher than 10th:**\n   - Ensure that all teams from the United States have a rank number less than or equal to 10.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Teams from the United States:**\n   - Confirm there is exactly one team listed under \"nation\" as \"united states\".\n\n### Applying Reasoning to the Table\n\n1. **Identify Entries for the United States:**\n\n   - Row 1: Name = \"tai babilonia / randy gardner\", Nation = \"united states\"\n   - Row 6: Name = \"vicki heasley / robert wagenhoffer\", Nation = \"united states\"\n   - Row 9: Name = \"sheryl franks / michael botticelli\", Nation = \"united states\"\n\n2. **Check Rankings for These Entries:**\n\n   - Row 1: Rank = 1\n   - Row 6: Rank = 6\n   - Row 9: Rank = 9\n\n3. **Verify if All Ranks are Higher than 10th:**\n   - The ranks (1, 6, and 9) are all less than or equal to 10, so they satisfy this condition.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Teams from the United States:**\n   - There are three teams listed from the United States, not one as claimed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states there is \"1 team from the united state and all rank higher than 10th\".
