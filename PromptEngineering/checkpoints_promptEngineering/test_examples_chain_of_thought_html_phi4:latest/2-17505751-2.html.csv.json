The relevant cell shows \"fra\", indicating France as the nationality.\n   - For Faubert:\n     - Check the row where \"name\" is \"faubert\". The relevant cell also shows \"fra\", indicating France as the nationality.\n\n2. **Determine Transfer or Loan Activity:**\n   - Examine whether Lass and Faubert were involved in a transfer or loan during the winter window, which could relate to the 2008-09 season.\n   - For Lass:\n     - The row shows \"transfer\" under the \"type\" column with \"winter\" as the transfer window and \"2013\" as the end year. This suggests activity relevant to that period but does not specifically mention Real Madrid CF.\n   - For Faubert:\n     - The row indicates a \"loan\" type, with \"winter\" as the transfer window and \"2009\" as the end year, suggesting involvement in the 2008-09 season.\n\n3. **Connection to Real Madrid CF:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention clubs like Real Madrid CF for either Lass or Faubert.\n   - Therefore, we cannot confirm from this data that both were with Real Madrid during the 2008-09 season.\n\n4. **Conclusion on the Claim:**\n   - While it is true that both players are from France, there is no evidence in the table linking them to Real Madrid CF for the specified season.\n   - The claim about their involvement with Real Madrid CF during the 2008-09 season cannot be verified with the provided data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The players Lass and Faubert are both from France as indicated by 'nat' column entries.

However, the table does not explicitly mention \"Real Madrid CF.\" Therefore, we'll assume that all entries in this table pertain to Real Madrid for the purpose of evaluating the claim.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to focus on the column labeled \"ends\" which indicates when a player's contract or loan ends.\n   \n3. **Count Players Ending in 2013**:\n   - Look through each row and count how many players have their contracts ending in 2013.\n\n4. **Count Players Ending in 2012**:\n   - Similarly, count the number of players whose contracts end in 2012.\n\n5. **Compare Counts**:\n   - Calculate the difference between the number of players ending in 2013 and those ending in 2012.\n   - Check if this difference is exactly 3 as stated in the claim.\n\nLet's perform these steps with the data:\n\n- **Players Ending in 2013**:\n  - van der vaart: ends in 2013\n  - garay: ends in 2014 (not relevant)\n  - huntelaar: ends in 2013\n  - lass: ends in 2013\n\n  Total = 3 players end in 2013.\n\n- **Players Ending in 2012**:\n  - javi garc\u00eda: ends in 2012\n\n  Total = 1 player ends in 2012.\n\n- **Difference Calculation**:\n  - Difference = Players ending in 2013 (3) - Players ending in 2012 (1) = 2\n\nThe claim states there should be 3 more players ending in 2013 than those ending in 2012.
