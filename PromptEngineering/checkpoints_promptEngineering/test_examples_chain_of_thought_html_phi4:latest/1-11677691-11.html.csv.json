Each row corresponds to a different player.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Column**: We need to focus on the \"hometown\" column since that's where we will find information about each player's hometown.\n\n3. **Search for the Hometown**: Check each entry in the \"hometown\" column to see if it matches \"delray beach, florida\".\n\n4. **Count Matches**:\n   - Row 1: `austin kafentzis` - hometown is `sandy , utah`\n   - Row 2: `greg bryant` - hometown is `delray beach , florida` (match found)\n   - Row 3: `derrick green` - hometown is `richmond , virginia`\n   - Row 4: `kelvin taylor` - hometown is `belle glade , florida`\n   - Row 5: `laquvionte gonzalez` - hometown is `cedar hill , texas`\n   - Row 6: `leonard fournette` - hometown is `new orleans , louisiana`\n   - Row 7: `tramel terry` - hometown is `goose creek , south carolina`\n   - Row 8: `jalen brown` - hometown is `phoenix , arizona`\n   - Row 9: `kyle bosch` - hometown is `wheaton , illinois`\n   - Row 10: `cameron hunt` - hometown is `corona , california`\n   - Row 11: `thomas duarte` - hometown is `santa ana , california`\n\n5. **Verify the Number of Matches**: We found that only one player, `greg bryant`, has \"delray beach, florida\" as his hometown.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim states there is exactly one player with this hometown, and our examination confirms this.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains a column named 'hometown'.
