Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify Total Number of Matches**:  \n   The table contains six rows under the \"tbody\", each representing one match.\n\n2. **Determine the Criterion for Evaluation**:  \n   We need to check if more than half (i.e., more than 3 out of 6) away teams have a score greater than 10.\n\n3. **Extract Away Team Scores**:  \n   For each row, extract the \"away team\" and their corresponding \"away team score\". \n\n4. **Convert Scores to Numerical Values**:  \n   The scores are given in a format like \"9.11 (65)\". The number after the parenthesis is the total points scored. We need to convert this into goals and behinds, then determine if it's greater than 10:\n   - Convert \"goals\" and \"behinds\" from the score string: \n     - Each goal equals 6 points.\n     - Behind scores are typically 1 point each.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Points for Away Teams**:  \n   For each match, calculate the total points scored by the away team and check if it exceeds 60 points (10 goals).\n\n6. **Count Matches with Scores Greater than 10 Goals**:\n   - Footscray vs St Kilda: St Kilda scored 65 points -> \\( \\frac{65}{6} = 10\\) goals, remainder is 5 behinds.\n   - Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: North Melbourne scored 66 points -> \\( \\frac{66}{6} = 11\\) goals.\n   - Essendon vs Richmond: Richmond scored 111 points -> \\( \\frac{111}{6} = 18\\) goals, remainder is 3 behinds.\n   - Carlton vs South Melbourne: South Melbourne scored 63 points -> \\( \\frac{63}{6} = 10\\) goals, remainder is 3 behinds.\n   - Hawthorn vs Geelong: Geelong scored 98 points -> \\( \\frac{98}{6} = 16\\) goals, remainder is 2 behinds.\n   - Collingwood vs Melbourne: Melbourne scored 58 points -> \\( \\frac{58}{6} = 9\\) goals, remainder is 4 behinds.\n\n7. **Determine the Number of Away Teams with More than 10 Goals**:\n   - St Kilda: 10 goals\n   - North Melbourne: 11 goals (greater than 10)\n   - Richmond: 18 goals (greater than 10)\n   - South Melbourne: 10 goals\n   - Geelong: 16 goals (greater than 10)\n   - Melbourne: 9 goals\n\n8. **Count and Compare**:\n   - Away teams with more than 10 goals: North Melbourne, Richmond, Geelong.\n   - Total number of away teams meeting the criterion = 3.\n\n9. **Evaluate the Claim**:  \n   Since only 3 out of 6 away teams have scores greater than 10 goals, which is not \"more than half\", the claim is false.\n\nFinally, we list the relevant cells for the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify total number of matches: 6\",\n    \"Criterion: More than half (i.e., more than 3) away teams must have scores greater than 10 goals.\",\n    \"Extract and convert away team scores to numerical values:\",\n    \"- Footscray vs St Kilda: St Kilda scored 65 points -> 10 goals, 5 behinds\",\n    \"- Fitzroy vs North Melbourne: North Melbourne scored 66 points -> 11 goals\",\n    \"- Essendon vs Richmond: Richmond scored 111 points -> 18 goals, 3 behinds\",\n    \"- Carlton vs South Melbourne: South Melbourne scored 63 points -> 10 goals, 3 behinds\",\n    \"- Hawthorn vs Geelong: Geelong scored 98 points -> 16 goals, 2 behinds\",\n    \"- Collingwood vs Melbourne: Melbourne scored 58 points -> 9 goals, 4 behinds\",\n    \"Count away teams with scores greater than 10 goals: North Melbourne, Richmond, Geelong (3 out of 6)\",\n    \"Since 3 is not more than half of 6, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
