Instead, it lists entrants (teams) and other technical details.

Instead, it continues with entries under \"leyton house racing.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"sasol jordan yamaha\" is not listed as an entrant in 1989 and there is no indication of a takeover from \"leyton house racing,\" the claim that they took over in 1989 is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The cells relevant to this analysis are those for the year 1989 under the \"entrant\" column, showing entries for \"leyton house racing.\"\n- Additionally, the cell for \"sasol jordan yamaha\" in 1992 confirms they were not involved in 1989.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows 'leyton house racing' as an entrant in 1989 with two separate entries.
