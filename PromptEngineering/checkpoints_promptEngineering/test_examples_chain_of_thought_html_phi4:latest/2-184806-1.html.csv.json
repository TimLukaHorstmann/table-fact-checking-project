    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the table is true, we need to identify all distinct languages listed in the \"language\" column of the table. Here's how we can systematically approach this task:\n\n1. **Extract Data from the Table:**\n   - The relevant data for our analysis is contained within the \"language\" column.\n   \n2. **Identify Unique Languages:**\n   - Go through each row in the \"language\" column and list out all the languages mentioned.\n\n3. **Count Distinct Languages:**\n   - Ensure that each language is counted only once, regardless of how many times it appears across different rows.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states there are 10 different languages performed at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965.\n   - We will compare our count of distinct languages to this number.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- Start by listing all entries from the \"language\" column:\n  1. Dutch\n  2. English\n  3. Spanish\n  4. German\n  5. Norwegian\n  6. French\n  7. Portuguese\n  8. Italian\n  9. Danish\n  10. Finnish\n  11.
