We will focus on this timeframe to check for relevant entries in the table.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Dates**:\n   - Row 1: Date is \"april 20\".\n   - Row 2: Date is \"april 23\".\n   - Row 3: Date is \"april 25\".\n   - Row 4: Date is \"april 27\".\n   - Row 5: Date is \"april 29\".\n   - Row 6: Date is \"may 1\".\n\n   All rows fall within the specified date range.\n\n3. **Check the 'team' Column for Each Relevant Row**:\n   - Row 1: Team is \"detroit\".\n   - Row 2: Team is \"detroit\".\n   - Row 3: Team is \"detroit\".\n   - Row 4: Team is \"detroit\".\n   - Row 5: Team is \"detroit\".\n   - Row 6: Team is \"detroit\".\n\n   In all rows, the team listed is \"detroit\", not \"detriou\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere are no entries in the table for a game involving a team named \"detriou\" between April 20 and May 1.
