    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 have less than 10 more appearances as a defender than Larrys Mabiala\" is true or false, we need to analyze their respective data from the provided table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate the rows for St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 and Larrys Mabiala in the table.\n\n2. **Extract Appearance Data:**\n   - For each player, extract the number of appearances (matches played) from their respective row.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Compute the difference in appearances between St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 and Larrys Mabiala.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Check if St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9's appearances exceed Larrys Mabiala's by less than 10.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Locate Rows:**\n   - St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 is in row 25.\n   - Larrys Mabiala is in row 26.\n\n2. **Extract Appearances:**\n   - St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has 165 appearances.\n   - Larrys Mabiala has 15 appearances.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Difference = 165 (St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9) - 15 (Larrys Mabiala) = 150\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 should have less than 10 more appearances than Larrys Mabiala.\n   - Since 150 is much greater than 10, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has 165 appearances and Larrys Mabiala has 15.
