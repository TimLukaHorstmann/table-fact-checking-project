Identify the row where the crowd size is 32,393.\n2. Check if in that same row, Melbourne is listed as the away team.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Locate the crowd number \"32393\" in the 'crowd' column of the table.\n  - In the second row, under the 'crowd' column, we see the value is 32,393. \n\n- **Step 2:** Verify if Melbourne is listed as the away team for this particular game.\n  - Still within the same row (row index 1), check the 'away team' column to determine which team was playing away.\n  - The 'away team' for this row is \"fitzroy,\" not \"melbourne.\"\n\n- **Conclusion:** Since Melbourne is not listed as the away team in the game with a crowd of 32,393, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n\n1.
