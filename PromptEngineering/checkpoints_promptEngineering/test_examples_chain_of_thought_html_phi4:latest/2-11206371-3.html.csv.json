    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the male bounder book be no\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement refers to a character named \"bounder book,\" specifying that it should not have male gender (\"be no\").\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information in the Table**:\n   - Look for any rows where the `name` column contains \"Bounder Book.\"\n   - Once identified, check the `gender` column for this entry to confirm its gender.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**: \n   - The table has multiple entries with various names and corresponding attributes.\n   - We'll iterate through each row to find a name matching \"Bounder Book.\"\n\n4. **Find the Match**:\n   - On examining, we see that there is an entry where `name` is \"bounder book.\"\n   - Specifically, this appears in the row with `row_index: 19`.\n\n5. **Check Gender Attribute**:\n   - For the identified row (where `name` = \"bounder book\"), check the `gender` column.\n   - The `gender` for this entry is listed as \"male.\"\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data**:\n   - The claim states that \"the male bounder book be no,\" which implies the character should not have a gender of male.\n   - Since the data indicates that \"bounder book\" does indeed have a male gender, this contradicts the claim.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the information in the table, the claim is false because the character \"bounder book\" is listed as having a male gender.\n\n8. **Output the Result**:\n   - We will format the result according to the JSON structure provided, including details of our reasoning and relevant cells.\n\nHere's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. The claim refers to 'bounder book' needing a non-male gender ('be no').\\n2. Locate entries with 'name' as 'bounder book'.\\n3. Find such entry in row_index: 19.\\n4. Check the 'gender' column for this row, which indicates 'male'.\\n5. The claim states that it should not be male, contradicting the table data.\\n6.
