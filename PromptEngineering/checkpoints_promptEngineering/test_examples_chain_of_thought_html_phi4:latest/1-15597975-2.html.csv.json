The player's name appears under the column labeled \"skip.\"\n   \n2. **Locate the Row for Kevin Martin:**\n   - By examining the rows, we find that Kevin Martin is listed in the first row of the table:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>alberta</td>\n       <td>kevin martin</td>\n       <td>11</td>\n       <td>0</td>\n       <td>86</td>\n       <td>52</td>\n       <td>50</td>\n       <td>40</td>\n       <td>11</td>\n       <td>11</td>\n       <td>89</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n3. **Find the \"pf\" Column Value:**\n   - The column labeled \"pf\" (points for) corresponds to the fourth data cell in each row.\n   - For Kevin Martin, this value is 86.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claimed Value:**\n   - The claim states that Kevin Martin's \"pf be 89.\" However, from our analysis of the table, his \"pf\" is actually 86.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual \"pf\" value for Kevin Martin (86) does not match the claimed value (89), the statement is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell for Kevin Martin's \"pf\" is located in the first row under the column \"pf.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
