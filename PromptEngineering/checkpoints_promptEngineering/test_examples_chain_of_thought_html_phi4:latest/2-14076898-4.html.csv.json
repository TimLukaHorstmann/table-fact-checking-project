    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze each row in the table for the 'points' column.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim states there are \"two times when the points be greater than 12\" and \"no time when the points be less than 2\".\n\n2. **Analyzing Points Greater Than 12**:\n   - We need to find rows where the 'points' value is greater than 12.\n   - Checking each row:\n     - Row 1: Points = 12\n     - Row 2: Points = 12\n     - Row 3: Points = 10\n     - Row 4: Points = 7\n     - Row 5: Points = 7\n     - Row 6: Points = 6\n     - Row 7: Points = 2\n     - Row 8: Points = 0\n   - None of the rows have points greater than 12. Thus, the claim that there are \"two times when the points be greater than 12\" is false.\n\n3. **Analyzing Points Less Than 2**:\n   - We need to check if any row has 'points' less than 2.\n   - Checking each row:\n     - Row 1: Points = 12\n     - Row 2: Points = 12\n     - Row 3: Points = 10\n     - Row 4: Points = 7\n     - Row 5: Points = 7\n     - Row 6: Points = 6\n     - Row 7: Points = 2\n     - Row 8: Points = 0\n   - Row 8 has points equal to 0, which is less than 2. Thus, the claim that there are \"no times when the points be less than 2\" is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because:\n- There are no instances where the points are greater than 12.\n- There is one instance (Row 8) where the points are less than 2.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are in the 'points' column across all rows, specifically focusing on Row 1 to Row 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each row's 'points' value.
