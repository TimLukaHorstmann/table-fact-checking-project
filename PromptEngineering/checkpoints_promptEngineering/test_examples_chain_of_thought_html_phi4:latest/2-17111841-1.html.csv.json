    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify if episode number 4 is indeed the earliest episode aired on June 8, 2008.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column:** We need to look at both the \"episode\" and \"original airdate\" columns in the table because the claim involves matching an episode number with a specific air date.\n\n2. **Locate episodes airing on June 8, 2008:**\n   - Examine each row's \"original airdate\" column for entries that match \"8 june 2008.\"\n\n3. **Check the corresponding episode number:** \n   - For any matching dates found in step 2, note down the corresponding episode numbers from the \"episode\" column.\n\n4. **Verify earliest episode:**\n   - Ensure that the episode number identified is indeed the lowest among those aired on June 8, 2008.\n\n**Execution of reasoning steps with table data:**\n\n- Reviewing each row in the \"original airdate\" column:\n  - Row 1 (Episode 1) has an airdate of \"18 may 2008.\"\n  - Row 2 (Episode 2) has an airdate of \"25 may 2008.\"\n  - Row 3 (Episode 3) has an airdate of \"1 june 2008.\"\n  - **Row 4 (Episode 4)** has an airdate of \"8 june 2008.\" This matches the date in question.\n  - Rows 5 to 15 have different dates and do not match \"8 june 2008.\"\n\n- As only one episode, number 4, is found with the airdate \"8 june 2008,\" it is indeed the earliest (and only) episode aired on that date.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is true because episode 4 is the only and therefore the earliest episode originally aired on June 8, 2008.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked each row for the 'original airdate' matching '8 june 2008'.
