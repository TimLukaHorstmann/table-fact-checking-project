    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Walter Meanwell's conference record was worse than that of Stan Van Gundy\" is true or false, we need to compare their respective conference records from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Walter Meanwell's Conference Record:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to Walter Meanwell.\n   - He has two entries:\n     - First entry (row 4): \"years\" are 1911 - 1917, with a conference record of 63 wins and 9 losses.\n     - Second entry (row 6): \"years\" are 1920 - 1934, with a conference record of 95 wins and 71 losses.\n\n2. **Calculate Walter Meanwell's Overall Conference Record:**\n   - Combine the two entries for his total conference record:\n     - Total Wins = 63 + 95 = 158\n     - Total Losses = 9 + 71 = 80\n\n3. **Locate Stan Van Gundy's Conference Record:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to Stan Van Gundy (row 12).\n   - His conference record is 7 wins and 11 losses for the years 1994 - 1995.\n\n4. **Compare Conference Records:**\n   - Calculate the win percentage for each coach:\n     - **Walter Meanwell's Win Percentage:** \n       \\[\n       \\text{Win Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Total Wins}}{\\text{Total Wins + Total Losses}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{158}{158 + 80}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 66.39\\%\n       \\]\n     - **Stan Van Gundy's Win Percentage:** \n       \\[\n       \\text{Win Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{7}{7 + 11}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{7}{18}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 38.89\\%\n       \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Walter Meanwell's conference win percentage (66.39%) is higher than Stan Van Gundy's (38.89%).\n   - Therefore, Walter Meanwell's conference record was not worse; it was better.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Walter Meanwell has two periods as coach with combined conference records of 158-80.
