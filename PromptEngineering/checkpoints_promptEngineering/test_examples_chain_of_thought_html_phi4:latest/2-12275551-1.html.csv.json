    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Song Yang win the women 's single more than any other player\" is true or false, we need to analyze the \"Women's Singles\" column of the table for occurrences of Song Yang winning compared to other players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for this claim is the \"women 's singles\" column since it contains data about who won in women's singles each year.\n\n2. **Scan the Table:**\n   - We need to go through each row of the table and check if Song Yang is listed as a winner in the \"Women's Singles\" category.\n   \n3. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - Tally how many times Song Yang appears in the \"women 's singles\" column.\n   - Simultaneously, keep track of other players who win more than once to compare their frequency with that of Song Yang.\n\n4. **Compare Frequencies:**\n   - After counting occurrences for all players, compare Song Yang's count with those of others to see if she has the highest number of wins in women\u2019s singles.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If Song Yang's win count is higher than any other player's count, the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **2000**: Zhou Mi (Not Song Yang)\n- **2001**: Yao Jie (Not Song Yang)\n- **2002**: Lene K\u00f8ppen (Not Song Yang)\n- **2003**: Lenny Permana (Not Song Yang)\n- **2004**: Huang Chia Chi (Not Song Yang)\n- **2005**: Adriyanti Firdasari (Not Song Yang)\n- **2006**: Huang Chia-Chi (Not Song Yang)\n- **2007**: Zhou Mi (Not Song Yang)\n- **2008**: Zhou Mi (Not Song Yang)\n- **2009**: Sayaka Sato (Not Song Yang)\n- **2010**: Wang Shixian (Not listed in table, but not Song Yang)\n- **2011**: Wang Xin (Not listed in table, but not Song Yang)\n- **2012**: Lindaweni Fanetri (Not listed in table, but not Song Yang)\n- **2013**: Deng Xuan (Not Song Yang)\n\n- **Occurrences of Song Yang:**\n  - **2000**: Song Yang wins\n  - **2005**: Song Yang wins\n\n- **Count for Other Players:**\n  - Zhou Mi: 2 wins (2007, 2008)\n  - Huang Chia-Chi: 2 wins (2004, 2006)\n  - Others have fewer than 2 wins.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSong Yang has won the women's singles title twice. However, both Zhou Mi and Huang Chia-Chi also have two wins each in women\u2019s singles, which is equal to Song Yang's count.
