    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all wrestlers, including vacate, have held at least 3 reigns\" is true or false, we need to evaluate each entry in the table under the \"reign\" column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column for this claim is \"reign\", as it indicates how many times a wrestler has held a title.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - We will check each row's value in the \"reign\" column to see if it is at least 3.\n   \n3. **Row Evaluation**:\n   - **Row 1**: Wrestler: filoso, Reign: 1\n     - The reign count is less than 3.\n   - **Row 2**: Wrestler: osamu namiguchi, Reign: 1\n     - The reign count is less than 3.\n   - **Row 3**: Wrestler: katsuhiko nakajima, Reign: 1\n     - The reign count is less than 3.\n   - **Row 4**: Wrestler: tatsuhito takaiwa, Reign: 1\n     - The reign count is less than 3.\n   - **Row 5**: Wrestler: vacated, Reign: -\n     - The \"-\" symbol indicates no reigns held. This means zero reigns.\n   - **Row 6**: Wrestler: the\u2605zest, Reign: 1\n     - The reign count is less than 3.\n   - **Row 7**: Wrestler: noiz, Reign: 1\n     - The reign count is less than 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the wrestlers have held at least 3 reigns; all listed reign counts are either \"1\" or \"-\".\n\nBased on this evaluation, the claim that \"all wrestlers, including vacate, have held at least 3 reigns\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n- Row 2: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n- Row 3: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n- Row 4: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n- Row 5: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n- Row 6: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n- Row 7: {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'reign' column was examined for each row to determine if any wrestler had held at least 3 reigns. All wrestlers listed had either a reign count of 1 or none (indicated by '-'). Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"reign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"reign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"reign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"reign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"reign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
