    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the data in the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states: \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" This implies that there are 4 poles associated with the Moto2 class.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the Moto2 class.\n   - Then, check the value in the \"pole\" column for this row.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - The table contains rows for different classes: 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, and total.\n   - We focus on the row where the class is \"moto2\".\n\n4. **Check the Moto2 Row**:\n   - Locate the row with \"moto2\" in the \"class\" column (this is the fourth row).\n   - Look at the value in the \"pole\" column for this row.\n\n5. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - In the \"moto2\" row, under the \"pole\" column, the value is 0.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data**:\n   - The claim states there are 4 poles for Moto2.\n   - However, according to the table, there are 0 poles for Moto2.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the data shows 0 poles and not 4, the claim is FALSE.\n\n8. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell is in row index 3 (fourth row) under the \"pole\" column.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states there are 4 poles for Moto2.
