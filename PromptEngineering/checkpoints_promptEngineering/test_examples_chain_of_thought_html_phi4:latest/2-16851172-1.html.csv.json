    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Martina Hingis was a semifinalist 3 different times\" is true or false, we need to examine the table and count how many different tournaments Martina Hingis reached the semifinals.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest**:\n   - We are interested in the \"semifinalists\" column as it lists the players who made it to the semifinals for each tournament.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Traverse through each row and check if Martina Hingis is listed under the \"semifinalists\" column.\n   - We will count how many distinct tournaments (rows) she appears as a semifinalist.\n\n3. **Check Each Tournament**:\n\n   - **Tokyo**: Semifinalists are \"magdalena maleeva anna kournikova\". Martina Hingis is not listed here.\n   \n   - **Indian Wells**: Semifinalists are \"martina hingis venus williams\". Martina Hingis appears as a semifinalist in this tournament.\n   \n   - **Miami**: Semifinalists are \"martina hingis elena dementieva\".

Martina Hingis appears as a semifinalist in this tournament as well.\n   \n   - **Rome**: Semifinalists are \"martina hingis conchita mart\u00ednez\". Martina Hingis is listed here, but since we are only counting distinct tournaments, this does not add to our count beyond the previous unique appearances.\n   \n   - **Canada (Toronto)**: Semifinalists are \"anke huber monica seles\". Martina Hingis is not listed.\n   \n   - **Moscow**: Semifinalists are \"anastasia myskina silvia farina elia\". Martina Hingis is not listed.\n   \n   - **Zurich**: Semifinalists are \"nathalie tauziat jennifer capriati\". Martina Hingis is not listed.\n\n4. **Count Distinct Tournaments**:\n   - From the above examination, Martina Hingis appears as a semifinalist in three distinct tournaments: Indian Wells, Miami, and Berlin.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that Martina Hingis was a semifinalist 3 different times, which matches our findings.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Martina Hingis appears as a semifinalist in the tournaments: Indian Wells, Miami, and Berlin.
