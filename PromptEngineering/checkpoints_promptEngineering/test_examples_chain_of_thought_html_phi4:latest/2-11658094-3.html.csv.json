    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Year Founded:** The claim mentions a university founded in 1839.\n2. **Determine Type of Institution:** It specifies that the institution was private.\n3. **Year Left:** According to the claim, this institution left in 1975.\n4. **Location:** The location mentioned is Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nNow, let's analyze these criteria using the data provided:\n\n- **Founded in 1839:**\n  - Longwood University (Public), Farmville, Virginia\n  - Queens University of Charlotte (Private), Charlotte, North Carolina\n  - University of North Carolina at Pembroke (Public), Pembroke, North Carolina\n\n  Only the founding year matches with Longwood University and two private institutions. However, we are looking for a private institution.\n\n- **Private Institution:**\n  - Presbyterian College (Private), Clinton, South Carolina\n  - Queens University of Charlotte (Private), Charlotte, North Carolina\n  - Western Carolina University (Public), Cullowhee, North Carolina\n\n  From the list of institutions founded in 1839, only Queens University of Charlotte is private.\n\n- **Left in 1975:**\n  - Presbyterian College (1965 to 1972)\n  - Mars Hill College (1973 to 1975)\n\n  Neither Presbyterian College nor any other private institution from 1839 left in 1975. However, Mars Hill College matches the \"left\" year but is not founded in 1839.\n\n- **Location: Hickory, North Carolina:**\n  - Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, North Carolina\n  - Wingate University, Wingate, North Carolina\n\n  None of these match the location specified for a private institution founded in 1839 and left in 1975.\n\n- **Hickory, North Carolina Specifics:**\n  - Lenoir-Rhyne University (not listed) is located in Hickory but does not fit any other criteria.\n  - Longwood University was public, ruling it out.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- No private institution founded in 1839 and leaving in 1975 is associated with Hickory, North Carolina. The only private university from that year is Queens University of Charlotte, located in Charlotte, not Hickory.\n\nTherefore, the claim does not hold true based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify institutions founded in 1839.\",\n    \"Filter for private institutions among them.\",\n    \"Check which, if any, left in 1975.\",\n    \"Verify if any match the location Hickory, North Carolina.\",\n    \"No institution fits all criteria.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Type of Institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
