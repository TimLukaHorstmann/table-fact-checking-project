    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the total attendance on May 28 being 17132 is true or false, we can analyze the given table step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Date of Interest:**\n   - The claim specifies the date as May 28.\n\n2. **Locate the Row Corresponding to May 28:**\n   - In the HTML table provided, locate the row where the \"date\" column is \"may 28.\"\n\n3. **Extract Attendance for May 28:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row for May 28, check the value in the \"attendance\" column of that row.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value:**\n   - Compare the extracted attendance value with the claimed value (17132) to see if they match.\n\n### Applying Steps to the Table:\n\n- **Row Identification:**\n  - The third row in the table corresponds to May 28:\n    ```html\n    <tr>\n      <td>may 28</td>\n      <td>detroit</td>\n      <td>2 - 3</td>\n      <td>pittsburgh</td>\n      <td>osgood</td>\n      <td>17132</td>\n      <td>2 - 1</td>\n    </tr>\n    ```\n\n- **Extract Attendance:**\n  - In this row, the \"attendance\" column has a value of 17132.\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - The extracted attendance (17132) matches exactly with the claimed attendance for May 28.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the total attendance on May 28 was 17132 is indeed true based on the table data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
