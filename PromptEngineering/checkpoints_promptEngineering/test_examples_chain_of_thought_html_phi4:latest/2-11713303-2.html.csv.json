Whether Peter Voets took the place of Dennis van Wijk.\n\nLet's break down each part using the table provided:\n\n### Part 1: Was Val\u00e8re Billen replaced by Dennis van Wijk?\n\n- **Row 1**: Val\u00e8re Billen, who managed Sint-Truiden, quit on 18 September 2007. He was initially replaced by Peter Voets (caretaker) on the same day.\n  \n- **Row 4**: On 10 December 2007, the caretaker manager Peter Voets at Sint-Truiden was replaced by Dennis van Wijk.\n\nFrom this information:\n- Val\u00e8re Billen was not directly replaced by Dennis van Wijk; he was replaced by Peter Voets first. Thus, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Part 2: Did Peter Voets take the place of Dennis van Wijk?\n\n- **Row 4**: As noted above, on 10 December 2007, Peter Voets was replaced by Dennis van Wijk at Sint-Truiden. Therefore, Dennis van Wijk took the place of Peter Voets.\n\nFrom this information:\n- Peter Voets did not take the place of Dennis van Wijk; rather, it was the other way around. Thus, this part of the claim is also FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"in the 2007 - 2008 season, Val\u00e8re Billen be replaced by Dennis van Wijk and Peter Voets take the place of Dennis van Wijk\" is FALSE because:\n- Val\u00e8re Billen was not directly replaced by Dennis van Wijk; he was initially replaced by Peter Voets.\n- Peter Voets did not replace Dennis van Wijk; instead, Dennis van Wijk replaced Peter Voets.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n1. **Val\u00e8re Billen's Replacement**:\n   - Row 1: \"outgoing manager\" (Val\u00e8re Billen), \"date of vacancy\" (18 September 2007), \"replaced by\" (Peter Voets).\n   \n2. **Peter Voets' and Dennis van Wijk's Swap**:\n   - Row 4: \"team\" (Sint-Truiden), \"outgoing manager\" (Peter Voets), \"manner of departure\" (caretaker replaced), \"date of vacancy\" (10 December 2007), \"replaced by\" (Dennis van Wijk).\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
