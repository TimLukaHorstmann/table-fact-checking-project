It provides context about performance but isn't needed to verify the specific claim regarding finish position and total score.\n   - **Finish**: The finish is listed as \"t12.\" The claim states he finished in a tie for 12th place, which matches exactly with \"t12.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim**:\n   - The claim states: \"Tiger Woods finished tied for 12th with a score of 282.\"\n   - From the table, we have confirmed that Tiger Woods' finish is indeed \"t12\" and his total score is \"282.\" Both components of the claim are accurate according to the data provided.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both parts of the claim match the information in the table, the claim is true.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are located at row index 2 (Tiger Woods' row):\n     - Column \"player\": Value \"tiger woods\"\n     - Column \"total\": Value \"282\"\n     - Column \"finish\": Value \"t12\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Tiger Woods' entry by identifying his name in the 'player' column.
