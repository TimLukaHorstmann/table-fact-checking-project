    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about December 4th having a game at Wells Fargo Center with an attendance of 19,684 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Column Information:**\n   - The table has columns for \"game\", \"december\", \"opponent\", \"score\", \"location / attendance\", \"record\", and \"points\".\n   - We are interested in the \"december\" column to find games played on December 4th.\n   - Additionally, we need the \"location / attendance\" column to verify the location and attendance.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for December 4th:**\n   - Find the row where the \"december\" value is 4.
