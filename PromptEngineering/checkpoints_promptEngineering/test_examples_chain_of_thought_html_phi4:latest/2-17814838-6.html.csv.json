Replays are explicitly labeled as \"replay\".\n\n2. **Identify Initial Games and Replays:**\n   - Rows where \"tie no\" is numeric indicate the original matches.\n   - Rows with \"replay\" in the first column indicate matches that were replays due to the initial game ending in a tie.\n\n3. **Determine Which Initial Games Ended in Ties:**\n   - A tie result occurs when the score is \"0 - 0\", \"1 - 1\", or any other scenario where both teams have the same number of goals.\n   - We need to check each row with numeric \"tie no\" to find which games ended in a tie and thus required a replay.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Replays:**\n   - For each initial game that resulted in a tie, there should be a corresponding replay match listed below it with \"replay\" as its first column value.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 6 games needed replays because they ended in ties.\n   - We will count the number of such replays and verify if this matches the claim.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** Liverpool vs Everton, Score: 1 - 1 (Tie), Replay exists.\n- **Row 3:** Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur, Score: 2 - 1 (Not a tie).\n- **Row 4:** Hull City vs Millwall, Score: 2 - 0 (Not a tie).\n- **Row 5:** Sunderland vs Blackburn Rovers, Score: 0 - 0 (Tie), Replay exists.\n- **Row 7:** Cardiff City vs Arsenal, Score: 0 - 0 (Tie), Replay exists.\n- **Row 9:** Chelsea vs Ipswich Town, Score: 3 - 1 (Not a tie).\n- **Row 10:** Doncaster Rovers vs Aston Villa, Score: 0 - 0 (Tie), Replay exists.\n- **Row 11:** West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley, Score: 2 - 2 (Tie), Replay exists.\n- **Row 15:** Derby County vs Nottingham Forest, Score: 1 - 1 (Tie), Replay exists.\n\n**Replays Identified:**\n- Rows with replays due to ties are: Row 2, Row 6, Row 8, Row 11, Row 16, and Row 17.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere are exactly 6 replays listed in the table that were necessitated by initial games ending in a tie.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check if there exists a tie where the total number of goals scored by both teams combined is 8 or more. The claim specifically mentions a hypothetical scenario involving West Bromwich Albion and Burnley with a score of 7 - 7, which would indeed result in a total of 14 goals.\n\nLet's go through the table to identify any ties where the total goal count might reach 8 or more:\n\n1. **Identify all matches:**\n   - Liverpool vs Everton: Score is 1 - 1 (Total: 2)\n   - Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur: Score is 2 - 1 (Total: 3)\n   - Hull City vs Millwall: Score is 2 - 0 (Total: 2)\n   - Sunderland vs Blackburn Rovers: Score is 0 - 0, Replay 2 - 1 (Replay Total: 3)\n   - Hartlepool United vs West Ham United: Score is 0 - 2 (Total: 2)\n   - Sheffield United vs Charlton Athletic: Score is 2 - 1 (Total: 3)\n   - Cardiff City vs Arsenal: Score is 0 - 0, Replay 4 - 0 (Replay Total: 4)\n   - Portsmouth vs Swansea City: Score is 0 - 2 (Total: 2)\n   - Chelsea vs Ipswich Town: Score is 3 - 1 (Total: 4)\n   - Doncaster Rovers vs Aston Villa: Score is 0 - 0, Replay 3 - 1 (Replay Total: 4)\n   - West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley: Score is 2 - 2, Replay 3 - 1 (Replay Total: 4)\n   - Torquay United vs Coventry City: Score is 0 - 1 (Total: 1)\n   - Kettering Town vs Fulham: Score is 2 - 4 (Total: 6)\n   - Watford vs Crystal Palace: Score is 4 - 3 (Total: 7)\n   - Derby County vs Nottingham Forest: Score is 1 - 1, Replay 2 - 3 (Replay Total: 5)\n   - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Middlesbrough: Score is 1 - 2 (Total: 3)\n\n2. **Check for high goal totals:**\n   - The highest total score in any match or replay is found in the Watford vs Crystal Palace tie, with a total of 7 goals.\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that West Bromwich Albion and Burnley scored a combined total of 14 goals (7 - 7), which does not occur in any match.\n   - No match or replay in the table reaches a total of 8 or more goals, let alone 14.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because there is no evidence in the data to support such a high-scoring tie between West Bromwich Albion and Burnley, nor does any other match reach a combined goal count of 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"List all matches and calculate total goals for each.\",\n    \"Identify highest total goals scored in any match or replay.\",\n    \"Check if the specific claim about West Bromwich Albion vs Burnley with 7-7 is true.\",\n    \"Verify if any match reaches a combined goal count of 8 or more.\",\n    \"Conclude that no such high-scoring tie exists, making the claim false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
