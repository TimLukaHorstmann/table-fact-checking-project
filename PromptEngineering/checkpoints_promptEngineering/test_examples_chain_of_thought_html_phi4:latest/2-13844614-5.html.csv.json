Only one position has won all of their matches.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Check Matches for Each Position:**\n   - The `matches` column indicates how many matches each position has played. We will check this value for each row:\n     - Row 1 (Position 1): `matches = 5`\n     - Row 2 (Position 2): `matches = 5`\n     - Row 3 (Position 3): `matches = 5`\n     - Row 4 (Position 4): `matches = 5`\n     - Row 5 (Position 5): `matches = 5`\n     - Row 6 (Position 6): `matches = 5`\n\n   All positions have played exactly 5 matches, satisfying the first part of the claim.\n\n2. **Check Wins for Each Position:**\n   - The `wins` column indicates how many matches each position has won.
