    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided in the table for players who were active during that period. The relevant columns are \"name\", \"years\", and \"goals\". Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Players Active During 1950-1965:**\n   - Look at each row in the \"years\" column to find players whose career span overlaps with or includes any part of the period from 1950 through 1965.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Relevant Player's Goal Score:**\n   - For each player identified, check their corresponding goal score in the \"goals\" column.\n   \n3. **Check Against the Claim:**\n   - Verify if all these players have scored fewer than 160 goals during this period.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Row 10 (Titus Ozon):**\n   - Years: 1947 - 1964\n   - This player was active during part of the period in question.\n   - Goals: 157\n   - Since 157 is less than 160, this satisfies the claim for this player.\n\n2. **Row 9 (Mihai Adam):**\n   - Years: 1962 - 1976\n   - This player was active during part of the period in question.\n   - Goals: 160\n   - Since 160 is not less than 160, this does not satisfy the claim.\n\n3. **Row 5 (Ion Oblemenco):**\n   - Years: 1964 - 1976\n   - This player was active during part of the period in question.\n   - Goals: 170\n   - Since 170 is greater than 160, this does not satisfy the claim.\n\n4. **Other Rows:**\n   - All other players listed have career spans that start after 1965 or end before 1950, so they are irrelevant to this analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe goal score for at least one player (Mihai Adam and Ion Oblemenco) active during the period 1950-1965 is not less than 160. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players active during 1950-1965: Titus Ozon (157 goals), Mihai Adam (160 goals), and Ion Oblemenco (170 goals).
