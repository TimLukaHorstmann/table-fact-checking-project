This information is under the \"matches played\" column.\n  - In row 15, the value for \"matches played\" is 113.\n\n- **Verify the Number of Innings Played by Mark Taylor:**\n  - Next, check the number of innings under the \"innings\" column for Mark Taylor.\n  - In row 15, the value for \"innings\" is 110.\n\n- **Confirm Mark Taylor's Batting Average:**\n  - Check the batting average under the \"average\" column for Mark Taylor.\n  - In row 15, the value for \"average\" is 32.23.\n\n**Verification of Claim:**  \nThe claim states that Mark Taylor has played 113 matches with 110 innings and an average of 32.23.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"185 be the least match for not out be 44 in 1984 - 1995\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions a specific condition where:\n     - Matches (column \"Matches\") equal 185.\n     - Not Outs (column \"Not Outs\") equal 44.\n     - Career span is between 1984 and 1995.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Columns:**\n   - We need to examine the columns: \"Matches\", \"Not Outs\", and \"Career\".\n\n3. **Checking for Matches = 185:**\n   - Locate rows where the \"Matches\" column has a value of 185.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 11 (Michael Hussey): Matches = 185, Not Outs = 44, Career = 2004-2012.\n\n4. **Verifying Not Outs = 44:**\n   - In the row identified above (Row 11), \"Not Outs\" is indeed 44.\n\n5. **Checking Career Span for 1984 - 1995:**\n   - The career span in Row 11 is 2004-2012, which does not match 1984-1995.\n   - Therefore, the condition of having a career span from 1984 to 1995 is not met.\n\n6. **Checking for Career Span = 1984 - 1995:**\n   - Locate rows where the \"Career\" column matches 1984-1995.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 10 (David Boon): Career = 1984-1995, Matches = 181, Not Outs = 16.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no row in the table where both \"Matches\" equals 185 and \"Not Outs\" equals 44 for a career span of 1984-1995.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- Row 11: Matches = 185, Not Outs = 44\n- Row 10: Career = 1984-1995, Matches = 181, Not Outs = 16\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires finding a row where Matches = 185 and Not Outs = 44 for a career spanning 1984-1995. Row 11 has Matches = 185 and Not Outs = 44, but the career span is 2004-2012, not 1984-1995. Row 10 matches the career span of 1984-1995 but does not have Matches = 185 or Not Outs = 44. Therefore, no such row exists in the table.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Matches\", \"value\": 185},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Not Outs\", \"value\": 44},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Career\", \"value\": \"1984 - 1995\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Matches\", \"value\": 181},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Not Outs\", \"value\": 16}\n  ]\n}\n```",
