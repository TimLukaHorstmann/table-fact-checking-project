We need to convert \"rookie\" to 0 for comparison.\n   - From the table, we find that `nayef abi said` and `rudy hachach` have played for 7 years each.\n\n2. **Check Weights of Players with Most Years**:\n   - `nayef abi said`: Weight = 118 kg\n   - `rudy hachach`: Weight = 117 kg\n\n3. **Identify the Two Lightest Players in the Team**:\n   - Sort all players by weight to find the two lightest.\n   - The sorted weights are: \n     - 65 kg (alaa khashab)\n     - 75 kg (walid yassine, hassan ghazi)\n     - 80 kg (yves khoury)\n     - 83 kg (khalil namro, kevin haddad)\n     - 82 kg (kassem abdo)\n     - 85 kg (abed hammoud in center position, rami hawi)\n     - 87 kg (ahmad fadlalah)\n     - 94 kg (hani assi)\n     - 94 kg (khalil namro)\n     - 95 kg (shawkat el ghazi, hamza abou zahr, hani assi in prop position, walid yassine)\n     - 98 kg (kassem abdo)\n     - 104 kg (kevin haddad)\n     - 107 kg (yves khoury)\n     - 110 kg (walid yassine in center position)\n     - 118 kg (nayef abi said)\n     - 117 kg (rudy hachach)\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The two lightest players are `alaa khashab` (65 kg) and either `walid yassine` or `hassan ghazi` (75 kg).\n   - Neither `nayef abi said` nor `rudy hachach` is among the two lightest.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the 2 players who have played the greatest number of years are also the 2 lightest\" is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified 'nayef abi said' and 'rudy hachach' as having the most years (7).
