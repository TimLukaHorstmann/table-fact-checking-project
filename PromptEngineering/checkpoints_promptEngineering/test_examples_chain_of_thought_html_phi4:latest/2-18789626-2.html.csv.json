This implies two periods: one starting in 1948 and another in 2000.\n   \n   - **Southwestern (Row Index 7):** Year Joined is 1958, which is not after 1970.\n\n   - **Western (Row Index 8):** Year Joined is 1958, which is not after 1970.\n\n   - **Carroll (Row Index 9):** Year Joined is 1961, which is not after 1970.\n\n   - **Clinton Prairie (Row Index 10):** Year Joined is 1961, which is not after 1970.\n   \n   - **Central Catholic (Row Index 11):** Year Joined is 1970, which is not after 1970.\n\n   - **Harrison (West Lafayette) (Row Index 12):** Year Joined is 1970, which is not after 1970.\n\n   - **McCutcheon (Row Index 13):** Year Joined is 1975, which is indeed after 1970.\n   \n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the maverick be the only team to join after 1970.\"\n   - Sheridan rejoined in 2000, which is also after 1970, contradicting the exclusivity of McCutcheon Mavericks.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Sheridan has a period of rejoining in 2000, it implies that there are at least two teams (Sheridan and McCutcheon) with \"year joined\" values greater than 1970.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE because McCutcheon is not the only team to join after 1970.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **McCutcheon Mavericks:**\n  - Row Index: 13\n  - Column Name: year joined\n\n- **Sheridan Blackhawks:**\n  - Row Index: 6\n  - Column Name: year joined\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked each row's 'year joined' column to see if any team joined after 1970.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine the years when \"Winamac\" and \"Southwestern\" joined and then calculate the difference between these years.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Winamac:**\n   - Look through the table for the row where the school name is \"winamac\".\n   - The relevant data in this row is:\n     - School: winamac\n     - Year Joined: 1947\n\n2. **Identify the Row for Southwestern:**\n   - Look through the table for the row where the school name is \"southwestern\".\n   - The relevant data in this row is:\n     - School: southwestern\n     - Year Joined: 1958\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Joining Years:**\n   - Subtract the year \"Southwestern\" joined from the year \"Winamac\" joined:\n     \\[\n     1947 - 1958 = -11\n     \\]\n   - This calculation shows that Winamac joined 11 years before Southwestern, not after.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"winamac join 10 year after southwestern join\".\n   - Based on our calculation, Winamac actually joined 11 years before Southwestern.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row for 'Winamac' which shows it joined in 1947. Then, find the row for 'Southwestern', showing it joined in 1958. Calculate the difference: 1947 - 1958 = -11, indicating Winamac joined 11 years before Southwestern. Thus, the claim that Winamac joined 10 years after Southwestern is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
