We need to check if they were elevated on September 21, 1179.\n\n2. **Locate the Rows**:\n   - **Melior le Maitre, OSBVall**: \n     - Look for \"melior le maitre , osbvall\" in the 'elector' column.\n     - This is found in row index 3.\n   - **Pietro Diana**:\n     - Look for \"pietro diana\" in the 'elector' column.\n     - This is found in row index 7.\n   - **Radulf Nigellus**:\n     - Look for \"radulf nigellus\" in the 'elector' column.\n     - This is found in row index 8.\n\n3. **Check Dates of Elevation**:\n   - For **Melior le Maitre, OSBVall** (row index 3):\n     - The date of elevation is \"March 16, 1185\".\n   - For **Pietro Diana** (row index 7):\n     - The date of elevation is \"March 16, 1185\".\n   - For **Radulf Nigellus** (row index 8):\n     - The date of elevation is \"March 16, 1185\".\n\n4. **Verify Against the Claim Date**: \n   - The claim states all were elevated on September 21, 1179.\n   - None of the individuals have this date as their elevation date.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that Melior le Maitre, Pietro Diana, and Radulf Nigellus were elevated on September 21, 1179, is FALSE.
