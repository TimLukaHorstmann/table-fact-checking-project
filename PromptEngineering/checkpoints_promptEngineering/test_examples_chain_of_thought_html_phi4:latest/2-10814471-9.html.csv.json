    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points on 25 tries\" is true, we need to analyze the table data for Tevita Vaikona.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Tevita Vaikona's Row:**\n   - Locate the row in the table where the player's name matches \"tevita vaikona.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data from the Row:**\n   - From this row, extract the values for the columns `tries`, `goals`, and `points`.\n\n3. **Check the Number of Tries:**\n   - The claim states that Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points on 25 tries.\n   - Verify if the value in the `tries` column is indeed 25.\n\n4. **Calculate Points from Tries:**\n   - In rugby, each try is worth 4 points.\n   - Calculate the points contributed by tries using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Points from tries} = \\text{Tries} \\times 4\n     \\]\n   - For 25 tries, this calculation would be:\n     \\[\n     25 \\times 4 = 100\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify Total Points:**\n   - Check if the total points in the `points` column match the calculated points from tries (100 points).\n\n6. **Consider Goals Contribution:**\n   - Ensure that no additional points come from goals, as the claim specifies that all points are from tries.\n   - Verify the value in the `goals` column is 0.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - If all conditions match (25 tries, 100 total points, and 0 goals), then the claim is true.\n\n### Applying the Steps to the Table:\n\n- **Row for Tevita Vaikona:** \n  - `player`: tevita vaikona\n  - `position`: wing\n  - `tries`: 25\n  - `goals`: 0\n  - `points`: 100\n\n- **Verification:**\n  - Tries = 25, which matches the claim.\n  - Points from tries = \\(25 \\times 4 = 100\\).\n  - Total points = 100, which matches the calculated points.\n  - Goals = 0, confirming no additional points from goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true based on the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Tevita Vaikona's row shows 25 tries and 100 total points with 0 goals.
