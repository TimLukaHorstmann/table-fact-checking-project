St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S., so it's domestic.\n   - **Row 3:** `location` is \"st pete times forum\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the lightning play every game at 7:00 pm\" is true or false, we will examine each entry of the table under the \"time\" column.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **First Entry (row index 0):**\n   - Date: Saturday, September 20\n   - Time: 7:30 pm\n   \n2. **Second Entry (row index 1):**\n   - Date: Monday, September 22\n   - Time: 7:30 pm\n\n3. **Third Entry (row index 2):**\n   - Date: Tuesday, September 23\n   - Time: 7:30 pm\n\n4. **Fourth Entry (row index 3):**\n   - Date: Thursday, September 25\n   - Time: 7:00 pm\n   \n5. **Fifth Entry (row index 4):**\n   - Date: Sunday, September 28\n   - Time: 10:00 pm\n\n6. **Sixth Entry (row index 5):**\n   - Date: Tuesday, September 30\n   - Time: 12:00 pm\n\n**Analysis of the times:**\n\n- The first three games are played at 7:30 pm.\n- The fourth game is played at 7:00 pm.\n- The fifth game is played at 10:00 pm.\n- The sixth game is played at 12:00 pm.\n\nFrom this analysis, it's clear that not every game is played at 7:00 pm. Specifically, games are also scheduled at 7:30 pm, 10:00 pm, and 12:00 pm.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nThe claim \"the lightning play every game at 7:00 pm\" is false because there are multiple time slots different from 7:00 pm for the games listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine each entry under the 'time' column.\",\n    \"First three entries have times at 7:30 pm.\",\n    \"Fourth entry has a time of 7:00 pm.\",\n    \"Fifth entry has a time of 10:00 pm.\",\n    \"Sixth entry has a time of 12:00 pm.\",\n    \"Not every game is played at 7:00 pm.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
