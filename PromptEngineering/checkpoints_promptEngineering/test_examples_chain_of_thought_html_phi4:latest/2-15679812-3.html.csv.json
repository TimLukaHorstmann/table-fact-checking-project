They are consistently finishing:\n   - 7th, 6th, 8th, 6th, 4th, and 8th in the conference. No first or second finishes.\n\n2. **2000-2013**: The team moved to Memphis and became the \"Memphis Grizzlies.\" Their finish positions are as follows:\n   - 2001: 7th\n   - 2002: 5th\n   - 2003: 4th \u00a4 (with a notable finish due to tie)\n   - 2004-2006: Ranges from 4th to 3rd in the \"southwest\" division.\n   - 2007-2010: Typically finishing between 5th and 4th.\n   - 2011-2012: Finish positions are 3rd \u00a4 and 2nd \u00a4 (both with ties).\n   - 2013: 2nd \u00a4\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Claim\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"Between 1995 and 2013, the Grizzlies have never finished in first.\"\n- They have finished second \"in their final 2 listed conference\" seasons.\n\n#### Verification of Each Part of the Claim:\n\n1. **Never Finished First**:  \n   - From our analysis, there are no instances where the team finishes in 1st place from 1995 to 2013.\n   \n2. **Finished Second in Final Two Listed Seasons**:  \n   - The last two seasons listed (2012-13 and 2011-12) both show a \"2nd \u00a4\" finish, confirming they finished second in these final seasons.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim hold true based on the analysis:\n\n1.
