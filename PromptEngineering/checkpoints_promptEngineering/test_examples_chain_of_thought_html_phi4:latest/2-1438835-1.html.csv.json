We first locate all entries in the table corresponding to this season.\n   - In the table, the rows with \"season\" as \"2013 - 14\" are:\n     - Row 5: `uefa europa league`, `group h`, `sevilla`\n     - Row 6: `uefa europa league`, `group h`, `estoril`\n     - Row 7: `uefa europa league`, `group h`, `slovan liberec`\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Competition:**\n   - The claim mentions the \"UEFA Europa League.\" We confirm that all entries for the 2013-14 season are under this competition.\n\n3. **Check Round Information:**\n   - All relevant rows (5, 6, and 7) indicate participation in `group h`.\n\n4. **Identify Clubs Mentioned:**\n   - The claim lists three clubs: Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec.\n   - We check the \"club\" column for each row:\n     - Row 5: Club is `sevilla`\n     - Row 6: Club is `estoril`\n     - Row 7: Club is `slovan liberec`\n\n5. **Check Home/Away Status:**\n   - The claim does not specify home or away status, but we note:\n     - Row 5 has an away score (`0 - 2`).\n     - Row 6 has no scores filled (both `-`), indicating no match data.\n     - Row 7 has a home score (`2 - 2`).\n\n6. **Verify Club Involvement:**\n   - The table does not mention SC Freiburg at all in any of the rows for the 2013-14 season or otherwise.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"SC Freiburg play[ed] in the UEFA Europa League competition 3 times in 2013-14, all in the group H round against club Sevilla, Estoril, and Slovan Liberec.\" However, SC Freiburg is not mentioned anywhere in the table.

Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n- The lowest away score of `0 - 0` occurs on two occasions (1995 - 96 and 2001 - 02), which matches the claim.\n\nSince one part of the claim is false (the highest away score in 2001 - 02 is not `3 - 1`), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Highest away score in 2001 - 02:\n  - Row index 2, Column: `away`, Value: `0 - 0`\n  - Row index 3, Column: `away`, Value: `4 - 1`\n  - Row index 4, Column: `away`, Value: `0 - 1`\n\n- Lowest away score of 0 - 0:\n  - Row index 0, Column: `away`, Value: `0 - 0`\n  - Row index 1, Column: `away`, Value: `0 - 0`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The highest away score in the 2001 - 02 season is 4 - 1, not 3 - 1.
