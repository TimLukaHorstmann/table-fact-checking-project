Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Game:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the date \"march 8\" in the table.\n   - This row indicates a game where Washington played at home against Boston.\n\n2. **Check the Game Outcome:**\n   - In this row, the score is listed as \"1 - 2\", meaning Washington won.\n   - The decision was made by Huet (Washington's goaltender).\n\n3. **Verify Washington's Record After March 8 Game:**\n   - According to the table, after the March 8 game, Washington's record is \"32 - 29 - 8\".\n\n4. **Determine Boston's Record Before and After the March 8 Game:**\n   - The table does not directly provide Boston's record.\n   - However, we know that before the March 8 game, Washington had a record of \"31 - 28 - 8\".\n   - Since Washington won against Boston on March 8, their win count increased by one from 31 to 32.\n   - Therefore, Boston's loss count must have increased by one.\n\n5. **Calculate Boston's Record After the Game:**\n   - Before the game, if Boston had a record of \"x - y - z\", after losing to Washington, it would become \"x - (y+1) - z\".\n   - Since Washington's record was \"31 - 28 - 8\" before the game and became \"32 - 29 - 8\" after, Boston's losses increased by one.\n   - Therefore, if Washington's loss count increased from 28 to 29 due to this game, Boston's record must reflect a corresponding increase in their losses.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that after the March 8 game at home against Boston, Boston had a record of \"32 - 29 - 8\".\n   - This implies that Boston had 32 wins, 29 losses, and 8 ties/other outcomes before this game.\n   - Since Washington's loss count increased by one due to this game, it is consistent with the claim.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim about Boston's record after the March 8 game is logically consistent with the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row for March 8 where Washington played at home against Boston.
