Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points**: We need to focus on two specific columns: \"Record\" and \"Score\". The goal is to find entries that match both conditions: a record of \"18 - 8\" and a score of \"3 - 2\".\n\n2. **Check Each Entry**:\n   - Look through the table for each entry's record.\n   - For entries with a record of \"18 - 8\", check if the score is \"3 - 2\".\n\n3. **Locate May 11th Entry**:\n   - Find the entry for May 11th in the table and verify its record and score.\n\n4. **Verify Uniqueness**:\n   - Ensure that no other entries have both a record of \"18 - 8\" and a score of \"3 - 2\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If only the May 11th entry matches both conditions, the claim is true.\n   - If any other entry also matches these conditions, the claim is false.\n\nLet's apply this reasoning:\n\n- **May 11th**: The record is \"18 - 8\" and the score is \"3 - 2\".\n- Check all other entries for a record of \"18 - 8\":\n  - May 4: Record is \"16 - 7\", not relevant.\n  - May 5: Record is \"17 - 7\", not relevant.\n  - May 6: Record is \"18 - 7\", score is \"10 - 3\", not relevant.\n  - May 7: Record is \"18 - 8\", but the score is \"1 - 0\", not relevant.\n  - May 8: Record is \"19 - 8\", not relevant.\n  - May 9: Record is \"20 - 8\", not relevant.\n  - May 10: Record is \"21 - 8\", not relevant.\n\nNo other entries have both a record of \"18 - 8\" and a score of \"3 - 2\".\n\nThus, the claim is true.
