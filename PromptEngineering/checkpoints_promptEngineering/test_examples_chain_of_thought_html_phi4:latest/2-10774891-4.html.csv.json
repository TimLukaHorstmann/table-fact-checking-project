    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the VFL play at Victoria Park on 11 May 1957 is TRUE or FALSE, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - The claim mentions a venue, \"victoria park\". Therefore, we need to focus on the \"venue\" column in the table.\n\n2. **Check Each Row for the Venue:**\n   - We will examine each row under the \"venue\" column to see if any of them list \"victoria park\".\n\n3. **Verify the Date:**\n   - The claim specifies the date as 11 May 1957, so we need to ensure that any match found in the venue also corresponds to this date.\n\n4. **Locate the Match:**\n   - We will identify which row(s) have \"victoria park\" listed under the \"venue\" column and confirm if the \"date\" is 11 May 1957 for those rows.\n\n5. **Draw a Conclusion:**\n   - If there exists at least one match where both conditions (venue as \"victoria park\" and date as 11 May 1957) are satisfied, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Venue: \"glenferrie oval\", Date: 11 May 1957\n  - Not a match for venue.\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Venue: \"windy hill\", Date: 11 May 1957\n  - Not a match for venue.\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Venue: \"victoria park\", Date: 11 May 1957\n  - This row matches both the venue and date criteria.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Venue: \"princes park\", Date: 11 May 1957\n  - Not a match for venue.\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Venue: \"junction oval\", Date: 11 May 1957\n  - Not a match for venue.\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Venue: \"punt road oval\", Date: 11 May 1957\n  - Not a match for venue.\n\nSince Row 3 matches both the specified venue (\"victoria park\") and date (11 May 1957), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- Row index 2, Column name \"venue\": \"victoria park\"\n- Row index 2, Column name \"date\": \"11 may 1957\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked each row for a match in the 'venue' column with 'victoria park'.
