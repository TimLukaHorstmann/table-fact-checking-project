    "resp": "To determine whether the claim that \"the average time to complete the event be about 6.2 minutes\" is true or false, we need to calculate the average time of all the entries in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Extract Time Data**: \n   - Retrieve times from each row and convert them into a consistent unit (minutes) for calculation.\n   - The times listed are:\n     - Row 1: 5:36.20\n     - Row 2: 5:36.42\n     - Row 3: 5:39.18\n     - Row 4: 5:42.22\n     - Row 5: 6:00.98\n\n2. **Convert Times to Minutes**:\n   - Convert each time from the format \"minutes:seconds.centiseconds\" into total minutes.\n   - Conversion formula: Total Minutes = Minutes + (Seconds + Centiseconds/100) / 60.\n\n3. **Calculations**:\n   - Row 1: \\(5 + \\frac{36.20}{60} = 5.603333\\) minutes\n   - Row 2: \\(5 + \\frac{36.42}{60} = 5.607000\\) minutes\n   - Row 3: \\(5 + \\frac{39.18}{60} = 5.653000\\) minutes\n   - Row 4: \\(5 + \\frac{42.22}{60} = 5.703667\\) minutes\n   - Row 5: \\(6 + \\frac{00.98}{60} = 6.016333\\) minutes\n\n4. **Calculate the Average**:\n   - Sum of all times in minutes: \n     \\[\n     5.603333 + 5.607000 + 5.653000 + 5.703667 + 6.016333 = 28.583333\n     \\]\n   - Number of entries: 5\n   - Average time:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{28.583333}{5} = 5.7166666 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The calculated average time is approximately 5.72 minutes.\n   - The claim states an average of about 6.2 minutes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated average (5.72 minutes) does not match the claimed average (6.2 minutes).
