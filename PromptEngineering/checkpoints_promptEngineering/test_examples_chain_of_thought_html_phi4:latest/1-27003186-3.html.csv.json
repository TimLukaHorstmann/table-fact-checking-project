This indicates a stronger preference for Trump over Biden in Murrieta.\n\n2. **Net Shift Towards Biden**:\n   - The net shift towards Biden is -22.9%, suggesting that compared to previous elections or expectations, there was a significant decline in support for the Democratic candidate (Biden).\n\n3. **Third-party Preference and Undecided Voters**:\n   - While 9.2% of voters preferred third parties and 20.8% were undecided, these numbers do not indicate a strong preference towards Democrats.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBased on the data:\n- The majority support for Trump (48.8%) compared to Biden (25.3%) indicates a Republican leaning.\n- A negative net shift towards Biden (-22.9%) further supports this conclusion.\n- High percentages of third-party and undecided voters do not compensate for the strong preference shown for Trump.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nMurrieta does not have a strong Democratic party preference based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The population of Murrieta shows a higher percentage voting for Trump (48.8%) compared to Biden (25.3%).
