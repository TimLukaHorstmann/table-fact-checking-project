Game site: Mile High Stadium.\n- **Week 2**: The opponent was San Francisco 49ers. Game site: Mile High Stadium.\n- **Week 10**: The opponent was Seattle Seahawks. Game site: Mile High Stadium.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Attendance Figures\n\nNext, extract the attendance figures for these games:\n\n- **Week 1**: Attendance = 73,564\n- **Week 2**: Attendance = 73,899\n- **Week 10**: Attendance = 73,996\n\n### Step 3: Compare with Other Games at Mile High Stadium\n\nNow, compare these figures with other games played at Mile High Stadium:\n\n- **Week 12**: The opponent was Atlanta Falcons. Attendance = 73,984\n- **Week 14**: The opponent was Kansas City Chiefs. Attendance = 74,192\n\n### Step 4: Determine Lowest Attendances\n\nLet's list all attendances for games at Mile High Stadium and identify the lowest:\n\n1. Week 1: 73,564\n2. Week 2: 73,899\n3. Week 10: 73,996\n4. Week 12: 73,984\n5. Week 14: 74,192\n\nFrom this list, we can see that the lowest attendance was during **Week 1** (73,564). The next lowest is **Week 2** (73,899).\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"week 1, 2 and 10 be play with the lowest attendance at the mile high stadium.\" \n\n- Week 1 indeed has the lowest attendance.\n- Week 2 has the second-lowest attendance.\n- Week 10 does not have one of the lowest attendances; it has a higher figure than both Weeks 1 and 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis, the claim is **FALSE** because Week 10 does not have one of the lowest attendances at Mile High Stadium.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified games played at Mile High Stadium: Week 1 (73,564), Week 2 (73,899), Week 10 (73,996), Week 12 (73,984), and Week 14 (74,192).
