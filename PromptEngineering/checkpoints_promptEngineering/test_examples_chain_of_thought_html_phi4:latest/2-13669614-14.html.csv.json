    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the pitcher who set a record in the 7th inning be joel peralta robinson tejeda\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for any instances where the game extended to the 7th inning and identify the pitchers involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Row with 7th Inning:**\n   - We are looking for a row in the table where the \"inn\" column indicates the 7th inning.\n   \n2. **Examine Relevant Cell:**\n   - From the table, we find that the first row has the value \"7th\" under the \"inn\" column.\n\n3. **Check Pitchers Involved:**\n   - In this row, the \"pitcher\" column lists \"jim maloney (2) marshall bridges.\"\n   - This indicates that Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridges were the pitchers involved in the 7th inning of this game.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda set a record in the 7th inning.\n   - According to the table, the pitchers for the 7th inning are Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridges, not Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the pitchers listed in the claim do not match those in the row with the 7th inning, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row where the game extended to the 7th inning.\",\n    \"The first row has '7th' in the 'inn' column.\",\n    \"Check the pitchers involved in this inning: Jim Maloney (2) and Marshall Bridges are listed.\",\n    \"Compare these names with those in the claim: Joel Peralta and Robinson Tejeda.\",\n    \"The names do not match, so the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"inn\", \"value\": \"7th\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\", \"value\": \"jim maloney (2) marshall bridges\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
