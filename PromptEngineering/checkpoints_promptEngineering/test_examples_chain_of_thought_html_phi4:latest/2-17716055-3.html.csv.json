We need to find any row where this value is 51.\n\n2. **Check Losses for Teams with 51 Points:**\n   - For any team found in step 1, check the \"lost\" column to see if the number of losses is greater than 5.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there are no teams with exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Look at the \"points 1\" column:\n  - Row 3 (Clitheroe) has 51 points.\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the \"lost\" column for Clitheroe:\n  - Clitheroe has lost 5 games.\n\nSince Clitheroe is the only team with 51 points and it does not have more than 5 losses, there are no teams that meet both criteria specified in the claim.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim \"there have be no player drawn with 1 of 51 point and a number of loss larger than 5\" is true because no team has exactly 51 points and more than 5 losses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify teams with 51 points in the 'points 1' column.
