The match on this date took place at \"Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile.\" Therefore, there is no relevant 2011 qualification match in Bolivia.\n\n3. **Locate the 2013 Match:**\n   - On \"15 October 2013,\" there was a match at \"Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile\" with a score of \"2 - 0\" and a final result of \"2 - 1.\" This is relevant for comparison as it's part of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\n4. **Compare Scores:**\n   - Since there is no match in Bolivia during the 2011 World Cup qualification, we cannot compare any score from such a match.\n   - The 2013 match had a final result of \"2 - 1,\" meaning the winning team scored 2 points.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that more points were scored by the winning team in the 2011 qualification match in Bolivia than in the 2013 match.\n   - Since there is no 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia, it's impossible for any team to have scored more points in such a non-existent match compared to the 2 points scored in the 2013 match.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because there was no relevant 2011 match in Bolivia to compare against the 2013 match.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to a 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia, but there is no such match recorded in the table.
