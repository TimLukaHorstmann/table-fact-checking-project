    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true, we need to analyze the data provided in the table carefully.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim states that \"bridgenorth have the highest number of wins in the NTFA Div with 15 wins and only 3 losses.\"\n   - We need to verify two parts:\n     a. Bridgenorth has 15 wins.\n     b. Bridgenorth's win count is the highest among all teams listed.\n     c. Bridgenorth has 3 losses.\n\n2. **Locate Bridgenorth in the Table:**\n   - Search for \"bridgenorth\" in the first column labeled \"ntfa div 1.\"\n   - Find that it appears in the first row of the table.\n\n3. **Verify Wins and Losses for Bridgenorth:**\n   - In the row where \"bridgenorth\" is listed:\n     - The \"wins\" column shows 15.\n     - The \"losses\" column shows 3.\n   - This confirms that Bridgenorth has 15 wins and 3 losses, as stated in the claim.\n\n4. **Check for Highest Number of Wins:**\n   - Look at the \"wins\" column for all teams to verify if any team has more than 15 wins:\n     - bridgenorth: 15\n     - rocherlea: 13\n     - bracknell: 12\n     - george town: 9\n     - scottsdale: 8\n     - deloraine: 6\n     - longford: 5\n     - hillwood: 1\n   - No team has more than 15 wins; thus, Bridgenorth indeed has the highest number of wins.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the data from the table, all parts of the claim are verified to be true. Bridgenorth has the highest number of wins (15) and only 3 losses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified the relevant columns for verifying the number of wins and losses for Bridgenorth: 'wins' and 'losses'.
