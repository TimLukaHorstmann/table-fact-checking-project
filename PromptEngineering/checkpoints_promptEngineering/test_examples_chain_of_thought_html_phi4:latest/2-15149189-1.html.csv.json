    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"prop Steve Borthwick be Leicester's best-known player in that position\" is true or false, we need to analyze the information provided in the table regarding players' positions and their respective teams.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to determine if Steve Borthwick played as a \"prop\" for Leicester.\n   - Verify if there are other players listed who also played as a prop for Leicester.\n   - Compare any additional context or information that might suggest the prominence of a player in their position.\n\n2. **Locate Steve Borthwick's Details:**\n   - Steve Borthwick is listed in row 1 with \"prop\" as his position and \"Bath\" as his club (not Leicester).\n\n3. **Check for Other Props at Leicester:**\n   - We need to identify players who played as props specifically for Leicester.\n   - Review the table for any entries where the position is \"prop\" and the club is \"Leicester.\"\n\n4. **Analyze the Table for Relevant Players:**\n   - No player in the table is listed with both \"prop\" as their position and \"Leicester\" as their club.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Steve Borthwick was not a Leicester prop, and no other players are listed as props for Leicester, we cannot confirm that he or anyone else from Leicester was best known in that position.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is false because Steve Borthwick was associated with Bath, not Leicester, and there are no props listed for Leicester in the table.
