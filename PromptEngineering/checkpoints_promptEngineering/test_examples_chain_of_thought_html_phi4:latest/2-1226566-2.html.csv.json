Therefore, we need external knowledge to verify if Satoru Nakajima drove for Tyrrell Racing Organisation.\n\n3. **External Verification:**\n   - Historically, Satoru Nakajima drove for the Tyrrell team during 1987-1991.\n   - He indeed drove for Tyrrell in 1987 and 1990.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"tyrrell racing organisation be the only entrant tohat satoru nakajima drive for 2 time.\"\n   - Based on external knowledge, Satoru Nakajima drove for Tyrrell in 1987 and 1990.\n   - The table confirms Tyrrell Racing Organisation's presence in 1990 (rows 4 and 5).\n   - We need to check if there is any other entrant that had Satoru Nakajima as a driver twice. Based on historical records, he did not drive for any other team more than once.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Tyrrell Racing Organisation is the only entrant listed in the table for which Satoru Nakajima drove more than once.\n   - The claim is true based on the combination of table data and external verification.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

The goal is to verify if \"camel team lotus honda\" earned the lowest amount of points in 1987 compared to any other entrant and year.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Points Earned by 'Camel Team Lotus Honda'**\n   - In 1987, \"camel team lotus honda\" earned 7 points.\n   - In 1988, the same team earned 1 point.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Entrants in the Same Year (1987)**\n   - Only one entry exists for 1987: \"camel team lotus honda\" with 7 points. No other entrant is listed for this year.\n\n3. **Evaluate Points for All Years and Entrants**\n   - For 1988, \"camel team lotus honda\" earned 1 point.\n   - In 1989, \"camel team lotus\" earned 3 points.\n   - In 1990, \"tyrrell racing organisation\" earned 3 points in both entries (row indices 4 and 5).\n   - In 1991, \"braun tyrrell honda\" earned 2 points.\n\n4. **Determine the Lowest Points Earned Across All Entries**\n   - The lowest point total across all years and entrants is 1 point, achieved by \"camel team lotus honda\" in 1988.\n\n5. **Conclusion**\n   - Since \"camel team lotus honda\" earned more than 1 point in 1987 (they earned 7 points), they did not earn the lowest amount of points in that year. The lowest was actually 1 point, achieved by them in a different year (1988).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'camel team lotus honda' earned the lowest points in 1987.
