    "resp": "To determine if the claim about Olivier Panis being the only driver disqualified from the 1998 Brazilian Grand Prix is true or false, we need to examine the relevant part of the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement claims that Olivier Panis was the only driver disqualified in this race.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: We must look at the \"time / retired\" column because disqualifications are typically noted there, alongside other reasons for retirement such as technical failures or accidents.\n\n3. **Scan the Table**:\n   - Go through each row and check the \"time / retired\" column for any mention of \"disqualified.\"\n\n4. **Check Each Row for Disqualification**:\n   - Mika H\u00e4kkinen: Time/Retired is `1:37:11.747` (not disqualified).\n   - David Coulthard: Time/Retired is `+ 1.102` (not disqualified).\n   - Michael Schumacher: Time/Retired is `+ 1:00.550` (not disqualified).\n   - Alexander Wurz: Time/Retired is `+ 1:07.453` (not disqualified).\n   - Heinz-Harald Frentzen: Time/Retired is `+ 1 lap` (not disqualified).\n   - Giancarlo Fisichella: Time/Retired is `+ 1 lap` (not disqualified).\n   - Jacques Villeneuve: Time/Retired is `+ 1 lap` (not disqualified).\n   - Eddie Irvine: Time/Retired is `+ 1 lap` (not disqualified).\n   - Jean Alesi: Time/Retired is `+ 1 lap` (not disqualified).\n   - Jan Magnussen: Time/Retired is `+ 2 laps` (not disqualified).\n   - Johnny Herbert: Time/Retired is `physical` (not disqualified).\n   - **Damon Hill**: Time/Retired is `disqualified` (one instance of disqualification).\n   - Olivier Panis: Time/Retired is `engine` (not disqualified).\n   - Rubens Barrichello: Time/Retired is `gearbox` (not disqualified).\n   - Ricardo Rosset: Time/Retired is `gearbox` (not disqualified).\n   - Esteban Tuero: Time/Retired is `throttle` (not disqualified).\n   - Pedro Diniz: Time/Retired is `gearbox` (not disqualified).\n   - Toranosuke Takagi: Time/Retired is `engine` (not disqualified).\n   - Mika Salo: Time/Retired is `engine` (not disqualified).\n   - Jarno Trulli: Time/Retired is `fuel pump` (not disqualified).\n   - Shinji Nakano: Time/Retired is `spun off` (not disqualified).\n   - Ralf Schumacher: Time/Retired is `spun off` (not disqualified).\n\n5. **Conclude**: The table shows that Damon Hill, not Olivier Panis, was the only driver disqualified.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Olivier Panis was the only driver disqualified from the race. Upon examining the 'time / retired' column in the table, we found that Damon Hill is listed as disqualified, not Olivier Panis. Therefore, the statement is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
