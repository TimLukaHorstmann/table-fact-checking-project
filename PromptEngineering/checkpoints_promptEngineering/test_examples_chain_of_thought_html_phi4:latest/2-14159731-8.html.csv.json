This helps us narrow down to the specific entry we are interested in verifying.\n\n3. **Check Visitor for March 6:**\n   - Once we identify the correct row, check the value under the \"visitor\" column.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row corresponding to \"March 6\":\n       - Date: \"march 6\"\n       - Visitor: \"montreal\"\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - The claim states that \"Montreal be the visitor on March 6\".\n   - As per the table data for March 6, the visitor is indeed listed as \"montreal\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The information from the table confirms that Montreal was the visitor on March 6.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row with date \"march 6\":\n  - Column \"date\": Value \"march 6\"\n  - Column \"visitor\": Value \"montreal\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was checked for the entry corresponding to March 6.
