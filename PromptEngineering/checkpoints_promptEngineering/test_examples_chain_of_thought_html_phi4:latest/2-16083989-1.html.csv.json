    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about \"Proteus mirabilis having a negative Voges-Proskauer reading\" is true or false, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Proteus mirabilis:**\n   - The table contains multiple species, each represented in its own row.\n   - Locate the row where \"Proteus mirabilis\" is listed as the species.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Column:**\n   - Once the row for \"Proteus mirabilis\" is identified, find the column labeled \"voges-proskauer.\"\n\n3. **Check the Value in the Identified Cell:**\n   - Check what value (positive or negative) is recorded under the \"voges-proskauer\" column for the row corresponding to \"Proteus mirabilis.\"\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Proteus mirabilis have a negative voges-proskauer reading.\"\n   - Compare this statement against what is found in step 3.\n\n5. **Determine Truthfulness of the Claim:**\n   - If the value is indeed \"negative,\" then the claim is true.\n   - If it is anything other than \"negative,\" the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. Locate \"Proteus mirabilis\" in the species column:\n   - It is found in the sixth row (considering 0-based indexing).\n\n2. Identify the \"voges-proskauer\" column:\n   - This is the third column after \"species,\" so we look at the value in the third column of the sixth row.\n\n3. Check the value for Voges-Proskauer for Proteus mirabilis:\n   - In the sixth row under the \"voges-proskauer\" column, the value is \"negative.\"\n\n4. Compare with the Claim:\n   - The claim states that \"Proteus mirabilis have a negative voges-proskauer reading,\" which matches what we found in step 3.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Since the actual value in the table for \"voges-proskauer\" is \"negative\" for Proteus mirabilis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cell:**\n- The relevant cell to check is at row index 6 (Proteus mirabilis) and column name \"voges - proskauer.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row for 'Proteus mirabilis' in the table, locate the 'voges-proskauer' column, check the value in that cell (negative), compare it to the claim which states it is negative, confirming the claim is true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"voges - proskauer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
