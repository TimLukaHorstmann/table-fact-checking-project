The entry here is \"w 65 - 20\".\n   - The \"w\" indicates a win, and \"65 - 20\" matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since all parts of the claim are verified as correct (week number, date, result type 'win', and the exact score), the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 7, Column \"date\": \"november 13 , 1949\"\n- Row 7, Column \"result\": \"w 65 - 20\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to week 8 on November 13, 1949.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true, we need to verify if there is a result of \"w 65 - 20\" after week 9 on November 13, 1949.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Week and Date**: \n   - The claim specifies \"after week 9 on November 13, 1949.\" Therefore, we need to look at entries with a `week` value greater than 9 or the same week if it occurs after November 13.\n\n2. **Locate Entries After Week 9**:\n   - From the table, weeks are sequentially numbered from 1 to 12. We focus on weeks 10, 11, and 12 as they occur after week 9.\n\n3. **Check for Result \"w 65 - 20\"**:\n   - For each of these weeks (10, 11, and 12), we need to check the `result` column to see if it matches \"w 65 - 20\".\n\n4. **Review Week 8**:\n   - Although week 8 is not after week 9, let's verify it since the date mentioned in the claim (November 13, 1949) corresponds to week 8.\n   - In week 8, the `result` column shows \"w 65 - 20\" and the `date` is November 13, 1949.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The result \"w 65 - 20\" indeed exists in the table on November 13, 1949, which corresponds to week 8. However, since the claim specifies \"after week 9,\" this entry does not meet that condition.\n   - Therefore, there is no result of \"w 65 - 20\" after week 9.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a result 'w 65 - 20' after week 9 on November 13, 1949. Checking the table, this result occurs in week 8. Since the claim requires it to be after week 9, and no such result exists for weeks 10, 11, or 12, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
