    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Manchester City and Aalborg BK be the only team to win without going to penalty\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table and check for instances where a team won on aggregate score without proceeding to a penalty shootout.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand Aggregate Score**:\n   - The \"agg\" column shows the aggregate score of two legs combined.\n   - A team wins if it has a higher aggregate score than its opponent at the end of both legs, excluding any tiebreaker like penalties or away goals rule.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Penalty Shootouts**:\n   - Typically, penalty shootouts occur when teams are tied on aggregate and extra time does not resolve the tie.\n   - Indicators in the table: \"p\" stands for penalty shootout, and \"aet\" means after extra time (usually a precursor to penalties if still tied).\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Werder Bremen vs Saint-\u00c9tienne\n     - Aggregate: 3 - 2\n     - No indicators of penalties or extra time; thus, no penalty shootout.\n   \n   - **Row 2**: CSKA Moscow vs Shakhtar Donetsk\n     - Aggregate: 1 - 2\n     - No penalties mentioned; Shakhtar won without penalties.\n   \n   - **Row 3**: Udinese vs Zenit St. Petersburg\n     - Aggregate: 2 - 1\n     - No penalties or extra time indicators; Udinese won outright.\n\n   - **Row 4**: Paris Saint-Germain vs Braga\n     - Aggregate: 1 - 0\n     - No mention of extra time or penalties; PSG won without penalties.\n   \n   - **Row 5**: Dynamo Kyiv vs Metalist Kharkiv\n     - Aggregate with away goals rule (\"a\"): 3 - 3 (a)\n     - Away goals apply here, but no penalty indication.\n\n   - **Row 6**: Manchester City vs Aalborg BK\n     - Aggregate: 2 - 2 (4 - 3 p)\n     - \"p\" indicates a penalty shootout; Manchester City won via penalties.\n   \n   - **Row 7**: Marseille vs Ajax\n     - Aggregate: 4 - 3\n     - No mention of penalties, just extra time (\"aet\"); Marseille won without penalties.\n\n   - **Row 8**: Hamburg vs Galatasaray\n     - Aggregate: 4 - 3\n     - No penalty indication; Hamburg won outright.\n   \n4. **Identify Teams Winning Without Penalties**:\n   - Teams that won without going to penalties are: Werder Bremen, Shakhtar Donetsk, Udinese, Paris Saint-Germain, Dynamo Kyiv (via away goals rule), Marseille, and Hamburg.\n\n5. **Conclusion about the Claim**:\n   - The claim states Manchester City and Aalborg BK as the only teams winning without penalties.\n   - From our analysis, multiple teams won without penalties: Werder Bremen, Shakhtar Donetsk, Udinese, Paris Saint-Germain, Dynamo Kyiv (away goals), Marseille, Hamburg.\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are several other teams besides Manchester City and Aalborg BK that won without going to a penalty shootout.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"I analyzed the table for matches where the aggregate score indicated a win without needing penalties.
