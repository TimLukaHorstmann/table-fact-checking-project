    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Taylor Beck be pick 2 place before Ryan Howse\" is true, we need to analyze their draft positions based on the provided data.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Positions:**\n   - Locate Taylor Beck's row in the table and note his pick number.\n   - Locate Ryan Howse's row in the table and note his pick number.\n\n2. **Compare Pick Numbers:**\n   - Compare the draft positions of Taylor Beck and Ryan Howse to see if Taylor was indeed selected before Ryan.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - If Taylor Beck's pick number is lower than Ryan Howse's, then he was picked earlier, which makes the claim true.\n   - Otherwise, the claim would be false.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1. **Locate Relevant Rows:**\n   - From the data:\n     - Taylor Beck is listed with \"Pick # 63\".\n     - Ryan Howse is listed with \"Pick # 80\".\n\n2. **Comparison of Pick Numbers:**\n   - Taylor Beck's pick number (63) is less than Ryan Howse's pick number (80).\n\n3. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Since Taylor Beck was picked at a lower number, he was indeed selected before Ryan Howse.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Taylor Beck has Pick # 63 and Ryan Howse has Pick # 80.
