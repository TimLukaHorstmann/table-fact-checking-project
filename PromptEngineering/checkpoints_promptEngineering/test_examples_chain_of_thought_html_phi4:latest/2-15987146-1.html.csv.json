This implies:\n   - We are looking for the game in Week 14 (since it is the week after Week 13).\n   - The result should be a win.\n   - The score should be 24-21.\n\n2. **Identify Week 14's Entry**: \n   - From the table, locate the row corresponding to \"week\" 14.\n\n3. **Check the Result for Week 14**:\n   - In Week 14, check if the result is a win.\n   - The column labeled \"result\" shows the outcome of the game (e.g., \"w 24 - 7\").\n\n4. **Verify the Score for Week 14**:\n   - Confirm that the score in the result matches \"24-21\".\n\n5. **Draw Conclusion**: \n   - If both conditions are met, the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n1. **Locate Week 14**:\n   - The row for Week 14 has:\n     - Date: December 7, 1992\n     - Opponent: Chicago Bears\n     - Result: w 24 - 7\n     - Attendance: 62193\n\n2. **Check the Result and Score**:\n   - The result is a win (\"w\"), but the score is 24-7, not 24-21.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the score does not match 24-21, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for this determination are from Week 14:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to week 14.\",\n    \"Check if the result column indicates a win.\",\n    \"Verify that the score in the result matches '24 - 21'.\",\n    \"Conclude based on whether both conditions are met.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
