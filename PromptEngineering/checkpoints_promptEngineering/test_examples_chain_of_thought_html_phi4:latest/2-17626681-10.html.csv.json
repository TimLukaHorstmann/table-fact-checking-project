    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the attendance figures for Manchester United FC's games in the 2008-09 season is true, we need to analyze the data provided in the table. The claim states that \"the final round have higher attendance than any other game list.\" We will examine each row of the table and compare the attendance numbers.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Attendance Values:**\n   - Extract the attendance values from each row in the table.\n   \n2. **Compare Each Game's Attendance to Others:**\n   - The final round game (27 May 2009) has an attendance of 62,467.\n   - Compare this number with all other games listed:\n     - First knockout round first leg (24 February 2009): 80,018\n     - First knockout round second leg (11 March 2009): 74,769\n     - Quarter-final first leg (7 April 2009): 74,517\n     - Quarter-final second leg (15 April 2009): 50,010\n     - Semi-final first leg (29 April 2009): 74,733\n     - Semi-final second leg (5 May 2009): 59,867\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Attendance:**\n   - The highest attendance is for the \"first knockout round first leg\" game on 24 February 2009 with 80,018 attendees.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Comparison:**\n   - Since the final round (27 May 2009) has an attendance of 62,467 and there are other games with higher attendances, specifically the first knockout round first leg with 80,018, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Final round: Attendance = 62,467 (Row index: 6, Column name: \"attendance\")\n- First knockout round first leg: Attendance = 80,018 (Row index: 0, Column name: \"attendance\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The attendance for the final game on 27 May 2009 was 62,467.
