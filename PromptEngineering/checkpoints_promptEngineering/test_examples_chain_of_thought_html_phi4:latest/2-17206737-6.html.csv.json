    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"less than 17132 crowd be in attendance for only 4 of the game\" is true or false, we need to analyze the 'attendance' column in the table and count how many entries have an attendance number less than 17,132.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column:**\n   - The relevant column for this claim is \"attendance\".\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - We will extract the attendance numbers from each row in the table:\n     - December 2: 21,273\n     - December 4: 21,273\n     - December 6: 21,273\n     - December 9: 21,273\n     - December 11: 21,273\n     - December 13: 21,273\n     - December 16: 16,434\n     - December 18: 21,273\n     - December 20: 21,273\n     - December 21: 21,273\n     - December 27: 17,132\n     - December 29: 20,741\n     - December 30: 20,454\n\n3. **Count Attendance Less Than 17132:**\n   - Compare each attendance number with 17,132:\n     - December 2: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 4: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 6: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 9: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 11: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 13: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - **December 16: 16,434 (less than 17,132)**\n     - December 18: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 20: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 21: 21,273 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 27: 17,132 (equal to 17,132, not less)\n     - December 29: 20,741 (not less than 17,132)\n     - December 30: 20,454 (not less than 17,132)\n\n4. **Determine the Count:**\n   - Only one game has an attendance of less than 17,132, which is on December 16.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there are \"only 4\" games with attendance less than 17,132.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"over 40 points were scored for at least 5 games\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of the Table**: The table provides details about hockey games involving the Montreal Canadiens as either home or visitor. Each row corresponds to a game with columns showing date, visitor team, score, home team, decision (which goalie was used), attendance, record before and after the game, and points.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**:\n   - The column named \"score\" contains information about the number of goals scored by each team in a particular game. \n   - We need to check this column for every row where Montreal Canadiens were either home or visitor (as the claim is related to games involving them).\n\n3. **Interpret the Score Column**:\n   - The score format \"X - Y\" indicates Montreal Canadiens' goals as X if they are listed in the \"home\" column, otherwise Y.\n   - Similarly, when listed under \"visitor\", the first number represents their goals.\n\n4. **Count Games with Over 40 Points**: \n   - We need to calculate the total points scored in each game and check how many games have more than 40 total points (i.e., sum of both teams' scores).\n\n5. **Evaluate Each Game**:\n   - December 2: Score is \"4 - 5\". Total points = 4 + 5 = 9.\n   - December 4: Score is \"2 - 6\". Total points = 2 + 6 = 8.\n   - December 6: Score is \"2 - 1 ot\". Total points = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - December 9: Score is \"1 - 4\". Total points = 1 + 4 = 5.\n   - December 11: Score is \"3 - 1\". Total points = 3 + 1 = 4.\n   - December 13: Score is \"2 - 1\". Total points = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - December 16: Score is \"2 - 3\". Total points = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - December 18: Score is \"2 - 5\". Total points = 2 + 5 = 7.\n   - December 20: Score is \"3 - 4 ot\".

Total points = 5 + 2 = 7.\n   - December 30: Score is \"2 - 1 so\". Total points = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n6. **Determine Games with More Than 40 Points**: \n   - None of the games have a total score exceeding 9, which means no game had over 40 points scored in total.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are zero games with more than 40 points, it is impossible for at least five games to exceed this threshold.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"over 40 point be score for at least 5 game\" is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we evaluated each row in the 'score' column to calculate total points scored in each game.
