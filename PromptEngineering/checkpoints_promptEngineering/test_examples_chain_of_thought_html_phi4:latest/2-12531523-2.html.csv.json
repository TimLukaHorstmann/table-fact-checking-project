This matches our search criterion.\n\n5. **Verify the Total for the Year 1976:**\n   - Check the `total` column in the same row where the year is 1976.\n   - The value in the `total` column for this row is 154.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the player who won in 1976 has a total score of 154, the claim \"the win total from 1976 be 154\" is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows with 'year (s) won' including 1976.
