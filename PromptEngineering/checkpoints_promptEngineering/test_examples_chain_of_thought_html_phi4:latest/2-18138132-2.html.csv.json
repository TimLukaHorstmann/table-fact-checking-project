    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each part of it against the table:\n\n1. **Identify the App**: \n   - The claim mentions \"window live messenger\". We will look for a title that matches or is very similar.\n\n2. **Verify Developer**:\n   - The claim states it was made by \"microsoft\".\n\n3. **Check Version Number**:\n   - The version number mentioned in the claim is \"version 14\".\n\n4. **Confirm Release Date**:\n   - The release date given is \"2010 - 11 - 17\".\n\n5. **Verify Category**:\n   - The category should be \"social networking\".\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table:\n\n1. **Find \"window live messenger\" in the Title Column**:\n   - In row 16, we find the title \"windows live messenger\".\n\n2. **Check Developer for \"windows live messenger\"**:\n   - In row 16, under the developer column, it lists \"microsoft\", which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Version Number for \"windows live messenger\"**:\n   - In row 16, the version is listed as \"1.4\". The claim states \"version 14\", which does not match (1.4 vs. 14).\n\n4. **Confirm Release Date for \"windows live messenger\"**:\n   - In row 16, the release date is \"2010 - 11 - 17\", which matches the claim.\n\n5. **Verify Category for \"windows live messenger\"**:\n   - In row 16, the category is listed as \"social networking\", matching the claim.\n\nBased on these checks, the only discrepancy is with the version number. The table lists version 1.4, while the claim states version 14.
