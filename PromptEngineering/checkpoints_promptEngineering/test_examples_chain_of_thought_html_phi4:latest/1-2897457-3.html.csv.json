According to the data, this is at `row_index` 58.\n\n4. **Check Positions for All Players**:\n   - For each player, check if more than one position is listed.\n   - The claim specifically mentions John Brill as the only such case, so we need to verify that no other players have multiple positions listed.\n\n5. **Analyze John Brill's Entry**:\n   - John Brill is listed with `position`: \"left / right wing\", which indicates he plays two positions.\n\n6. **Verify Other Players**:\n   - Go through each player entry in the table and check their position.\n   - Only one other player, Rob Zamuner at `row_index` 45, has a position of \"left wing\" without any indication of playing more than one position (like \"center / left wing\").\n   - No other entries in the table list multiple positions for any player.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - John Brill is indeed the only player listed with two positions (\"left / right wing\").\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"john brill be the only player on the list who play 2 position\" is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"50% of the player draft 43 - 63 in 1989 be male\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the information provided in the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that 50% of players drafted between picks 43 and 63 are male.\n   - This implies that out of the total number of players listed from pick 43 to pick 63, half should be male.\n\n2. **Count Total Players in Range 43-63**:\n   - Review each row in the table from pick 43 to pick 63.\n   - Count the total number of players listed within this range.\n\n3. **Evaluate Gender Information**:\n   - The table does not explicitly provide gender information for any player.\n   - However, hockey is a sport traditionally played by males at the professional level (NHL), so we can assume all listed players are male unless otherwise specified.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage**:\n   - If all players in the range are assumed to be male due to the nature of the sport, then 100% of the players from pick 43 to pick 63 are male.\n   - Compare this percentage (100%) with the claim (50%).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 100% is greater than 50%, the claim that \"50% of the player draft 43 - 63 in 1989 be male\" holds true.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - All rows from pick 43 to pick 63 are relevant as they contain the players being evaluated.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that 50% of players drafted between picks 43 and 63 are male.\",\n    \"Count the total number of players listed from pick 43 to pick 63 in the table.\",\n    \"The table does not provide explicit gender information, but hockey is traditionally a male sport at this level.\",\n    \"Assume all players in the range are male, resulting in 100% being male.\",\n    \"Since 100% > 50%, the claim holds true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
