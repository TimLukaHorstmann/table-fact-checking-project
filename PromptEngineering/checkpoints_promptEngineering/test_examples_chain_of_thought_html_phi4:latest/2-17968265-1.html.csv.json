    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. Identify if there is a team that played 114 matches and accumulated 107 points.\n2. Check if any team scored exactly 31 points during the 1987 - 88 season.\n\nLet's examine these step-by-step using the table provided:\n\n### Step 1: Check for a Team with 114 Played Matches and 107 Points\n\n- We look at each row in the \"played\" column to see which teams have played 114 matches.\n- For each of those, we check the corresponding value in the \"points\" column to see if it equals 107.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- **Ferro Carril Oeste** is a team with 114 matches played and exactly 107 points scored.\n\n### Step 2: Check for a Team with 31 Points in the 1987 - 88 Season\n\n- We examine the \"1987 - 88\" column to find any entry that equals 31.\n- If such an entry exists, we note the corresponding team.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- **Racing de C\u00f3rdoba** scored exactly 31 points during the 1987 - 88 season.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n1. Ferro Carril Oeste played 114 matches and accumulated 107 points.\n2.
