    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Place Ville Marie was the tallest building for the least amount of years\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data related to the number of years each building held the title of the tallest.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the column \"years as tallest,\" which tells us how long each building was the tallest.\n   - Additionally, the \"of years as tallest\" column provides a numerical value for clarity on those durations.\n\n2. **Extract and Compare Years of Tallest Status:**\n   - Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years (1829-1928)\n   - Royal Bank Building: 3 years (1928-1931)\n   - Sun Life Building: 31 years (1931-1962)\n   - Tour CIBC: Less than 1 year in 1962\n   - Place Ville Marie: 2 years (1962-1964)\n   - Tour de la Bourse: 28 years (1964-1992)\n   - 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years current (1992-present)\n\n3. **Determine the Shortest Duration:**\n   - Tour CIBC held the title for less than 1 year, which is the shortest duration among all buildings listed.\n\n4. **Compare with Place Ville Marie:**\n   - Place Ville Marie was the tallest for 2 years.\n   - Since Tour CIBC held the record for a shorter period (less than 1 year), Place Ville Marie does not have the least amount of time as the tallest building.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because another building, Tour CIBC, held the title for less time than Place Ville Marie.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates that Tour CIBC was the tallest building for less than 1 year, which is shorter than the 2 years Place Ville Marie was the tallest.
