    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 4 games were held in the 1940s\" is true, let's follow a logical step-by-step approach using the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Time Period:**\n   - The 1940s refers to the years from 1940 to 1949 inclusive.\n\n2. **Examine the Table for Entries in the 1940s:**\n   - We need to look at each row and identify if any events were held during these specific years.\n\n3. **Review Each Relevant Row:**\n   - The table is structured with rows representing different events, identified by year, driver(s), category, and event name.\n   - Check the \"year\" column for entries between 1940 to 1949 inclusive.\n\n4. **Locate Entries in the 1940s:**\n   - Scan through each row's year to see if it falls within the 1940s range:\n     - There is no entry from 1940 to 1948.\n     - The first relevant event is in 1949 with Luigi Villoresi, under \"grand prix,\" and named \"xxii coppa acerbo.\"\n\n5. **Count the Number of Events:**\n   - Based on the review, only one event was held in the year 1949.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is only one entry for an event in the 1940s (in 1949), the claim that \"only 4 games were held in the 1940s\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe table confirms that there was only 1 game held during the 1940s, not four. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the time range for the 1940s (1940-1949). Then, examine each row of the table to find entries within this range. The only entry found is in 1949, resulting in a total count of one event during the decade. Thus, the claim that 'only 4 games were held in the 1940s' is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
