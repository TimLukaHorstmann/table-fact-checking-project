Here's how we can logically approach this task:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement asserts that Keiko Tamia did not have any losses beyond her second fight.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We are interested in the columns \"Result,\" \"Opponent,\" and potentially \"Round\" (though it's only labeled explicitly for some entries).\n   - We need to check all results from after her 2nd round (i.e., starting from the third fight).\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Each row represents a fight, with the first column implicitly numbering them sequentially.\n   - The \"Result\" column will indicate wins or losses.\n\n4. **Locate Keiko Tamia's Record**:\n   - From the table, we observe that Keiko Tamia\u2019s fight history starts at the 19th entry and ends at the 27th entry.\n\n5. **Analyze Fights After the Second Round**:\n   - Her third fight is in row 21 (against Yuuki Kondo).\n   - We need to examine her results from this point onward until the last recorded fight against Etsuko Kato.\n\n6. **Check Results for Losses**:\n   - Fight 3: Result is \"Loss\" against Yuuki Kondo.\n   - Subsequent fights after this (rows 22 through 27) have all been wins, as indicated by the \"Result\" column.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Keiko Tamia did lose in her third fight. Therefore, she had at least one loss after the second round.\n\n8. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the claim is false because there was a loss recorded after the 2nd round.\n\nHere's how this reasoning translates into the JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Keiko Tamia didn't lose any fights after her second.
