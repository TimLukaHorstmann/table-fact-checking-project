We can do this by looking at the \"data\" column in the table, which contains a list of games. Each game is represented as an array with 5 elements.\n\n3. The first element of each game's array represents the name of the team playing in that game. We need to find the team that corresponds to the 4th and 6th positions on the list.\n\n4. Looking at the table, we can see that the 4th position is \"lprc oilers\" (team 1: lprc oilers) and the 6th position is \"port autonome\".\n\n5. Next, we need to extract the scores from each game's array to compare their values.\n\n6. For the 4th game, we have a score of \"2 - 3\". We can convert this into an integer by splitting it at the \"-\" and subtracting the first value from the second: (int)(5) - int(3) = 2.\n\n7. For the 6th game, we have a score of \"0 - 0\". We can convert this into an integer in the same way: ((int)(1)) - (int)(0) = 1.\n\n8. Comparing these scores, we see that the 4th game has a higher value than the 6th game.\n\n9.

Therefore, these are the two relevant teams to compare.\n\n#### Step 3: Extract the agg values for the relevant teams\nFind the agg value for the team 1 \"Saint - Louis FC\" in the table.\n- The agg value is \"2 - 7\".\n\nFind the agg value for the team 2 \"Eleven Arrows FC\" in the table.\n- The agg value is \"4 - 0\".\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the combined agg value\nCalculate the combined agg value by adding the agg values of both teams.\nCombined agg = \"2 - 7\" + \"4 - 0\"\nSince we need to compare the combined agg with other games, it would be helpful to convert these into a numerical format. Let's convert them.\n\nFor \"2 - 7\", first extract the numbers: 2 and 7.
