Locate the row that contains \"24 january 1976\" as the value in the \"date\" column.\n3. Check if there are any other rows with a similar date but different values in the other columns.\n4. If there is only one row with this specific date, then check if it is a replay match by looking for the presence of a \"replay\" string in either the home team, away team, or score column.\n5. If there are multiple rows with the same date, but not all of them are replay matches, then the claim is FALSE.\n6. Check the value in the score column to see if it contains a \"-\" separator (indicating a tie) or a \"/\" separator (indicating a match).\n7.

We need to convert this to a numerical value.\n- For Crystal Palace: The score is \"0 - 1\" in row 14. We also need to convert this to a numerical value.\n\n### Step 2: Convert scores to numerical values\nWe will use the following conversion rules:\n- If the score is of the form \"x - y\", where x and y are numbers, then we consider it as `x+y`.\n- So for Chelsea's score, 0 - 2 = 0+2 = 2.\n- For Crystal Palace's score, 0 - 1 = 0+1 = 1.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the scores\nNow that we have both scores in numerical values (2 and 1), we can compare them to see if Chelsea scored double than Crystal Palace. However, since the claim states \"double\", it should be interpreted as Chelsea's score is twice of Crystal Palace's score.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the answer based on comparison\nSince 2 is not equal to 1 (and it certainly does not imply that Chelsea scored twice as many goals), we will need to check if one of them was zero for their respective scores, because \"double\" could also mean 0.\n\n- For Crystal Palace's score, which is 1.\n- For Chelsea's score, which is 2.\n\nAs both scores are greater than 0 and not equal to each other, the claim that \"the number of goal scored by chelsea be double that score by crystal palace\" cannot be true.\n\n### Step 5: List relevant cells\nThe relevant cells for this problem would be:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 15,\n        \"column_name\": \"tie no\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 14,\n        \"column_name\": \"tie no\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 15,\n        \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 14,\n        \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim cannot be true since Chelsea scored more than double the score of Crystal Palace, which was not zero.

We should focus on the \"score\" column and identify any matches with a 0-0 score.\n\n### Step 2: Check if there are indeed 3 drawn matches that could be goalless\nThe JSON table has a list of matches, and some have scores like 0-0 (drawn) or other team scoring after, but it doesn't explicitly mention \"goalless\" as a specific type of match.
