We need to determine if this is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\nStep 2: Find relevant data from the table\nTo verify the claim, we need to find out how many matches Galina Voskoboeva has played on clay courts and compare it to the total number of her matches. We also need to know if she plays 20% of her games on these surfaces.\n\nStep 3: Identify relevant columns in the table\nWe will use the \"tournament\" column to find out where each match was played, specifically looking for instances with \"clay\" as part of that description. The \"opponent\", \"date\", and \"surface\" columns are also relevant since we want to know the surface on which she plays, but primarily we're interested in whether it's clay.\n\nStep 4: Calculate percentage of games played on clay\nOnce we have the data, we'll calculate what percentage of her total games were played on a clay court. This will help us understand how accurate the claim is.\n\nStep 5: Compare with 20%\nWe then compare this calculated percentage to 20%. If they match or are very close (considering rounding errors), it supports the truth of the claim. Otherwise, it does not.\n\nStep 6: Determine relevance\nFor steps 3 and 4, we'll identify which specific rows in the table correspond to Galina Voskoboeva's matches on clay courts and list those along with their row index and column name.\n\nHere\u2019s how this translates into code:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = {\n  \"columns\": [\n    \"outcome\",\n    \"date\",\n    \"tournament\",\n    \"surface\",\n    \"opponent\",\n    \"score\"\n  ],\n  \"data\": [\n    [\n      \"runner - up\",\n      \"28 january 2003\",\n      \"tipton\",\n      \"hard (i)\",\n      \"matea mezak\",\n      \"6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"winner\",\n      \"29 june 2003\",\n      \"mont - de - marsan\",\n      \"hard (i)\",\n      \"oleksandra kravets\",\n      \"6 - 4 , 6 - 2\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"runner - up\",\n      \"3 october 2003\",\n      \"latina\",\n      \"clay\",\n      \"roberta vinci\",\n      \"3 - 6 , 4 - 6\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"runner - up\",\n      \"8 november 2005\",\n      \"pittsburgh\",\n      \"hard\",\n      \"lilia osterloh\",\n      \"6 - 7 , 4 - 6\"\n    ],\n    [\n      \"winner\",\n      \"6 june 2006\",\n      \"cuneo , italy\",\n      \"clay\",\n      \"alice canepa\",\n      \"6 - 1 , 6 - 2\"\n    ]\n  ]\n};\n\nconst galinaVoskoboevaMatches = data[\"data\"].filter((match, index) => {\n  if (index == 3 || index == 4) return false;\n  else return match[3] === 'clay';\n}).map((match, index) => {\n\n  const rowIndex = index;\n  let surface = match[3];\n  return {rowIndex: rowIndex, column_name: \"surface\"}\n});\n\nconst totalMatchesOnClay = galinaVoskoboevaMatches.length;\n\n// Calculate percentage\nconst clayPercentage = (totalMatchesOnClay / data[\"data\"].length) * 100;\n\nconst answer = clayPercentage === 20 ? \"TRUE\" : \"FALSE\";\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify({\n  \"chain_of_thought\": `Step 1: Analyze the claim about Galina Voskoboeva playing 20% of her games on clay courts.`,\n  \"answer\": answer,\n  \"relevant_cells\": galinaVoskoboevaMatches\n}));\n```\nThe above code will process the data from the table, calculate the percentage of matches played by Galina Voskoboeva on clay courts, and then compare it to the claimed percentage.

We can see that the \"surface\" is mentioned in all match details.\n- Count the number of times 'clay' appears in the surface column (it appears 3 times) and 'hard' appears (it appears 4 times).\n- For clay, count the total number of matches where 'winner' or 'runner-up' are in that row since those two columns indicate a win.\n- For hard, similarly, count the total number of wins for the same.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the winrate for Galina Voskoboeva on both surfaces.\n\n- To calculate the winrate, we divide the number of wins by the total number of matches played in each category. We already have these numbers from Step 1.\n- So if there were 'n' clay wins and 'm' hard wins, the clay winrate is n/m and the hard winrate is m/n.\n\nStep 3: Compare the winrates to see if they are equal.\n\n- To do this, we take the two winrates calculated from Step 2.\n- We compare them.

We can do this by counting the number of rows for each surface in the table.\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of rows for clay surface\nWe look at the \"surface\" column in the data section of the table and count the number of times \"clay\" appears. This will give us the total number of games played on clay surfaces.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of rows for hard surface\nSimilarly, we look at the \"surface\" column and count the number of times \"hard (i)\" and \"hard\" appear together since they represent the same type of surface. This will give us the total number of games played on hard surfaces.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate percentages\nOnce we have the counts for both clay and hard surfaces, we can calculate the percentage of games played on each surface out of the total number of games played by Galina Voskoboeva. Since there are only five rows in the table, if the game count is not explicitly stated, it might imply that the entire dataset was considered.\n\n### Step 5: Compare calculated percentages with claim\nWe compare our calculated percentages for clay and hard surfaces to determine if they match the claim provided (20% on clay and 1% on hard).\n\n### Step 6: Output final answer\nBased on our calculations, we will output a JSON object indicating whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE along with the reasoning steps that led us to this conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Counting games on clay surface\",\n      \"data_point\": {\n        \"column_name\": \"surface\",\n        \"row_index\": 2,\n        \"value\": \"clay\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Counting games on hard surface\",\n      \"data_point\": {\n        \"column_name\": \"surface\",\n        \"row_index\": [\n          0, // hard (i)\n          1, // hard\n        ],\n        \"value\": [\"hard (i)\", \"hard\"]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculating percentages for clay surface\",\n      \"data_point\": {\n        \"total_games_clay\": 2,\n        \"percentage_clay\": \"40.0%\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculating percentages for hard surface\",\n      \"data_point\": {\n        \"total_games_hard\": 3,\n        \"percentage_hard\": \"60.0%\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing calculated percentages with claim\",\n      \"claim_match\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determining final answer based on comparison\",\n      \"answer\": false\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"surface\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nGiven the calculated percentages do not exactly match the claim, the answer is FALSE.",

First, we need to identify all the unique opponents that Galina Voskoboeva played against and their respective dates.\n2. Next, we will count how many times each of these opponents was paired with Galina Voskoboeva in the table.\n3. We will then compare this count to 1 for each opponent to determine if they were ever played more than once.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n* Looking at row 4: \"opponent\" is Lilia Osterloh, and she played against Galina Voskoboeva on November 8, 2005.\n* Looking at row 2: \"opponent\" is Oleksandra Kravets, and she played against Galina Voskoboeva on June 29, 2003.\n\nThese are the only instances where we can find that Galina Voskoboeva plays with the same opponent more than once. \n\nNow we will compare these results to the claim:\n\nThe claim says Galina Voskoboeva never plays the same opponent more than once except in June 6, 2006.

We need to calculate her average score loss for each opponent.\n*   For each match, we will calculate the absolute difference between the points won by Galina Voskoboeva and the points lost by her opponent.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate average score loss\nLet's analyze each match:\n*   **Oleksandra Kravets**: \n    *   First match: Galina Voskoboeva lost by 2 points (4-6, 4-6)\n    *   Second match: Galina Voskoboeva lost by 3 points (6-7)\n*   **Alice Canepa**:\n    *   First match: Galina Voskoboeva lost by 1 point (6-1)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate average score loss\nNow, we will calculate the average score loss for each opponent.\n\n*   For Oleksandra Kravets: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 points\n*   For Alice Canepa: 1 point\n\n### Step 5: Check if the claim is true or false\nSince Galina Voskoboeva's average score loss against both opponents (Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa) is less than 4 points, the claim that she loses by only 4 points on average with these opponents is FALSE.\n\n### Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract relevant data from the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate average score loss for Oleksandra Kravets\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{ \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }, { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score (won - lost)\" }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate average score loss for Alice Canepa\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{ \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }, { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score (won - lost)\" }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if the claim is true or false\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score (won - lost)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score (won - lost)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
