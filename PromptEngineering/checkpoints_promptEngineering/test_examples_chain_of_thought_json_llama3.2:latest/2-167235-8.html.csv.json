Identify the \"political party\" column in the table.\n2. For each person mentioned in the claim, check if their row has a non-empty value for the \"political party\" column and matches \"Socialist Party of Albania\".\n   - Lir Meta: Row 11 has [\"1969 -\", \"29 october 1999\", \"22 february 2002\", \"socialist party of albania\"]\n   - Bashkim Fino: Row 6 has [\"1962 -\", \"11 march 1997\", \"24 july 1997\", \"socialist party of albania\"]\n   - Ylli Bufi: Row 3 has [\"1948 -\", \"10 december 1991\", \"socialist party of albania\"]\n   - Pandeli Majko (1st time): Row 5 has [\"1967 -\", \"2 october 1998\", \"29 october 1999\", \"socialist party of albania\"]\n3. For each person, verify that their row's \"born - died\" column value is non-empty.\n   - Lir Meta: Row 11 has a non-empty \"born - died\" value [\"1969 -\"].\n   - Bashkim Fino: Row 6 has a non-empty \"born - died\" value [\"1939 -\"] (not matching the claim's condition).\n   - Ylli Bufi: Row 3 has a non-empty \"born - died\" value [\"1948 -\"].\n   - Pandeli Majko (1st time): Row 5 has a non-empty \"born - died\" value [\"1967 -\"].\n4.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the claim's main components:**\n   The claim states that Sali Berisha was elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party for the first time since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi, who was also elected in the same manner.\n\n2. **Find relevant cells in the table to verify the claim:**\n\n   - Look up Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's data in the \"data\" section.\n     ```\n     [\n       [\n         \"ylli bufi\",\n         \"1948 -\",\n         \"5 june 1991\",\n         \"10 december 1991\",\n         \"socialist party of albania\"\n       ],\n       [\n         \"aleksand\u00ebr meksi\",\n         \"1939 -\",\n         \"13 april 1992\",\n         \"11 march 1997\",\n         \"democratic party of albania\"\n       ]\n     ]\n   ```\n   Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi was indeed elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\n3. **Verify Sali Berisha's data:**\n   Look up Sali Berisha in the \"data\" section.\n     ```\n     [\n       [\n         \"sali berisha\",\n         \"1944 -\",\n         \"11 september 2005\",\n         \"15 september 2013\",\n         \"democratic party of albania\"\n       ]\n     ]\n   ```\n   Sali Berisha was elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\n4. **Compare election manners:**\n   The claim states that Sali Berisha is the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected in the same manner, implying that both were elected from within the party (as opposed to joining or leaving it).\n\n5. **Check if Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi was indeed part of the Democratic Party before his election:**\n   Since there's no \"party affiliation\" column with any data and given that Sali Berisha is clearly listed under the \"democratic party of albania\", but no mention of a similar entry for Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi, it can be inferred that he was indeed part of the party before his election.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on comparison:**\n   Since both Sali Berisha and Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi were elected from within the Democratic Party of Albania, and we verified Sali Berisha's first membership as per the claim, we should confirm whether Sali Berisha holds the \"first\" position for such an election pattern.\n\n7. **Verify if there was anyone before Sali Berisha in a similar electoral pattern:**\n   The table doesn't explicitly list individuals who have been elected and then returned to being part of the party only to be elected again as a member, but it does show Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi followed by others including Fatos Nano (after 1991). Given that there's no evidence or mention in the table of any election occurring between Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi and Sali Berisha where someone left the party and then rejoined to be elected again as a member, we should verify if such an event could occur before Sali Berisha.\n\n8. **Finalize Conclusion:**\n   Given that we found no evidence in the table indicating another person was elected into the Democratic Party of Albania after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi, followed by someone leaving and then being elected again (to fulfill the claim's requirement), but did verify both Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi and Sali Berisha were indeed part of the party before their election, we must determine if this makes Sali Berisha the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected as a member in such a manner.\n\n9. **Conclusion Verification:**\n   Given that there is no clear evidence provided about another individual being elected into the Democratic Party after Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi and then leaving, joining again, and being elected (to fulfill the condition of being \"since\" Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's first election pattern), but we verified Sali Berisha was indeed part of this electoral cycle with no information on a previous instance fitting this exact description, it suggests that Sali Berisha could be considered as such an individual under the specific interpretation that we're looking for the first person to follow Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi in being elected into the party and returning to it before another similar event occurred.\n\n### Final JSON Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify claim components.\",\n      \"message\": \"Sali Berisha was elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find relevant cells in table for verification.\",\n      \"message\": \"Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi and Sali Berisha both had valid entries.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify if Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi was indeed part of the party before his election.\",\n      \"message\": \"Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's data indicates he joined after his initial term.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if Sali Berisha also had a first-time membership as per claim.\",\n      \"message\": \"Sali Berisha is listed under the 'democratic party of albania'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion based on comparison: Since both Sali Berisha and Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi were elected from within the Democratic Party of Albania, determine if Sali Berisha holds the first position for such an election pattern.\",\n      \"message\": \"No clear evidence in table of another person being in between.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Finalize Conclusion: Given that there is no direct information about another similar instance occurring before Sali Berisha, and acknowledging Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's initial term fits this description, determine the truth of the claim.\",\n      \"message\": \"Given lack of evidence for someone else in between, Sali Berisha could be seen as such an individual under specific conditions.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"claim verification\": \"True\",\n  \"truth determination\": true\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to count the number of individuals who have been members of the Socialist Party of Albania.\n2.

If the political party is \"Socialist Party of Albania\", we increment a counter to keep track of the number of individuals who have been members.\n4. We will also need to identify which row corresponds to Fatos Nano, as he has three different instances in the table and his last instance does not mention him being a member of the Socialist Party of Albania. To do this, we can check if the \"born - died\" column contains dates and compare them with the dates in other columns.\n5. Once we have counted the number of individuals who have been members of the Socialist Party of Albanian and checked Fatos Nano's entries, we will evaluate the claim based on our findings.\n\nHere is how this step-by-step process can be represented as JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1.
