Next, we count how many such transfers there are to verify if it matches or exceeds 7.\n\n4.

His name is listed under the \"name\" column at index \"5\", and his nationality is \"sco\". However, since there are two rows with the same nationality (\"sco\"), we need to check both of them for more information about Chris Burke.\n\n### Step 3: Check if Chris Burke has a free transfer fee\nAfter finding the relevant row(s), we can see that Chris Burke's transfer fee is listed at index \"6\" as \"free\".\n\n### Step 4: Check if any other players have a free transfer fee\nSince we are checking for uniqueness, we also need to verify if there are no other players with the same type of transfer fee (\"transfer\" or \"loan\"). However, our previous steps already checked for these cases.\n\n### Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on findings\nBased on our analysis in Steps 2-4, Chris Burke indeed has a free transfer fee.

We will ignore these players when finding the lowest transfer amount.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify transfer amount for each player\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\"amount\": \"1 m\", \"player\": \"slovakia\", \"nationality\": \"slovakia\"},\n        {\"amount\": \"7.8 m\", \"player\": \"esp\", \"nationality\": \"esp\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the lowest transfer amount\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Find the lowest transfer amount\nNow, we can see that the two players in Scotland have a transfer fee of 'n / a' and one other player has a transfer fee of '1 m'. The lowest transfer amount is actually the value of the Scottish players.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify transfer amount for each player\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\"amount\": \"n / a\", \"player\": \"sco\", \"nationality\": \"sco\"},\n        {\"amount\": \"n / a\", \"player\": \"sco\", \"nationality\": \"sco\"},\n        {\"amount\": \"1 m\", \"player\": \"slovakia\", \"nationality\": \"slovakia\"},\n        {\"amount\": \"7.8 m\", \"player\": \"esp\", \"nationality\": \"esp\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the lowest transfer amount\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the number of players with 'n / a'\",\n      \"count\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Compare the number of players with 'n / a'\nSince there are two players in Scotland who have a transfer fee of 'n / a', we should not include them when finding the lowest transfer amount.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify transfer amount for each player\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\"amount\": \"1 m\", \"player\": \"slovakia\", \"nationality\": \"slovakia\"},\n        {\"amount\": \"7.8 m\", \"player\": \"esp\", \"nationality\": \"esp\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the lowest transfer amount\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the number of players with 'n / a'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Determine the lowest transfer amount\nThe lowest transfer amount is actually lower than any other amount.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify transfer amount for each player\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\"amount\": \"1 m\", \"player\": \"slovakia\", \"nationality\": \"slovakia\"},\n        {\"amount\": \"7.8 m\", \"player\": \"esp\", \"nationality\": \"esp\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the lowest transfer amount\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the number of players with 'n / a'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the lowest transfer amount\",\n      \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Output the final answer\nSince we are looking for the number of players with the lowest transfer amount, which is 'n / a' and there are more than two players who have this value. Therefore the statement in the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify transfer amount for each player\",\n      \"data\": [\n        {\"amount\": \"1 m\", \"player\": \"slovakia\", \"nationality\": \"slovakia\"},\n        {\"amount\": \"7.8 m\", \"player\": \"esp\", \"nationality\": \"esp\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the lowest transfer amount\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the number of players with 'n / a'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the lowest transfer amount\",\n      \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"amount\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"amount\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
