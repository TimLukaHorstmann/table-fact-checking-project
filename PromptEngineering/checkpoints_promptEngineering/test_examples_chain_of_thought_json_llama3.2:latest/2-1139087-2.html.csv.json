    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the given claim:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many Grand Prix races Ayrton Senna started in pole position. This will involve iterating through each row of the table.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if Ayrton Senna started 13 Grand Prix races in total. This can be done by comparing the count of rows where \"winning driver\" equals \"ayrton senna\" with the given number 13.\n\n3. If both conditions are met (Ayrton Senna started 13 Grand Prix races and he was in pole position for at least one race), then we have to check which row has \"pole position\" equal to \"ayrton senna\". This will confirm that Ayrton Senna indeed started the specified race in pole position.\n\nNow, let's list out our step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- **Step 1**: To verify if Ayrton Senna started 13 Grand Prix races in total, we need to check how many rows have \"winning driver\" equal to \"ayrton senna\".\n\n- **Step 2**: After finding the row with \"winning driver\" as \"ayrton senna\", we will then verify that \"pole position\" equals \"ayrton senna\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Finally, we need to check for how many races Ayrton Senna was in pole position. This can be done by looking at each race where he won and checking if the corresponding cell has \"pole position\" equal to his name.\n\n- **Conclusion**: If all conditions are met (Ayrton Senna started 13 Grand Prix races, he was in pole position for one of them, and that specific race is specified), then the claim about Ayrton Senna starting a Grand Prix race in pole position is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nBased on the analysis above, here's how we can output our final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Check for rows where winning driver equals 'ayrton senna' to determine total races Ayrton Senna started.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Verify that pole position is 'ayrton senna' in the row where winning driver equals 'ayrton senna'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count how many times Ayrton Senna is in pole position across all races.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"pole position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify Relevant Data\nWe will focus on the 'pole position' column in the table, as it directly relates to the claim. Specifically, we are interested in rows where a driver appears in both the first and second positions of the row (since the first position is typically for the pole position).\n\n#### Step 3: Check Each Row for Duplicate Drivers\n- For each row:\n  - Check if 'winning driver' equals 'pole position'. If true, it indicates that Senna or Prost won the race but only one can be in both positions.\n  - Verify that there are no other drivers who share the same pole and winning driver status.\n\n#### Step 4: Review Table for Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost\n- Ayrton Senna has multiple instances where he is both 'winning driver' and 'pole position', indicating a win but not necessarily a unique occurrence.\n- Alain Prost shares this characteristic with Senna, suggesting at least one instance where Prost won (or was pole) without being the only driver.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven that Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost appear in both positions multiple times across different races, it is clear they are not the only drivers to hold these positions.

Looking at the table, the \"winning driver\" is listed as Michele Alboreto.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify Alain Prost's Position in the Race\nNext, we need to confirm that Alain Prost did not win the race.
