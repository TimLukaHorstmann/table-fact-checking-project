This verification process helps us establish whether or not there is at least one instance where this claim holds true.\n\n7. **Conclude and Provide Evidence (If Necessary)**: After examining all relevant dates within March, if an example exists that satisfies our criteria of two consecutive matches with a 2-day gap between them, we conclude the claim to be True; otherwise, we state it False.\n\n### Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Output:\n\nThe output indicates that the chain_of_thought is a list detailing two relevant rows in the table: row 23's date and row 24's date. This corresponds with examining March 1st and April 2nd in the provided data, where we can see these dates have matches on the next day (March 2nd for March 1st, and April 3rd for April 2nd). Since our claim is satisfied by at least one instance of consecutive matches occurring within a two-day gap in March, we conclude that the answer is indeed True.",
