    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1:** We need to find out if John Wayne or Gilda Radner died from any kind of cancer.\n\n**Step 2:** Look at the list of celebrities who passed away, specifically Pilar Wayne (John Wayne's wife) and Gene Wilder (Gilda Radner's husband).\n\n**Step 3:** Check if Pilar Wayne's cause of death is listed as stomach cancer. If so, note that John Wayne died from stomach cancer.\n\n**Step 4:** Check if Gilda Radner's cause of death is listed anywhere in the data. Upon reviewing the list again, we notice that her husband Gene Wilder was listed with an ovarian cancer cause of death for Gilda.\n\n**Step 5:** Now, let's determine if our claim is true or false based on our findings from steps 3 and 4.\n\nSince both Pilar Wayne (John Wayne) and Gene Wilder (Gilda Radner) had causes of death related to cancer, we can conclude that the statement \"neither John Wayne or Gilda Radner die of any kind of cancer\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"Pilar Wayne\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 55,\n      \"column_name\": \"Gene Wilder\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"cause_of_death\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 55,\n      \"column_name\": \"cause_of_death\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if Mona Graham and Karl Malden have one of the shortest marriages, we need to compare their marriage duration with other celebrities.\n2. We can do this by finding the minimum marriage duration among all couples listed in the table.\n3. We'll start by assuming the minimum marriage duration is infinity, as no value has been set for it yet.\n4. Then, we will iterate through each couple's cell and update our assumption if we find a shorter marriage duration.\n5. Once we've compared all marriage durations, we can determine whether Mona Graham and Karl Malden have one of the shortest marriages.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define the data\ndata = {\n    # ... (all cells remain the same)\n}\n\n# Find the minimum marriage duration\nmin_marriage_duration = float('inf')\nrelevant_cells = []\n\nfor row_index, row in enumerate(data):\n    for column_name, value in row.items():\n        if column_name == 'marriage':\n            marriage_duration = value.split()[1]\n            if int(marriage_duration) < min_marriage_duration:\n                min_marriage_duration = int(marriage_duration)\n                relevant_cells.append({\n                    \"row_index\": row_index,\n                    \"column_name\": column_name\n                })\n\n# Check Mona Graham and Karl Malden's marriage duration\nmona_graham_karl_malden_row_index = data.index({'name': 'Mona Graham', 'marriage': '8 years'})\nmona_graham_karl_malden_marriage_duration = min_marriage_duration\n\nif int(marriage_duration) == mona_graham_karl_malden_marriage_duration:\n    has_shortest_marriage = True\nelse:\n    has_shortest_marriage = False\n\n# Output the result in JSON format\noutput_json = {\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Iterated through all couples to find the minimum marriage duration.
