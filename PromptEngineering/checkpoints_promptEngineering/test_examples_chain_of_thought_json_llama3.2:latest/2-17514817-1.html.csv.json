    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, let's identify the brewery responsible for \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\". From the table, we can see that Maggs Magnificent Mild is brewed by \"maggs\" (likely a person or company name), not specifically \"West Berkshire Brewery\".\n\n2. Next, let's examine the years in which Maggs Magnificent Mild won awards. According to the table:\n   - 2002: Won gold medal for \"mild and porter\"\n   - 2003: Won gold medal for \"mild and porter\" (again)\n   - 2004: Won overall winner award\n   - 2005: Won gold, bronze, and silver medals for \"mild\" in different competitions\n\n3. Now, let's compare the years of Maggs Magnificent Mild winning awards to the claim that it is West Berkshire Brewery's most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009. There are several issues with this claim:\n   - West Berkshire Brewery does not appear to be responsible for brewing Maggs Magnificent Mild.\n   - The award years provided in the table do not match any single \"most decorated\" period, as there is no consistent level of decoration across all these years.\n\n4. Based on these observations, we can conclude that the claim about \"West Berkshire Brewery's 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' being its most decorate beer between 1995 and 2009\" is false.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"brewery\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"brewery\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The first appearance of this beer is in 1995.\n   - The claim mentions awards between 1995 and 2009. We need to check if all these beers from the year 1995 to 2009 have been awarded.\n\n3. **Verify the number of awards for each year:**\n   - Checking the table, we find that there are records of this beer from 1995 to 2005. There are six different instances where \"good old boy\" has won an award.\n   - The last instance is in 2005 and it has been awarded three times (gold medal, silver medal, bronze medal).\n\n4. **Determine the total number of awards:**\n   - We have a total of six records from 1995 to 2005 where \"good old boy\" beer won an award.\n   - However, since we are looking for five awards in total between 1995 and 2009, we can see that there is no record of the award being awarded in 2006 or beyond.\n\n5. **Check if all required conditions have been met:**\n   - The claim mentions \"between 1995 and 2009\". Since we do not have any records of this beer after 2005, it seems that the requirements for five awards have not been fully met.\n   - However, the last three instances in 2005 also have been awarded a total of two medals.\n\n6. **Final conclusion:**\n   - Given the provided data, it is true that \"west berkshire brewery's good old boy beer\" won six awards between 1995 and 2009, but one award was missing at the end of this time period.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract all relevant data\",\n      \"info\": \"The claim mentions 'good old boy beer' by 'west berkshire brewery'.

This means we need to find all instances where a beer from West Berkshire Brewery wins a single award during this time period.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data**: We will search through the table for beers produced by West Berkshire Brewery that have won a single award. The relevant columns are \"year\", \"beer name\", and \"prize\".\n\n3. **Check Each Row for Relevance**:\n   - For each row, we check if the \"beer name\" matches the claim's brewery (West Berkshire).\n   - If it does, we then verify that the \"prize\" is a single award (\"overall winner\", \"gold medal\", \"silver medal\", or \"bronze medal\") since multiple awards would not fulfill the claim.\n\n4. **Count Awards Won by West Berkshire Brewery**: We keep track of how many beers from West Berkshire win these single awards between 1995 and 2009.\n\n5. **Determine if Claim is True or False**: If we find three such instances, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Example Steps with Specifics:\n\n- For instance, looking at row 1: [\"1995\", \"good old boy\", \"overall winner\", ...] shows a beer from West Berkshire winning an overall award in 1995.\n- This process continues for each relevant row until all rows are checked.\n\n6. **Counting and Verification**: After checking all relevant beers, we count how many won single awards. If this number is exactly 3, the claim holds true; if not, it does not.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The claim's truth value is determined by whether West Berkshire Brewery beers collectively won three single awards between 1995 and 2009.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"beer name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"prize\"\n    },\n    ...\n    // Check all relevant beers and their prizes\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"beer name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"prize\"}, // Gold Medal\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prize\"}, // Second Reserve Champion\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"prize\"} // Gold Medal\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nGiven the data in the provided JSON table, only a few beers from West Berkshire Brewery won single awards (not exactly three as per the claim), thus leading to an output where the claim is false.",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that West Berkshire Brewery's \"Dr Hexter Healer Beer\" has only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009.\n\n2. **Locate relevant data in table**:\n   - We need to look at each row of the table to see if Dr Hexter Healer Beer received any medals.\n   - Specifically, we're interested in rows where \"Dr Hexter 's healer\" is present (as this indicates the beer being referred to).\n\n3. **Check for gold and bronze medals**:\n   - If there are any instances where the beer receives a gold or bronze medal, it contradicts the claim.\n\n4. **Verify years involved**:\n   - Ensure that all relevant years fall between 1995 and 2009 as per the claim.\n\n### Relevant Data Extraction\n\n| Row Index | Column Name        |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n|          | year                |\n|          | beer name           |\n|          | prize               |\n|          | category            |\n|          | competition         |\n\n### Inspection of Relevant Rows\n\n- **Row 1**: \"Dr Hexter 's healer\" (year = 1995, gold medal), does not fit the claim.\n- **Row 6**: \"Dr hexter 's healer\", (year = 2002, silver medal), fits the criteria and is within the specified years range.\n- **Row 7**: Not directly relevant to Dr Hexter Healer Beer, appears to be a different beer.\n\n### Further Inspection\n\n- Continue inspecting rows where \"Dr Hexter 's healer\" is present for any gold or bronze medals that might have been missed initially.\n\n... (After inspecting more rows)\n\n- **Row 19**: No \"Dr Hexter 's healer\", no relevant row found here, as it pertains to a different beer.\n- **Row 20-24**, does not appear in table\n\nUpon thorough inspection:\n\n- All instances of Dr Hexter Healer Beer between 1995 and 2009 yield either gold or bronze medal except one instance yielding only silver.\n\n### Conclusion on Claim Truth\n\nSince there are at least two instances where \"Dr Hexter 's healer\" receives a gold or bronze medal, the claim is false.",

However, it is mentioned that there was an overall winner of \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" at a different competition (Bracknell Blues and Real Ale Festival).\n- Year 2005: There are three rows containing information about Maggs Magnificent Mild with categories 'mild', 'overall' twice.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of bronze awards received\nOnly row index 7 from year 2002 has a category named \"strong ale\" where a silver medal was won, but there is no data for a Bronze award in any category between 1995 and 2005 other than Siba National Beer Competitions.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nSince Maggs Magnificent Mild received two Bronze awards at the Siba National Beer Competition, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the brewery name and beer style mentioned in the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Extract the relevant data from the table for Maggs Magnificent Mild awards\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Determine the number of Bronze awards received by West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild between 1995 and 2005\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information extracted from the table\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
