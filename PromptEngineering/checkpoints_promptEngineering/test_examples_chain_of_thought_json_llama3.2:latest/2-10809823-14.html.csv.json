    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the venues for June 28, 1980\nThe table contains information about various matches played on different dates. To determine if the claim is true, we first need to identify which venue(s) were used for the match played on June 28, 1980.\n\nLooking at the \"data\" section of the table, we see that:\n- Kardinia Park was used\n- Western Oval was used\n- Princes Park was used\n\nThese three venues are mentioned as being used for matches played on June 28, 1980.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if Princes Park is one of the six venues used for matches on June 28, 1980\nWe already know that Princes Park was indeed used for a match on this date. We need to verify if it's among the six venues in total.\n\nSince we have identified three venues being used on June 28, 1980 and there are more than three games listed under \"data\", there is no clear indication that any other venue(s) were used on this specific date. \n\nHowever, the claim does not provide further details for why it should be one of the six.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze additional information from table\nThe table contains a column called 'crowd' and 'date'. We also know that there are 6 games in total.\n\n\nIn the \"data\" section:\n- Row 1 has crowd=21555\n- Row 2 has crowd=11785\n- Row 3 has crowd=8209\n- Row 4 has crowd=64054\n- Row 5 has crowd=12362\n- Row 6 has crowd=20485\n\n\nWe can see that all these numbers represent crowds for games played on June 28, 1980. The claim mentions 'prince park' and that it is used for one of the six venue, and the only other venues mentioned are 'kardinia park' and 'western oval'. There is no evidence to confirm any more than three total venues.\n\n#### Step 4: Final assessment\nSince we have found that Princes Park was indeed used on June 28, 1980 but do not know if there were exactly six venues in use at the time of this match, there isn't enough information to definitively state that the claim is true. However, as only three are mentioned and all data points align with only these three being present, a plausible argument can be made that it was indeed one of the used six.\n\n#### Final output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",

Check Melbourne's away score:\n   - The \"away team\" for western oval (Melbourne) in the second row of the data is \"melbourne\".\n   - However, this entry seems incorrect as we were looking for \"western oval\". \n   - Let's re-examine table and note that there is a match between footscray and Melbourne where Western Oval is listed as the venue.\n   - In the case of this western oval (Melbourne), the score for away team (melbourne) should actually be 6.7 (43).\n\n4. Compare scores:\n   - North Melbourne's away score is \"8.7 (55)\" which is greater than their home score \"13.6 (84)\".\n   - Melbourne's away score is 6.7 (43), and the away team is listed as western oval, not just melbourne. \n\n5.

This will help us identify the top 4 crowd venues.\n\n4. **Identify Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away game venues and their respective crowd values**:\n    - For Melbourne: The team played against Collingwood at MCg with a crowd of 64054.\n    - For North Melbourne: The team played against Fitzroy at Princes Park with a crowd of 8209.\n\n5. **Check if both venues are among the top 4 crowd venues**: Sort the crowd values (excluding those of Melbourne and North Melbourne) in descending order to find out which venues fall into the top 4.\n    - Excluding MCg's 64054, the next highest value is 11785 (for Footscray against Melbourne at Western Oval).\n    - The other values are lower than 8209.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the sorting of crowd data, both Melbourne's and North Melbourne's away game venues do not fall into the top 4 crowd venues, because Melbourne's venue is higher in rank than the next highest value (11785).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to find out which venues have a crowd of more than 15000.\n   - Looking at the data table, we can see that:\n     * Lake Oval has a crowd of 12362\n     * VFL Park has a crowd of 20485\n\n    Both are less than 15000.\n\n2. Next, let's rank these two venues based on their crowds in descending order to determine which one should be among the top 3.\n   - The venue with the highest crowd is VFL Park (20485) and the venue with the second-highest crowd is Lake Oval (12362).\n\n    Therefore, only VFL Park has a crowd higher than 15000. Hence it will be ranked in the first place.\n\n3. Now we need to find out if there are any other venues that have crowds higher than 15000.\n   - We already checked and found none of the others above 15000. So the top spot is VFL Park's.\n\n\nSo the claim about \"vfl park and lake oval venue be rank among the top 3 crowd venue\" is FALSE.\n\nHere is our final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",
