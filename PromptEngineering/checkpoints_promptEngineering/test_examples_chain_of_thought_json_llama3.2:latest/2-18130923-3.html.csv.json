The relevant row for Bob Gilder is:\n```\n{\n  \"place\": \"t5\",\n  \"player\": \"bob gilder\",\n  \"country\": \"united states\",\n  \"score\": \"73 + 70 + 67 + 73 = 283\",\n  \"to par\": \"- 5\",\n  \"money\": 60000\n}\n```\nThe relevant row for John Daly is:\n```\n{\n  \"place\": \"1\",\n  \"player\": \"john daly\",\n  \"country\": \"united states\",\n  \"score\": \"69 + 67 + 69 + 71 = 276\",\n  \"to par\": \"- 12\",\n  \"money\": 230000\n}\n```\n### Step 3: Compare the places of Bob Gilder and John Daly\nTo compare their places, we can see that:\n- Bob Gilder's place is \"t5\"\n- John Daly's place is \"1\"\n\nSince \"1\" comes before \"t5\" alphabetically, John Daly has a higher place than Bob Gilder.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the claim based on the comparison\nBased on our comparison in step 3, we can conclude that the claim \"bob gilder place higher than john daly\" is FALSE.\n\n### Final answer\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
