    "resp": "Step 1: Identify the row of Darryl Dawkins in the table.\n\nThe row for Darryl Dawkins has the following data:\n```\n[\n  \"darryl dawkins\",\n  \"united states\",\n  \"center\",\n  \"1987 - 88\",\n  \"maynard evans hs\"\n]\n```\n\nStep 2: Identify the row of Paul Dawkins in the table.\n\nThe row for Paul Dawkins has the following data:\n```\n[\n  \"paul dawkins\",\n  \"united states\",\n  \"guard\",\n  \"1979 - 80\",\n  \"northern illinois\"\n]\n```\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference between years of play for Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins.\n\nTo find out how long before Paul Dawkins started playing basketball that Darryl Dawkins started, we need to calculate the length of time they both played. The row for Darryl Dawkins states he played from 1987-88. The row for Paul Dawkins states he played from 1979-80.\n\n```python\ndawkins_start_year = int(\"1987 - 88\".split(\"-\")[1])\npaul_dawkins_start_year = int(\"1979 - 80\".split(\"-\")[1])\n\nyear_difference = dawkins_start_year - paul_dawkins_start_year\n```\n\nStep 4: Compare the calculated year difference with 7 years.\n\nIf the result from step 3 is equal to or greater than 7, then Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz 7 years before Paul Dawkins. Otherwise, he did not play 7 years before Paul Dawkins.\n\n```python\nis_dawkins_before_paul = year_difference >= 7\n```\n\nStep 5: Determine whether Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz 7 years before Paul Dawkins.\n\nThe claim states that Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz 7 years before Paul Dawkins. Based on our calculations, if `is_dawkins_before_paul` is True, then this statement is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n```python\nfinal_answer = \"TRUE\" if is_dawkins_before_paul else \"FALSE\"\n```\n\nStep 6: Record the relevant cells in JSON format.\n\n```python\nrelevant_cells = [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 1: Identify the row of Darryl Dawkins in the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 2: Identify the row of Paul Dawkins in the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 3: Calculate the difference between years of play for Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 4: Compare the calculated year difference with 7 years.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 5: Determine whether Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz 7 years before Paul Dawkins.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 6: Record the relevant cells in JSON format.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the relevant data\nFirst, we need to identify which players were on the team during the 1979-80 season. We can do this by looking at the \"data\" section of the table, specifically the rows that contain dates in the format \"1979 - 80\".\n\n#### Step 2: Extract the relevant player names\nNext, we extract the names of the players who were on the team during the 1979-80 season. We can do this by looking at the corresponding row data for each date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Identify the relevant data\",\n      \"description\": \"Identify which rows in the 'data' section contain dates in the format '1979 - 80'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Extract the relevant player names\",\n      \"description\": \"Extract the player names corresponding to each row with a date in '1979 - 80'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Check for duplicate guards\nWe need to check if there are at least three guard players who were on the team during the same season. We can do this by counting the number of unique guard names in the relevant rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Identify the relevant data\",\n      \"description\": \"Identify which rows in the 'data' section contain dates in the format '1979 - 80'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Extract the relevant player names\",\n      \"description\": \"Extract the player names corresponding to each row with a date in '1979 - 80'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Check for duplicate guards\",\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of unique guard names\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Verify if James Donaldson is one of the guards\nWe need to verify that James Donaldson is indeed one of the guards who was on the team during the same season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Identify the relevant data\",\n      \"description\": \"Identify which rows in the 'data' section contain dates in the format '1979 - 80'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Extract the relevant player names\",\n      \"description\": \"Extract the player names corresponding to each row with a date in '1979 - 80'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Check for duplicate guards\",\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of unique guard names\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Verify if James Donaldson is one of the guards\",\n      \"description\": \"Check if 'James Donaldson' is in the list of unique guard names\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the answer\nIf there are at least three guard players who were on the team during the same season, and James Donaldson is one of them, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Identify the relevant data\",\n      \"description\": \"Identify which rows in the 'data' section contain dates in the format '1979 - 80'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Extract the relevant player names\",\n      \"description\": \"Extract the player names corresponding to each row with a date in '1979 - 80'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Check for duplicate guards\",\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of unique guard names\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Verify if James Donaldson is one of the guards\",\n      \"description\": \"Check if 'James Donaldson' is in the list of unique guard names\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"5: Determine the answer\",\n      \"description\": \"Determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the previous steps\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `relevant_cells` array contains the row and column indices of the cells in the table that were relevant to determining the answer.",
