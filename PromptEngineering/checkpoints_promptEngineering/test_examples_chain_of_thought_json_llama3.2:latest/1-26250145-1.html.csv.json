This requires finding all occurrences of both \"Didi Benami\" and \"angel\" in the table.\n\n3. **Compare with Lean On Me Condition**: Check if any row matching the criteria (from step 2) also contains a result of either \"safe\" or \"advanced\", indicating that she sang before \"Lean on Me\".\n\n4. **Locate Lean On Me Occurrence**: Find and verify the row(s) where the song is actually \"lean on me\".\n\n5. **Evaluate Row Index for Both Conditions**:\n    - For each row with Didi Benami singing \"angel\", check if her performance of \"angel\" comes before any performance of \"Lean on Me\".\n    - If there are multiple rows where this condition is met, ensure that the row index is higher than any row that meets the conditions for \"lean on me\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on steps 4 and 5, conclude whether Didi Benami singing the song choice \"angel\" before \"Lean On Me\" is a true statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution (Note: This is just an execution of the explanation in code format)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify the Claim\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Find the Relevant Rows\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Compare with Lean On Me Condition\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Locate Lean On Me Occurrence\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 5,\n            \"description\": \"Evaluate Row Index for Both Conditions\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"order\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nGiven the steps above, executing them leads to identifying that there is no row where Didi Benami sings before singing \"lean on me\", as indicated by her performance being safe/advanced in rows without a higher index of \"angel\" than \"Lean On Me\". Thus, the claim stated about Didi Benami singing \"angel\" before \"lean on me\" cannot be verified to be true based on the data provided.",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim\nThe claim states that Didid Benami was number 5 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women).\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the relevant rows in the table\nWe need to find the rows corresponding to \"top 20 (10 women)\" and \"top 16 (8 women)\". These rows are at indices 3 and 5, respectively.\n\n#### Step 3: Check the order for \"top 20 (10 women)\"\nThe row at index 3 is:\n{\n  \"week\": \"top 24 (12 women)\",\n  \"theme\": \"billboard hot 100 hits\",\n  \"song choice\": \"the way i am\",\n  \"original artist\": \"ingrid michaelson\",\n  \"order\": \"9\",\n  \"result\": \"safe\"\n}\nDidid Benami is at order 9, not 5. So the claim is FALSE for this row.\n\n#### Step 4: Check the order for \"top 16 (8 women)\"\nThe row at index 5 is:\n{\n  \"week\": \"top 20 (10 women)\",\n  \"theme\": \"billboard hot 100 hits\",\n  \"song choice\": \"lean on me\",\n  \"original artist\": \"bill withers\",\n  \"order\": \"5\",\n  \"result\": \"safe\"\n}\nDidid Benami is at order 5, so the claim is TRUE for this row.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if the claim is true or false\nSince the claim is only true for one of the relevant rows, we need to check if there are any other claims that could potentially make it true. We notice that \"top 20 (10 women)\" occurs before \"top 16 (8 women)\" in order, so didid benami must be number 5 for both weeks.\n\n#### Step 6: Recheck the claim with step 3\nFor \"top 20 (10 women)\", Didid Benami is at order 9. So we can't make the claim that she was number 5. We are left with only one row to reevaluate, which is \"top 16 (8 women)\".\n\n#### Step 7: Recheck all relevant cells\nFor \"top 20 (10 women)\", Didid Benami is at order 9.\nFor \"top 16 (8 women)\", Didid Benami is at order 5. The claim that she was number 5 in the top 20 (10 women) is still FALSE because she wasn't.\n\n#### Step 8: Final evaluation\nWe know that for \"top 20 (10 women)\" didid benami isn't the fifth person, so let's reevaluate \"top 16 (8 women)\". Didid Benami is at number 5. This would imply that there are no other people with a lower order on top 16 than 5.\n\n#### Step 9: Recheck all relevant cells again\nFor \"top 20 (10 women)\", Didid Benami is at order 9.\nFor \"top 20 (12 women)\", Didid Benami isn't in this row. We check the next ones and find that there are no other people with an order lower than 5.\n\n#### Step 10: Recheck all relevant cells once more\nSince there were no results for top 16 with an order higher than 5, we can conclude that didid benami is indeed number 5 on \"top 16 (8 women)\".\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Claim states Didid Benami was number 5 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Locate the relevant rows in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Check the order for \\\"top 20 (10 women)\\\".

Finally, we need to check if any other row from the table had Didi Benami singing \"No One\" before \"hey jude\". \n   We see that after the 6th row (\"top 20 (10 women)\") there is another row (\"top 16 (8 women)\") that has Didi Benami singing \"rhiannon\", however that song was performed by Fleetwood Mac, and then another row with Didi Benami singing \"you 're no good\" which does not match either \"No One\" or \"hey jude\". \n\n4. However, there is a row (\"top 12\") where the original artist of the song choice's performance is \"Betty Everett\", however that was before she sang \"you 're no good\".\n\n5. Then we check if any row with Didi Benami singing \"No One\" appears before the row with Didi Benami singing \"hey jude\".

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Locate the rows for top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women)\n\nFirst, we need to find the specific rows in the table that correspond to the claim about Didi Benami being number 4 in both the \"top 20 (10 women)\" and \"top 16 (8 women)\" categories. We can do this by looking at the row where the week is labeled as such.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the order of each of these weeks\n\nNext, we need to determine the position of Didi Benami in the original data for both the \"top 20 (10 women)\" and \"top 16 (8 women)\". We can do this by examining the corresponding rows' \"order\" values.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if there is a value in order which corresponds to number 4\n\nSince we know that Didi Benami needs to be at position 4 for both of these categories, we need to see whether any row has an \"order\" value equal to 4.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze all relevant rows for the existence of said values\n\nAnalyze all relevant rows from step 3 and verify if they match our claim. We can do this by examining the corresponding cells in each table row.\n\n#### Step 5: Output answer\nAfter following these steps, we will output whether or not Didi Benami has an order of number 4 for both the \"top 20 (10 women)\" and \"top 16 (8 women)\" categories.\n\nBased on our analysis:\n\n- For the first category (\"week top 20 (10 women)\"), check if row index 3 is 9 and value in 'order' equals to 4.\n- For the second category (\"week top 16 (8 women)\"), check if row index 2 is 5 and value in 'order' equals to 4.\n\n#### Step 6: Verify claim\n\nUpon further inspection, we see that for both categories Didi Benami indeed has an \"order\" equal to 9 and 5 respectively. But the order number should be equal to 4 for both, since she is stated as being at position 4 in our claim.\n\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"order\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"order\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"order\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"order\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Extract the relevant information from the table:\n   - The claim mentions two pieces of information: a song title (\"the way i am\") and a theme (\"billboard hot 100 hits\").\n   - According to the data, Ingrid Michaelson sang \"The Way I Am\" (not \"the way i am\") in the Top 24 (12 women) episode with the Billboard Hot 100 Hits theme.\n\n2. Determine if the claim is True or False based on the extracted information:\n   - The song title and theme match according to the data, but the name of the performer (\"Ingrid Michaelson\" instead of \"the beatles\") does not.\n   - The correct interpretation would be: Ingrid Michaelson sang a song titled \"The Way I Am\" as part of a Billboard Hot 100 Hits episode.\n\n3. Find the relevant rows in the table:\n   - The first row is Top 24 (12 women).\n   - The second row is Top 20 (10 women).\n\n4. Check if \"the way i am\" was one of 5 song choices for a Billboard Hot 100 hits theme.\n   - According to the data, there were five songs selected for that specific episode (\"billboard hot 100 hits\").\n   - We must verify which one is \"The Way I Am\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since we verified earlier that Ingrid Michaelson sang \"The Way I Am\" but not as a Billboard Hot 100 Hits selection with her name, the claim can be considered incorrect because it specifically refers to \"the beatles\" instead of \"Ingrid Michaelson\".\n- However, it is true that there were five song choices in that episode.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": \"The claim mentions a specific song with the correct theme but incorrectly identifies the artist.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"However, the correct version of the song is by Ingrid Michaelson, not The Beatles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Given that there were five songs in the Billboard Hot 100 Hits episode, it seems like it could be true that one of them was selected.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"order\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"song choice\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the theme**: The table has a column named \"theme\". We need to check if there's a week with a Bollywood theme.\n\n2. **Find the relevant week(s)**: Look for the \"week\" column in the table. It contains values like \"audition\", \"hollywood\", etc. Since we are looking for a week with a Bollywood theme, we can ignore the first two (\"audition\" and \"hollywood\") as they don't match our criteria.\n\n3. **Find the Bollywood-themed song(s)**: Now, let's find the songs that were performed during a week with a Bollywood theme (the third value in each row). The relevant rows are:\n   - Hollywood\n   - Hollywood\n\n4. **Check if \"terrified\" is one of the Bollywood-themed song(s)**: Look at the \"song choice\" column for the two Hollywood weeks. Both have songs titled \"Terrified\". Since both weeks match our criteria, we need to verify that \"terrified\" was indeed one of these two songs.\n\n5. **Confirm the row index and column name**: The rows are indexed starting from 1 (the first week is at index 2). In this case, since we're interested in verifying if \"terrified\" was sung during a Bollywood-themed week (\"hollywood\"), we should focus on the row with index 3. The corresponding column names would be:\n   - Row Index: 3\n   - Column Name: Song Choice\n\n6. **Verify the claim**: Based on our steps, if we can confirm that \"terrified\" was indeed one of the songs performed during a week with a Bollywood theme (specifically, in the Hollywood week), then the claim is True.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince both weeks were titled \"hollywood\", and both had the song \"terrified\", the claim that \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme\" is indeed True.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the theme\",\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"theme\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the relevant week(s)\",\n      \"row_index\": [2, 3],\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the Bollywood-themed song(s)\",\n      \"row_index\": [2, 3],\n      \"column_name\": \"song choice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if \\\"terrified\\\" is one of the Bollywood-themed song(s)\\\",\",\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"song choice\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
