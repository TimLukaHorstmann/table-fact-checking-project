Therefore, the bowler with 13 wickets (ray lindwall) appears in more match than the bowler with 11 wickets (ernie toshack).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extracting data for bowlers with 13 wickets\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extracting data for bowlers with 11 wickets\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Checking the number of matches played by each bowler\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing the number of matches played by the two bowlers\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determining if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"matches\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object represents our step-by-step reasoning process, including the final answer and relevant cells in the table.",

First, we need to identify the players who are from England.\n   - The column name for team information is \"team\".\n   - We can see that Alec Bedser and Norman Yardley have teams listed as \"england\".\n\n2. Next, we will find the number of wickets each English player has taken in order to compare with Bill Johnston's statistics.\n   - For Alec Bedser: 18\n   - For Norman Yardley: 9\n\n3. Now, let's look at Bill Johnston's statistics:\n   - The column for wicket information is \"wickets\".\n   - Bill Johnston has 27 wickets.\n\n4. Based on the above steps, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding in the claim, as not all England players seem to have taken the same number of wickets as Bill Johnston.\n\n5. However, we also need to check if any other English player has taken more wickets than Bill Johnston.\n   - Alec Bedser took 18 wickets which is less than Bill Johnston's 27 wickets.\n\n6. After re-reading the claim and re-checking the data, it seems that the claim \"all of the england player take as many wicket as bill johnston\" is not true for all England players.\n\n7.
