First, we need to find the score for North Melbourne.\n   - In the table, there is one team named \"north melbourne\". \n   - The scores for this team can be found in the second row of data:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"st kilda\",\n       \"15.9 (99)\",\n       \"north melbourne\",\n       \"17.19 (121)\",\n       \"moorabbin oval\",\n       17811,\n       \"7 june 1975\"\n     ]\n   ```\n   - The score for North Melbourne is the third element of this row, which is `\"17.19 (121)\"`.\n2. Next, we need to find the highest score among all teams.\n   - We can do this by iterating through each row in the data and comparing their scores.\n   - In the table, there are six rows:\n     ```\n     [\n       \"geelong\",\n       \"14.20 (104)\",\n       \"melbourne\",\n       \"14.14 (98)\",\n       \"kardinia park\",\n       13328,\n       \"7 june 1975\"\n     ],\n     [\n       \"st kilda\",\n       \"15.9 (99)\",\n       \"north melbourne\",\n       \"17.19 (121)\",\n       \"moorabbin oval\",\n       17811,\n       \"7 june 1975\"\n     ],\n     [\n       \"richmond\",\n       \"19.14 (128)\",\n       \"essendon\",\n       \"12.9 (81)\",\n       \"mcg\",\n       49469,\n       \"7 june 1975\"\n     ],\n     [\n       \"hawthorn\",\n       \"19.24 (138)\",\n       \"collingwood\",\n       \"13.11 (89)\",\n       \"princes park\",\n       23830,\n       \"7 june 1975\"\n     ],\n     [\n       \"fitzroy\",\n       \"15.7 (97)\",\n       \"carlton\",\n       \"16.10 (106)\",\n       \"junction oval\",\n       16249,\n       \"7 june 1975\"\n     ],\n     [\n       \"footscray\",\n       \"13.11 (89)\",\n       \"south melbourne\",\n       \"12.15 (87)\",\n       \"vfl park\",\n       14056,\n       \"7 june 1975\"\n     ]\n   ```\n   - The scores are in the format `X.XX (score)`, where `X` is a number and `XX` represents the score's decimal part.\n   - We can convert these strings to integers by taking the first part of the string, removing the parentheses, and converting it to an integer. Then we compare them:\n     ```\n      128 > 121\n       No, 138 > 121\n    ```\n- Now that we have converted all scores to integers, we need to determine which is the highest.\n   - The highest score of North Melbourne (`17.19`) is indeed higher than the other scores in this row.\n   - We compare it with other rows:\n     ```\n       No, 138 > 121 and 138 > 128\n    ```\n- Now that we have compared all scores to find the highest one, we can output our final answer.\n\nHere is the code in python, following your required format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis code will convert all the row and column names to indices, find which team has the highest score and print it in the required format.",
