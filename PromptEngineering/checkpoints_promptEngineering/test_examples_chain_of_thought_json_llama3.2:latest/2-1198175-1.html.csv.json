    "resp": "Here are the steps for evaluating the claim:\n\n1. **List all students who were undrafted**: Looking at the table, we can see that there are two columns that indicate if a player was \"undrafted\": one column has \"undrafted\" explicitly written in it, while another column indicates draft position as \"rX\" where X is a number (indicating no pick). We will check both.\n\n2. **Count the number of undrafted students**: After identifying all relevant cells for this claim, count how many are true. In this case, we'll need to look at every row and determine if the student was indeed undrafted according to one or both criteria, since not all players' drafts are listed in \"rX\", but all players from ca technical high school can be checked via either method.\n\n3. **Compare with claim**: After counting the number of students who were undrafted, compare this count to the claim's assertion that there are four such students.\n\n4. **Determine if the claim is true or false based on step 3**.\n\n\nHere is our step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- First, we will find all relevant cells indicating a player was not drafted:\n- We can see from the \"drafted\" column of each row that only one player is explicitly stated to be undrafted (\"walter clago\"). In order to verify if there are more players who were not picked by a team (from either this column or rX), we will look in the table for students whose draft positions indicated no pick:\n- \"ben john paolucci\" has an entry of \"undrafted\"\n- The player named \"pat ivey\" is also listed as undrafted\n- We have found 2 players that were not drafted from ca technical high school according to these rules.\n- Next, we will check all students who are supposed to be from the mentioned high school (ca technical), and verify their draft status:\n- Walter Clago is indeed a student from the relevant state: \"6 / / 1899 detroit , mi\"\n- Darris McCord does not match\n- Ben John Paolucci is not stated to come from Detroit, but his college was Wayne State\n- Arnie Simkus's school is Michigan, so it does not meet this rule as well\n- David Boone, Jr. and Aaron Kyle are also not students from the mentioned state\n- Tom Seabron is a student from Michigan\n- Harlan Huckleby is a student from Detroit, which meets our criteria.\n- Curtis Greer's school was Michigan, so he does not qualify.\n- Guy Frazier's location was in Detroit as well, and thus also qualifies as a member of ca technical high school based on the claim that their location should match\n- This brings us to 3 students who were undrafted (with at least one student being from ca technical high school), but we still need to check the last player mentioned, Thomas Sidney Sims: He is indeed a student from Detroit Michigan\n- We have now identified four players from the relevant high school that were undrafted.\n \nHere's our output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"drafted\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"drafted\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"drafted\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"drafted\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"drafted\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. Check if Arnold Simkus was a student at Michigan college: Look at cell (0, 3) which contains \"michigan\". Since there is no other name besides Arnold's that has this place, we can conclude that it indeed refers to the University of Michigan.\n\n2. Count how many times the name 'michigan' or any part of it appears in a cell. In the given table, names containing 'michigan' are found at cells (0, 3), (6, 3), and (13, 4). That is three students, so now we have one possible answer which states that Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus aren't both part of six student that went to Michigan college.\n\n3. Check if Will Campbell was a student at Michigan college: Look at cell (15, 3) which contains \"michigan\". Since there is no other name besides Will's that has this place, we can conclude that it indeed refers to the University of Michigan.\n\n4. Count how many times the name 'michigan' or any part of it appears in a cell. In the given table, names containing 'michigan' are found at cells (0, 3), (6, 3), and (15, 3) along with cell (13, 4). That is four students, so now we have another possible answer which states that Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus aren't both part of six student that went to Michigan college.\n\n5. Check if there are any other students at the University of Michigan: Look at cells (0, 3), (6, 3), and (15, 3) as they are the only ones containing 'michigan'. Therefore, we can conclude that these three names indeed refer to the University of Michigan.\n\nBased on our findings so far, since there are four students from the University of Michigan in total but only two of them were mentioned by name, we have one more piece of information. \n\n6. Determine how many other students there were that went to the University of Michigan: Since cells (0, 3), (6, 3), and (15, 3) are all part of the 'michigan' group, look at cell (13, 4) which also contains 'michigan'. Therefore, we can conclude that there was indeed another student besides Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus who went to Michigan college.\n\n7. Determine how many students from the University of Michigan were not mentioned by name: Look at cells (0, 3), (6, 3), (15, 3), and (13, 4). Since only three names were found that had 'michigan' in them, we can conclude that there was indeed another student besides Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus who went to Michigan college.\n\n8. Check if the total number of students is six: Based on our findings so far, since there are four other cells that have 'michigan' in them, look at cell (13, 4) which also contains 'michigan'. However, this name does not appear as part of a student's name. Since it appears at the end of the row instead, we can conclude that it indeed refers to the University of Michigan but does not contain any other names besides Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus.\n\n9. Determine how many students from the University of Michigan were mentioned by name: Based on our findings so far, since cells (0, 3), (6, 3), and (15, 3) are all part of the 'michigan' group, we can conclude that these three names indeed refer to the University of Michigan.\n\n10. Determine how many students from the University of Michigan were not mentioned by name: Based on our findings so far, since cell (13, 4) contains a student's name, we can conclude that it does not contain any other names besides Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus.\n\nBased on our findings so far, since there are four cells with 'michigan' in them but only two of the students were mentioned by name, we have one more piece of information.\n\n11. Check how many other students went to Michigan college: Based on our findings so far, since cell (0, 3) and (6, 3) contain a student's name while the other cells also contained a student's name as well as names with 'michigan' in them but are not part of that name, we can conclude that there were indeed more students who went to Michigan college besides Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus.\n\n12. Count how many students there are that went to Michigan college: Based on our findings so far, since cells (0, 3), (6, 3), (13, 4), (15, 3) all contain a student's name but not necessarily as part of the 'michigan' name, we can conclude that there were indeed six students who went to Michigan college in total.\n\nNow we know that Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus are two out of the six students from the University of Michigan. Therefore, based on our findings so far, since there were indeed six students who went to Michigan college and Will Campbell and Arnold Simkus are part of them but are not both part of only two names, we can conclude that the answer is FALSE.\n\n\n\nHere's the code to write this in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"College Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"College Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"College Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"College Name\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"Name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\" : 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"Name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The reference to \"CA Technical High School\" seems out of place as it does not match any known historical context for any NFL player. Therefore, we should conclude that this claim is referring to the college attended by 16 NFL players.\n\n### Step 3: Identify relevant data from the table.\nWe can identify relevant cell values from the 'data' section of the json table:\n- Each row represents a different NFL player.\n- We need to find out how many of these players went through a California high school before entering the college system.\n\nLooking at each row, only one player attended a \"CA Technical High School\" (or possibly another name for it), but this is not explicitly stated in any given cell. However we can determine that none match exactly with the name CA Technical High School; instead some of the players went through California schools. So for the purpose of this problem, let's look at player details from colleges like \"California\" or \"California State University\", or simply see how many were drafted and therefore are part of a college system.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of relevant players.\nOut of the given data, we can observe that none of them attended CA Technical High School. However if we consider other California schools - then there is one player from Wayne State (Michigan) who went to Michigan's football rival school (that has a high reputation in California) and another 5 players with California colleges:\n\n1.
