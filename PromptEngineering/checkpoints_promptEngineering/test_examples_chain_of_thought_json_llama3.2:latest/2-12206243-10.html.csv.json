If the score is indeed 3 - 0, then the claim is likely true.\n\n3. **Find the Relevant Entry**: Search for the row with \"september 1\" as its value in the 'date' column. Once found, extract its corresponding values from the other columns to verify the claim.\n\n4. **Compare Values**: If the score for September 1 matches \"3 - 0\", and the attendance is 19196, then the claim can be confirmed as true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"score\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 0,\n    \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n5. **Verify Attendance**: Confirm that the attendance for September 1 is indeed 19196.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the verification of the score and attendance, determine if the claim is true or false.\n\n### Conclusion in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check the 'score' column for the September 1 entry\",\n    \"Verify the attendance value matches 19196\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
