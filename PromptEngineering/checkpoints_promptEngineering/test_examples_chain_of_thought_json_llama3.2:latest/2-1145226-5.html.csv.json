    "resp": "Step 1: Determine the data type of the claim. The claim states \"all of the player have already finish their span of play on the united state national rugby union team\", which implies a universal affirmative statement.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each row in the table to check if all players have completed their playing period. We will start from the first row and move down to the last row, examining each cell value for \"span\".\n\nStep 3: Check if the span of player \"vaea anitoni\" includes a year range that has ended. The span is given as \"1992 - 2000\", which indicates that this period has passed.\n\nStep 4: Check if the span of player \"paul emerick\" includes a year range that has ended. The span is given as \"2003 - 2012\", which also indicates that this period has passed.\n\nStep 5: Check if the span of player \"todd clever\" includes a year range that has ended. The span is given as \"2003 -\", which means that it started in 2003 but no end date is specified. This suggests that Todd's playing period may not have ended yet.\n\nStep 6: Check if the span of player \"philip eloff\" includes a year range that has ended. The span is given as \"2000 - 2007\", which indicates that this period has passed.\n\nStep 7: Check if the span of player \"takudzwa ngwenya\" includes a year range that has ended. The span is given as \"2007 -\", which means that it started in 2007 but no end date is specified. This suggests that Takudzwa's playing period may not have ended yet.\n\nStep 8: Check if the span of player \"chris wyles\" includes a year range that has ended. The span is given as \"2007 -\", which means that it started in 2007 but no end date is specified. This suggests that Chris's playing period may not have ended yet.\n\nStep 9: Check if the span of player \"david fee\" includes a year range that has ended. The span is given as \"2002 - 2005\", which indicates that this period has passed.\n\nStep 10: Check if the span of player \"mike hercus\" includes a year range that has ended.

The span is given as \"2003 - 2004\", which indicates that this period has passed.\n\n\nStep 12: After analyzing each row, it's clear that not all players have completed their playing periods. Specifically, Todd Clever and Chris Wyles are still active in their respective spans.\n\nStep 13: Since at least one player (Todd Clever) is still active in his span of play on the united state national rugby union team, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"span\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer: FALSE",
