Specifically, we should look at the \"event\" column to identify draws and then count how many matches result from these draws.\n\n### Step 3: Examine the table for draws\nA draw is indicated when the event value in the table equals 3. We will check if there are any matches where this condition is true.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of draws resulting from a match outcome\nAfter identifying the relevant rows (rows with an event value equal to 3), we need to determine if these draws resulted from losses or wins since both can lead to a draw (e.g., a win by decision after a draw). If there are no wins or losses before a draw, it typically means the fight ended in a draw.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the claim based on findings\nIf we find any row where an event value equals 3 and this value does not directly indicate a loss or win (e.g., a decision), then the claim that only one match result in the result of a draw is false. If no such case exists, the claim might be true.\n\n### Step 6: Output findings\nWe will summarize our findings in a JSON object, detailing our chain of thought and the answer to the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"List relevant data for claim evaluation\",\n      \"description\": \"Table's 'data' section examined\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Determine if there are any draws in the table\",\n      \"description\": \"Event value equals 3 indicates a draw\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Check each row with event value equal to 3\",\n      \"description\": \"Rows examined for match outcomes before or following the draw\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Identify if any of these draws resulted in a loss or win (or both) prior to them\",\n      \"description\": \"Assess if the draw is the result of an outcome rather than a standalone result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nGiven the analysis, there are multiple draws in the table without a preceding loss or win. This indicates that not only one match result in the result of a draw, but rather more than one, contradicting the claim.",
