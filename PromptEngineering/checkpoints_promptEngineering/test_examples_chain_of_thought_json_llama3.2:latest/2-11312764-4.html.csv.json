Next, we will compare her points with 112.28 to determine if she came in last place.\n\nNow let us do this step-by-step:\n\n- We can get Natailas index by finding the row that corresponds to \"natalia strelkova\" - The only possible way is searching for all rows where 'name' equals \"natalia strelkova\" or looking at the table data.\n  ```\n  {\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Find the index of Natalia Strelkova's row in the data\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"The rows that have 'natalia strelkova' are found by iterating over every row\",\n        \"code\": [\n          {\n            \"line_number\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"data\",\n            \"value\": \"[[\\\"natalia strelkova\\\", \\\"...\\\"]]\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []},\n  ```\n\n- Next, we will compare her points with 112.28\n- This value can be found in the cells for Natailas row - So now that we have Nataila's index and that she has a lower score than 112.28, we must find if this score is greater than any other in the table.\n  ```\n  {\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Find the rank of Natalia Strelkova's points\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"The value for 'points' equals 164.94 - We can see this by going to row 13\",\n        \"code\": [\n          {\n            \"line_number\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"data[2]\",\n            \"value\": \"[\\\"natalia strelkova\\\", \\\"164.94\\\"]\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Find the rank of the lowest points in the table\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"This value is found by searching for the minimum point - This can be seen when iterating over every row\",\n        \"code\": [\n          {\n            \"line_number\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"data[6]\",\n            \"value\": \"[\\\"shin hae sook\\\", \\\"120.44\\\"]\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"description\": \"Determine if Nataila Strelkova came in last place with the lowest points\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"Since we know her score and the lowest possible value, we can determine that she does not come in last\",\n        \"code\": [\n          {\n            \"line_number\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"\",\n            \"value\": \"\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []},\n  ```\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Find the index of Natalia Strelkova's row in the data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"The rows that have 'natalia strelkova' are found by iterating over every row\",\n      \"code\": [\n        {\n          \"line_number\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"data\",\n          \"value\": \"[[\\\"natalia strelkova\\\", \\\"...\\\"]]\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Find the rank of Natalia Strelkova's points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"The value for 'points' equals 164.94 - We can see this by going to row 13\",\n      \"code\": [\n        {\n          \"line_number\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"data[2]\",\n          \"value\": \"[\\\"natalia strelkova\\\", \\\"164.94\\\"]\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Find the rank of the lowest points in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"This value is found by searching for the minimum point - This can be seen when iterating over every row\",\n      \"code\": [\n        {\n          \"line_number\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"data[6]\",\n          \"value\": \"[\\\"shin hae sook\\\", \\\"120.44\\\"]\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if Nataila Strelkova came in last place with the lowest points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"Since we know her score and the lowest possible value, we can determine that she does not come in last\",\n      \"code\": [\n        {\n          \"line_number\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"\",\n          \"value\": \"\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
