    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Extract the Data from the Table\nFirst, we need to extract all the relevant data points from the table, specifically focusing on May 27th games where only one away team won.\n\n### Step 2: Filter Games Won by Richmond on May 27th\nNext, we filter the data to find any game on May 27th where Richmond won. Richmond is identified as the \"away team\".\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Find Out How Many Richmond Won on May 27th\nNow, we check how many games were won by Richmond.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. First, we need to extract the scores from the table for Collingwood, St Kilda, and Melbourne.\n\n   - The score for Collingwood is 28.16 (184).\n   - The score for St Kilda is 9.19 (73) + 5.6 (36) = 14.79.\n   - The combined score of St Kilda and Melbourne is 73 + 36 = 109.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if Collingwood's score is half as many points as the combined score of St Kilda and Melbourne.\n\n3. To do this, we will calculate half of St Kilda and Melbourne's combined score by dividing it by 2: (109) / 2 = 54.5\n\n4. Now, we compare Collingwood's score to this calculated value. We need to convert both scores into a format that allows for comparison.\n\n   - Convert Collingwood's score from a string to an integer or float for easy comparison.\n   - Convert the calculated half of St Kilda and Melbourne's combined score from a decimal number to an integer or float, which is 55 in this case, as there are no more decimal places.\n\n5. Now we compare these two values to determine if Collingwood scored exactly half of what St Kilda and Melbourne have when added together: 55 != 184.\n\n6. Given that the comparison does not equal true (184 is not equal to 55), our final answer will be false.\n\n\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\nStep 1: Extract all teams' scores from the table.\n- From the table, we can extract the following scores:\n  - Footscray: 81 points\n  - South Melbourne: 64 points\n  - Fitzroy: 97 points\n  - Richmond: 105 points\n  - Hawthorn: 105 points\n  - Essendon: 107 points\n  - Collingwood: 184 points\n  - Geelong: 109 points\n  - Carlton: 109 points\n  - North Melbourne: 47 points\n  - St Kilda: 73 points\n  - Melbourne: 36 points\n\nStep 2: Sort the teams' scores in descending order.\n- Sorting the teams' scores, we get:\n  - Essendon: 107 points\n  - Collingwood: 184 points\n  - Fitzroy: 97 points\n  - Hawthorn: 105 points\n  - Richmond: 105 points\n  - Geelong: 109 points\n  - Carlton: 109 points\n  - Footscray: 81 points\n  - South Melbourne: 64 points\n  - St Kilda: 73 points\n  - North Melbourne: 47 points\n  - Melbourne: 36 points\n\nStep 3: Find the teams that scored less than 109 points.\n- From the sorted scores, we can see that the following two teams scored less than 109 points:\n  - North Melbourne: 47 points\n  - Melbourne: 36 points\n\nStep 4: Check if Geelong lose their game and score more points than all but two other teams on May 27th.\n- According to the table, both Richmond and Hawthorn scored more points than Geelong's score of 109 points. However, none of these two teams scored less than 109 points.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\n- Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE because Geelong lost their game but did not score more points than all but two other teams (Richmond and Hawthorn) on May 27th.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Extract scores from table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Sort the extracted scores in descending order\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find teams that scored less than 109 points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check Geelong's score against the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion based on analysis\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"geelong\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"richmond\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"hawthorn\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
