    "resp": "Step 1: Extract the dates from the table data.\nTo determine if the claim about the game schedule is true or false, we first need to find out which games were played on May 25, 1972. We will extract these specific dates by iterating over each row in the table's data.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through each row in the table's data and check for matches.\nWe'll iterate through each row in the \"data\" section of the table, checking if any of the rows have a date that matches May 25, 1972. We'll be looking at the \"date\" column of each row.\n\nStep 3: Check if there are any other dates that match the claim.\nSince we're interested in finding out if all six games were played on this specific date (May 25, 1972), we need to confirm that no other rows have dates matching this day. This is essential to validate our claim accurately.\n\nStep 4: Analyze each row for the specific date match and non-match.\nWe'll check every row in \"data\" against May 25, 1972, to determine if there's any instance of a different date, which would suggest that not all six games were played on this exact day.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"1: Extract dates from table\",\n      \"details\": \"Iterated through the table to find specific dates.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"2: Iterate and check for May 25, 1972 match\",\n      \"details\": \"Checked each row's date for May 25, 1972 matches.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"3: Confirm no other dates match the claim\",\n      \"details\": \"Confirmed that no other games were played on this specific date.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStep 5: Determine the final answer based on the chain of thought.\nGiven that there's at least one row with a date other than May 25, 1972 (the dates in the rows match May 20, 1972), we conclude that not all six games were played on this specific day.",
