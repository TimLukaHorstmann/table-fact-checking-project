If we find an entry where the entrant is \"Sasol Jordan Yamaha\" and the previous entry has a different team name, or if there's no previous entry with Leyton House Racing, then the claim could be true.\n\n### Step 3: Examine the row before the target row\nWe examine the row before the one with Sasol Jordan Yamaha as entrant. The last entry in the data array is:\n```\n[\n  1992,\n  \"sasol jordan yamaha\",\n  \"jordan 192\",\n  \"yamaha v12\",\n  0\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Examine the row before the one with Leyton House Racing\nWe examine the row before the one with Leyton House Racing. The last entry in the data array that has a team name is:\n```\n[\n  1991,\n  \"leyton house\",\n  \"leyton house cg911\",\n  \"ilmor v10\",\n  0\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Determine if there's a change of team from Leyton House Racing to Sasol Jordan Yamaha in 1989\nFrom the previous steps, we see that there is no row before the one with Sasol Jordan Yamaha in which the entrant was \"Leyton House Racing\" or \"leyton house\", which means there is no evidence to support the claim.\n\n### Step 6: Check if Sasol Jordan Yamaha took over for Leyton House Racing at some point, not necessarily in 1989\nIf we check again from step 3 and before it:\n```\n[\n  1992,\n  \"sasol jordan yamaha\",\n  \"jordan 192\",\n  \"yamaha v12\",\n  0\n]\n```\n\n```\n[\n  1991,\n  \"leyton house\",\n  \"leyton house cg911\",\n  \"ilmor v10\",\n  0\n]\n```\n\n```\n[\n  1990,\n  \"leyton house\",\n  \"leyton house cg901\",\n  \"judd v8\",\n  1\n]\n```\n\n```\n[\n  1989,\n  \"leyton house racing\",\n  \"march cg891\",\n  \"judd v8\",\n  4\n]\n```\n\n```\n[\n  1989,\n  \"leyton house racing\",\n  \"march 881\",\n  \"judd v8\",\n  4\n]\n```\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion on the claim\nWe can see that there was a team name change from March CG891 to March 881 for Leyton House Racing in 1989, but we cannot confirm if Sasol Jordan Yamaha took over because they were not present before 1990. However, it's clear that \"Sasol Jordan Yamaha\" did take over some time after the claim period started.\n\n### Step 7: Re-evaluate conclusion\nConsidering our data only goes up to 1992 and looking at how our previous steps are laid out - we can find the relevant information about Leyton House Racing before Sasol Jordan Yamaha by considering when \"Sasol Jordan Yamaha\" took over for them. The answer is then that there was no team name change from Leyton House Racing to Sasol Jordan Yamaha in 1989.\n\n### Step 8: Final analysis\nOur final step will involve creating a JSON response with our chain of thought, the answer as TRUE or FALSE and any relevant cells.\n\n### Step 9: Constructing the JSON response\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"analysis\": \"Analyze the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"analysis\": \"Check for entries in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"analysis\": \"Examine the row before the target row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"analysis\": \"Examine the row before the one with Leyton House Racing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"analysis\": \"Determine if there's a change of team from Leyton House Racing to Sasol Jordan Yamaha in 1989\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"analysis\": \"Check if Sasol Jordan Yamaha took over for Leyton House Racing at some point, not necessarily in 1989\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"analysis\": \"Conclusion on the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 8,\n      \"analysis\": \"Re-evaluate conclusion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 9,\n      \"analysis\": \"Final analysis\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 10: Final output\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"analysis\": \"Analyze the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"analysis\": \"Check for entries in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"analysis\": \"Examine the row before the target row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"analysis\": \"Examine the row before the one with Leyton House Racing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"analysis\": \"Determine if there's a change of team from Leyton House Racing to Sasol Jordan Yamaha in 1989\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"analysis\": \"Check if Sasol Jordan Yamaha took over for Leyton House Racing at some point, not necessarily in 1989\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"analysis\": \"Conclusion on the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 8,\n      \"analysis\": \"Re-evaluate conclusion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 9,\n      \"analysis\": \"Final analysis\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim mentions Gugelmin's auto, so I need to find Gugelmin's entry in the table.\n2. After searching the table, I found Gugelmin's entry: \n   {\n     \"year\": 1990,\n     \"entrant\": \"sasol jordan yamaha\",\n     \"chassis\": \"leyton house cg901\",\n     \"engine\": \"judd v8\",\n     \"pts\": 1\n   }\n3. Now I need to check if the chassis changed over time for Gugelmin's auto.\n4. According to the table, the chassis is 'leyton house cg901' in year 1990 and there is no other entry with the same chassis name that belongs to gugelmin for a different year before the given claim year\n5. However, I can see that for the year 1989 (one year prior) Gugelmins chassis was \"march cg891\". This implies that Gugelmin's chassis did change from march cg891 to leyton house cg901\n6. Now let's verify if we also have another entry of March with the same chassis name after claim year in order to disprove or support our answer.\n7. According to the table, there is no other entry for the year 1991 (the year right after Gugelmins entry), where the Chassis was \"march 881\" and it belongs to gugelmin.\n8. Since there is another March chassis entry in a different row and year that belongs to gugelmin, our initial assumption of leyton house cg901 being his final chassis is wrong.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"chassis\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
