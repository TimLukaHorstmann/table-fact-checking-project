However, we can still calculate the difference between \"United States\" and \"Japan\".\n\n2. Extract the relevant medal counts:\n   - United States gold: 4\n   - Japan gold: 3\n\n3. Calculate the total medals won by each country:\n   - Total for the United States = Gold + Silver + Bronze = 4 + 8 + 9 = 21\n   - Total for Japan = Gold + Silver + Bronze = 3 + 2 + 3 = 8\n\n4. Find the difference in total medals between \"United States\" and \"Japan\":\n   - Difference = 21 (Total for United States) - 8 (Total for Japan) = 13\n   - Since the problem states that the United States win a total of 13 more medals than Japan, this value must be correct.\n\n5. Verify if the difference is indeed 13:\n   - The data in the table confirms that the total medal count for \"United States\" (21) minus the total medal count for \"Japan\" (8) equals 13.\n\n6.
