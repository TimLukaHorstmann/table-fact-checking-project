    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We need to find a television service that has both \"sport news\" as content and only one option.\n2. We can do this by looking for a cell with \"content\" equal to \"sport news\", where there is only one option available.\n\nLet's list out all the relevant cells:\n\n- Cell (4, 8): content = \"promozionale\"\n- Cell (4, 9): content = \"qualsiasi tranne sky hd\"\n- Cell (4, 10): content = \"qualsiasi\"\n- Cell (5, 7): content = \"calcio , ppv wrestling\"\n\nHowever, we can see that none of the above cells have \"sport news\" as their content. Therefore, our reasoning leads us to look at other options.\n\nWe notice that in the following cell:\n \nCell (4, 8) has content equal to \"promozionale\", while Cell (4, 9) has a value of \"qualsiasi tranne sky hd\". However, since we need \"sport news\" as our content and \"promozionale\" is not the same thing as \"sport news\", this does not help us.\n\nWe now look at another cell:\n\nCell(2,8):content = \"calcio , ppv wrestling\". We see that \"calcio , ppv wrestling\" contains a sport (calcio) but it also includes other stuff (\"ppv wrestling\"), which is not what we want. However, it does contain the word \"sport\", so it could be argued that this cell has \"sport news\" as content.\n\nSo our reasoning steps are:\n\n- Look for a television service with both \"sport news\" as content and only one option.\n- We find no such services in cells (4, 8), (4, 9) or (4,10).\n- However, we do find a cell (2,8) that contains the word \"sport\", even though it's not exactly what we want.

We need to compare this data against our claim to see if it matches.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Relevant Rows\nWe will iterate through the rows in the dataset where 'calcio' and 'ppv wrestling' are both present as content. \n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"cartello promozionale sky hd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wwe 24 / 7\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"cartello promozionale sky hd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Comparing Data Against Claim\nWe will compare the rows where 'calcio' and 'ppv wrestling' are present as content against our claim. We need to check if exactly four out of these rows match our condition.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wwe 24 / 7\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"cartello promozionale sky hd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nAfter comparing our data against the claim, we see that three rows have 'calcio , ppv wrestling' as content. Therefore, the condition is not met.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Understanding the Problem\",\n    \"Step 2: Preparing Data\",\n    \"Step 3: Identifying Relevant Rows\",\n    \"Step 4: Comparing Data Against Claim\",\n    \"Step 5: Conclusion\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wwe 24 / 7\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"cartello promozionale sky hd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n{ \n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Understanding the Problem\",\n    \"Step 2: Preparing Data\",\n    \"Step 3: Identifying Relevant Rows\",\n    \"Step 4: Comparing Data Against Claim\",\n    \"Step 5: Conclusion\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wwe 24 / 7\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"cartello promozionale sky hd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"promozionale\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
