We can do this by looking at the \"data\" section of the table and finding the rows where the date matches \"13 february 2000\".\n\n2. After identifying the relevant row(s), we will count the number of goals scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez.\n\n3. Next, we need to check if there are any other years where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal in international competitions. We can do this by comparing our result from step 2 with the results for each year (i.e., the \"score\" column).\n\n4. If our count from step 2 is only 1, then we know that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score more than 1 goal in any other year besides 2000.\n\n5. To confirm this, we will compare our result with the results for each year to ensure there are no other instances where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal in international competitions.\n\n6. Finally, if we can prove that Rafael M\u00e1rquez only scored 1 goal in 2000 and did not score more than 1 goal in any other year, then our claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n7.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the year when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal in an international competition.\n   We will look at each row of the table, starting from index 2 (the first row) since the dates are in a non-standard format and we don't want to process them for now.\n\n2. For each row, we need to check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez is playing as a defender by checking his \"position\" key (which isn't present), or find any information about him (such as goals scored) from the competition data.\n   Since there's no position in the table, we will use the \"competition\" column instead and look for competitions that involve players with names related to Rafael M\u00e1rquez.\n\n3. Let's look at row 2:\n   - The date is \"13 february 2000\".\n   - The competition is \"2000 concacaf gold cup\".\n   - The score is \"1 - 0\" which indicates only one goal.\n   \n4. Now, let's look at row 12:\n   - The date is \"12 june 2011\".\n   - The competition is \"2011 concacaf gold cup\".\n   - The score is \"1 - 0\" which also indicates only one goal.\n\n5. From the given claim that Rafael M\u00e1rquez had more than one goal in international competitions, we need to find a year where he scored more than one goal.\n   It seems like he did this multiple times throughout his career.\n\n6. However, since we can't directly get information about goals scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez from the table provided, and considering that no row contains any player data or statistics other than those of the players in their respective competitions, we should verify if 2000 is indeed one of these years.\n   Let's take a closer look at row 2 again.\n\n7. We can see that in 2000 concacaf gold cup Rafael M\u00e1rquez was playing and scored only one goal, so this isn't an instance where he scored more than one goal.\n   \n8. Since the problem statement asks us to verify if 2000 is indeed one of two years when Rafael M\u00e1rquez had a score over 1 in an international competition, we will verify another year from the provided data.\n\n9. Let's look at row 7:\n   - The date is \"7 september 2005\".\n   - The competition is \"2006 world cup qualifier\".\n   - The score is \"2 - 0\" which indicates two goals.\n   \n10. Now, let's verify if there's any other instance of Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in an international competition:\n    Since we're only looking for years where he scored more than 1 goal in an international competition and have found the first instance (2005), we don't need to look further.\n    The statement that \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" would only be true if there was another year with Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal.\n\n11. Since we've already verified row 7 and there's no other instance of Rafael M\u00e1rquez having scored more than one goal, the claim that \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\" is FALSE.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"We will start by finding Rafael M\u00e1rquez's score data for each year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Now, we need to verify if 2000 is one of two years when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than 1 goal in an international competition.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"We can see that Rafael M\u00e1rquez played and scored only 1 goal in 2000 concacaf gold cup.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Now, we need to verify if there's any other instance of Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in an international competition.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Since we've already verified row 7 and there's no other instance of Rafael M\u00e1rquez having scored more than one goal, the claim that \\\"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition\\\" is FALSE.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

For the year 2006, we need to find if Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal (1 - 0 is considered as a score). Also, for the year 2010, we need to verify if Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score any goals.\n\n### Step 3: Find the relevant data for the year 2006\nLooking at the table:\n- In row 8, \"24 june 2006\", the 'score' is \"1 - 0\". So, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\n### Step 4: Verify that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score any goals during the 2010 FIFA World Cup\n- In row 11, \"11 june 2010\", the 'score' is \"1 - 1\". This indicates that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the claim is true or false based on the findings\nSince we found out Rafael M\u00e1rquez did score a goal in both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, the claim \"rafael m\u00e1rquez score a goal at the 2006 , but remain scoreless during the 2010 fifa world cup\" is False.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the specific claim to be verified\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate the relevant data for each year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the relevant data for the year 2006\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score any goals during the 2010 FIFA World Cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if the claim is true or false based on the findings\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}",

    "resp": "#### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant information in the table:\n   - We need to find instances where Mexico loses an international competition.\n   - A loss is indicated by a \"result\" of either \"3 - 0\", \"4 - 0\", or \"2 - 1\".\n   - The player's goal must be scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez.\n\n2. Filter the table based on these criteria:\n   - Mexico loses in international competitions: \n     * Looking at the \"competition\" column, we identify international competitions as those that are not labeled as \"friendly\". These include \"1999 carlsberg cup\", \"2000 concacaf gold cup\", \"2002 world cup qualifier\", \"2006 world cup qualifier\", and \"2010 fifa world cup\".\n   - Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal:\n     * We look for rows where the player Rafael M\u00e1rquez has scored a goal. The column name is \"score\".\n\n3. Count the occurrences of Mexico losing in international competitions when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal:\n   - For each row that satisfies both conditions, count it as one occurrence.\n\n4. Determine if the total number of occurrences matches or exceeds 2 (since there are two times mentioned in the claim).\n   - If yes, then the statement is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n5. List relevant rows and their corresponding column indices:\n   - Include row index and the name of the \"score\" column for each relevant occurrence.\n   - These will help verify the claims.\n\n#### Execution:\n\nBased on the conditions identified in step 2, filter rows in the table that satisfy both criteria: \n- Loss in international competition\n- Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal\n\nExecuting these steps reveals there are no instances where Mexico loses an international competition and Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores exactly one goal; however, for \"2006 fifa world cup\" Rafael M\u00e1rquez is credited with 1 goal. But this time he scored while Mexico lost (1-2), which matches the claim's criteria.\n\nHere is the relevant cell data:\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ \n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is in JSON format and contains the chain of thought leading to the conclusion that the claim is true.",
