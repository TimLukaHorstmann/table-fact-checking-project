We need to check which one corresponds to episode 9. Assuming the row with the highest \"no in series\" is episode 9 (based on standard TV naming conventions).\n\n### Step 4: Find episode 10 in the season\nOnce we have found the row for episode 9, we can sort the columns again and find the row corresponding to episode 10.\n\n### Step 5: Check if episode 10 air 1 week after episode 9 in the season\nWe will calculate the difference between the \"original air date\" of episode 10 and episode 9.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. To solve this problem, we need to compare the total viewership of episode 1 and 2 together with the total viewership of any two episodes combined.\n2. Let's first find the total viewership for episodes 1 and 2. The data is in the following cells:\n   - Episode 1: row_index = 0, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Episode 2: row_index = 1, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n\n3. Cell 0: us viewers (million) = 15.07\n4. Cell 1: us viewers (million) = 15.75\n5. Now we need to find the total viewership of any two episodes combined. Let's consider all possible pairs:\n   - Pair 1: Episodes 1 and 2, already found in steps 3-4.\n   - Pair 2: Episode 3 and episode 4, cell values are in row_index = 2, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\" and row_index = 27, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Pair 3: Episode 3 and episode 5, same as pair 2.\n   - Pair 4: Episode 3 and episode 6, cell values are in row_index = 26, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\" and row_index = 29, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Pair 5: Episode 3 and episode 7, same as pair 2.\n   - Pair 6: Episode 3 and episode 8, cell values are in row_index = 26, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\" and row_index = 31, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Pair 7: Episode 4 and episode 5, same as pair 2.\n   - Pair 8: Episode 4 and episode 6, cell values are in row_index = 27, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\" and row_index = 29, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Pair 9: Episode 4 and episode 7, same as pair 2.\n   - Pair 10: Episode 4 and episode 8, cell values are in row_index = 27, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\" and row_index = 31, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Pair 11: Episode 5 and episode 6, same as pair 2.\n   - Pair 12: Episode 5 and episode 7, cell values are in row_index = 28, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\" and row_index = 29, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Pair 13: Episode 5 and episode 8, same as pair 2.\n   - Pair 14: Episode 6 and episode 7, cell values are in row_index = 28, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\" and row_index = 31, column_name = \"us viewers (million)\"\n   - Pair 15: Episode 6 and episode 8, same as pair 2.\n   - Pair 16: Episode 7 and episode 8, same as pair 3.\n\nNow we need to calculate the total viewership for each pair:\n- Pair 1: 15.07 + 15.75 = 30.82\n- Pair 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, and 17 (same as pair 2): 30.82.\n- Pair 4: 14.34 + 14.98 = 29.32\n- Pair 8: 14.85 + 14.84 = 29.69\n\nAfter checking all possible combinations of two episodes, we see that the total viewership for episode 1 and episode 2 (30.82) is greater than any other pair.\n\nNow let's output the answer in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
