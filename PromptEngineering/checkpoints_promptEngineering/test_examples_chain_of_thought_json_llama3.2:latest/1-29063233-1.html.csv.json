Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [...],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Output the final answer in JSON format\nAfter evaluating the relevant data and comparing the UK viewership values, we can output the final answer.\n\nBased on the table provided:\nThe row index for \"the lady of the lake\" episode is 22. Its UK viewership value is 6.3 million.\nComparing this with other episodes reveals that its viewership is higher than some others but lower than others. Let's find those relevant values and compare them with \"the lady of the lake\".\nFor episode 21, its index is 7 and its viewership is 5.62 million.\nFor episode 24, its index is 11 and its viewership is 6.01 million.\n\nThus, \"the lady of the lake\" has a higher viewership than some episodes like 21 but a lower one compared to 24, indicating it doesn't hold the lowest in UK viewership alone among those mentioned. For this claim to be true, we'd need all other values to be greater or equal and only her's lesser. This isn't the case here.\n\nTherefore, based on our step-by-step reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be verified\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate the relevant data in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find the index of \\\"the lady of the lake\\\" episode\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare UK viewership values\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Determine the truth of the claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
