    "resp": "Step 1: Identify the columns that are relevant to the claim.\nThe relevant columns are \"ERP W\", \"Class\", \"City of License\".\n\nStep 2: Extract the values for each row from the table.\nFor row \"w290ag\":\n- ERP W: 27\n- Class: d\n- City of License: Griffin, Georgia\n\nFor row \"w230av\":\n- ERP W: 10\n- Class: d\n- City of License: Gadsden, Alabama\n\nStep 3: Compare the extracted values to the claim.\nThe claim states that both w290ag and w230av have an ERP W of 55 and a Class of 'd'. However, this is not true for both rows. The claim also incorrectly states that one has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama while the other has a city of license of Macon, Georgia.\n\nStep 4: Determine the overall truth value of the claim based on the comparison.\nSince the values extracted from the table do not match the claim, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant columns\",\n      \"description\": \"Extracted ERP W, Class, and City of License for each row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare extracted values to claim\",\n      \"description\": \"Claim states that both w290ag and w230av have an ERP W of 55 and a Class of 'd', but this is not true for both rows\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine overall truth value\",\n      \"description\": \"Claim is FALSE because extracted values do not match the claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"ERP W\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"Class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"City of License\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
