Identify the columns and data in the table.\n\n   - The columns are:\n     * home team\n     * home team score\n     * away team\n     * away team score\n     * venue\n     * date\n   - The data consists of five rows, each containing information about a football game.\n\n2. Determine which column contains the relevant information for the claim \"the game at mcg have essendon as the away team\".\n\n   - Based on the columns listed above, we can see that the \"venue\" column is the most likely source of information related to where the game was played (in this case, \"mcg\").\n\n3. Look up the relevant row index and column name in the table for the claim.\n\n   - Since we are interested in a game played at \"mcg\", we need to find which row contains this venue.\n   - The \"venue\" for each game is listed as:\n     * emcg\n     * junction oval\n     * lake oval\n     * mcg\n     * punt road oval\n\n4. Check if the away team for the game played at \"mcg\" matches the claim.\n\n   - According to the table, the row with venue \"mcg\" has Essendon as its away team.\n   - This means that the claim is correct according to our analysis.\n\n\n#### Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1: Identify columns and data in the table\",\n      \"cells\": [\"columns\", \"data\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2: Determine relevant column for claim\",\n      \"cells\": [\"home team\", \"away team\", \"venue\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3: Look up row index and column name in table\",\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4: Check away team for game at mcg\",\n      \"cells\": [\"away team\", \"mcg\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
