This implies we need to check if all rows (translators) in the table have a value for \"class\" equal to \"d\".\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns and Data:** In the given JSON, the relevant column is \"class\" since it directly relates to the claim about class D translators. The data part contains a list of arrays representing different translator information.\n\n3. **Locate Class D Translators in Data:**\n   - To verify if all translators are indeed class D, we need to check each translator's class value.\n   - We'll go through each row in the \"data\" array and identify the \"class\" for each translator.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Falsity (if any):**\n   - Since there might be multiple translators with different classifications, if all are indeed D or none are, we can infer the claim's truth value.\n   - If the presence of at least one non-class D translator exists, the chain is false; otherwise, it's true.\n\n5. **Extract Relevant Cell Information for Output:**\n   - For each row in the \"data\" array that is identified as a class D translator or where the claim could be proven false (e.g., if there are non-class D translators), extract the corresponding cell information into an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Code Implementation:\n\n```javascript\nconst tableData = {\n  columns: [\n    \"call sign\",\n    \"frequency mhz\",\n    \"city of license\",\n    \"erp w\",\n    \"class\",\n    \"fcc info\"\n  ],\n  data: [\n    [\"w221by\", 92.1, \"elgin , illinois\", 38, \"d\", \"fcc\"],\n    [\"w264bf\", 100.7, \"englewood , illinois\", 2, \"d\", \"fcc\"],\n    [\"w240bj\", 95.9, \"crown point , indiana\", 10, \"d\", \"fcc\"],\n    [\"w276bm\", 103.1, \"park forest , illinois\", 19, \"d\", \"fcc\"],\n    [\"w293al\", 106.5, \"rochester , indiana\", 80, \"d\", \"fcc\"],\n    [\"w223au\", 92.5, \"south bend , indiana\", 10, \"d\", \"fcc\"]\n  ]\n};\n\nconst claimChecker = {\n  checkClaim: function() {\n    const allClassD = tableData.data.every((row, index) => row[4] === 'd');\n    if (allClassD) {\n      return { chain_of_thought:\n        `All of the translator data are class D because every row's corresponding class value in the table was found to be 'd'.`,\n        answer: true,\n        relevant_cells: tableData.data.map((row, index) => ({ row_index: index, column_name: \"class\" }))}\n    } else {\n      return { chain_of_thought:\n                `The claim that all of the translator be class D is false because not all rows had a 'd' value for their corresponding class.`,\n        answer: false,\n        relevant_cells: tableData.data.map((row, index) => ({ row_index: index, column_name: \"class\" }))}\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst result = claimChecker.checkClaim();\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim that all of the translator be class D is false because not all rows had a 'd' value for their corresponding class.\",\n  \"answer\": false,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
