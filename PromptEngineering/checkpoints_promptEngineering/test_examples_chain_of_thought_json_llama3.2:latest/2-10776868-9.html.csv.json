    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps to evaluate the given claim:\n\n1. **Extract the year from the table**: The table contains a column named \"date\", which has entries like \"23 june 1962\". Extracting the year from this entry, we get 1962.\n\n2. **Check if there is only one match for the year**: Since the table contains only one entry with the year \"1962\" in the \"date\" column, it is likely that this date corresponds to the Victorian Football League season.\n\n3. **Verify the date of the season**: The claim states that the Victorian Football League season takes place on 23 June. To verify this, we need to check if there are any other dates with the same year in the \"date\" column that do not correspond to a specific football match.\n\n4. **Check for other matches on the same date**: Looking at the \"data\" array, we can see that there is only one row corresponding to 23 June 1962, which includes the entries for Melbourne and Essendon. This suggests that this date might be the actual date of the Victorian Football League season.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that there is only one match on 23 June 1962, it is likely that this was indeed the date of the Victorian Football League season in 1962.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the game between footscray and carlton being played at Princes Park:\n\n1. **Examine the table**: The table contains information about various football games, including the venue where each game was played.\n\n2. **Find the relevant rows**: We need to find the rows that correspond to the game between Footscray and Carlton. Since we don't know the names of both teams, we can look for the team \"carlton\" in the table. The row corresponding to Carlton is:\n   ```\n[\n  \"carlton\",\n  \"12.9 (81)\",\n  \"footscray\",\n  \"9.10 (64)\",\n  \"princes park\",\n  32400,\n  \"23 june 1962\"\n]\n```\n\n3. **Check the venue**: The claim states that the game was played at Princes Park. Looking at the row we found in step 2, we can see that the venue is indeed listed as \"princes park\". This suggests that the table does contain information about this specific game being played at the specified venue.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on our analysis, it appears that the claim about the game between Footscray and Carlton being played at Princes Park is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",
