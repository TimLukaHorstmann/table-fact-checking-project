    "resp": "Step 1: Verify the claim by analyzing the table.\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check if the team \"hurricane\" won 90% of their games in the year 2007. We will start by finding the relevant information about hurricane's performance in 2007.\n\nStep 2: Find the number of wins for hurricane in 2007.\n\nWe can find this by looking at the table data and locating the row that corresponds to hurricane in 2007. The column we are interested in is \"wins\". We will look up the value in the \"wins\" column for the relevant team in 2007.\n\nStep 3: Find the total number of games played by hurricane in 2007.\n\nTo calculate 90% win rate, we need to know how many games were played. The relevant information can be found in the table data and locating the row that corresponds to hurricane in 2007. We will look up the value in the \"wins\" column for the relevant team in 2007.\n\nStep 4: Calculate 90% of total games.\n\nTo check if hurricane won 90% of their games, we need to divide the number of wins by the total number of games played and see if it's equal to or greater than 0.9\n\nIf true then this will be our answer.\n \nStep 5: Check division promotion based on the win percentage.\n\nWe also need to check if hurricane was promoted to a higher division in 2007 based on their performance in that year.\n\nHere is how we do it:\n\nStep 6: Determine the final answer and relevant data\n\nBased on steps 2,3,4,5, we determine our final answer and store all relevant cells (row index and column name) for output as shown below:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify claim by analyzing table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find number of wins for hurricane in 2007\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate percentage win rate based on the value found in steps 2 and 3\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check division promotion based on the value found in step 4\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"final position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"notes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nStep 7: Justify the answer\n\nHurricane won 9 out of 11 games in the season that follows, which is less than a 90% win rate.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\nStep 1: Check if the team won exactly 50% of their games in 2007.\n- To do this, we need to calculate the winning percentage for the 2007 season by dividing the number of wins (9) by the total number of games played (6).\n- Winning percentage = 9 / 6 = 1.5\n- Since a team can't win more than 100% of their games in a single season, and it's also not possible to achieve exactly 50% winning, we need to assess if \"winning 50%\" is what the claim intends to check.\n- In this context, it appears that the claim likely intends to check for \"exactly half\" or \"exactly 50%\". Given this interpretation, the calculation would be 9 / 6 = 1.5 wins, which doesn't match exactly 50%. Therefore, we will state the team did not win exactly 50%, but we'll also see if it won more than half.\n\nStep 2: Verify that the team was promoted to a higher division in 2007.\n- According to the \"notes\" column for the 2007 season, the team \"promoted to division 1 north.\"\n- This means that while the team did not win exactly 50%, it indeed got promoted to a higher division in 2007.\n\nStep 3: Check if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on our findings.\n- The statement says \"the hurricane only win 50% of their game\" which doesn't mean they won more than half. However, since we've established that \"exactly 50%\" isn't what's being checked (as a team can't), and given that the actual calculation shows exactly half wins in 2007 with six games played, it might be misleading without context.\n- However, we determined that they indeed got promoted to division 1 north.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the claim is completely FALSE since it only addresses win percentage and not promotion or any other aspect directly mentioned by \"the hurricane\" (which isn't present in the table provided). Without more information about \"the hurricane,\" we can only discuss data related to \"bafl division 2 north\" and \"bafl division 1 north.\"\n\nSince no direct, applicable data is available for a team called \"the hurricane\" in the given table, we'll address the claim as it pertains to the provided data.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the lack of information about \"the hurricane,\" we can only assess \"bafl division 2 north\" and \"bafl division 1 north.\" We concluded earlier that while \"the hurricane\" does not directly exist in the provided table, we've found some details related to teams from different divisions. However, this is irrelevant to answering whether the claim about winning exactly 50% or promotion is true.\n\nSince there's no relevant cell data for a team named \"the hurricane,\" our answer cannot be definitively marked as TRUE based on the given data.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"To check if the hurricane won exactly 50% of their games in 2007\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\" : 5, \"column_name\" : \"wins\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"The team didn't win exactly 50% because a calculation using '9 / 6' is greater than one but less than two.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Understand the claim**: The claim states that the Dundee Hurricane did not win the same number of games in any season between 2003 and 2009.\n\n2. **Identify relevant data**: We need to examine each row in the table for the \"wins\" column and verify if there are consecutive seasons where the Dundee Hurricane wins a different number of games.\n\n3. **Examine each season**:\n   - In the 2003 season, the team won 6 games.\n   - In the 2004 season, the team won 6 games, which is the same as in 2003.\n   - In the 2005 season, the team won 5 games, different from 2003 and 2004.\n   - In the 2006 season, the team won 3 games, different from 2003, 2004, and 2005.\n   - In the 2007 season, the team won 9 games, different from all previous seasons.\n   - In the 2008 season, the team won 5 games, which is the same as in 2005 but not the same as in 2003, 2004, and 2006. However, for our purposes, we must note it's different from 2007.\n   - In the 2009 season, the team won 2 games, different from all previous seasons.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the data provided in the table, the Dundee Hurricane did not win the same number of games in any season between 2003 and 2009.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
