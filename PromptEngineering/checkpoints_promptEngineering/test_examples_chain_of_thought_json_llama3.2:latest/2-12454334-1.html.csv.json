Since there are no other matching rows for 'cape vincent , ny', it's last among all city of licenses.\n   I compare each value in the 'city of license' column with 'webster , ny'. There is only one matching row, which is at index 1.\n\n6. Now, we can see that 'cape vincent , ny' is indeed the last and 'webster , ny' is first.\n\nBased on these steps, I can conclude:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"city of license\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Extract the class column from the table: The class column contains the class of each facility, which can be either \"a\" or \"b\".\n\n2. Count the number of facilities with a frequency of 91.1 FM: The table has 5 rows, but only one row has a frequency of 91.1 FM (wmhu).\n\n3. Check if there are two class B facilities in the list that both have a frequency of 91.1 FM: Since there is only one facility with a frequency of 91.1 FM and its class is \"a\", not \"b\", this claim cannot be true.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the chain of thought leads us to determine whether the claim about the table is FALSE.\n\nHere is the output in the specified format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"class\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"frequency\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []",
