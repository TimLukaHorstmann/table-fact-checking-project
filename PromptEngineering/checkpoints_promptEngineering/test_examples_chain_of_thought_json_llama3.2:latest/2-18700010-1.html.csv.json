    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps to determine whether the claim about Chris Topping and Dave Sutton having the highest league apps is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Find the row with the maximum value in the \"league apps\" column.\n2. Compare this value with the \"league apps\" value of Chris Topping and Dave Sutton's rows to verify that they indeed have the highest league apps.\n\nNow, let's proceed to find the relevant cells and output a final answer:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the row with the maximum value in the \"league apps\" column. The table has 7 rows, so we will iterate through all of them:\n   - Row 0: 46\n   - Row 1: 46\n   - Row 2: 39 (note that \"(1)\" indicates this is not the highest number but rather one of two numbers in a sequence)\n   - Row 3: 30 (note that \"(8)\" indicates this is one of eight identical values)\n   - Row 4: 33\n   - Row 5: 46\n   - Row 6: 6 (note that \"(4)\" indicates this is one of four numbers in a sequence)\n\n2. From our list, the row with \"league apps\" = 46 appears twice, so to identify the highest value we need to look at all rows again.\n   - Row 0: 46\n   - Row 1: 46\n   - Row 2: 39\n   - Row 3: 30\n   - Row 4: 33\n   - Row 5: 46\n   - Row 6: 6\n\n3. We can see that Row 0 and Row 5 both have \"league apps\" = 46, which is the highest value so far.\n   \n4. For Dave Sutton's row, we find:\n   - Dave sutton's row: \"46\"\n\n5. For Chris Topping's row, we find:\n   - Chris topping's row: \"13\"\n\n6. From our findings, it appears that neither Dave Sutton nor Chris Topping have the highest league apps. However, their values are lower than another player whose data is still missing.\n\n7. Looking at Row 4 again to see if any of its numbers could be higher:\n   - Row 4: \"33\" \n\n8. Comparing this number with the missing player's row:\n   - Missing player's row: (still missing)\n\n9. Now, looking for a potential match in Row 2 where there is an identical value \"(1)\" to be added onto to possibly represent the highest value:\n   - Row 2: \"39\" \n\n10. If we assume that \"(1)\" represents one number in a sequence of identical values and if this value was higher than Dave Sutton's or Chris Topping's \"league apps\", then we could say that the claim is TRUE.\n    - However, we cannot accurately verify this since we do not know what the missing player's row actually looks like.\n\n11. We can still determine that the claim \"chris topping and dave sutton have the highest league apps\" is FALSE because neither of their data entries has a higher number than 46.\n\n12. Next, we need to find which cell(s) in the table contains the claim:\n    - The relevant cells are: \n      ```json\n      [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"name\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n        }\n      ]\n      ```\n\nHere's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find row with max value in league apps column\",\n      \"description\": \"Iterate through all rows and find maximum value.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare values to verify claim is true\",\n      \"description\": \"Verify that Chris Topping and Dave Sutton have highest league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find relevant cells for chain of thought\",\n      \"description\": \"Identify which row has the maximum value in league apps.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the chain of thought is not a formal mathematical proof but rather an explanation in natural language.",

This is clearly lower than any number in the column but does indicate his lowest.\n\n4. **Evaluate claim**:\n    - Since Tommy Smith does not score a single goal according to the only relevant data available (as per row 11 where he scored a league goal but it was only 1 game), we can safely say that no player has a higher number of goals than him.\n    - The statement seems to be true based on this comparison.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n    - We know 'tommy smith' is the one with zero goals which indeed indicates he does not have any league goal.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim's Focus**: The claim focuses on identifying players with the highest number of total goals.\n2. **Locate the Relevant Column**: In the table, the relevant column for finding the player with the highest number of total goals is \"total goals\".\n3. **Find the Highest Number of Total Goals**: After reviewing each row in the table, we need to find which players have the same highest number of total goals.\n4. **Compare the Number of Players with the Same Highest Goal Count**: We will count how many players share the highest goal count. If only one player has this highest score, and if there are no other players sharing the exact same highest score then the claim is true; otherwise it is false\n5.  **Identify Ian Robins as One of the Players with the Highest Goal Count**: From the table, we can see that \"ian robins\" has a total goal count of 27 which is among the highest.\n6.  **Identify Chris Topping as the Other Player with the Same Highest Goal Count**: From the table, we can also see that \"chris topping\" has a total goal count of 0 which is not the highest but it should be checked for the presence of \"another player sharing same score\". Upon checking other rows we find out that no other players are having the same highest score so there isn't another player.\n7. **Determine If There Are Two Players with the Same Highest Number of Total Goals**: Since Ian Robins and Chris Topping have the same highest number of total goals, which is 27 for IAN and 0 for Chris but since zero was not the highest the second highest value is considered; there are only two players having this same highest score.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"total goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"total goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"total apps\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"total goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"total goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n### Step 1: Extract relevant data\nThe claim mentions \"2 other player apart from peter hart have fa cup goal\". We need to find out how many players, apart from Peter Hart, have scored a FA Cup goal.\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant columns\nWe need to look at the columns that indicate FA Cup goals. The relevant column is \"fa cup goals\".\n\n### Step 3: Count FA Cup goals for all players\nWe will count the number of non-zero values in the \"fa cup goals\" column, excluding Peter Hart.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"List relevant data, identify relevant columns, count FA Cup goals for all players\",\n    \"answer\": \"\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of non-zero FA Cup goals\nWe will iterate through the table and count the number of rows where the value in the \"fa cup goals\" column is not zero. We exclude Peter Hart's row.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Count the number of non-zero FA Cup goals, excluding Peter Hart's row\",\n    \"answer\": \"\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nIf the count from step 4 is greater than 1, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Count the number of non-zero FA Cup goals for all players, excluding Peter Hart's row, and determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\",\n    \"answer\": \"\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Count FA Cup goals for all players\nWe will iterate through the table and count the number of rows where the value in the \"fa cup apps\" column is not zero. We exclude Peter Hart's row.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Count the number of non-zero FA Cup goals, excluding Peter Hart's row, and determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\",\n    \"answer\": \"\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Count the number of non-zero FA Cup apps for all players\nWe will iterate through the table and count the number of rows where the value in the \"fa cup apps\" column is not zero. We exclude Peter Hart's row.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Count the number of non-zero FA Cup goals, excluding Peter Hart's row, and determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\",\n    \"answer\": \"\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 8: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nIf the count from step 7 is greater than 1, then the claim is TRUE.
