    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the columns of interest\nThe table has two main sections: \"columns\" and \"data\". The \"columns\" section contains a list of strings, which appear to be the names of teams or outcomes. We are particularly interested in the following columns:\n- \"team 1\": This column lists the first team in each match.\n- \"2nd leg\": This column indicates whether the second leg was played.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the relevant row\nWe need to find the row for \"asc diaraf\" and \"stade malien\". Looking at the table data:\n```json\n[\n  [\n    \"al - merrikh\",\n    \"2 - 2 (5 - 4 pen)\",\n    \"tele sc asmara\",\n    \"2 - 1\",\n    \"0 - 1\"\n  ],\n  [...],\n  [\n    \"asc diaraf\",\n    \"3 - 4\",\n    \"stade malien\",\n    \"3 - 0\",\n    \"0 - 4\"\n  ],\n  [...]\n]\n```\nThe relevant row for \"asc diaraf\" is the third row.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if asc diaraf lost to stade malien\nIn the relevant row, we can see that:\n- \"team 1\": \"asc diaraf\"\n- \"agg\": Not directly relevant to this comparison\n- \"team 2\": \"stade malien\"\n- \"1st leg\": \"3 - 0\" (Asc Diarraf won)\n- \"2nd leg\": \"0 - 4\" (Stade Malien won)\n\nThis suggests that Asc Diaraf lost the match.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if the match occurred in 1971\nWe can see in the first row of data:\n```json\n[\n  [\n    \"al - merrikh\",\n    \"2 - 2 (5 - 4 pen)\",\n    \"tele sc asmara\",\n    \"2 - 1\",\n    \"0 - 1\"\n  ],\n  [...],\n  [\n    \"asc diaraf\",\n    \"3 - 4\",\n    \"stade malien\",\n    \"3 - 0\",\n    \"0 - 4\"\n  ],\n  [...]\n```\nHowever, there is no indication of the year in which these matches were played.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nWe have found that Asc Diaraf lost to Stade Malien. However, since we could not verify if this match occurred in 1971, our conclusion relies on the date information being missing from the provided table data. We will proceed with the assumption that the year of the match is unknown.\n\n#### JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"Step_1\": \"Identify the columns of interest\",\n      \"Step_2\": \"Locate the relevant row\",\n      \"Step_3\": \"Check if asc diaraf lost to stade malien\",\n      \"Step_4\": \"Check if the match occurred in 1971\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Next, we will check if the score of Young Africans is indeed 2 points.\n\n3. We then have to confirm that the competition is indeed the African Cup of Champions Club.\n\n4. Finally, we must determine the year of the competition based on the given claim (1971).\n\nNow let's move to the actual steps and relevant cells:\n\n- Step 1: The team \"Young Africans\" exists in the table. Relevant cell:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n}\n```\n- Step 2: To verify if Young Africans scored 2 points, we need to find their score for \"agg\". However, we also have to be aware of the fact that there might not be any record in the data. Looking at the relevant cell from step one, let's go and check:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n}\n```\n- Step 3: We need to find if Young Africans played against Canon Yaound\u00e9, since this is a possible opponent that would have provided the required score of 2 in the competition. Relevant cell:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n}\n```\n- Step 4: Looking at the relevant cells from step 3 and step 1, let's find their corresponding scores to verify if Young Africans beat Canon Yaound\u00e9 by a score of 9 - 4. Relevant cell:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 5,\n  \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n}\n```\n- Step 5: The data does not contain any record about the year of the competition mentioned in the given claim (1971). However, we can't determine if this piece of information is required or can be ignored.\n\nNow let's combine all these steps into a single JSON output:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is in JSON format as per the given instructions:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"agg\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Otherwise, it's false.\n\n5. **List the relevant cells as per output format**:\n   - List each matching row where both conditions are met.\n   - These rows will contain \"secteur 6\", Enugu Rangers, and their respective scores.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process Continued in Detail\n\nThe detailed steps of this process are best summarized by examining the table directly. Since we cannot visually display the table here, let's break down what it means to apply these steps:\n\n- For each match involving \"secteur 6\" against Enugu Rangers:\n    - Look at the team \"secteur 6\".\n    - Its score must be one goal behind Enugu Rangers' score for the claim to hold.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout direct access to the table, let's simulate based on common patterns in sports data tables:\n\n- If there are any matches where \"secteur 6\" is listed as having a score that is exactly one goal lower than Enugu Rangers', then the claim is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\n- Since we can't directly verify this due to table limitations, assume that if such a scenario exists based on common table structure and claims about sports statistics.\n\n### Final JSON Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"reasoning_steps_summary\": [\n      \"List relevant matches between Scepteur 6 and Enugu Rangers\",\n      \"Extract scores for each match\",\n      \"Compare Scepteur 6's score with Enugu Rangers' score\"\n    ],\n    \"claim_result\": \"FALSE\" // Based on assumption of no direct data access\n  },\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null, // Cannot directly verify without table data\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

To determine if the claim \"canon yaound\u00e9 score 5 more points than their opponent\" is true, we need to find out if Canon Yaound\u00e9 has a higher aggregate score than their opponent in any of the matches.\n\n2. Looking at the table, the second column \"agg\" represents the aggregate score for each team. We can ignore other columns like game date, etc., as they don't impact this comparison.\n\n3. From the data provided, Canon Yaound\u00e9 played against two teams: As Solidarit\u00e9 and Al-Ahly (Benghazi). \n\n4. For Canon Yaound\u00e9 vs. As Solidarit\u00e9:\n   - The total score for Canon Yaound\u00e9 is 9+7+2 = 18.\n   - The total score for As Solidarit\u00e9 is 4+3+1 = 8.\n   - Canon Yaound\u00e9 has a higher aggregate score by 10 points.\n\n5. For Canon Yaound\u00e9 vs. Al-Ahly (Benghazi):\n   - The total score for Canon Yaound\u00e9 is 9+7+2 = 18.\n   - The total score for Al-Ahly (Benghazi) is 0+0+1 = 1.\n   - Canon Yaound\u00e9 has a higher aggregate score by 17 points.\n\n6.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. The claim states \"canon yaound\u00e9 score zero point against their opponent\". This implies we need to find if the score against 'canon yaound\u00e9' contains a value of 0.\n\n2. Looking at the table structure, we have multiple rows and columns. However, there seems to be no direct column for 'opponent'. Instead, the team names appear as 'team 1' and 'team 2', which might serve a similar purpose. We need to find a relevant row that contains information about a match involving 'canon yaound\u00e9'.\n\n3. In the table data, we can see multiple rows with 'canon yaound\u00e9'. To check if the score is zero against their opponent, we need to examine each of these rows and check for a score of 0.\n\n4. Upon closer inspection, we find that in one row (index 5), the value under 'team 2' column is indeed 'canon yaound\u00e9'. Looking further down this row, we see that the 'agg' column contains a score of '9 - 4', which does not match our criteria.\n\n5. Continuing to examine each row, we eventually find a row where 'canon yaound\u00e9' appears in both 'team 1' and 'team 2'. The relevant values under this row are:\n\n- 'agg': '2 - 1'\n- '0 - 1'\n\n6. From the above score values, it is clear that 'canon yaound\u00e9' scored zero points against their opponent ('al ahly (benghazi)').\n\n7. Having verified this information, we can now proceed to provide a final answer.\n\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"The claim states 'canon yaound\u00e9 score zero point against their opponent'\"},\n    {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"We need to find if the score against 'canon yaound\u00e9' contains a value of 0.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}",
