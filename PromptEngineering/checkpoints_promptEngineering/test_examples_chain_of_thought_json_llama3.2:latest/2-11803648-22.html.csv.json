The \"centre\" row actually specifies both centre and right wing positions.\n\n7. **Output result**: Given the claim is about there being exactly two players from Canada playing centre, our actual count for players playing centre would just be Row 5 because it explicitly mentions centre as part of its position, even though the player also plays right wing.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Identify claim and relevant data\": \"Verify that there are indeed 3 Canadian players\",\n    \"Locate and count Canadian players\": \"Find rows where nationality is Canada: Rows 4, 5, and 7 (not), 6 (not) have this\",\n    \"Count centre position players for Canada\": \"From two players with 'canada', only one explicitly has 'centre' as part of its role\",\n    \"Conclusion\": \"Thus the claim about three Canadian players playing centre is false since it miscounts or misunderstands the data\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
