We need to find the corresponding cells in the table that match this description.\n\n- For Calgary Stampeders, we look at row 5, where \"cfl team\" = \"calgary stampeders\" and \"position\" = \"dl\".\n- For Montreal Alouettes, we look at row 6, where \"cfl team\" = \"montreal alouettes\" and \"position\" = \"dl\".\n- For Edmonton, we look at rows 8 (there is no cfl team listed), so there might be a missing value.\n\nStep 3: Check if Edmonton has any information about DL\nSince the second argument of Edmonton's row is empty, let's check the last argument.

To verify this claim, we need to count the number of DL positions in the table and compare it with the number of OL positions.\n\n3. Looking at the table, we can see that the \"position\" column has the following values:\n   - CB (cornerback)\n   - DL (defensive lineman)\n   - LB (linebacker)\n   - OG (offensive lineman)\n   - OL (offensive lineman)\n\n4. From this, we can count that there are 3 DL positions (DL is a subset of DL, but since DL and DL have different values in the table i.e., \"dl\" and \"lb\", they should be considered as separate) and 2 OL positions.\n\n5. However, looking closer at the position \"dl\" it seems like only two of the DLs are listed under the name \"dl\". That means we may have over counted dl by one.\n\n\n\n6. Now, let's compare the number of DL positions (3) with the number of OL positions (2). Since 3 is greater than 2, this contradicts the claim that there are 1 more DL positions than players who play OL positions.\n\n7.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find the row index of Mark Farraway in the table.\n2. We can do this by searching for the cell value \"mark farraway\" in the data array.\n3. Once we find the row index, we can compare it with the pick number of Jason Clemett.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. Searching for the row index of Mark Farraway:\n   - Looking at the table, we see that Mark Farraway is in the 8th position.\n   - Therefore, the row index of Mark Farraway is 7 (since array indices start from 0).\n\n2. Now, let's find the pick number of Jason Clemett:\n   - We know that Jason Clemett is in the 7th row.\n   - Looking at the data array, we see that Jason Clemett is indeed in the 7th position.\n\n3. Comparing the two values:\n   - Mark Farraway's pick number (8) is greater than Jason Clemett's pick number (7).\n   - Since Mark Farraway's pick number is not after Jason Clemett's, this means that the claim \"jason clemett be pick after the player mark farraway\" is FALSE.\n\nHere is our JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
