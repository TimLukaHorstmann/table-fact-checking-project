However, this is not an international match.\n\n4. **Expand search to other rows**:\nSince the initial search did not yield results, we need to continue searching through all rows for a match that could be relevant.\n\n5. **Locate Carsten Jancker's actual data (found on the 3rd of June 2000)**:\nCarsten Jancker is actually mentioned in row 1: `[[\"3 june 2000\", ...], ...]`.\n\n6. **Verify score type**:\nWe must ensure that this match is indeed an international goal for Carsten Janacker.\n\n7. **Find date, competition, and score details**:\nThe date of the match (3 June 2000), the venue (EasyCredit Stadium, Nuremberg), and the score (1 - 0) are all present in row 1.\n\n8. **Identify relevant data for claim**:\nWe now have a potential answer for Carsten Jancker's score: 4 goals.\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\nCarsten Janacker scored 4 goals, but there is no information to confirm if it was international. However, there are more matches on the table and we could expand our search or consider different data points.\n\n\n\n#### Code\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim's requirements\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate relevant data: Carsten Jancker, international goals in 2002\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find Carsten Janacker's data: Row 4 not found (friendly match)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Expand search to other rows: No relevant results yet\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Locate Carsten Jancker's actual data (found on the 3rd of June 2000)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Verify score type: Score is 1-0, not confirmed as international goal\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Find date, competition, and score details: 3 June 2000 (International match)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant data for claim: 4 goals but not all of them are international\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Extract the total score for each game**: First, we need to calculate the total score for each game to determine if Carsten Jancker's team scored 2 points in two separate games.\n\n   From the table, the total scores are as follows:\n   - Game 1: 3 (Carsten Jancker's team) + 5 (opponent) = 8 points\n   - Game 2: 7 (Carsten Jancker's team) + 0 (opponent) = 7 points\n   - Game 3: 4 (Carsten Jancker's team) + 0 (opponent) = 4 points\n\n2. **Check if Carsten Jancker scored exactly 2 points in two separate games**: Now, let's analyze each game to see if Carsten Jancker scored exactly 2 points.\n\n   - Game 1: No, he scored a total of 3 points.\n   - Game 2: Yes, he scored a total of 7 points, but this is not 2 points in two separate games. However, looking at the table again, there's another row that shows Carsten Jancker scoring only 2 points (not alone). That row has his team score 4-0 and his score being 4.\n   - Game 3: No, he scored a total of 4 points.\n\nHowever, rechecking my calculation in step 1, it was a mistake to not include the \"2002 world cup qualifier\" rows because I had missed that Carsten Jancker's team played against Hungary and lost with 5-2 but Carsten Jancker alone scored only 1 point. Thus, another row shows him scoring only 2 points - in this case for his score of 4-0 against a team playing only one player (4-0), that player being Carsten Jancker.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: After reviewing the data again, I noticed there were two rows where Carsten Jancker scored exactly 2 points: once as part of a larger total and another time when looking closely we see that he was alone in his team for that score so I can count this row.\n\n4. **Final Answer Preparation**:\n\nNow I will finalize my reasoning process into the required format:\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 2,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 6,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"score\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if this answer is correct.",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the relevant data for the claim\nTo determine if over half of the goals scored were during World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games, we need to first count the number of goals scored in these categories.\n\n#### Step 2: Count the total number of goals scored in all games\nWe will start by counting the total number of goals scored in all games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the total number of goals scored in all games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nFrom the table, we see that there are 8 rows and a total of 2 + 7 + 4 = 13 goals scored.\n\n#### Step 3: Count the total number of goals scored during World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games\nNext, we will count the number of goals scored in World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of goals scored in World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nFrom the table, we see that there are 2 rows with a total of 8 + 0 = 8 goals scored during World Cup games and 1 row with a total of 4 - 0 = 4 goals scored during World Cup games. There is also 1 row with a total of 2 - 2 = 0 goals scored during World Cup qualifier games.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if over half of the goals were scored in these categories\nNow that we have counted the total number of goals scored and the number of goals scored in World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games, we can determine if over half of the goals were scored in these categories.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Determine if over half of the goals were scored in World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games\",\n    \"If the number of goals scored in these categories is greater than or equal to half of the total number of goals scored, then the claim is TRUE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nSince there are a total of 13 goals and 8 + 4 = 12 goals scored in World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games, which is greater than half of the total number of goals scored.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if the claim is TRUE\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE because over half of the goal score was during world cup game or world cup qualifier game\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the total number of goals scored in all games\",\n    \"Count the number of goals scored in World Cup games or World Cup qualifier games\",\n    \"Determine if over half of the goals were scored in these categories\",\n    \"If the number of goals scored in these categories is greater than or equal to half of the total number of goals scored, then the claim is TRUE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
