Instead, we need to focus on any instance where these teams play each other consecutively without assuming every matchup occurs within a single week.\n\n8. **Re-evaluate claim**: Given that the team names are swapped in the table and there isn't a direct consecutive sequence for both Argonauts-Rough Riders matches as initially thought, we must recognize the claim might not be directly supported by the data as presented due to how it's structured (team name swap vs actual week order).\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The claim seems to misunderstand how the data is laid out or misinterprets \"back-to-back\" weeks in a context that doesn't align with standard sports competition schedules.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"\"}, // Start point: No relevant data initially found.\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\":\"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\":\"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\":\"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\":\"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\":\"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\":\"\"}, // Realization step: Misinterpretation of data layout.\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\":\"\"}, // Second Argonauts-Rough Riders matchup.\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\":\"\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\":\"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\":\"\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\":\"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

To identify a stretch with 7 games in a row lost by Argonauts, we compare number of consecutive losses in different potential stretches (e.g., weeks 8 and onwards) versus the number of total days or weeks.\n\n3. Compare each count of losses against possible criteria such as length of stretch.\n4. If we can identify one where they lose seven games consecutively we can conclude that this is true otherwise this will be false\n\nLet's start evaluating.\n\nFrom week 1 to week 8 there are five data points with Argonauts' losses, the next few shows Argonauts won two weeks before losing 5 more weeks.
