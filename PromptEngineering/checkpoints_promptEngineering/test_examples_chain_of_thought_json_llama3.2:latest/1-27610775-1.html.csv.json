To verify this, we need to find the row in the table where the episode title is 'that's so not raven' and check its corresponding \"us viewers (millions)\" value.\n3. We can do this by searching for the row with matching values in the relevant cells:\n   - `title` column should contain the string \"that's so not raven\".\n   - The \"us viewers (millions)\" value should be equal to 7.1 million.\n\n4. Once we have identified the correct row, we need to check if its \"us viewers (millions)\" value is indeed 7.1 million and that it has a higher value than any other row with a matching title.\n5.

Identify the specific rows in the table where we want to compare the number of US viewers.\n\n   The claim mentions two episodes: 'a goat's tale' with a prod code of 35, and 'the road to audition' with a prod code of 39. So I need to look at cells (35, \"us viewers (millions)\") and (39, \"us viewers (millions)\"), which are rows 6 and 9 respectively.\n\n2. Extract the number of US viewers from each relevant cell in the table:\n\n   The row at index 6 corresponds to episode 'a goat's tale' with a prod code of 35:\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 6,\n     \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\",\n     \"value\": 4.3\n   }\n\n   The row at index 9 corresponds to episode 'the road to audition' with a prod code of 39:\n   {\n     \"row_index\": 9,\n     \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\",\n     \"value\": 4.27\n   }\n   \n   As we can see, the value in both cells are not exactly equal (4.3 and 4.27). Therefore, my next step will be to check if there is any error or discrepancy.\n\n3. Check for errors or discrepancies:\n\n   Since I've compared the values of the two relevant cells and they are indeed different, my next step would be to look at other potential sources of differences (like rounding) or any possibility that both episodes might have been broadcast at the same time but had slightly different viewership numbers.\n\n4. Final Conclusion:\n   After analyzing all possible sources of discrepancies and looking at the data again, I found no discrepancy in this case.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant rows\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract values for us viewers (millions)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if extracted values are equal\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the answer based on comparison result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
