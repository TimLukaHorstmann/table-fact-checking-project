In this case, it says that \"the game at mcg be the game that have the largest crowd\".\n\n2. **Locate relevant data**: Find the row(s) in the table where the venue is \"mcg\". This is because the claim specifically mentions the venue, which can help narrow down the search.\n\n3. **Extract crowd values**: For each row with \"mcg\" as the venue, extract the crowd value (column 5). These are likely to be relevant for determining if they represent the largest crowd.\n\n4. **Compare crowd values**: Compare the extracted crowd values to find the maximum value. This can help determine if there is a game at mcg that has the largest crowd.\n\n5. **Verify against other rows**: Since the claim uses \"be\" (indicating comparison), also verify that no other row in the table has a larger crowd value than this one.\n\n6. **Determine truthfulness of claim**: Based on these steps, determine if the claim is true or false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
