We need to extract these titles and their corresponding release dates from the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_columns\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Verify the release dates of \"Cock-a-Doodle Duel\" and \"The Whizzard of Ow\"\nWe need to check if the release dates of both titles match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_columns\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"release_dates\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": \"2004 - 03 - 31\",\n      \"title\": \"Cock-a-Doodle Duel\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": \"2003 - 11 - 01\",\n      \"title\": \"The Whizzard of Ow\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare the release dates\nSince the release date of \"Cock-a-Doodle Duel\" is not equal to the release date of \"The Whizzard of Ow\", the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"relevant_columns\": [\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"title\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"release_dates\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"2004 - 03 - 31\",\n        \"title\": \"Cock-a-Doodle Duel\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"2003 - 11 - 01\",\n        \"title\": \"The Whizzard of Ow\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```\n\n### Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"relevant_columns\": [\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 5,\n        \"column_name\": \"title\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"release_dates\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"2004 - 03 - 31\",\n        \"title\": \"Cock-a-Doodle Duel\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"2003 - 11 - 01\",\n        \"title\": \"The Whizzard of Ow\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
