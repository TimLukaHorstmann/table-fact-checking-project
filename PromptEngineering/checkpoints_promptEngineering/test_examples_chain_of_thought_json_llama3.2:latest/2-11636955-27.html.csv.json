First, we need to extract the information about Peter Schaefer and Brent Sopel from the table.\n   - Peter Schaefer played 3 playoff games (as shown in cell `[rd = 3]`).\n   - Brent Sopel played 42 playoff games (as shown in cell `[pl gp = 42)`).\n\n2. Next, compare the number of playoff games each player has played to determine if Peter Schaefer played in more playoff games than Brent Sopel.\n   - Peter Schaefer played in less playoff game(s) compared to Brent Sopel.\n\n3.

Conclusion\nSince the count of players without games played (4) is greater than the expected number (3), the claim that only three players do not play any games at all is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n
