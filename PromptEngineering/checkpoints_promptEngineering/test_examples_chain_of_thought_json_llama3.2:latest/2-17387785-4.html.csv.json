The claim we need to verify states that Semi Tadulala, Ben Jeffries, and David Solomona were previously from Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. We can infer this by examining the values in the \"previous club\" column.\n\n#### Step 2: Find relevant cell values\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to find out if Semi Tadulala, Ben Jeffries, and David Solomona's previous clubs were Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. We can do this by checking their respective values in the \"previous club\" column.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the claim\nWe will compare each player's value in the \"previous club\" column with \"Wakefield Trinity Wildcats\". If any of them are not from Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, we can determine that the claim is false. However if one or more players do match then the chain_of_thought would be as follows:\n\n#### Step 4: Construct the answer\nWe will determine whether Semi Tadulala, Ben Jeffries, and David Solomona were previously from Wakefield Trinity Wildcats based on the values found in the \"previous club\" column. If they were all from Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous club\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous club\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Provide the final answer\nAfter verifying the claim, we can conclude that Semi Tadulala, Ben Jeffries, and David Solomona were indeed previously from Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.
