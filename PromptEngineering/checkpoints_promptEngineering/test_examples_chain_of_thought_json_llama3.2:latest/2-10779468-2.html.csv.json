    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Parse the table data to extract the relevant information:\n   - For each row (game), we need to check if the score is shown on a different location than \"UT\".\n   - Specifically, we need to look at columns \"opponent's venue\" and \"neutral site\" to see where the scores are displayed.\n\n2. Check each game in the table for this condition:\n   - For example, in the first row (Baylor vs UT), the score is shown as \"(57-23)\" which does not indicate a different location.\n   - In some cases, like Texas A&M and Texas Tech, the score is written in multiple lines. We need to determine if any of those scores are on a different line than just \"UT\".\n\n3. Verify that all rows meet the condition:\n   - If we find one row where the score is not shown on a different location than \"UT\", then the claim is FALSE.\n   - If we do not find any such row, then the claim could be TRUE.\n\nHere's my reasoning in more detail:\n\n- Looking at the table, I notice that for most games, the scores are displayed as \"(X-X)\" next to \"UT\" without any indication of a different location. For example, in the Baylor game, it says \"(57-23)\".\n- However, there is one notable exception: Texas Tech's game against UT shows \"(55-24)\" which is on a separate line than just \"UT\". This suggests that not all scores are displayed next to \"UT\".\n- Looking at the other games where the score is shown on a different line (e.g., Texas A&M and some of Oklahoma State's games), it seems like they also display the opponent's name rather than showing their venue as part of the score. However, these cases do not meet the condition specified in the claim.\n- There are no rows that meet the condition specified by the claim: all scores for UT are displayed next to \"UT\" with no indication of a different location.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Parse table data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check each game for scores on different locations than UT\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Verify all rows meet the condition\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The given claim is \"ut , 58 - 15 be the result on the game at austin , texas v iowa state and kansa state\".\n\n2. **Locate relevant data in the table**:\n   - We need to find the rows corresponding to Texas vs Iowa State and Kansas State.\n   - In the \"columns\" list, we are looking for \"texas vs\", \"iowa state\", and \"kansas state\".\n   - The relevant column names are:\n     - \"texas vs\"\n     - \"opponent 's venue\"\n     - \"iowa state\"\n     - \"kansas state\"\n\n3. **Find the row index of each relevant opponent**:\n   - For Texas vs Iowa State: \n     - In the data table, we need to find a row where \"ut\" is mentioned as the opponent for Iowa State.\n     - The matching row number (index) is 2 (for the first game), and also 5 (for the second game).\n   - For Texas vs Kansas State:\n     - We need to find a row where \"ut\" is mentioned as the opponent for Kansas State.\n     - The matching row number (index) is 3.\n\n4. **Extract relevant cell values**:\n   - For each of the identified row indexes, extract the values from the corresponding columns:\n     - Row index 2: \n       - \"texas vs\": Baylor\n       - \"opponent 's venue'\": ut , 22 - 13\n       - \"iowa state\" is not present in this column.\n       - The relevant game result is not found here, ignore it.\n     - Row index 5:\n       - \"texas vs\": Colorado\n       - \"opponent 's venue'\": ut , 7 - 2\n       - \"kansas state\" is not present in this column.\n       - The relevant game result is not found here, ignore it.\n     - Row index 3:\n       - \"texas vs\": Iowa State\n       - \"opponent 's venue'\": ISU , 5 - 2\n       - \"kansas state\": tied , 4 - 4\n       - The relevant game result is not found here, ignore it.\n     - Row index 6:\n       - \"texas vs\": Kansas State\n       - \"opponent 's venue'\": tied , 4 - 4\n       - \"iowa state\" is not present in this column.\n       - The relevant game result is not found here, ignore it.\n\n5. **Find the specific game results for Texas vs Iowa State and Kansas State**:\n   - The desired result of 58-15 is found in the first row corresponding to Texas vs Iowa State.\n   - The desired result is also present in the second row corresponding to Texas vs Kansas State.\n\n6. **Verify if the games at austin , texas for both opponents are tied or not**: \n   - In the \"opponent 's venue\" column, we see that the game against Iowa State was played in \"ut , 22 - 13\", and it's clear they aren't at Texas.\n   - For the first row of Texas vs Iowa State, we see \"ut , 27 - 5\".\n   - For the second row of Texas vs Kansas State, we see \"ut , 6 - 1\".\n   - Neither of these results mention a tie in Austin. Therefore, there is no result that shows the two games being tied at the same venue.\n\n7. **Check if \"ut , 58 - 15\" matches both results**:\n   - Yes, it does.\n\n8. **Determine the answer based on our findings**.\n   - Since we verified all conditions are met in step 6 and 7, the answer is TRUE.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim: ut , 58 - 15 be the result on the game at austin , texas v iowa state and kansa state\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate relevant data in the table: columns = [texas vs, overall record, austin...], relevant column names are ut, iowa state, kansas state\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"texas vs\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"iowa state\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"kansas state\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Find row index for Iowa State and Kansas State\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"texas vs\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"iowa state\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"kansas state\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Extract values from identified row indexes\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"texas vs\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"iowa state\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"kansas state\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Find specific game results for Texas vs Iowa State and Kansas State\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"kansas state\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Verify if the games at austin , texas for both opponents are tied or not\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"kansas state\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Check if ut , 58 - 15 matches both results\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"kansas state\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Determine the answer\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"kansas state\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
