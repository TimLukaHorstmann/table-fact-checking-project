We look at the 'data' table in the json format, which contains information about each tennis player's performance in various tournaments.\n\n3. Specifically, we are interested in the rows where 'tournament' is one of the grand slam tournaments (i.e., 'grand slam tournaments', 'australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', or 'us open').\n\n4. We need to check if Olga Govortsova has reached the final in any of these grand slam tournaments.\n\n5. Looking at the data, we see that in 2009, Olga Govortsova was in the 'grand slam tournaments' category and won a match, but we cannot tell if she was in the finals or not because only 'win - loss' is given for this year, which implies that she lost.\n\n6. However, we also notice that in 2011, 'win - loss' for Olga Govortsova is '2-4', meaning she lost that match and thus did not make it to the final.\n\n7. Given these observations, we can now conclude whether or not Olga Govortsova has reached the finals of a grand slam tournament.\n\n8. Based on our analysis, the claim \"Olga Govortsova have never reach the final in a grand slam tournament\" is FALSE because she did reach the finals and lost in 2009.\n\nHere's the output JSON:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"grand slam tournaments\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"grand slam tournaments\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"year - end championship\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, we need to identify the column names from the table data.\n   - The relevant columns for this task are:\n     - `tournament`\n     - `2007`, `2008`, ..., `2011` (representing the tournament year)\n     - `win - loss` (representing the result of the tournament)\n\n2. Next, we need to find the furthest Olga Govortsova has ever advanced in a grand slam tournament.\n   - We can do this by looking at her results from each year.\n\n3. Now that we know which columns are relevant, let's look for Olga Govortsova's result in the `win - loss` column:\n   - The relevant rows are those where \"Olga Govortsova\" is not present in the first column.\n   \n4. In the table, Olga Govortsova is found in the 5th row of her data and has advanced to the 3rd round.\n\n5. We need to verify that this furthest advancement of 3 rounds for a \"grand slam tournament\".\n\n6. Since Grand Slam tournaments include Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open.\n   - According to the table:\n     - She won at the Australian Open, advancing one round beyond the third.\n     - Her results do not show that she won any Grand Slam Tournament after the third round.\n\n7. Now that we know Olga Govortsova's furthest advancement in a grand slam tournament is 3 rounds (or possibly more), let's verify this claim:\n   - If true, it should be present in her data in one of the columns as \"grand slam tournaments\" before the last column which represents the win/loss statistics.\n\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"First, identify the relevant columns for this task.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Next, find Olga Govortsova's furthest advancement in a grand slam tournament.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Now that we know which columns are relevant, look for Olga Govortsova's result in the win - loss column\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify that this is indeed her furthest advancement and it corresponds to a grand slam tournament.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if the claim 'the furthest Olga Govortsova have ever advance in a grand slam tournament be the third round' matches our calculated answer\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"grand slam tournaments\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We will count the number of wins for Olga Govortsova in each year by counting the instances where \"win\" appears in the same row as one of the tournaments (which are: grand slam tournaments, australian open, french open, wimbledon, us open).\n\n4. For each year, we will check if the count of wins is 5 or more.\n\n5. If there is at least one year where Olga Govortsova won at least 5 Grand Slam tournament matches, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for this problem:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"2007\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"2008\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"2009\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"2010\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if Olga Govortsova won at least 5 Grand Slam tournament matches in any given year from 2007-2011\",\n    \"For each row where 'win' appears, check the corresponding column to see if it is one of the Grand Slam tournaments.\",\n    \"Count wins for each year by counting instances where 'grand slam tournaments', 'australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', or 'us open' appear in the same row as 'win'.\",\n    \"For each year, check if count of wins is 5 or more.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"2007\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"2009\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"2010\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that from 2007 to 2011, Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking has always gone up. To verify this, we need to check if her year-end rankings increased over these years.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we find the row for \"year - end championship\" in 2007-2011, which contains the ranking information. The relevant column is the one corresponding to each year from 2007 to 2011.\n\n3. Checking each row, we see that the rankings for 2008 and 2009 are 49 and 52 respectively, while the rankings for 2010 and 2011 are 74 and 114 respectively. This suggests that the ranking has indeed increased over these years.\n\n4. However, to confirm if the claim is always true, we need to check the next year's ranking (2012) as well, since the claim only mentions from 2007 to 2011.\n\n5. Unfortunately, there is no data for 2012 in the table, so we cannot determine if Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking went up in 2012.\n\n6. Based on the available data, it seems that Olga Govortsova's WTA year-end ranking did go up from 2007 to 2011, but we cannot confirm this for all years, specifically 2012.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year - end championship\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year - end ranking\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"2007\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"2008\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"2009\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"2010\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the Claim\nThe claim states that Olga Govortsova advances to the third round in the French Open for 5 years in a row.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Relevant Data from Table\nTo verify the claim, we need to find Olga Govortsova's performance in the French Open tournament. We can do this by looking at the \"French Open\" column and finding her year-by-year data.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"french open\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Verify Yearly Advancements to Third Round\nWe need to check if Olga Govortsova advances to the third round in the French Open for 5 consecutive years.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"french open\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"french open\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"french open\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"french open\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check Yearly Advancements\nWe can see that Olga Govortsova advances to the third round in the French Open for 2 years (2008 and 2011), not 5.
