Specifically, we are interested in the numbers associated with these entities within the table.\n\n3. **Locate Administrative Panel Data**: In the table's \"data\" section, find the row that corresponds to the \"administrative panel\". Since party names are listed first, we can identify this by looking for an entry named \"administrative panel\".\n\n4. **Extract Administrative Panel Numbers**: The numbers associated with the administrative panel will be found in the 2nd column of its data entry, since the counts for each political entity or group start from index 1 (0 indexing), the number representing administrative panel would indeed be at index 1.\n\n5. **Locate National University of Ireland Data**: Next, we need to identify where the \"national university of ireland\" is listed in the table\u2019s data section. It should appear as a row with its name followed by a count, which will indicate how many members it has according to this dataset.\n\n6. **Extract National University of Ireland Numbers**: The number associated with the national university of Ireland will be found in what appears to be an entry with that exact text, since the counts are indexed starting from 1 and appear after each party's name.\n\n7. **Compare Counts**: To determine if the claim is true, we compare the count for the \"administrative panel\" to the count for the \"national university of ireland\". If the administrative panel has indeed 4 more members, then the statement holds true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n8. **Output Conclusion**: Based on the comparison made in step 7, output a final JSON response that includes the chain of thought up to this point, whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, and relevant cell indices.\n\n### Chain_of_thought:\n\n- Extracted administrative panel data: [data[1][1], data[1][2]] = [4, 11]\n- Extracted national university of ireland data: [data[6][0], data[6][1]] = [3, 3]\n\n### Answer:\n\"administrative panel has 8 more members than the national university of Ireland\"\n\n### Relevant_cells:\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"administrative panel\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national university of ireland\"}\n]",
