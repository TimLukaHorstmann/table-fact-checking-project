Extract the relevant data from the table to investigate the claim.\n   - The columns of interest are attendance, team, and location.\n   - We need to check if Golden State, Memphis, and New Orleans have the same attendance.\n\n2. Check the attendance for each team mentioned in the claim.\n   - For Golden State: Attendance is not specified because it only has 3 digits (\"us airways center\"), which might be an abbreviation of a full address.

Look at the team \"memphis\" in subsequent rows.\n   - In the row before the Golden State data, Memphis has an attendance of 15908.\n   - In the same row as the Golden State data, Memphis again has an attendance of 18422.\n\n4. Check the attendance for New Orleans.\n   - The attendance for New Orleans is 17781 in its respective row.\n\n5. Compare the attendance values to determine if all three have the same value.\n   - The attendance values are not the same; Golden State's was only partially filled, but Memphis' and New Orleans' were different from each other.\n\n6. Conclude based on the comparison of attendance values.\n   - Since the attendance for Golden State is not a complete number (implying it might be missing information or an error), comparing it directly to the attendance values for Memphis and New Orleans would be incorrect, but if we consider only the given data that includes full numbers, then no, they do not have the same value.\n\nHere's the output in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"memphis\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"new orleans\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, we need to identify the row that corresponds to the game against New Orleans.\n   - Look at the table data: The second element of each cell represents the date.

Next, we need to verify if this game had the highest attendance.\n   - Look at the value in cell \"location attendance\" for row index 3: It's \"17781\".\n   - Check if there are any rows with a higher value for \"location attendance\". \n   - Compare this value to each other cell's location attendance:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 0,\n       \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 5,\n       \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n     }\n     ```\n3.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim is about the game against New Orleans having the highest attendance.\n2. **Find the Relevant Game**: In the table, we need to find the row that corresponds to the game against New Orleans. This can be done by looking for the \"team\" column and finding the row where the team name is \"new orleans\".\n3. **Extract the Attendance Value**: Once we find the relevant row, we need to extract the attendance value for that row. The attendance values are in the \"location attendance\" column.\n4. **Compare with Other Games**: To verify if it's the highest attendance, we also need to compare this attendance value with other games. This can be done by iterating through all rows and finding the maximum attendance value across all teams.\n\n### Code Implementation (Python):\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the table from JSON format\ntable = json.loads('''\n{\n  \"columns\": [\n    \"game\",\n    \"date\",\n    \"team\",\n    \"location attendance\",\n    \"record\"\n  ],\n  \"data\": [\n    [\n      75,\n      \"april 1\",\n      \"houston\",\n      \"us airways center 18422\",\n      \"41 - 34\"\n    ],\n    [\n      76,\n      \"april 3\",\n      \"sacramento\",\n      \"us airways center 18422\",\n      \"42 - 34\"\n    ],\n    [\n      77,\n      \"april 5\",\n      \"dallas\",\n      \"american airlines center 20301\",\n      \"42 - 35\"\n    ],\n    [\n      78,\n      \"april 8\",\n      \"new orleans\",\n      \"new orleans arena 17781\",\n      \"43 - 35\"\n    ],\n    [\n      79,\n      \"april 10\",\n      \"memphis\",\n      \"fedexforum 15908\",\n      \"43 - 36\"\n    ],\n    [\n      80,\n      \"april 11\",\n      \"minnesota\",\n      \"target center 18478\",\n      \"44 - 36\"\n    ],\n    [\n      81,\n      \"april 13\",\n      \"memphis\",\n      \"us airways center 18422\",\n      \"45 - 36\"\n    ],\n    [\n      82,\n      \"april 15\",\n      \"golden state\",\n      \"us airways center\",\n      \"46 - 36\"\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n''')\n\n# Find the row corresponding to New Orleans game\nnew_orleans_row = next((row for row in table['data'] if row[2] == 'new orleans'), None)\n\nif new_orleans_row:\n    # Extract attendance value for New Orleans game\n    new_orleans_attendance = int(new_orleans_row[3].split(' ')[0])\n\n    # Find the maximum attendance across all teams\n    max_attendance = max(int(row[3].split(' ')[0]) for row in table['data'])\n\n    # Compare with other games\n    relevant_cells = [{\"row_index\": i, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"} for i, row in enumerate(table['data']) if int(row[3].split(' ')[0]) == max_attendance]\nelse:\n    relevant_cells = []\n\n# Output the answer in JSON format\nprint(json.dumps({\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Found New Orleans game\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\" if new_orleans_attendance < max_attendance else \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": relevant_cells\n}))\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Found New Orleans game, Step 2: Extracted attendance value for New Orleans game, Step 3: Compared with other games\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}]\n}\n```",
