Next, we need to verify if the Kirin Cup had a game on May 21, 1998.\n   - Looking at the table, we find the entry: [ \"1998 - 05 - 21\", \"kobe universiade memorial stadium kobe , japan\", \"1 - 0\", \"kirin cup\", \"456\" ]\n   - This indicates that the Kirin Cup also had a game on May 21, 1998.\n\n3.

However, upon filtering the table to only include world cup matches and counting them, we find that there are only 4 matches in total. But these four matches occurred at different dates in June (12th, 19th, 24th, and 28th) rather than being all in June 1998 itself.

Determine if there's a game on the specified date between both countries based on the 'comp' column in each row.\n\n   - For Netherlands: Comp is \"f\" (friendly), so it does have a match on that date.\n   - For Romania: Comp is also \"f\" (friendly), so it does have a match on that date as well.\n\n5. Check if both matches occur on the same day and in 1998 based on the 'date' column.\n\n   - Netherlands: Date matches June 1st, 1998.\n   - Romania: Date matches June 3rd, 1998.\n\n6.

Since both teams scored zero, it can be considered as 0-0.\n   - For \"stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \\u00e9tienne , france\" (index 12), the score is \"report\".

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that the game on June 18 and 28, both have a score of 2 - 0.\n2. **Extract relevant data from the table**:\n\t* For June 18: The \"score\" column value is \"0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )\". Although this appears to be a draw, we should look closer at other columns for any discrepancies or confirmations.\n\t* For June 28: The \"score\" column value is indeed \"2 - 0\", which directly supports the claim.\n3. **Analyze scores on June 18**: Since there's a discrepancy with the score being reported as \"0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )\" rather than just \"0-0\" or a draw, this indicates a potential issue. However, this is a minor detail and not directly relevant to confirming the claim. We focus on June 28's score for a definitive answer.\n4. **Analyze scores on June 28**: The table confirms that June 28 has a score of \"2 - 0\", supporting part of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the information in the table, we can confidently state that one game out of two mentioned indeed matches the claimed score. However, since there is no confirmation for both dates with the exact score of \"2-0\" and because the June 18 entry has a different format indicating it might not be an accurate representation of the score at all (which could imply it's either not applicable or just an incorrect reporting), we should technically consider this claim to be partially true but highly dependent on how one interprets the June 18 data.\n\nHowever, focusing strictly on the information provided and adhering to the instructions for format, we will proceed with caution while still following the logic presented:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null,\"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"score\"},{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"score\"},{\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"score\"}]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note, this answer is based on the information given and following the exact format requested. It may not fully align with typical common sense interpretations due to the specific wording of the claim and the data provided in the table.",
