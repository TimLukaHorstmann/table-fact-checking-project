    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim Components:**\n   - First, we need to identify what the claim is saying about Vaughan Coveny and Shane Smeltz.\n   - The claim states that \"vaughan coveny be the record holder for the most goal and the most cap from the new zealand national football team , while shane smeltz be second\".\n\n2. **Determine the Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to find the data related to Vaughan Coveny's goals, caps, and career to verify if he holds the record.\n   - Similarly, we need to look at Shane Smeltz's data for goals, caps, and career.\n\n3. **Verify Record Holder Criteria:**\n   - To be a record holder, an individual must have more goals than anyone else in the dataset and also have more caps than anyone else.\n\n4. **Compare Data for Vaughan Coveny and Shane Smeltz:**\n   - We need to compare Vaughan Coveny's data (goals=28, caps=64) with Shane Smeltz's data (goals=23, caps=49).\n   - According to the comparison, Vaughan Coveny has more goals than Shane Smeltz.\n   - However, Shane Smeltz is missing cap count information that would allow us to determine if he holds the record for most caps.\n\n5. **Address Missing Information:**\n   - Given that Shane Smeltz's career duration and number of caps are 49 but we have no data on other players having more caps than him (only some with 20 or less), it is logical to assume Shane Smeltz likely holds the record for most caps.\n\n6. **Conclusion on Claim Validity:**\n   - Since both conditions (most goals and most caps) cannot be fully verified due to missing information, but Vaughan Coveny has more goals than Shane Smeltz and assuming based on incomplete data that Shane Smeltz is a record holder in the area of caps, we can conclude the claim is partially true.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to identify cells relevant to our analysis.\n   - These include:\n     ```json\n     [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 0,\n         \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 1,\n         \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 2,\n         \"column_name\": \"career\"\n       }\n     ]\n     ```\n     This list represents the relevant cells for comparing Vaughan Coveny and Shane Smeltz.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim components: vaughan coveny is record holder in goals and caps, shane smeltz is second\",\n    \"Determine relevant data: compare coveny and smeltz's goal and cap counts\",\n    \"Verify criteria for record holders: must have most goals and most caps\",\n    \"Compare Coveny and Smeltz data: Coveny has more goals than Smeltz, but missing cap information for Smeltz to determine if he holds the cap record\",\n    \"Address missing information: assuming Smeltz likely has the record for most caps due to lack of comparable data in the set\",\n    \"Conclusion on claim validity: partially true because both criteria (goals and caps) cannot be fully verified but Coveny is confirmed to have more goals than Smeltz and Smeltz likely holds the record for most caps\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"career\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

We can do this by looking at the row indices of players who have more caps than these three players.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if any other player is also in the top 20\"\n    },\n    \"Relevant cells: [1,4], [2,4] with 'caps' and 'name' columns\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Cap Counts of Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner\nFinally, we need to compare the cap counts of Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner. If any of them have more caps than these three players, then they are not the only players in the top 20.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the cap counts of Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner\"\n    },\n    \"Relevant cells: [1,4], [2,4] with 'caps' and 'name' columns\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Determine if the Claim is True or False\nBased on our analysis, we can now determine if the claim is true or false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if the claim is true or false\"\n    },\n    \"Grant Turner has 42 caps, Colin Walker has 15 caps and Steve Sumner has 58 caps. Therefore, Grant Turner and Colin Walker are not in the top 20.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"caps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim we need to evaluate is whether Chris Wood would become the highest scoring athlete for New Zealand National Football Team if he scored 5 more goals throughout his time with the team.\n\nFirstly, we find that there are two rows containing information about Michael McGarry and Wynton Rufer respectively in columns labeled \"goals\".",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data**: The claim mentions Vaughan Coveney's cap count during his second year, third year, and overall with the team.\n2. **Locate Vaughan Coveney's Data in the Table**: Find Vaughan Coveney's data by searching for \"vaughn coveny\" in the \"name\" column of the table.\n3. **Extract Relevant Information from Vaughan Coveney's Data**:\n\t* First year: 1992\n\t* Last cap: 4 June 2006 (This indicates that his last cap was during the 2005-2006 season)\n\t* Caps in first two years: We need to calculate this based on his career duration and caps.\n4. **Calculate Vaughan Coveney's Caps in First Two Years**:\n\t* Total career duration: 1992 - 2006 = 14 years\n\t* Number of caps in last year (2005-2006): 28\n\t* Assuming he played for the team for all 14 years, subtract the last year's caps from his total to find the caps in first two years: 28 - 1 = 27 (assuming 1 cap from 1992 is counted)\n5. **Determine Vaughan Coveney's Caps During Second and Third Year**:\n\t* Since we know he played for 14 years, his second year would be around 1994-1995.\n\t* His third year would be around 1995-1996.\n\t* We can calculate the caps during these two years by subtracting the first two years' caps (27) from the total career duration (14). However, we need to find which of those caps falls in his second and third years. The last cap is on June 4th, 2006, so caps during that time would be 28.\n\t* We can't directly determine the number of caps for each year without knowing the exact dates or years played per game but we know the range when his first cap was (1992) and last cap. Hence if he has only one cap in 1992 then for his second and third years he could have at max two cap.\n6. **Check Overall Caps**: The overall caps are given as 64.\n7. **Evaluate Claim**:\n\t* Claim states that Vaughan Coveney has a cap during his second year, third year, and overall he has 19 caps throughout his year with the team.\n\t* Given the total caps (64) and assuming we can't directly calculate each year separately, but knowing our total caps range is 64 and his last year was 2005-2006 when he had 28 caps ,it makes it unlikely that he will have more than 19 throughout his career given caps during first two years would be low considering the overall number. However, without exact details, we can't determine with absolute certainty if this is true or not.\n8. **Identify Relevant Cells for Claim**:\n\t* Since we can't directly calculate each year separately due to lack of data on games per year and hence, the only relevant information that can help us in determining if his statement is true or false would be his first cap (1992) , last cap (2006) and overall caps (64). Hence cells with \"vaughn coveny\", caps in first two years are not directly needed for our calculation here\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Locate Vaughan Coveney's data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Extract information from his data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Calculate caps in first two years\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine caps during second and third year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Check overall caps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Evaluate claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant cells for claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}",
