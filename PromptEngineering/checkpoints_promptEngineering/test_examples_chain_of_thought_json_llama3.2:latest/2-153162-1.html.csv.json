    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which subsidiaries are equal equity holders.\n2. To do this, we'll look at the 'group 's equity shareholding' column for each subsidiary.\n3. We can see that there are multiple values in this column for some subsidiaries, indicating that they don't have 100% equity stake.\n4. For example, \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd\" has a value of \"100%\", but \"ge engine services malaysia\" and \"lsg sky chefs\" both have different percentages.\n5. Therefore, it's unlikely that all subsidiaries have equal equity shares.\n\n2.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: Understand what the claim states - \"malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate\". We need to check if Malaysia Airlines has a 30% equity shareholding in any of its associates.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**: Extract the relevant data from the table that pertains to this issue:\n   - The 'type' column specifies 'associate'.\n   - The 'group 's equity shareholding' column needs to be checked for each row where type is 'associate'. We need a 30% equity shareholding.\n\n3. **Check Malaysia Airlines Subsidiaries**: Locate the rows related to Malaysia Airlines subsidiaries and check their equity shareholdings.\n   - Look at the first entry: \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd\" has 100%. This doesn't match because it's 100%, not 30%.\n   - Then, look at the second entry for ge engine services malaysia. It's a joint venture, not an associate and thus this doesn't fit.\n   - Next, check maswings sdn bhd which is indeed a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines but has 100% equity shareholding, again not matching.\n\n4. **Identify Associates with 30% Shareholding**: Since we need to identify if any associates have exactly 30%, look through the list again.\n   - Upon reviewing further rows in the table:\n     + Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is listed as an associate but only has a 20% share, which doesn't match.\n     + LSG Sky Chefs is listed as an associate and indeed has a 30% equity shareholding, fitting our criteria.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Determine if Malaysia Airlines have a 30% equity shareholding in none of its associates based on the findings from step 4.\n   - Given that we found one instance (LSG Sky Chefs) where Malaysia Airlines does hold 30% in an associate, this claim is false because it states they do not.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Identify the Claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Extract Relevant Data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Check Malaysia Airlines Subsidiaries\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"Identify Associates with 30% Shareholding\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 11,\n          \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
