    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the rows in the table where the fighter won against Paul Weremecki and Gary Padilla\nLooking at the 'data' section of the table, we need to find the rows where the fighter's name is 'Paul Weremecki' and the opponent's name is 'Gary Padilla'.\n\n### Step 2: Extract relevant data from each identified row\nFor Paul Weremecki, the relevant data is found in the following row:\n```\n[\n  \"win\",\n  \"14 - 10\",\n  \"seung bae whi\",\n  \"decision (unanimous)\",\n  \"road fc 11\",\n  3,\n  \"5:00\",\n  \"seoul , south korea\"\n]\n```\n\nFor Gary Padilla, the relevant data is found in the following row:\n```\n[\n  \"win\",\n  \"1 - 0\",\n  \"gary padilla\",\n  \"decision (split)\",\n  \"total combat 15\",\n  3,\n  \"5:00\",\n  \"san diego , california , united states\"\n]\n```\n\nHowever, for Paul Weremecki's match against Gary Padilla is not found in the table. \n\n### Step 3: Check if Paul Weremecki won his fight against gary padilla with the method tko (head kick and punches)\nSince there is no row where Paul Weremecki fought against Gary Padilla, we cannot confirm this part of the claim.\n\n### Step 4: Verify if Paul Weremecki won the match against another fighter with tko (head kick and punches) \nWe need to look for a row where the fighter's name is 'Paul Weremecki' and the method used is 'tko (head kick and punches)'.\n```\n[\n  \"win\",\n  \"2 - 0\",\n  \"paul weremecki\",\n  \"tko (head kick and punches)\",\n  \"sf 17: hot zone\",\n  1,\n  \"2:11\",\n  \"portland , oregon , united states\"\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Check if Gary Padilla won the match against another fighter with decision (split)\nWe need to look for a row where the opponent's name is 'gary padilla' and the method used is 'decision (split)'.\n```\n[\n  \"win\",\n  \"1 - 0\",\n  \"gary padilla\",\n  \"decision (split)\",\n  \"total combat 15\",\n  3,\n  \"5:00\",\n  \"san diego , california , united states\"\n]\n```\n\n### Step 6: Combine the results of steps 3-5 and draw a conclusion\nFrom step 4, we know that Paul Weremecki won his fight against another fighter with tko (head kick and punches). However, we cannot confirm if this is the same opponent as in the claim. From step 5, we can see that Gary Padilla won his match against another fighter with decision (split).\n\nSince there's no evidence for Paul Weremecki winning against Gary Padilla with the specified methods, and based on the information about both fighters, our conclusion will be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"Paul Weremecki\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"Gary Padilla\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"method\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 5,\n            \"column_name\": \"Paul Weremecki\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"Gary Padilla\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Note: We ignored some rows because there is no row where Paul Weremecki fights against Gary Padilla, and we could not find the match between them.",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim components**:\n   - The claim states two specific fights: against Glover Teixeira and Jan Nortje.\n   - It claims Glover Teixeira was beaten with a method of KO (punches).\n   - It also claims Jan Nortje won with a method of TKO (punches).\n\n2. **Extract relevant data**:\n   - We need to check the win/loss status for both opponents against these specific outcomes.\n   \n3. **Check Glover Teixeira\u2019s fight outcome**:\n   - According to the table, Glover Teixeira was beaten by Jan Nortje in a KO (punches) round, not an opponent named Gloster Teixeira. However, we should also check for any other matches against Gloster Teixeira.\n\n4. **Check Jan Nortje\u2019s fight outcome**:\n   - In the table, Jan Nortje is indeed shown as having won a match against Glover Teixeira with a method of TKO (punches).\n   \n5. **Gloster Teixeira\u2019s actual opponent**:\n   - There's no information in the provided data for Gloster Teixeira.\n\n6. **Check other matches involving Glover Teixeira and Jan Nortje**:\n   - No other losses by KO punches against Glover Teixeira are found, but a submission loss against Jan Teixeira exists.\n\n7. **Conclusion based on findings**:\n   - The claim about Gloster Teixeira doesn't have enough data to verify its truthfulness.\n   - However, the statement that Jan Nortje beat Glover Teixeira via TKO (punches) is supported by the table data.\n\n### Output in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. We need to check if both fight with opponent Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander, and lose with method TKO (punches) for both.\n\n2. First, we can extract all rows where \"opponent\" is either 'Shamil Abdurahimov' or 'Houston Alexander'. These rows are:\n   * [\n     \"loss\",\n     \"9 - 8\",\n     \"shamil abdurahimov\",\n     \"tko (punches)\",\n     \"adfc : round 2\",\n     3,\n     \"2:17\",\n     \"abu dhabi , united arab emirates\"\n   ]\n   * [\n     \"loss\",\n     \"9 - 7\",\n     \"houston alexander\",\n     \"tko (punches)\",\n     \"shark fights 13: jardine vs prangley\",\n     2,\n     \"1:31\",\n     \"amarillo , texas , united states\"\n   ]\n\n3. Next, we can check if the method for both of these rows is 'tko (punches)'. Both of these rows indeed have this method.\n\n4. Now, we need to check if there are any other rows where either 'Shamil Abdurahimov' or 'Houston Alexander' is the opponent and TKO (punches) is the method. The only such row is:\n   * [\n     \"loss\",\n     \"5 - 3\",\n     \"luiz can\\u00e9\",\n     \"tko (punches)\",\n     \"ufc 89\",\n     2,\n     \"4:15\",\n     \"birmingham , england\"\n   ]\n\n   However, the opponent is Luiz Cane in this row and not either of the two we are looking for. So, it does not meet our requirements.\n\n5. We need to check if there are any other rows where 'Shamil Abdurahimov' or 'Houston Alexander' is the opponent and TKO (punches) is the method. There aren't any such rows in this dataset.\n\n6. Since we have found that both Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander lose with method TKO (punches), but there isn't another row where either of them loses to one of these opponents with this method, our answer will be that the claim is false.\n\n7.

Since none of these conditions are met, it appears that the claim about Paul Weremecki or Gary Padilla losing their respective matches is not true. \n\n7. However we must note that there was no search done on 2nd step and neither match exist in the table so let us provide some final steps\n\n8. We have a loss against paul weremecki, but he did win his fight with method \"tko (head kick and punches)\".\n9. There is also a loss to gary padilla but it was with decision not tko (head kick and punches).\n\n10. Therefore the statement does contain false elements.\n\n11.

We find that the 5th opponent is indeed Glover Teixeira.\n\n- Relevance:\n  ```\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Step 4: Check if Jan Nortje's fight is a win by TKO (punches)\nTo verify this, we need to find the row index of Jan Nortje in the table and check if the \"res\" value is \"win\" with the \"method\" being \"tko (punches)\".\n\n### Step 5: Extract relevant cell data for Jan Nortje's fight\nThe row index of Jan Nortje can be found by looking at the \"opponent\" column, which contains his name. We find that the 6th opponent is indeed Jan Nortje.\n\n- Relevance:\n  ```\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Step 6: Determine if Glover Teixeira's fight against him was a loss by KO (punches)\nGlover Teixeira's opponent is at row index 4. The value of this cell for the column \"res\" is indeed \"loss\", and the value for the column \"method\" is \"ko (punches)\". Hence, Glover Teixeira's fight against him was a loss by KO (punches).\n\n### Step 7: Determine if Jan Nortje's fight against him was a win with TKO (punches)\nJan Nortje's opponent is at row index 5. The value of this cell for the column \"res\" is indeed \"win\", and the value for the column \"method\" is \"tko (punches)\". Hence, Jan Nortje's fight against him was a win with TKO (punches).\n\n### Step 7: Determine if both claims are true\nSince Glover Teixeira's fight against him was indeed a loss by KO (punches), but Jan Nortje's fight against him was a win with TKO (punches), the statement in the claim is false.\n\n### Chain of thought\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n  }\n]\nfalse\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"res\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\nStep 3: Re-evaluate the claim without considering the first case\nSince the first case is already FALSE, we can ignore it and only consider Houston Alexander's fight.\nIn the table, Houston Alexander's opponent is listed as Ryan Jimmo, not Houston Alexander. However, Houston Alexander is indeed listed in a row where he won with method tko (punches).\n\nStep 4: Check if Houston Alexander's win was due to tko (punches)\nAccording to the claim, both fights should have been wins with method tko (punches). In Houston Alexander's case, his winning method is indeed tko (punches), so this part of the claim seems TRUE.\n\nStep 5: Re-evaluate Shamil Abdurahimov's fight\nSince we've already determined that the first case was FALSE, we can re-examine Shamil Abdurahimov's row. In Shamil Abdurahimov's row, he actually lost with method tko (punches) to Houston Alexander. However, the claim states that both fights should have been wins.\n\nStep 6: Combine the results\nFrom step 2 and step 5, we know that one case of the claim is FALSE and the other case is TRUE.

The table indicates one fight did occur in the US: Gary Padilla's match against an opponent from California.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: From our analysis, Kazuhiro Nakamura and Bob Sapp both have matches outside the United States, specifically in Japan. Glover Teixeira had a match but was in Brazil, not England. Brisbane has no records of fights here. Meanwhile, Gary Padilla's match indeed occurred within the US.\n\n6. **Final Check**: Review each city mentioned to ensure accuracy and completeness in our assessment.\n\n7. **Conclusion on Claim Accuracy**: The claim states there are fighters with matches in countries inside the United States including specified cities outside of it. Our review found that while there were fighters with international matches, not all were from within the US as implied by the question's phrasing about countries \"inside\" the US. Only one match occurred within a state of the US.\n\n8. **Final Evaluation**: Since we've identified at least one fight within the United States but have mixed or entirely false claims for fights in other countries like Japan and Australia, the claim cannot be universally confirmed as accurate due to its broad phrasing about \"inside\" the US and including international cities.\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 34,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"city\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
