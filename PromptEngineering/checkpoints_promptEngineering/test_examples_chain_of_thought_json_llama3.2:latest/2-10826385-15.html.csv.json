This will serve as our benchmark to compare against the count from step 3.\n\nStep 5: Compare the count from step 3 to half of the total away teams (calculated in step 4).\nWe then compare this count to the calculated half to determine if more than half have a score greater than 10.\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Extract the away team scores from the table.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Identify the away teams with scores greater than 10.\",\n            \"away_teams_with_high_scores\": [\n                {\n                    \"row_index\": 0,\n                    \"column_name\": \"away team\",\n                    \"value\": \"st kilda\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"row_index\": 1,\n                    \"column_name\": \"away team\",\n                    \"value\": \"north melbourne\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Count the number of away teams with scores greater than 10.\",\n            \"count_of_teams_with_high_scores\": 2\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Calculate half of the total away teams.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 0,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

From the \"data\" section of the table, we can see that the home teams and their scores are in columns 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of home team scores**: To find the average, we first need to calculate the sum of all home team scores. We will add up the values in column 2 of the \"data\" section.\n\n3. **Count the number of rows with data**: Since each row represents a single game, the total number of rows is equal to the total number of games played. In this case, there are 6 rows.\n\n4. **Calculate the average home team score**: Now that we have the sum and count, we can calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count.\n\n5. **Compare with 12**: Finally, we compare the calculated average to 12 to determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\nHere's how these steps translate into JSON:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Extract home team scores from column 2 of data\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Sum the extracted values (91 + 110 + ...)\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the number of rows with data (6)\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate the sum of home team scores\",\n      \"sum\": 91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73,\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate the average of home team scores\",\n      \"average\": (91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73) / 6,\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the average to 12\",\n      \"average\": (91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73) / 6,\n      \"comparison_result\": (91 + 110 + 90 + 128 + 128 + 73) / 6 < 12\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": true,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nThis output contains the chain of thought in JSON format, as well as the final answer and relevant cells.",
