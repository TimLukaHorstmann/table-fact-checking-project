We notice that the table has a row with the opponent \"Jacksonville Jaguars\" and the game site \"reliant stadium\". The attendance of this cell (70041.0) does not help us confirm or deny the claim about Houston Texans, as it refers to Jacksonville Jaguars' home games played at Reliant Stadium.\n\n4. After examining all cells in the table that mention the team playing at Reliant Stadium, we notice another row with opponent \"Jacksonville Jaguars\" and the game site \"alltel stadium\". This information indicates a possible visit from Houston Texans or some other NFL team to Alltel (later renamed as HP Field) and does not confirm it was Reiliant.\n\n5. Further examining the table reveals that there are indeed at least 2 cells with Houston Texan\u2019s opponent played in Alltel Stadium, however we can not verify if any of these Houston texans games occurred at Reliant stadium as a result\n\n6.
