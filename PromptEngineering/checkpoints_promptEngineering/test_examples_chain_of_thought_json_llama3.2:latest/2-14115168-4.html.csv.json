Compare the values in the \"founded\" cells to determine which institution was founded earlier.\n3. Check if Peru State College (row 7) has a lower \"founded\" value than the earliest one.\n\nLet's go through these steps with the given data:\n\n1. For each row, we can extract the \"row_index\" and column name as follows:\n   - Row 0: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 1: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 2: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 3: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 4: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 5: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 6: {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 7: {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   - Row 8: {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n\n2.

Check if Peru State College (row 7) has a lower \"founded\" value than the earliest one:\n   - The earliest founded institution is Nebraska Wesleyan University (row 6), which was founded in 1887.\n   - However, Peru State College (row 7) was founded in 1865, which is earlier than NWU.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the claim that \"according to date of founding , peru state college be the oldest\" is TRUE. \n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}",

We need to check if there are any other Nebraska teams playing in the Midlands Conference.\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Nebraska Teams in the Midlands Conference**: To verify the claim, we will look at each row of the table that corresponds to a university or college in Nebraska (based on the \"school\" column).\n\n3. **Identify Relevant University Rows**: Since there are multiple universities listed from Nebraska, we need to check if they all meet the criteria specified by the claim.\n\n4. **Find Row Indexes for Each Relevant School**:\n   - We'll search for the row index of Bellevue University and find that its index is at 0 (index 0).\n   - Search for the row index of Nebraska Wesleyan University and find that its index is also 6.\n   - Now we know both universities meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Verify That Only One Team Plays in Midlands Conference**:\n   - Bellevue University plays in the \"Midlands\" conference, but another university (Nebraska Wesleyan) does not belong to this conference; instead, it belongs to \"Great Plains\". Hence, only one of them is a part of 'midland' as per claim.\n   - However we can't use this information. Because it was stated in the claim that there should be only nebraska teams playing in the midlands conference.\n\n6. **Check If There's Any Other Nebraska Team That Doesn't Play In The Midlands Conference**:\n    - We have found another university (Nebraska Wesleyan) from Nebraska.\n    - Now we need to check if it was stated that this university belongs to 'midland' or 'great plains'.\n\n7. **Verify Belonging Of University**: \n   - Search for the column name of \"conference\" in each relevant row index and find out what conference is Nebraska Wesleyan in.\n\n8. **Compare Conference**:\n    - Compare with the claim statement (only teams that are from Nebraska should be playing in 'midlands').\n    - In case, it's not true then our final answer will be false.\n\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process (continued):\n\n9. **Verify Final Answer**:\n   - Now that we have found the conference for each relevant university, we can use this information to determine if the claim is correct.\n\n10. **Output Result**:\n\n### Code\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the Claim's Relevant Information\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check Each Row for Nebraska Teams in the Midlands Conference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Identify Relevant University Rows\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"school\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"school\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Find Row Indexes for Each Relevant School\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Verify That Only One Team Plays in Midlands Conference\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Check If There's Any Other Nebraska Team That Doesn't Play In The Midlands Conference\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Verify Belonging Of University\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Compare Conference\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"conference\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 9,\n      \"description\": \"Verify Final Answer\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"national titles\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"national titles\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 10,\n      \"description\": \"Output Result\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 0,\n          \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"national titles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [...],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"national titles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, we need to identify the relevant columns for making a claim about institutions founded in the 19th century.\n   From the provided table, the relevant column will be \"founded\", which represents the year an institution was founded.\n\n2. Next, we'll iterate through each row of data to find the latest date mentioned that corresponds to its founding year.\n   Since the goal is to identify if a particular institution (\"peru state college\") is the last one found in the 19th century, we can focus on the relevant cell \"peru state college\" under the column \"founded\".\n\n3. We need to verify whether there's an institution with a founding year later than 1865 (the founding date of Peru State College), as this would indicate it is indeed the last one found in the 19th century.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant columns\",\n      \"description\": \"The 'columns' field indicates the table's header, and 'founded' is a relevant year to assess institution age\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find Peru State College data row\",\n      \"description\": \"Peru State College needs to be in the data array and its position relative to other colleges founded in 19th century\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify if a college after 1865 was found before or at the same year as Peru State College\",\n      \"description\": \"We are looking for other colleges that were founded in 19th century with any date after 1865 to assert Peru State College isn't last\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nOur reasoning steps highlight that we should identify whether there is any college founded in the 19th century after Peru State College's founding year (1865). Given that our claim asserts it as the last, finding colleges with later founding dates would disprove this assertion. In the provided table, Nebraska Wesleyan University has a founding year of 1887, which indeed is after 1865 and thus invalidates our claim about \"peru state college\" being the last institution found in the 19th century.\n\nNote: While we did not explicitly mention checking for cells that match Peru State College, assuming its cell data matches the criteria (founding year of 1865), we can see that Nebraska Wesleyan University indeed fulfills this condition and discredits our assertion.",
