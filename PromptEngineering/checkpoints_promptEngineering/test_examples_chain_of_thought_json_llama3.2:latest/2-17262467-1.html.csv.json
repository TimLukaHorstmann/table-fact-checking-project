We know that Jos\u00e9 Higueras was defeated in 1976. Therefore, we can calculate 3 years after this date by adding it:\n\\[1976+3 = 1979\\]\n\nStep 5: Verify if Van Winitsky lost to Kirmayr at that date\nNow, let's check the table for a loss of van winitsky (this is associated with row):\n{\n\"columns\": [\n    \"outcome\",\n    \"date\",\n    \"championship\",\n    \"surface\",\n    \"opponent in the final\",\n    \"score in the final\"\n],\n\"data\": [\n[\n\"runner - up\",\n1979,\n\"cairo , egypt\",\n\"clay\",\n\"peter feigl\",\n\"5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6\"\n]\n]\n}\n\nStep 6: Draw conclusion based on the evidence\nSince Van Winitsky was defeated by Kirmayr in 1979, which is indeed three years after Jos\u00e9 Higueras was defeated, we can verify that the claim is true.\n\n{\n\"chain_of_thought\": [\n{\n\"row_index\": 2,\n\"column_name\": \"date\"\n},\n{\n\"row_index\": 1,\n\"column_name\": \"date\"\n},\n{\n\"row_index\": 4,\n\"column_name\": \"score in the final\"\n}\n],\n\"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\" }, { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\" }, { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\" } ]\n}",
