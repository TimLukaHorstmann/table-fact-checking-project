According to the table, a chief justice is indicated by the rank being \"chief justice\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Iterate through each row in the data section\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the 'rank' column matches 'chief justice'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Counting Appointed Chief Justices\nWe will count how many judges have been appointed as chief justices.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Iterate through each row in the data section\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the 'rank' column matches 'chief justice'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of rows where 'rank' is 'chief justice'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Claim\nBased on our count, we can evaluate if only one judge has been appointed as a chief justice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Iterate through each row in the data section\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the 'rank' column matches 'chief justice'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of rows where 'rank' is 'chief justice'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare count to claim statement\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Finalizing Answer\nBased on our evaluation, we will provide the final answer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Iterate through each row in the data section\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the 'rank' column matches 'chief justice'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of rows where 'rank' is 'chief justice'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare count to claim statement\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant data points are as follows:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nSince two judges have been appointed as chief justices, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Iterate through each row in the data section\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the 'rank' column matches 'chief justice'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Count the number of rows where 'rank' is 'chief justice'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare count to claim statement\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This can be done by summing up the values in the `years until mandatory retirement` column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculating the total number of years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Summing up the values in the 'years until mandatory retirement' column\",\n      \"value\": 6 + 11 + 17 + 0 + 2 + 27 + 13 + 15 + 19\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": null,\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n3. **Determine if 2/3 of the judges have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement**: After calculating the total number of years, we can determine if 2/3 of the judges appointed have more than 10 years until their mandatory retirement.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determining if 2/3 of the judges have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Dividing the total number of years by 3\",\n      \"value\": (6 + 11 + 17 + 0 + 2 + 27 + 13 + 15 + 19) / 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing the result to 10\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": null,\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n4. **Output the final answer**: If the result from step 3 is greater than 10, then 2/3 of the judges appointed have more than 10 years until their mandatory retirement.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculating the total number of years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"Summing up the values in the 'years until mandatory retirement' column\",\n      \"value\": 6 + 11 + 17 + 0 + 2 + 27 + 13 + 15 + 19\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The actual output will depend on the calculations and comparisons performed in the steps above.",

First, let's extract the appointment year for Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. \n\nLooking at the \"data\" section of the table in json format:\n{\n  \"columns\": [\n    \"name\",\n    \"rank\",\n    \"years until mandatory retirement\",\n    \"appointed by\",\n    \"year appointed\"\n  ],\n  \"data\": [\n    [...],\n    [\n      \"edgardo rivera garcia\",\n      \"associate justice\",\n      \"11 years\",\n      \"luis fortu\u00f1o\",\n      2010\n    ],\n    [...],\n    [\n      \"federico hern\u00e1ndez denton\",\n      \"chief justice\",\n      \"0 year\",\n      \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n\",\n      2004\n    ],\n    [...]\n  ]\n}\n\nWe can see that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n was appointed in the year 2004.\n\nStep 2: Check if Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n's appointment year is consistent across all appointments.\n\nNext, let's verify if Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n only appointed new justices during the year 2004. Looking at the \"data\" section of the table:\n{\n  \"columns\": [\n    \"name\",\n    \"rank\",\n    \"years until mandatory retirement\",\n    \"appointed by\",\n    \"year appointed\"\n  ],\n  \"data\": [\n    [...],\n    [\n      \"edgardo rivera garcia\",\n      \"associate justice\",\n      \"11 years\",\n      \"luis fortu\u00f1o\",\n      2010\n    ],\n    [...],\n    [\n      \"federico hern\u00e1ndez denton\",\n      \"chief justice\",\n      \"0 year\",\n      \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n\",\n      2004\n    ],\n    [...]\n  ]\n}\n\nWe can see that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed at least one new justice, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, who was appointed in the year 2004. However, we need to check if there are any other appointments made by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n outside of the year 2004.\n\nLooking closer at the table, we can see that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n also appointed Erick Kolthoff Caraballo, who was appointed in the year 2009.\n\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on our findings.\n\nBased on our analysis, we found that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n did appoint new justices during the year 2004 and also during another year (in 2009).
