    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. The claim states that \"6 of the game end in a shut out.\" To evaluate this, we need to identify games where the score does not indicate any runs scored by either team.\n\n2. Looking at each row in the 'score' column, if it contains \"(X - X)\" notation without numbers (indicating no runs scored), or \"[X] - [X]\" notation (also indicating no runs scored), we can consider that game to be a shutout.\n\n3. Let's evaluate each of the 8 games with their respective scores:\n\n   - April 1: \"6 - 5 (10)\" indicates not a shutout.\n   - April 2: \"6 - 1\" indicates a non-shutout as well since one team scored 6 runs and the other scored only 1.\n   - April 4: \"6 - 2\" is also not a shutout for the same reason.\n   - April 5: Same reasoning applies, so it's not a shutout.\n   - April 6: The score shows \"[4 - 2]\" which indicates that both teams scored an equal number of runs and thus the game was not a shutout.\n\n4. Now looking at the \"postponed\" cells (which can be considered as no game being played) we have three instances where the claim could potentially apply: April 8, April 11, April 12.\n\n5. For April 8, it says \"[postponed] - [postponed]\" so even though there is a score given for attendance and record, since a \"postponed\" game was scheduled but not played (due to cold weather), we can still consider this as potentially being a shutout because no actual games were played.\n\n6. For April 11 and April 12, both have \"[postponed] - [postponed]\" which indicates they cannot be evaluated in the same way since there was no game played.\n\n7. Finally, evaluating \"5 - 0\" for April 9: This is a clear shutout since one team scored zero runs.\n8. Evaluating other rows with similar numbers like \"[4-0]\", \"[10 - 5]\" do not result in shutouts as they contain scores that indicate the teams both scored some amount.\n\n9. Evaluating \"6 - 5 (10)\" for April 29: Even though one team did score more runs, we must consider this to be a partial shutout because there is an extra parenthesis with the notation \"(X - X)\"; however since it does not specify that the numbers inside are zeros and thus implies both teams scored some amount of runs in those innings we can say no, this was not considered as part of our shutout games.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"postponed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"postponed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"postponed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"postponed\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"postponed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis indicates that there was only one instance of a game ending in a shutout.",
