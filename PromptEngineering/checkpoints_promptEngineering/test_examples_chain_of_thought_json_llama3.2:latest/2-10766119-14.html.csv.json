The crowd size for the match played at Victoria Park is 30000.\n\n4. **Compare with other venues**: To verify if this is indeed the largest crowd, we need to compare it with the crowd sizes from other matches. We will check the crowds from Western Oval and Lake Oval since they are also mentioned in the table.\n\n5. **Verify the claim**: Upon examining the data, we see that there is another match at Victoria Park where the crowd size was 13562. This suggests that Victoria Park does have a large crowd but it's not entirely clear if this is the largest for the entire 1928 VFL season.\n\n6. **Check the season details**: We need to verify that the dates and venues are consistent with the claim of having the largest crowd in the 1928 VFL season.\n\n7. **Confirm the claim**: The claim seems partially true, but without more data or context, we can't confirm if it's the largest for the entire season.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"venue\"},{\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"},{\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"},{\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"},{\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"},{\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"date\"}],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",
