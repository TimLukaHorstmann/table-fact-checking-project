    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the positions other than centre**: From the table, we can see that 'centre' is one of the positions listed in the 'position' column. To find the positions other than centre, we need to look for the values in this column that are not 'centre'. These values will be 'defence', 'left wing', and 'right wing'.\n\n2. **Count the number of players who play a position other than centre**: From the table, we can see the following players who play positions other than centre:\n\t- Defence: 6 players (Tom Ryan, Ian Ferguson, Timothy Hanley, Joseph Mcinnis, Stefan Larsson, Kelly Murphy)\n\t- Left Wing: 3 players (Vladimir Kyhos, Thomas Hussey, Henrik Cedegren)\n\t- Right Wing: 1 player (Henrik Cedegren)\n\n    Total players who play a position other than centre: 10\n\n3. **Verify if the claim is true or false**: Since we know that there are at least 8 players in the table who show in the picked players list play the position other than centre, the claim \"8 of the picked player show in the table play the position other than centre\" is indeed true.\n\n4. **Identify relevant cells**: The relevant cells for this problem are:\n    ```\n[\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified positions other than centre, counted the number of players who play a position other than centre, verified if the claim is true or false, and identified relevant cells.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"centre\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, we need to filter the table to find only Canadian players.\n   - We will look for rows where the 'nationality' column is either \"Canada\" or \"canada\".\n   - The relevant cells that contain this information are:\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 11,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 12,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 13,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 14,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 15,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 17,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 18,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 19,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 20,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 21,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 22,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 23,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 24,\n       \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n     }\n\n2. Next, we need to count how many Canadian players are in the table.\n   - Looking at our list of relevant cells from step 1, all 24 rows have Canadian nationality.\n\n3.
