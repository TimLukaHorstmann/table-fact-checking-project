    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to extract the relevant information from the table about the attendance on September 11.\n\n2. Then, we will sort the data for September 11 by attendance in descending order and find the game with the largest attendance.\n\n3. Finally, we compare our findings to the claim and determine whether it is true or false.\n\n4. Now let's extract the relevant information from the table:\n    - For each row in the data array, we need to check if the date matches \"september 11\" and get the corresponding values for visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance.\n    - Since our claim is about the largest attendance on September 11, we only care about these rows.\n\n5. Next, we sort the data for September 11 by attendance in descending order:\n    ```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n6. Then we find the game with the largest attendance on September 11:\n    ```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n7. Since the attendance for Texas Southern and New Hampshire are both larger than South Florida, our answer is FALSE.\n\nNow we have all the relevant information to determine if our claim is true or false.\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the rows in the table where \"indiana state\" and \"cincinnati\" are present as the visiting team and home team respectively.\n\n   - Relevant cells: \n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n     }\n   ```\n\n2. Next, we compare the attendance values of these two rows.\n\n   - Relevant cells:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n     }\n   ```\n\n3. Now, let's compare the attendance values of the two rows.\n\n   - Attendance for Indiana State: 30807\n   - Attendance for Cincinnati: 90612\n\n4. Since 30807 is less than 90612, we can conclude that the claim about Indiana State and Cincinnati on September 11 drawing the least attendance with only 30807 attending the game is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Finally, we need to check if this is the largest attendance among all games played on September 11th.\n\n   Looking at the relevant row for South Florida vs Connecticut again:\n    ```\n[\n  [\n    \"september 11\",\n    \"12:00 pm\",\n    \"south florida\",\n    \"connecticut\",\n    \"rentschler field east hartford , ct\",\n    \"big east network\",\n    \"w 62 - 3\",\n    37359\n  ]\n]\n```\n\n   The attendance of 37359 for South Florida vs Connecticut is indeed larger than the attendance of 62418 for Syracuse vs Washington.\n\n5. Based on our findings, we can conclude that the claim about the table is FALSE.\n\nHere's a JSON output in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"visiting team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the columns in the table: The columns are \"date\", \"time\", \"visiting team\", \"home team\", \"site\", \"broadcast\", \"result\", and \"attendance\".\n\n2. Find the relevant rows for the claim: We need to find the row where \"Indiana State\" and \"Cincinnati\" are both playing, which is the 3rd row.\n\n3. Check if Indiana State and Cincinnati played on September 10: According to the table, the row with \"date\" as \"september 11\", not \"september 10\".\n\n4. Since they did not play on September 10, we need to find another row for Indiana State and Cincinnati.\n   - The relevant rows are the 3rd and 6th rows.\n\n5. Check if the attendance for these games is less than or equal to 41382: For both the 3rd and 6th rows, the attendance is exactly 30807.\n\n6. Since 30807 is less than 41382, we need to find other relevant rows.\n   - There are no more relevant rows that meet the condition.\n\n7. Check if Indiana State and Cincinnati played only one game: According to the table, they did play multiple games (the 3rd row and the 6th row).\n\n8. Conclusion: Since there is at least one relevant row where the attendance is less than or equal to 41382, but not exactly 41382, we need to check if they played only that amount of people.\n   - According to the table, Indiana State played a total of 50120 and Cincinnati played a total of 51427 on September 11.\n\n9. Conclusion: The attendance for these games is greater than 41382, so it's not true.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Claim Evaluation: Home Team Wins All Games on the Day List\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Relevant Data\nThe claim specifies games where the home team wins all of the game played on a particular day. We need to evaluate each row in the \"data\" section to determine if this condition is met.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Each Game\nWe will go through each row and check if the home team won all games for that specific day (september 11).\n\n- Row 1: visiting team is South Florida, home team is Marshall. Since South Florida did not win, the day's condition does not apply.\n- Row 2: visiting team is No. 8 Florida, home team is Cincinnati. As Florida won, this row also doesn't satisfy the claim.\n- Row 3: visiting team is Indiana State, home team is Cincinnati. Here, Indiana State lost, so it does not fit the criteria.\n- Row 4: visiting team is Texas Southern, home team is Connecticut. Since Connecticut won, this day's condition doesn't apply here either.\n- Row 5: visiting team is New Hampshire, home team is Pittsburgh. In this case, New Hampshire did win against Pittsburgh. This row fits the claim for september 11.\n- Row 6: visiting team is Eastern Kentucky, home team is Louisville. Given that Louisville won, this day's condition also does not fit here since it was a loss.\n- Row 7: visiting team is Syracuse, home team is Washington. Since Syracuse lost to Washington, this row doesn't fulfill the claim for september 11.\n\n#### Step 3: Draw Conclusion\nFrom analyzing each row in the \"data\" section, especially focusing on rows where both teams were playing on the same day (september 11) and checking if the home team won all those games, we find that there's a contradiction in our evaluation process. Let's correct this oversight by directly looking at whether any of the days had more than one loss.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n- September 11 has multiple losses (Rows 2, 3, 4, and 6), indicating that not all home teams won on that day.\n- Given there are games where home teams lost, our initial interpretation was incorrect. The presence of at least one game with a home team's loss means the claim cannot be universally true for every day as stated.\n\n#### Step 4: Finalize Answer\nGiven the analysis, we conclude that the claim \"the home team wins all of the game play on the day list\" is **FALSE**, since there are instances (september 11) where the home team lost a game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
