The first step involves iterating through each row in the data table and checking if it represents an away team game.\n2. To determine this, we can examine the \"away team\" column to see if the value matches what we expect for away games (i.e., any team except the home team).\n3. Once all rows have been examined, we will find the row with Hawthorn as the away team by looking at the index 2 and then checking its \"away team score\".\n4. We can determine this by comparing the values of the relevant cells in that row.\n5. With both steps done, we are ready to check if hawthorn's score is higher than any other away game scores.\n\nSince there are indeed Hawthorn as an away team in the list with a higher score, but there are also some other teams (such as Melbourne and Geelong) with a higher total away scores (Melbourne has 76 points while Geelong has 100), hawthorn's score cannot be said to be the highest overall away team in that season.",
