Compare the first element of the date (29) with the corresponding value in the table for the date \"29 april 1939\". If they don't match, the claim is FALSE.\n3. Compare the home team and away team values for the Hawthorn game in the table. If they don't match, the claim is FALSE.\n4. Compare the score of Hawthorn (17.13 (115)) with North Melbourne (11.11 (77)). If they don't match, the claim is FALSE.\n5. Check if the claim contains any extraneous characters or punctuation.\n\nLet's do a sanity check for step 3: \nFor \"hawthorn\" and \"north melbourne\", row_index=1 , column_name=\"away team\".\nThe value in the table for the date \"29 april 1939\" is \"north melbourne\".\nBut for Hawthorn, the value in the table for the date \"29 april 1939\" is actually \"hawthorn\". So, this part of our reasoning process would be FALSE.\n\nLet's move on to step 4: \nFor Hawthorn, row_index=1 , column_name=\"home team score\".\nThe value in the table for the date \"29 april 1939\" is indeed \"17.13 (115)\".\nNow let's check North Melbourne:\nrow_index=1 , column_name=\"away team score\".\nThe value in the table for the date \"29 april 1939\" is indeed \"11.11 (77)\".\n\nHowever, to finish our reasoning process we must verify if both scores have been converted to integers: \nIn this case, yes they have.\nOur final check would be whether Hawthorn's score and North Melbourne's score are equal. Let's do that:\nHawthorn's score = 17+13*10= 17+130=147\nNorth Melbourne's score = 11+11*10=121\nClearly these values aren't equal.\n\nLet's put it all together:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Compare the crowd size of the specified Richmond vs Footscray match to determine if it's indeed the largest:\n\n   - The specified game has a crowd of 26000.\n\n4. Check if any other games have a larger crowd:\n   - For every row in \"data\", check if its last value (crowd) is greater than 26000.\n     - For each row, if the condition is met (if it's greater), add that row to your list of relevant cells.\n\n\n### Step-by-Step Code Implementation\n\nHere\u2019s an example code snippet written in Python.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the row that corresponds to the claim. We can do this by looking for the team names 'Richmond' and 'Footscray' in the table.\n\n2. After finding the relevant rows, we need to check if Richmond scored 19.21 points in that game.\n\n3. Once we have confirmed the score, we need to verify if it is indeed the highest scoring game by checking if any other team has a higher score in their respective games.\n\n4. If all conditions are met, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Continued:\n\n5. Looking at the table, Richmond plays Footscray in the 4th row: \n    ```\n    [\n      \"richmond\",\n      \"20.19 (139)\",\n      \"footscray\",\n      \"17.8 (110)\",\n      \"punt road oval\",\n      26000,\n      \"29 april 1939\"\n    ]\n```\n\n6. We can see that the score for Richmond is indeed 20.19, not 19.21. However, this is a slight deviation from the original claim. Let's continue.\n\n7. We need to verify if the claim about Richmond scoring 19.21 is partially correct and if it's the highest scoring game despite the slight error in the score.\n\n8. Looking at the table again:\n    ```\n    [\n      \"hawthorn\",\n      \"17.13 (115)\",\n      \"north melbourne\",\n      \"11.11 (77)\",\n      \"glenferrie oval\",\n      11000,\n      \"29 april 1939\"\n    ],\n    \n    [\n      \"fitzroy\",\n      \"14.18 (102)\",\n      \"st kilda\",\n      \"20.14 (134)\",\n      \"brunswick street oval\",\n      15000,\n      \"29 april 1939\"\n    ],\n    \n    [\n      \"essendon\",\n      \"19.21 (135)\",\n      \"melbourne\",\n      \"21.15 (141)\",\n      \"windy hill\",\n      20000,\n      \"29 april 1939\"\n    ],\n    \n    [\n      \"richmond\",\n      \"20.19 (139)\",\n      \"footscray\",\n      \"17.8 (110)\",\n      \"punt road oval\",\n      26000,\n      \"29 april 1939\"\n    ],\n    \n    [\n      \"south melbourne\",\n      \"15.17 (107)\",\n      \"collingwood\",\n      \"21.20 (146)\",\n      \"lake oval\",\n      17000,\n      \"29 april 1939\"\n    ],\n    \n    [\n      \"geelong\",\n      \"14.8 (92)\",\n      \"carlton\",\n      \"11.13 (79)\",\n      \"corio oval\",\n      15000,\n      \"29 april 1939\"\n    ]\n```\n\n9. We can see that the highest scoring game is indeed between Essendon and Melbourne with a score of 19.21 points, but this contradicts our claim. However, we also need to verify if Richmond's actual score (20.19) was the highest.\n\n10. Comparing scores, Richmond has the second-highest score in the table, so its game against Footscray does not meet the criteria for being the highest scoring game.\n\n11. Since we found that Richmond did not have the highest score and our claim had a slight error in the score but wasn't accurate to begin with, we need to clarify that based on the original table data provided, the claim is false.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"highest scoring game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"total crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
