In this specific case:\n\n*   Row index: The row numbers start at 0, so the first row (with a points difference of \"41 - 07\" and points equal to 14) does not meet our criteria.\n*   However, examining each row for when `points` is 0:\n    *   The row with index 5 (where points = 4), doesn't satisfy our condition since it has drawn=0 but lost game isn't 7.\n    *   Moving on to the next rows:\n        - Row index 6 has points = 3; again, not meeting criteria because drawn and lost aren't both 7.\n        - And finally, row index 7 has points = 0.

So, there are points equal to 10 on two occasions, but not exactly 10 as stated.\n\n### Step 3: Check point difference\nNow looking at the claim\u2019s second part about point difference being 30 - 15 and 26 - 21, we find that these values do match in row index 2. However, there is no direct evidence of matching point differences for both cases in our data as per this step.\n\n### Step 4: Look deeper into point difference\nSince row index 3 has the same points (9) value and a point difference of \"41 - 07\" which matches the claim's point difference being 30 - 15 when considering absolute numbers. For the second part, there is no exact match in terms of both value and direction for the 26 - 21 case.\n\n### Step 5: Combine findings\nConsidering the claim about points having a value of 10 on two occasions was not fully accurate (only one occurrence matches), but looking at point differences being 30-15 and 26-21, there are indeed two occurrences that match in terms of data but with some discrepancies in interpretation.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion based on findings\nThe initial claim about points having a value of 10 was not fully accurate. However, the second part regarding point difference is true because both differences do exist in our table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Extract relevant data from the table, finding points value is not exactly 10 on two occasions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Check point difference, finding matches for both but interpretation issues\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Look deeper into point difference to see both exist in table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Combine findings, noting one claim partially true and other partially false or misinterpreted.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion based on findings, acknowledging some claims are true while others not fully accurate\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"point difference\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the claim is saying: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5\". This means that we need to check if there is a row in the table where the points are 0, and both the drawn games are 3 and the lost games are 5.\n\n2. Next, let's look at the table and find the rows where the points are 0. We can do this by looking at the \"points\" column and checking if it is equal to 0.\n\n3. After finding these rows, we need to check the values in the \"drawn\" and \"lost\" columns for each of these rows. If both \"drawn\" and \"lost\" are equal to 3 or 5 respectively, then the claim would be TRUE.\n\n4. Now, let's find the relevant cells:\n    - For row_index = 0 (since it is the first row in the table), points = 14.\n    - For row_index = 1, points = 10.\n    - For row_index = 2, points = 9.\n    - For row_index = 3, points = 9.\n    - For row_index = 4, points = 7.\n    - For row_index = 5, points = 4.\n    - For row_index = 6, points = 3.\n    - For row_index = 7, points = 0.\n\n5. Now let's look at the \"drawn\" and \"lost\" columns:\n    - For row_index = 0 (since it is the first row in the table), drawn = 0 and lost = 0.\n    - For row_index = 1, drawn = 0 and lost = 2.\n    - For row_index = 2, drawn = 1 and lost = 2.\n    - For row_index = 3, drawn = 1 and lost = 2.\n    - For row_index = 4, drawn = 1 and lost = 3.\n    - For row_index = 5, drawn = 0 and lost = 5.\n    - For row_index = 6, drawn = 1 and lost = 5.\n    - For row_index = 7, drawn = 0 and lost = 7.\n\n6. Finally, we can see that for row_index = 5 (points = 4), the \"drawn\" game is indeed 0 and the \"lost\" game is 5. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's a JSON object with our reasoning steps:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Understand what the claim is saying\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Look for rows where points are 0 in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Check if 'drawn' and 'lost' are equal to 3 or 5 respectively\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Find the relevant cells with row_index and column_name\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
