Check if both USC and Clemson have a player with a draft position greater than or equal to 3 in the respective rows:\n   - For USC (row 4), the overall value is 88.\n   - For Clemson (row 6), the overall value is 144.\n\n4. Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison of the values:\n   - Since 88 < 3 and 144 >= 3, only Clemson meets the condition of having a player with a draft position greater than or equal to 3.\n\n5. Conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n   - The claim \"usc and clemson college have the most player draft at 3 each\" is FALSE because USC does not meet this criteria.\n\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify columns related to colleges\",\n      \"column_names\": [\"college\", \"name\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find rows for USC and Clemson\",\n      \"row_indices\": [4, 6],\n      \"column_names\": [\"college\", \"name\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if both colleges have a player with draft position >= 3\",\n      \"overall_values\": {\"USC\": 88, \"Clemson\": 144},\n      \"comparison_result\": \">=\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine claim result based on comparison\",\n      \"claim_result\": false\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. First, we need to count the number of running back positions picked by the 6th round.\n2. We will iterate through each row in the table's data.\n3. For each row, we will check if the value in the \"position\" column matches \"running back\".\n4. If it does, we will then check if the value in the \"pick\" column is within the range of 1 to 6 (inclusive), since this is the 6th round.\n5. We will keep a count of the number of running backs picked by the 6th round.\n\nHere's how we can implement these steps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Iterate through each row in the table's data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Check if the value in the 'position' column matches 'running back'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"If it does, check if the value in the 'pick' column is within the range of 1 to 6 (inclusive)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Keep a count of the number of running backs picked by the 6th round\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is based on the fact that in the 6th round, pick #5 and pick #24 both match the criteria.",
