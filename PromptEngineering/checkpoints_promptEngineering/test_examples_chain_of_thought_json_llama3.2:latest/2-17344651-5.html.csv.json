Extract relevant information from the table:\n   - For each game, extract the opponent's name, home score, away score, and the difference between them.\n   - Look for the row where \"Boston\" is the opponent's team name (noting that it's spelled as \"Celtics\").\n\n3. Find the Boston Celtics' largest win margin in December:\n   - Iterate through each row of data to find rows with Boston Celtics as the opponent.\n   - For those rows, calculate the difference between home score and away score.\n   - Identify which row has the highest difference.\n\n4. Compare to 23-point difference:\n   - Verify if this highest difference is indeed at least 23 points.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\nHere's a code implementation of these steps in Python, based on the provided JSON table:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_largest_win_margin(data):\n    # Initialize max_diff variable with negative infinity\n    max_diff = float('-inf')\n\n    for row in data['data']:\n        opponent = row[1]\n        home_score = int(row[2].split(' - ')[0])\n        away_score = int(row[2].split(' - ')[1])\n\n        if 'Boston' in opponent:\n            diff = abs(home_score - away_score)\n\n            # Update max_diff if current difference is greater\n            if diff > max_diff:\n                max_diff = diff\n\n    return max_diff\n\n\n# Load table data from JSON\nwith open(\"data.json\") as f:\n    json_data = json.load(f)\n\ndata = json_data['data']\n\nmax_margin = find_largest_win_margin(data)\n\nclaim_answer = True if max_margin >= 23 else False\n\nrelevant_cells = [{\"row_index\": index, \"column_name\": column} for index, row in enumerate(data['data']) for column in [\"date\", \"opponent\", \"score\"]]\nfor i, cell in enumerate(relevant_cells):\n    relevant_cells[i][\"row_index\"] += 1\n    relevant_cells[i][\"column_name\"] = \"score\"\n\n\nfinal_answer = {\n  \"chain_of_thought\": f\"Verifying if Boston Celtics' largest win margin in December is at least 23 points.
