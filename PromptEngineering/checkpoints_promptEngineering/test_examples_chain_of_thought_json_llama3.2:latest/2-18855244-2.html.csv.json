Otherwise, the statement is false.\n\n4. **Output the relevant cells and answer**:\n   - List all the relevant cells (rows from step 1) with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n   - Output \"TRUE\" if no row has a non-zero medal count.\n   - Output \"FALSE\" otherwise.\n\n### Filtering for Relevant Rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"specific_event\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": null,\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Evaluating the Claim:\n\nUpon inspection of rows 15 and 16, we find that larisa latynina received a medal for gymnastics (team) and all-around respectively, but not pommel horse.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": false,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": false,\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"medal_count\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim to evaluate is: \"none of the athletes received a medal in gymnastics.\"\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check each athlete's sport and see if it matches \"gymnastics\".\n3. We should then verify that none of these athletes have a record medal event or any other medal (gold, silver, bronze) in their respective sport.\n4. Next, we will search for rows where the column name 'athlete' equals to 'larisa latynina' since she is known to be one of the gymnast with numerous medals and thus can provide strong evidence against our claim if any row contains a gold medal event which does not have 'g' suffix (which indicates that there is no 'g' medal).\n5. Finally, we will count all the rows where sport equals to \"gymnastics\" or the athlete name contains 'latynina'.\n6. If any of these gymnast are in our table with at least one gold medal event then claim must be false and if all gymnasts have no gold medals events or there is not a single gymnast that has any medal, then we can say \"none of the athletes received a medal in gymnastics\" and set answer to \"TRUE\".\n7. Count the total number of row where sport equals to 'gymnastics' or athlete name contains 'latynina'.\n\n### Code\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"athlete\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"record medal event\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"athlete\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"sport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"record medal event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThere are a total of 2 gymnast, larisa latynina and paavo nurmi. Both have won at least one gold medal.\nHowever, there is no row in the table that has Larisa Latynina with 'g' suffix in her record medal event which means there must be some gymnasts who got medals without getting a gold.",
