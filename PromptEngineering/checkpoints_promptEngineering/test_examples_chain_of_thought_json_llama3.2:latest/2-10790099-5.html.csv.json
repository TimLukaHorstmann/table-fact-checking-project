First, we need to identify the \"home team score\" column in the table, which is the third element in the \"columns\" array: [\"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", ...].\n\n2. Next, we need to find the row with the highest \"home team score\" in the \"data\" array. We will compare each value in this column.\n\n3. Starting from the first row:\n   - The value of the home team score for Footscray is 13.14 (92).\n   - The value of the home team score for Fitzroy is 12.6 (78), which is lower than Footscray's.\n   - We continue checking all other rows.\n\n4. For the second row:\n   - The value of the home team score for Geelong is 20.10 (130).\n   - Since it's higher than 92, we move on to check if there are any other scores that might be even higher.\n\n5. Continuing this process for each row in the table until we reach the last one.\n   - The value of the home team score for Carlton is 13.15 (93), which is lower than Footscray's and Geelong's, but higher than Fitzroy's and Hawthorn's, so we continue checking.\n\n6. We find that North Melbourne has a home team score of 18.10 (118).\n   - The value of the home team score for South Melbourne is 14.15 (99), which is lower than North Melbourne's.\n   - Now we have checked all values in this column, so we can conclude.\n\n7. Based on our comparison, we see that only one team has a higher home team score: Geelong (20.10 (130)) and Carlton (13.15 (93)). However, Geelong does not appear as the home team, but rather as the away team.\n   - We must re-evaluate our initial conclusion.\n\n8. Since we have already concluded that North Melbourne has a high home team score of 18.10 (118), which is higher than all other scores in this column, we can confidently say that our final answer is TRUE.\n\n9.

This means we need to compare the crowd at Punt Road Oval with the crowd at Arden Street Oval.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Relevant Data\nWe need to find the data for both venues in the table. For Punt Road Oval, the relevant data is:\n```json\n{\n  \"venue\": \"punt road oval\",\n  \"crowd\": 10000,\n  \"date\": \"28 may 1932\"\n}\n```\nFor Arden Street Oval, the relevant data is:\n```json\n{\n  \"venue\": \"arden street oval\",\n  \"crowd\": 12000,\n  \"date\": \"28 may 1932\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Crowds\nWe need to compare the crowd at Punt Road Oval with the crowd at Arden Street Oval. According to the claim, we expect to see if there are 2000 more people in the first venue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"difference\": 10000 - 12000,\n  \"greater Venue\": \"Arden Street Oval\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Claim\nSince 10000 is less than 12000, the claim that Punt Road Oval have 2000 crowd more than Arden Street Oval is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim is 'punt road oval venue have 2000 crowd more than arden street oval'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the relevant data\",\n      \"description\": \"Found the relevant data for Punt Road Oval and Arden Street Oval\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the crowds\",\n      \"description\": \"The crowd at Punt Road Oval is less than 2000 more than the crowd at Arden Street Oval\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Evaluate the claim\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim is false because Punt Road Oval have less than 2000 crowd more than Arden Street Oval\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the table data**: First, we need to analyze the provided table to extract all crowd data points.\n\n   - The relevant column for this task is \"crowd\".\n   \n2. **Extract crowd data points**:\n   - Looking at the provided data in the 'data' section of the json table.\n   - All crowd values are present: 14000, 13000, 32000, 12000, 10000, and 28000.\n\n3. **Sort the crowd data**: We need to sort this list to find out which crowds were at Lake Oval (second row in data) and which ones were third largest.\n\n   - Sort by crowd from highest to lowest:\n     1. 32000\n     2. 28000\n     3. 14000\n     4. 13000\n     5. 12000\n     6. 10000\n\n4. **Find the third largest crowd**: Since we know that Lake Oval had a crowd of 28000, which is both the second and largest in this list and the first smallest. The third largest crowd will then be the one at 14000.\n\n5. **Determine if the claim about the \"third largest crowd\" being on \"lake oval\" venue is true or false**:\n   - Since Lake Oval had a crowd of 28000, which is not only the second but also largest in this list, and 14000, which is third largest, we can infer that this statement is true.\n\n6. **Determine relevant cells**: We need to find out all rows where \"crowd\" equals 14000 (third smallest crowd), as well as row with crowd equaling 28000 at Lake Oval's venue.\n\n   - The first value corresponds to the third largest, and thus its row index is `1` for \"crowd\": 14000.\n   - The second value has a corresponding value of $2$ for \"crowd\": 28000 on row with venue \"lake oval\".\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the table data and extract relevant crowd values. Sort those values to determine which ones were at Lake Oval's venue, then find the third largest crowd there. Determine whether this is a true or false claim based on that information.

Determine which rows contain these crowd values and their corresponding venues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
