    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in March 2011 David Lee scored the most rebounds on the Golden State Warriors team,\" we need to examine each game played by the team during March 2011 and identify the player with the highest rebound count for that game.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The relevant column is \"high rebounds\" because it shows the player who had the most rebounds in each game.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Game Played by Golden State Warriors in March 2011:**\n\n   | Game | Date     | High Rebounds                             |\n   |------|----------|-------------------------------------------|\n   | 60   | March 2  | David Lee (16)                            |\n   | 61   | March 4  | David Lee (12)                            |\n   | 62   | March 6  | David Lee (14)                            |\n   | 63   | March 8  | David Lee (14)                            |\n   | 64   | March 9  | David Lee (10)                            |\n   | 65   | March 11 | Monta Ellis, David Lee, Dorell Wright (6) |\n   | 66   | March 13 | Stephen Curry (9)                         |\n   | 68   | March 16 | Monta Ellis (11)                          |\n   | 70   | March 20 | David Lee (12)                            |\n   | 72   | March 23 | Stephen Curry, Dorell Wright (6)          |\n   | 73   | March 25 | Monta Ellis (10)                          |\n   | 74   | March 27 | Monta Ellis (12)                          |\n   | 75   | March 29 | David Lee (15)                            |\n\n3. **Determine if David Lee had the most rebounds in each game:**\n\n   - In games 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 70, and 75, David Lee had the highest number of rebounds.\n   - In game 65, he tied with Monta Ellis and Dorell Wright for the high rebound count (6).\n   - In games 66, 68, 72, 73, and 74, other players had more rebounds than David Lee.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nDavid Lee did not score the most rebounds in every game. There are several instances where other players (such as Monta Ellis or Stephen Curry) had higher rebound counts.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE** because there were games where David Lee was not the player with the highest number of rebounds for the Golden State Warriors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 59, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 75, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate whether Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors in total points scored during March 2011 based on the given table.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We're interested in the \"high points\" column since it shows who scored the most points for each game and by how much.\n   \n2. **Calculate Total Points Scored by Each Player**:\n   - **Stephen Curry**:\n     - March 2: 29 points\n     - March 4: 5 points\n     - March 6: 7 points\n     - March 9: 12 points\n     - March 13: 24 points\n     - March 14: 0 points (not highest)\n     - March 16: 26 points\n     - March 18: 6 points\n     - March 21: 5 points\n     - March 23: 6 points\n     - March 27: 37 points\n     - March 29: 35 points\n\n   - **Monta Ellis**:\n     - March 1: 25 points\n     - March 4: 41 points\n     - March 6: 27 points\n     - March 8: 24 points\n     - March 9: 17 points (highest, but not leading for total)\n     - March 11: 39 points\n     - March 14: 0 points (not highest)\n     - March 16: 26 points\n     - March 20: 18 points\n     - March 23: 0 points (not highest)\n     - March 25: 27 points\n     - March 27: 37 points\n     - March 29: 0 points (not highest)\n\n   - **David Lee**:\n     - David Lee is noted for rebounds, not points. He scores the most in games where he's listed but never leads in points.\n\n3. **Sum Total Points**:\n   - Stephen Curry: \\(29 + 5 + 7 + 12 + 24 + 26 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 37 + 35 = 192\\)\n   - Monta Ellis: \\(25 + 41 + 27 + 24 + 17 + 39 + 26 + 18 + 0 + 0 + 27 + 37 = 281\\)\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Monta Ellis scored more total points (281) than Stephen Curry (192) in March 2011.\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim that \"Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warrior in total number of point for the month of march 2011\" is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
