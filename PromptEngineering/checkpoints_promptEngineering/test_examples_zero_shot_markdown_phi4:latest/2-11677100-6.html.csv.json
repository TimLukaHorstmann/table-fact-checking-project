The claim states: \"eastlake high school's Adrian Gonzalez be the MLBs last round pick.\"\n\nThe primary focus should be on identifying:\n1. Whether Adrian Gonzalez was indeed drafted in 2000.\n2.

Being the \"last round pick\" would imply being picked last among all rounds.\n\n3. **Verify his draft position**:\n   - Adrian Gonzalez was the 1st pick of the 2000 draft, which means he was chosen first overall.\n   - The term \"last round pick\" implies a significantly later selection in the overall process, which is contradictory to being the first pick.\n\nSince the table explicitly states that Adrian Gonzalez was picked as the 1st overall pick in the 2000 MLB Draft, it directly contradicts the claim of him being the last round pick. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, we can identify the relevant cells for this verification:\n- Row corresponding to Adrian Gonzalez: Row index is 8.\n- Relevant columns are \"player\", \"school\", and \"mlb draft\".\n\nThus, the JSON object should reflect these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mlb draft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
