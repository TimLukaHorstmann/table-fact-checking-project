This confirms that Pascal Fabre started at grid position 26.\n\n- Check the number of laps completed:\n  - In column \"laps,\" row index 12 shows a value of 71, confirming that he completed 71 laps.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are supported by the data provided in the table for Pascal Fabre. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information are:\n\n- Row index 12, Column \"grid\" (for starting position)\n- Row index 12, Column \"laps\" (for number of laps completed)\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, let's break it down and verify each part against the table:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n- **\"the least lap for christian danner when the grid be 5\"**: This means we need to find if Christian Danner completed at least 43 laps when his grid position was 5.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n1. **Identify Christian Danner's Row**:\n   - Look through the table and locate the row where \"driver\" is \"christian danner\".\n\n2. **Check Grid Position**:\n   - In Christian Danner's row, check if the \"grid\" value is 5.\n\n3. **Check Laps Completed**:\n   - If the grid position is 5, then verify the number of laps he completed and see if it is at least 43.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- Locate Christian Danner in the table:\n  - Row Index: 22\n  - Driver: christian danner\n  - Grid: 23 (not 5)\n  - Laps: 3\n\nSince Christian Danner's grid position is 23, not 5, we do not need to check his laps for this specific condition. The claim involves a hypothetical scenario that doesn't match the actual data in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is about a situation where Christian Danner had a grid position of 5 and completed at least 43 laps.
