The crowd at \"hisense arena\" was 8093.\n\nLet's examine these conditions using relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: \n  - We need to find the row corresponding to \"8 February\". Looking at the dates in the first column, we see that the fourth entry (\"8 february\") matches this date.\n  \n- **Venue Verification**:\n  - In this row (row index 7), check the \"venue\" column. The venue listed is \"hisense arena\", which matches the venue mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Crowd Size Verification**:\n  - Still in this same row, check the \"crowd\" column to find the number of attendees. It lists \"8093\", which matches the crowd size mentioned in the claim.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that confirm these conditions are located at:\n\n- Row index 7 (corresponding to 8 February) for the columns: \"date\", \"venue\", and \"crowd\".\n\nThus, all parts of the claim match the data provided in the table.
