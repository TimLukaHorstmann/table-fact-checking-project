This is a loss.\n2. **June 17:** Blue Jays vs. Red Sox, score 11 - 10, loss to Mart\u00ednez (Mart\u00ednez has a record of 5-4). This is a loss.\n3. **June 18:** Blue Jays vs. Red Sox, score 5 - 1, win against Fassero (Fassero has a record of 6-3). This is a win.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- The Blue Jays played three games against the Red Sox in June 2000.\n- They lost two games and won one game.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the blue jays lose all 6 game[s] against the red sox\" is false.
