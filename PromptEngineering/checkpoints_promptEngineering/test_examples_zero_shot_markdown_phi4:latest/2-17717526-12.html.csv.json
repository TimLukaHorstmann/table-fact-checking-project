Grand Slam Match Wins:\n\nWe need to determine which year between 2006 and 2012 has the highest number of Grand Slam match wins. This requires adding up the matches won across all four Grand Slam tournaments for each year.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- The rows labeled **\"Australian Open,\" \"French Open,\" \"Wimbledon,\"** and **\"US Open\"** under each year provide the win-loss results at these tournaments.\n- We count the total number of wins (excluding 'a' or withdrawals) for 2009 and 2011:\n\n  - **2009:**\n    - Australian Open: 1 win\n    - French Open: 2 wins\n    - Wimbledon: 0 wins ('lq' is a withdrawal, not counted)\n    - US Open: 1 win\n\n    Total Grand Slam Wins in 2009 = \\(1 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 4\\)\n\n  - **2011:**\n    - Australian Open: 1 win\n    - French Open: 2 wins\n    - Wimbledon: 2 wins\n    - US Open: 2 wins\n\n    Total Grand Slam Wins in 2011 = \\(1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7\\)\n\nFrom this analysis, Poloma had more Grand Slam match wins in 2011 (7) than in any other year listed, confirming the second part of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth assertions are supported by the data from the table:\n- 2009 was indeed the year with the most total match wins.\n- 2011 was indeed the year with the most Grand Slam match wins.\n\nThus, we conclude that the claim is **TRUE**.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to establish two key points from the table:\n1. When Poloma achieved her first grand slam tournament match win.\n2. When she achieved her second premiership mandatory match win.\n\n**Step 1: Determine when Poloma won her first Grand Slam match**\n\n- The table provides data for each grand slam tournament (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) for every year from 2006 to 2012.\n- A player wins their first Grand Slam match if they progress beyond the first round. In tournament terms:\n  - \"1r\" denotes a loss in the first round,\n  - \"2r\" signifies winning the first round (but potentially losing later),\n  - \"3r\" means winning through to the third round, and so on.\n  - \"lq\" indicates not qualifying for the main draw.\n\nExamining each Grand Slam column:\n- In 2006, Poloma withdrew (\"a\") from all four tournaments, hence no matches played or won.\n- From 2007 to 2011, she again withdraws in every tournament until her first appearance in the US Open in 2008. However, she lost in the first round (\"lq\" does not count as winning).\n- In 2010, Poloma reaches the third round of the French Open (\"3r\") and wins at least two matches (the first and second rounds).\n\nThus, her first Grand Slam match win occurred in 2010 during the French Open.\n\n**Step 2: Determine when Poloma won her second Premier Mandatory tournament match**\n\n- The table shows records for each year under the \"premier mandatory\" section, specifically listing results for Indian Wells, Miami, and Madrid.\n- Similarly, a player's first win occurs by progressing beyond the first round:\n  - \"1r\" = loss in the first round,\n  - \"2r\" = win of at least one match (first round),\n  - \"3r\" = wins two matches (first and second rounds), etc.\n\nAnalyzing the data for Premier Mandatory tournaments:\n- In 2006, she withdrew (\"a\") from Indian Wells and Miami.\n- For 2007, same as 2006 with no participation (\"a\").\n- In 2008, again withdrawals at both events (\"a\").\n- By 2009, Poloma reaches the second round in Indian Wells (\"2r\"), achieving her first Premier Mandatory match win.\n- In 2010, she wins two matches each in Indian Wells (\"2r\") and Miami (\"3r\"). This marks her third and fourth wins in total across these tournaments. Therefore, her second win happened also in 2010.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPoloma's first Grand Slam tournament match win occurred in 2010 at the French Open, and her second Premier Mandatory match win was achieved earlier in 2010 (at Indian Wells). Thus, her second Premier Mandatory win came before her first Grand Slam tournament win within the same year.\n\nThe claim \"Poloma\u2019s second premier mandatory match win come after her first grand slam tournament match win\" is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n\n1.
