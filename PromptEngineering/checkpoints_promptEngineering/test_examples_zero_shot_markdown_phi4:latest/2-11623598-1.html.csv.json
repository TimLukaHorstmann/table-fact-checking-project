    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Bob Carmichael playing in the final with Frew McMullan and Allan Stone the same amount of times is true or false, we need to analyze the table for instances where each partner appears in a \"final\" alongside Bob Carmichael.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - We will look through the `partner` column for entries named \"frew mcmillan\" and \"allan stone\".\n   \n2. **Count occurrences:**\n   - Count how many times Bob Carmichael played in a final with each of these partners.\n\n3. **Compare counts:**\n   - If both counts are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Frew McMullan as partner:**  \n  - Row 4: \"winner\" (1975, Auckland)  \n  - Row 11: \"runner-up\" (1976, D\u00fcsseldorf)  \n\n  Frew McMullan appears with Bob Carmichael in two finals.\n\n- **Allan Stone as partner:**  \n  - Row 9: \"runner-up\" (1975, Denver WCT)  \n  - Row 10: \"runner-up\" (1975, Las Vegas)  \n  - Row 12: \"runner-up\" (1975, Hong Kong)  \n  - Row 17: \"runner-up\" (1979, Washington Indoor)  \n  - Row 18: \"runner-up\" (1979, Stuttgart Indoor)  \n\n  Allan Stone appears with Bob Carmichael in five finals.\n\n- **Bob Carmichael as partner:**  \n  The table doesn't list him directly, so we look for partners who might imply his participation. Since the claim is about him playing in the final and not explicitly listing him, we assume he's the player being discussed when identifying partner matches.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Frew McMullan appears twice with Bob Carmichael.\n- Allan Stone appears five times with Bob Carmichael.\n\nSince the number of finals played with each partner differs, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant rows from the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
