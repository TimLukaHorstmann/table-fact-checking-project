The date of the match is indeed January 26, 2006.\n2. The result of this specific match is 2 - 1.\n\nLet's review the table:\n\n- **Row 8** corresponds to a match on January 26, 2006, at Monster Park, San Francisco, United States:\n  - The `date` column confirms it as \"January 26, 2006\".\n  - The `result` column shows \"2 - 1\".\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by this row in the table, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify these points are:\n- Row index 7 (as indices start at 0 for markdown tables): \n  - Column `date`: \"January 26, 2006\"\n  - Column `result`: \"2 - 1\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
