    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check specific details from the table against the statement given in the claim.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\nThe claim states: \"there be a result of w 65 - 20 after week 9 on november 13 , 1949.\"\n\n1. **Date and Week Check**:\n   - The date mentioned is November 13, 1949.\n   - It specifies that this date is after week 9.\n\n2. **Result Verification**:\n   - We need to verify if the result of the game on this date was \"w 65 - 20\".\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- Look for the row where the date matches November 13, 1949.\n- Verify it occurs after week 9.\n- Check if the result is \"w 65 - 20\".\n\n#### Relevant Rows from the Table:\n- **Row 8**: \n  - Week: 8\n  - Date: November 13, 1949\n  - Result: w 65 - 20\n\n### Verification:\n\n- The date November 13, 1949, matches in row 8.\n- However, this date corresponds to week 8, not after week 9. Therefore, the claim that it occurs \"after week 9\" is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because although there is a result of \"w 65 - 20\" on November 13, 1949, it does not occur after week 9; it happens in week 8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
