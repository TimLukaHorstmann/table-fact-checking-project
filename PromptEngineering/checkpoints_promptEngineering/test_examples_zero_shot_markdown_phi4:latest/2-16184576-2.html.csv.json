    "resp": "To evaluate the claim provided against the data in the table, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Annual Win-Loss for 2001:**\n   - The claim states that the annual win-loss record for 2001 should be \"9-9\". \n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the year 2001 in the table and examine the \"annual win - loss\" column.\n\n2. **Non-participation in 1987:**\n   - The claim asserts that there were no matches played in 1987.\n   - Similarly, we must identify the row for 1987 and check both the Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters Series results to confirm if any matches (win-loss records) are listed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Finding Annual Win-Loss for 2001:**\n   - Locate the row labeled \"year\" with value \"2001\".\n   - Check the \"annual win - loss\" column in this row.\n   - The relevant cell is at `row_index` 13 (assuming the first row is headers, starting indexing from the data), and the value is indeed \"9-9\".\n\n2. **Checking Participation for 1987:**\n   - Locate the row labeled \"year\" with value \"1987\".\n   - Check all columns related to match records under both Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters Series results.\n   - For 1987, each cell contains \"n/a\", indicating no recorded matches were played.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The annual win-loss record for 2001 being \"9-9\" is supported by the data.\n- There are no recorded matches in 1987 across both categories of tournaments, supporting the claim that they didn't play any matches.\n\nThe claim is therefore **TRUE**. \n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Australian Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"French Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Wimbledon Championships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"US Open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ATP Masters Series Auckland\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ATP Masters Series Indian Wells\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThe row indices and column names are determined based on typical zero-indexing in tables starting from the first data row after headers.",
