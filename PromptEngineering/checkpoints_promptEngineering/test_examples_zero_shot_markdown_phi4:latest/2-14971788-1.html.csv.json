    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table and focus on two aspects of the claim: \n\n1. The highest points scored by the Colts in a single game.\n2. Whether this occurred against the Detroit Lions.\n\nThe claim states that \"the most point score by the colt be 41 against the detroit lion.\"\n\nLet's break down each part of the claim:\n\n### Part 1: Highest Points Scored by the Colts\nWe need to find the maximum points scored by the Colts in any game as per the 'result' column. The relevant part is before the dash ('-') which indicates the score for the Colts.\n\nHere are the scores for the Colts:\n- Week 1: 38 (vs. Atlanta Falcons)\n- Week 2: 38 (vs. Philadelphia Eagles)\n- Week 3: 41 (vs. San Francisco 49ers)\n- Week 4: 24 (vs. Chicago Bears)\n- Week 5: 24 (tie against Los Angeles Rams)\n- Week 6: 20 (tie against Minnesota Vikings)\n- Week 7: 17 (vs. Washington Redskins)\n- Week 8: 13 (vs. Green Bay Packers)\n- Week 9: 49 (vs. Atlanta Falcons)\n- Week 10: 41 (vs. Detroit Lions)\n- Week 11: 26 (vs. San Francisco 49ers)\n- Week 12: 23 (vs. Dallas Cowboys)\n- Week 13: 30 (vs. New Orleans Saints)\n- Week 14: 10 (loss to Los Angeles Rams)\n\nThe highest score is **49** points against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 9.\n\n### Part 2: Against Which Team Was This Score Achieved?\nFrom our analysis, we see that the highest score of 49 was achieved in Week 9 against the Atlanta Falcons, not the Detroit Lions. \n\nIn Week 10, the Colts did score **41** points, but this is not their highest scoring game.\n\nTherefore, while it's true that they scored 41 points against the Detroit Lions, it is false to claim that this is their highest score in the season. The highest was 49 points against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo verify the claim, we focus on:\n- Week 9 and Week 10 for the results of those games.\n- Specifically, checking the scores (columns related to 'result') and opponents ('opponent') in those weeks.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 8: The result \"w 49 - 7\" against Atlanta Falcons.\n- Row index 9: The result \"w 41 - 7\" against Detroit Lions.\n\nHere's the JSON object with this information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
