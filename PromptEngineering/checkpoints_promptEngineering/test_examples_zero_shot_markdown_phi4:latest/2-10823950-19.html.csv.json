Whether there was a game on August 9, 1981.\n2. If such a game existed, whether it took place at \"mcg\".\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions against the table:\n\n- **Date Condition**: We need to find any row where the date is \"8 august 1981\" or \"9 august 1981\". The rows with dates are:\n  - Rows 0 to 4 have the date \"8 august 1981\".\n  - Row 5 has the date \"9 august 1981\".\n\n- **Venue Condition**: For the row that matches the date condition, we need to check if the venue is \"mcg\". From the table:\n  - In row 5 (date: \"9 august 1981\"), the venue is listed as \"mcg\".\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied for row 5, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the relevant information extracted from the table:\n\n- Row index 5 has a date of \"9 august 1981\".\n- The same row (index 5) lists the venue as \"mcg\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
