    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we must evaluate whether an overall pick number of 32 is associated with a lower pick number than 8 within the table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"8.0 be the lowest pick number where the overall pick number be 32\". This implies we need to find if there exists any row in the table where the 'overall' column has a value of 32 and the 'pick' value is lower than 8.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - We will check each row for the condition where the 'overall' number is exactly 32.\n   - The relevant columns for this verification are 'round', 'pick', and 'overall'.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - Go through each row to see if 'overall' equals 32.\n   - For rows that meet this criterion, check the 'pick' value to determine if it is lower than 8.\n\n4. **Findings**:\n   - None of the rows in the table have an 'overall' number equal to 32. The smallest 'overall' number observed for pick number 8 starts at 23 and goes up sequentially.\n   - Without any row having an 'overall' value of 32, there is no need to consider a lower pick number than 8.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no rows with an 'overall' value of 32, the condition cannot be met or contradicted for any other pick number.\n   - Therefore, it's accurate to say that 8.0 is indeed the lowest (and only) pick number associated with an 'overall' of 32 simply because such a case does not exist.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is supported by default as there are no instances of 'overall' being 32 for any lower pick number than 8.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of relevant cells:\n- The row index 2 is checked as it contains the smallest 'overall' number that could potentially precede 32 if such a case existed. This helps verify that no lower pick numbers exist for an overall of 32, thus supporting the claim by default.",

The claim pertains to a specific round and pick number (round 20, pick 8).\n2. It specifies that the player selected at that point should have the position \"rb\" (running back).\n\nTo verify this, we need to locate the row in the table corresponding to these conditions:\n- The \"round\" column must equal 20.\n- The \"pick\" and \"overall\" columns both show the number 8 for pick 8 of round 20.\n\nOnce we identify this row, we will check if the value under the \"position\" column is \"rb.\"\n\nNow let's find the relevant information in the table:\n\n- Row with `round` = 20:\n  - **Row Index**: This corresponds to index 19 (since indices are 0-based).\n  - **Columns** of interest for verification:\n    - `\"round\"`: Should be 20.\n    - `\"pick\"`: Should be 8.\n    - `\"overall\"`: Should be 188 (since it's the overall pick number).\n    - `\"position\"`: Check if this is \"rb.\"\n\nFrom the table, we find:\n\n- **Row Index**: 19\n  - **round** = 20\n  - **pick** = 8\n  - **overall** = 188\n  - **position** = \"ot\" (offensive tackle)\n\nThe position of the player picked in round 20 is \"ot,\" not \"rb.\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n- `\"round\"` at Row Index 19.\n- `\"pick\"` at Row Index 19.\n- `\"overall\"` at Row Index 19.\n- `\"position\"` at Row Index 19.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
