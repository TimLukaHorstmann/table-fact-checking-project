The row where Ben Crenshaw is listed and verify his placement.\n2. The country associated with Ben Crenshaw.\n\nLet's break down the relevant checks:\n\n- **Row Check for Placement**: We look at the rows in the table to find Ben Crenshaw's entry. According to the table, he appears under row 6 (considering that indexing starts from 0) and is listed as \"t6,\" confirming his placement.\n\n- **Country Verification**: In the same row where Ben Crenshaw is mentioned, we need to verify his country of origin. The column for the player's country confirms that Ben Crenshaw is indeed from \"united states.\"\n\nBased on this verification:\n\n- Ben Crenshaw is listed at position \"t6.\"\n- He is associated with the country \"united states\" in the table.\n\nBoth conditions required to verify the claim are met.
