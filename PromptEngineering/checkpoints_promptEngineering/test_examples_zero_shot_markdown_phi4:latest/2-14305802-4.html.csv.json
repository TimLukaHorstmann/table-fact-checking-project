The team in question is \"the Philadelphia Flyers.\"\n2. They lost the 22nd game.\n3. It was against the \"Los Angeles Kings\" during the 1977-78 season.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table will help us verify these details:\n\n- **Row and Column for Game Number**: We need to confirm if game number 22 corresponds with this match. This is found in the \"game\" column.\n  \n- **Opponent Name**: We need to check if the opponent was indeed the Los Angeles Kings, which is listed under the \"opponent\" column.\n\n- **Outcome of the Game**: The score will reveal whether it was a loss or not for the Philadelphia Flyers. This information is in the \"score\" column.\n\nLet's go through these checks using the table:\n\n1. **Game Number**: \n   - From the table, row 0 (index 22) shows game number 22. Therefore, this game matches with what we are checking.\n   \n2. **Opponent Name**:\n   - The \"opponent\" column in row 0 lists \"los angeles kings,\" which confirms that they played against Los Angeles Kings in this game.\n\n3. **Outcome of the Game**:\n   - In row 0, under the \"score\" column, it is listed as \"4 - 2.\" Since score reporting generally puts the home team first and assuming Philadelphia Flyers are the second team (as no specific indication is provided that they are the first), this means they scored 2 goals while their opponent scored 4. Thus, the Philadelphia Flyers lost this game.\n\nGiven these checks:\n- The game number matches.\n- The opponent was indeed Los Angeles Kings.\n- The score indicates a loss for Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the table data.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Reviewing the \"december\" column, there is no entry with a value of 21. Therefore, there is no record of any game happening on this date in the table.\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: The claim mentions a game against the Philadelphia Flyers. In the given table, none of the entries lists the opponent as the \"Philadelphia Flyers.\" All opponents mentioned are either NHL hockey teams (e.g., Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Rockies) or other non-relevant teams for this particular query.\n\n3. **Cleveland Barons Check**: The Cleveland Barons do appear twice in the table:\n   - Row 27: They played against on November 11th with a score of \"11 - 1\" and gained points.\n   - Row 31: They played against on December 21st, which matches the date mentioned but does not involve the Philadelphia Flyers as the opponent.\n\n4. **Scoring Check**: The claim specifically mentions that the Cleveland Barons scored the most points in a game. While there is indeed an entry for them with a high score of \"11 - 1\" against the Cleveland Barons on November 11th, it does not involve the Philadelphia Flyers and thus doesn't support the claim as stated.\n\n5. **Summary**: No record exists for a December 21st game between the Cleveland Barons and the Philadelphia Flyers in this table.

Most of their games against the New York Rangers were wins.\n\nThe table provides information about a specific set of games, including the opponent and scores for each game. Here's how to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Team Verification**: \n   - The table does not explicitly state that these games are played by the Philadelphia Flyers, as it only lists \"opponent\" and \"score.\" However, we can infer this from the context: if there is a record column showing wins, losses, and ties, it likely refers to a specific team's performance for that season. This inference is crucial because no direct mention of the Philadelphia Flyers appears in the table.\n\n2. **Games Against New York Rangers**:\n   - We need to check all games against the New York Rangers and determine if most were wins.\n   - From the table, we identify three entries where the opponent is \"new york rangers\" (rows 24, 25, and 33).\n\n3. **Game Outcomes**:\n   - Row 24: Score was 3-3 (a tie).\n   - Row 25: Score was 7-4 (a win for the team).\n   - Row 33: Score was 4-3 (another win for the team).\n\nOut of three games, two were wins and one was a tie.
