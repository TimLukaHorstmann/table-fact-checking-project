The enrollment number must be associated with a school that has a WIAA classification of \"3a\".\n2. We need to verify if 1298 is indeed the lowest enrollment among these schools.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table to see which schools have a WIAA classification of \"3a\" and their respective enrollments:\n\n- **Row 0 (Henry Foss):** \n  - WIAA Classification: 3a\n  - Enrollment: 1298\n\n- **Row 1 (Lincoln):**\n  - WIAA Classification: 3a\n  - Enrollment: 1618\n\n- **Row 2 (Mount Tahoma):**\n  - WIAA Classification: 3a\n  - Enrollment: 1865\n\nRows 0, 1, and 2 have a WIAA classification of \"3a\". The enrollments for these schools are 1298, 1618, and 1865 respectively.
