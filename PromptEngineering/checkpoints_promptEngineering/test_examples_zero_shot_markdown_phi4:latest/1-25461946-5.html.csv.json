It states \"allen - 12\".\n   - This indicates that Allen scored 12 points in this game.\n\n3. **Evaluate if Allen Had the Most Points**:\n   - The claim asserts Allen had the most points on that date.\n   - We need to confirm there are no other players with more than or equal to 12 points mentioned for this game.\n   - In row index 2, \"high points\" is explicitly stated as \"allen - 12\". There are no other players listed with higher or equal points.\n\nSince Allen scored the most points in that game according to the table, and there's no contradiction found in the data, the claim is supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
