Identify the row corresponding to the game against the Hawks.\n2. Identify the row corresponding to the game against the Grizzlies.\n3. Extract and compare the 'attendance' figures from these rows.\n4. Calculate the difference in attendance between the two games.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Identify relevant rows:**\n  - The game against the Grizzlies took place on \"2 January 2008\".\n    - From the table, this corresponds to `row_index = 0`.\n  - The game against the Hawks took place on \"4 January 2008\".\n    - This corresponds to `row_index = 1`.\n\n- **Extract attendance figures:**\n  - For the Grizzlies game (`row_index = 0`), the attendance is listed as `10186`.\n  - For the Hawks game (`row_index = 1`), the attendance is listed as `10797`.\n\n- **Calculate the difference:**\n  - The difference in attendance between the Hawks game and the Grizzlies game is \\(10797 - 10186 = 611\\).\n\nSince the calculated difference of 611 matches the claim that \"the attendance for the hawks game exceed the attendance of the grizzlies game by 611 crowd\", the claim is verified as true.\n\n**Relevant cells from the table:**\n- The 'attendance' column in `row_index = 0` (Grizzlies game).\n- The 'attendance' column in `row_index = 1` (Hawks game).\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
