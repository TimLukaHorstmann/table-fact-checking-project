Therefore, in each game listed, we should look at the 'result' column and identify instances where the opposing team's score is 0.\n\nHere are the steps to verify this claim:\n\n1. **Examine the 'Result' Column:** We need to check each row for a result indicating a shutout (i.e., the opponent scored 0 points).\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - Week 1: Buffalo Bills, Result = \"w 12 - 0\" (Buffalo Bills scored 0)\n   - Week 4: Kansas City Chiefs, Result = \"w 14 - 6\" (No shutout)\n   - Weeks 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 all show non-zero scores for the opponents.\n\n3. **Count Shutouts:** From this analysis, there is only one game where a shutout occurred (Week 1).\n\nSince the claim states that there were \"2 shutouts,\" but our examination of the data shows only one shutout:\n\n- The claim is false.\n  \nNow we can format our findings into the required JSON object.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of `relevant_cells`:\n- **Row Index 0 (Week 1):** The result \"w 12 - 0\" is relevant because it represents a shutout.\n- **Row Index 3 (Week 4):** Although not a shutout, we checked this row to confirm that it did not contribute an additional shutout.",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the most points scored by the Dolphins in a game be 34 points,\" we need to analyze the table for all games where the Dolphins played and examine the 'result' column, specifically focusing on the scores where they were indicated as winners ('w').\n\nLet's go through each row step-by-step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: The result is \"w 12 - 0.\" Dolphins scored 12 points.\n2. **Row 2**: The result is \"w 34 - 24.\" Dolphins scored 34 points.\n3. **Row 4**: The result is \"w 14 - 6.\" Dolphins scored 14 points.\n7. **Row 7**: The result is \"w 32 - 14.\" Dolphins scored 32 points.\n8. **Row 8**: The result is \"w 21 - 7.\" Dolphins scored 21 points.\n9. **Row 9**: The result is \"w 30 - 14.\" Dolphins scored 30 points.\n10. **Row 10**: The result is \"w 20 - 17.\" Dolphins scored 20 points.\n12. **Row 12**: The result is \"w 37 - 0.\" Dolphins scored 37 points.\n13. **Row 13**: The result is \"w 38 - 14.\" Dolphins scored 38 points.\n14. **Row 14**: The result is \"w 24 - 17.\" Dolphins scored 24 points.\n15. **Row 15**: The result is \"w 31 - 24.\" Dolphins scored 31 points.\n16. **Row 16**: The result is \"w 34 - 14.\" Dolphins scored 34 points.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see the highest score by the Dolphins in a single game was 38 points (row 13). Therefore, the claim that their most points scored in any game were 34 is incorrect. They achieved higher scores of both 37 and 38 points in different games.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\" The relevant rows for checking this are those where Dolphins scored the highest or equal to what's claimed (34), including any scoring above 34:\n\n- **Row 2**: Scored 34 points.\n- **Row 12**: Scored 37 points.\n- **Row 13**: Scored 38 points.\n- **Row 16**: Scored 34 points.\n\nHere is the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the lowest attendance figure for a 1983 Dolphins' game being 39,434, we need to examine all the attendance figures in the given table and identify the smallest value.\n\nLet's review each row under the \"attendance\" column:\n\n1. Week 1: 78,715\n2. Week 2: 59,343\n3. Week 3: 57,796\n4. Week 4: 50,785\n5. Week 5: 66,489\n6. Week 6: 59,948\n7. Week 7: 58,615\n8. Week 8: 32,343\n9. Week 9: 72,175\n10. Week 10: 57,832\n11.
