    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002\" is true based on the given table, we need to analyze each row of the table for relevant data from the year 2002.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Focus only on rows where the date indicates an event occurred in 2002.\n2. **Analyze Score Column**: Check if Carsten Jancker's name is mentioned or implied in these events, specifically looking at his scoring contribution (goals).\n3. **Count Goals**: Count how many goals were attributed to him during those matches.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- **Row 7**: Date: 9 May 2002; Venue: dreisamstadion, Freiburg; Score: 7 - 0; Result: 7 - 0; Competition: friendly\n  - This row indicates a match where the score was 7 - 0. The table does not explicitly mention Carsten Jancker's goals here.\n\n- **Row 8**: Date: 1 June 2002; Venue: sapporo dome, Sapporo; Score: 4 - 0; Result: 8 - 0; Competition: 2002 world cup\n  - This row shows a match with a score of 4 - 0.

No explicit mention of Carsten Jancker's goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table does not provide any specific information about which players scored the goals in these matches, nor does it explicitly state that Carsten Jancker scored any goals in 2002. Therefore, based solely on the data provided in the table, we cannot confirm or deny the claim that \"Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002.\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON output indicates that the claim is false based on the information available in the table and identifies the relevant cells where the scoring data for 2002 was analyzed.",

The format of the score is \u201cfirst team\u2019s score - second team\u2019s score.\u201d\n   - Specifically, focus on how many times a \"1\" appears in the first part of the score (which represents the number of goals scored by Carsten Jancker's team if he was scoring).\n\n3. **Analyze Each Relevant Row:**\n   - **9 May 2002:** \n     - Score: \"7 - 0\"\n     - The first team scored 7 goals, so at least one goal could potentially be attributed to Carsten Jancker.\n   - **1 June 2002:** \n     - Score: \"4 - 0\"\n     - The first team scored 4 goals.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Carsten Jancker scored all of his goals in Dreisamstadion, Freiburg\" is true or false, we need to examine the table and verify if all instances of goal scoring (as indicated by matches with scores that imply goals) happened at the venue Dreisamstadion in Freiburg.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant entry:\n\n1. **Row 2**:\n   - Venue: Dreisamstadion, Freiburg\n   - Score: 6 - 2 \n   - This indicates goals were scored by both teams; however, we focus on the home team's goals since Carsten Jancker is implied to be a player associated with this venue.\n\n2. **Row 3**:\n   - Venue: Dreisamstadion, Freiburg\n   - Score: 8 - 2 \n   - Again, goals were scored by both teams; focus on the home team's goals.\n\n3. **Row 8**:\n   - Venue: Dreisamstadion, Freiburg\n   - Score: 7 - 0 \n   - Goals were scored solely by the home team.\n\nThese are all instances where goals were scored at Dreisamstadion in Freiburg. \n\nNow, let's examine other rows to see if there were any matches played by Carsten Jancker where he could have potentially scored outside of this venue:\n\n4. **Row 1**:\n   - Venue: EasyCredit-Stadion, Nuremberg\n   - Score: 1 - 0 \n   - Final result: 3 - 2 indicates goals were scored.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Venue: Helsinki Olympic Stadium, Helsinki\n   - Score: 2 - 2 \n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Venue: Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s Stadium, Budapest\n   - Score: 3 - 0 \n   - Final result: 5 - 2 indicates goals were scored.\n\n7. **Row 6**:\n   - Venue: Olympiastadion, Munich\n   - Score: 1 - 0 \n   - Final result: 1 - 5 indicates goals were scored.\n\n8. **Row 7**:\n   - Venue: Sapporo Dome, Sapporo\n   - Score: 4 - 0 \n   - Final result: 8 - 0 indicates goals were scored.\n\n9. **Row 9**:\n   - Venue: Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia\n   - Score: 2 - 2 \n\n10. **Row 10**:\n    - Venue: Asim Ferhatovi\u0107 Hase Stadium, Sarajevo\n    - Score: 1 - 1 \n\nFor the claim to be true, Carsten Jancker must not have scored in any of these matches outside Dreisamstadion.\n\nSince the problem does not provide explicit data on who scored each goal and given we only analyze venues with goals, based on this table alone:\n- We observe goals were scored in other locations (rows 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10).\n\nThus, without additional information specifically attributing all of Carsten Jancker's goals to the matches at Dreisamstadion, we cannot confirm that he did score exclusively there.
