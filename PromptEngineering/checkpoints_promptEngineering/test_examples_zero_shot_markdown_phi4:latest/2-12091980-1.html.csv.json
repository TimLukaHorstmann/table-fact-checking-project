    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30,\" we need to examine the \"goals for\" column in the table provided. The claim suggests that there should be no games where the number of goals scored (i.e., \"goals for\") is less than 30.\n\nHere's a step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table:** \n   - Each row represents a team.\n   - The columns include various statistics, but we are particularly interested in the \"games played\" and \"goals for\" columns to verify this claim.\n\n2. **Examining 'Goals For' Column:**\n   - We need to check if any team has fewer than 30 goals scored over the course of their games.\n   - The \"games played\" column is also relevant because it shows that each team has indeed participated in a number of games (10 for all teams listed).\n\n3. **Checking Each Row:**\n   - Ottawa Hockey Club: Goals For = 90\n   - Montreal Wanderers: Goals For = 74\n   - Montreal Victorias: Goals For = 76\n   - Quebec Hockey Club: Goals For = 57\n   - Montreal Hockey Club: Goals For = 49\n   - Montreal Shamrocks: Goals For = 30\n\n4. **Analyzing the Results:**\n   - All teams have \"goals for\" values of 30 or more.\n   - The team with the lowest number of goals scored, the Montreal Shamrocks, has exactly 30 goals for.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no team has fewer than 30 goals, it supports the claim that there were no games played resulting in less than 30 goals for any team. Thus, the statement \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\" is true based on the data provided.\n\n6. **Identifying Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are those in the \"games played\" and \"goals for\" columns across all teams because we need to confirm both participation and scoring metrics.\n   \nTherefore, the JSON object with the conclusion and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"games played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
