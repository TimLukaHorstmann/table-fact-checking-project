Whether the owner is correctly described as including \"self,\" \"king morgenson,\" \"travis,\" and so on.\n\nLet's break down these verifications against the table:\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n**Step 1: Check the Winner for 2012**\n- Look at the row where the year is 2012.\n- The winner column should contain \"blueeyesintherein.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row Index: 0 (as indexing starts from 0)\n- Column Name: \"winner\"\n- Value in this cell: \"blueeyesintherein\"\n\n**Step 2: Check the Owner for 2012**\n- Look at the row where the year is 2012.\n- The owner column should contain a description that includes \"self,\" \"king morgenson,\" \"travis,\" and so on.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row Index: 0\n- Column Name: \"owner\"\n- Value in this cell: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\"\n\nThe value for the owner includes all mentioned names (\"self,\" \"king,\" \"morgenson,\" \"travis\") along with \", et al,\" which indicates additional owners.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the table:\n- The winner in 2012 is indeed \"blueeyesintherein.\"\n- The owner description matches, including all specified names and suggesting more (\"et al\").\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

According to the table, \"blueeyesintherein\" won in 2012, which satisfies the condition of occurring after 2009.\n\n3. **Ownership by Overbrook Farm and et al**\n   - The claim specifies that the ownership includes \"Overbrook farm and et al.\" In the table, for the year 2012 (which matches our winner), the owner is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\". This does not include \"Overbrook Farm.\"\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- The relevant row for verifying the claim is the one corresponding to the year 2012.\n- Column checks needed are: `winner` and `owner`.\n\nBased on the data in the table, Overbrook Farm is not listed as an owner for \"blueeyesintherein.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The horse named \"flashy lassie\" was a winner.\n2. This win occurred after 2009.\n3. The owner of \"flashy lassie\" is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\"\n\nLet's examine each condition in the table:\n\n1. **Identify the row with \"flashy lassie\":**\n   - From the table, we find that \"flashy lassie\" is listed under the \"winner\" column in the row corresponding to the year 2011.\n\n2. **Check if the win occurred after 2009:**\n   - The year for \"flashy lassie\" is 2011, which is indeed after 2009.\n\n3. **Verify the owner of \"flashy lassie\":**\n   - In the row where \"flashy lassie\" appears, the \"owner\" column states \"barry l king.\"\n\nNow we compare this with the claim's specification that the owner should be \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" It is clear from our examination that:\n\n- The actual owner of \"flashy lassie\" in 2011 was \"barry l king,\" not \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\"\n\nGiven this information, the claim is false.
