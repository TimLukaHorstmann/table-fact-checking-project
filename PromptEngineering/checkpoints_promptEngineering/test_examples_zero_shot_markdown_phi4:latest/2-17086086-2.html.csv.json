The player in question is Laura Golarsa.\n2. We are interested in any match where she was an opponent in the final.\n3. We must verify if that match took place on a clay surface.\n\nNow, examine the table for relevant entries:\n\n- Look through each row to find where Laura Golarsa is listed as \"opponent in the final.\"\n- Verify the corresponding \"surface\" entry to check if it's \"clay.\"\n\nLet's analyze the table row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Date: 4 july 1988\n   - Tournament: b\u00e5stad , sweden\n   - Surface: clay\n   - Opponent in the final: sandra cecchini\n   - Score: 7 - 5, 6 - 1\n\n   Laura Golarsa is not involved here.\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Date: 1 august 1988\n   - Tournament: athens , greece\n   - Surface: clay\n   - Opponent in the final: laura golarsa\n   - Score: 6 - 0, 6 - 1\n\n   Laura Golarsa is involved as an opponent in this match, and it was played on a clay surface.\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Date: 17 july 1989\n   - Tournament: estoril , portugal\n   - Surface: clay\n   - Opponent in the final: sandra cecchini\n   - Score: 7 - 6 (3), 6 - 2\n\n   Laura Golarsa is not involved here.\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Date: 31 july 1989\n   - Tournament: sofia , bulgaria\n   - Surface: clay\n   - Opponent in the final: katerina maleeva\n   - Score: 6 - 2, 7 - 6 (3)\n\n   Laura Golarsa is not involved here.\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Date: 9 july 1990\n   - Tournament: palermo , italy\n   - Surface: clay\n   - Opponent in the final: barbara paulus\n   - Score: 6 - 2, 6 - 3\n\n   Laura Golarsa is not involved here.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we find that Laura Golarsa was an opponent in the final on a clay surface only once (Row 1).
