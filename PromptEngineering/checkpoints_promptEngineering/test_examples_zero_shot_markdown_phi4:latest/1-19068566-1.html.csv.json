Identify the row where the `production code` is `3t7458`.\n2. Check if the `written by` field in that row includes both \"don whitehead\" and \"holly henderson.\"\n\nLet's examine each condition step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Production Code\n\nWe need to find which row has the `production code` of `3t7458`. Looking through the table, we see:\n\n- Row 9 (no 162) has a production code of `3t7458`.\n\n### Step 2: Check Authors for the Identified Row\n\nIn row 9, we have:\n\n- `written by`: al septien & turi meyer\n- `production code`: 3t7458\n\nThe authors listed in this row are \"al septien\" and \"turi meyer,\" not \"don whitehead & holly henderson.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because the production code `3t7458` does not have \"don whitehead & holly henderson\" as its writers.\n\nBased on our findings, here is the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"production code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
