    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine two conditions based on the table:\n\n1. Identify the years when Collingwood was either a winner or a grand finalist.\n2. Check if these instances were among the top two largest winning margins from 1977 to 1986.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Collingwood's Performance:**\n  - **Winner:** \n    - Year 1979\n  - **Grand Finalist:**\n    - Year 1980\n\n- **Winning Margins for Collingwood's Years of Interest:**\n  - Year 1979 (Winner): Margin = 28 points\n  - Year 1980 (Grand Finalist): Not applicable as they did not win.\n\n- **Identify the Top Two Largest Winning Margins:**\n  - From the table, we extract all winning margins:\n    - 1977: 24 points\n    - 1978: 76 points\n    - 1979: 28 points\n    - 1980: 3 points (not a win for Collingwood)\n    - 1981: 24 points\n    - 1982: 32 points\n    - 1983: 34 points\n    - 1984: 51 points\n    - 1985: 9 points\n    - 1986: 30 points\n\n  - The top two largest margins are:\n    - 1978: 76 points\n    - 1984: 51 points\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - Collingwood's winning margin in 1979 (28 points) is not among the top two largest margins (76 and 51 points).\n\nSince Collingwood was not a winner or grand finalist at either of the games with the two biggest winning margins, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row index 3 (\"year\": 1979), columns:\n  - \"winners\" (Collingwood as winners)\n  - \"margin\" (28 points)\n\n- Top two largest margins are identified from:\n  - Row index 1 (\"year\": 1978), column \"margin\" (76 points)\n  - Row index 7 (\"year\": 1984), column \"margin\" (51 points)\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"margin\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"margin\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
