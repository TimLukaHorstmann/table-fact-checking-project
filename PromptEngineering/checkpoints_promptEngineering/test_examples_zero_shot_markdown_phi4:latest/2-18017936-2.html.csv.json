    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"for club jfk olimps r\uce74ga and fc ditton be the only club with a goal difference above 50,\" we must examine the \"goal difference\" column of the table for each team's value.\n\nHere are the steps to verify this:\n\n1. **Identify relevant data**: The claim is about clubs having a goal difference greater than 50, so we need to focus on the \"goal difference\" column in the table.\n   \n2. **Check club jfk olimps r\uce74ga**:\n   - Row index: 0\n   - Goal difference: +96 (which is above 50)\n\n3. **Check club fc ditton - 2 daugavpils**:\n   - Row index: 1\n   - Goal difference: +64 (which is above 50)\n   \n4. **Check other clubs for goal differences greater than 50**:\n   - **vents\ud50cs - 2**: \n     - Row index: 3\n     - Goal difference: +83 (above 50)\n   - Other clubs have a goal difference of 30 or less, except jfk olimps r\uce74ga and fc ditton.\n\nGiven the above checks, we found that ventspils - 2 also has a goal difference greater than 50, which contradicts the claim. Hence, the claim is false as there are more than two clubs with a goal difference above 50.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are those in the \"goal difference\" column related to the teams mentioned:\n\n- jfk olimps r\uce74ga: Row index 0\n- fc ditton - 2 daugavpils: Row index 1\n- ventspils - 2: Row index 3\n\nNow, let's structure this in JSON format as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
