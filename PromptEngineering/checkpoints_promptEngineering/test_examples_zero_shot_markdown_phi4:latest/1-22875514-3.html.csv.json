    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"cole have 18 out of 50 field goal for a 360 average,\" we need to check the specific data related to Cole in the table:\n\n1. **Field Goals Attempted and Made**: \n   - According to the table, Cole's field goals are listed as \"18 - 50 360.\" This indicates that Cole made 18 out of 50 attempts.\n\n2. **Field Goal Percentage**:\n   - The third number (360) represents the shooting percentage for field goals.\n   - To verify this, we calculate the percentage: \\((\\text{Made} / \\text{Attempted}) \\times 100 = (18/50) \\times 100 = 36.0\\%\\).\n\nThe claim states a \"360 average,\" which likely refers to the shooting percentage of 360%. However, based on our calculation, it should be 36.0%, not 360%.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because the percentage is misrepresented.\n\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - The row index for Cole is 9.\n  - The relevant column name is \"field goals.\"\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"cole have 18 - 50 360 field goal\" is true or false, we need to verify if the data for player \"cole\" in the \"field goals\" column matches exactly with \"18 - 50 360\". \n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to \"cole\".\n2. Locate the \"field goals\" column.\n3. Check if the value in this cell is \"18 - 50 360\".\n\nBased on the table provided:\n- The row for \"cole\" is the 10th entry (considering the header as the first row, making it index 9).\n- In the \"field goals\" column of this row, the data is \"18 - 50 360\".\n\nThe claim exactly matches the information in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine if the information provided about the player \"cole\" regarding their field goals matches the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"cole player have 6 - 19 316 field goal.\"\n\n1. Identify the row for the player \"cole\":\n   - The table lists players alphabetically by name. By checking, we find that \"cole\" is indeed listed as a player.\n\n2. Locate the relevant column:\n   - The column labeled \"field goals\" contains data formatted as \"made - attempted percentage.\" \n\n3. Verify the specific cell content for \"cole\":\n   - In the row corresponding to \"cole\", the entry in the \"field goals\" column is \"6 - 19 316\".\n\nNow, compare this with the claim:\n- The claim specifies \"6 - 19 316 field goal,\" which exactly matches what we find in the table.\n\nSince both the player name and the specific field goal data match the table's contents, the claim is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- The row index for \"cole\" in a zero-indexed system (as typically used in programming) is 9.\n- The relevant column name for field goals data is \"field goals\".",
