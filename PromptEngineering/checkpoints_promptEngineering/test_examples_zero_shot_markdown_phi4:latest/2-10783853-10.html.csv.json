This matches the information in the table.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- The row index where St Kilda is listed as the home team (row 2).\n- The columns \"home team\" and \"venue\" in this row.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
