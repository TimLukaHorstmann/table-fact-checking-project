The name of the stadium is indeed \"new trabzon stadium.\"\n2. Its capacity is stated as 41513.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the markdown table:\n\n| stadium               |   capacity | city           | club               |   opening |\n|:----------------------|-----------:|:---------------|:-------------------|----------:|\n| new trabzon stadium   |      41513 | trabzon        | trabzonspor        |      2016 |\n\n- The \"stadium\" column in row index 3 matches the name \"new trabzon stadium.\"\n- The \"capacity\" column in row index 3 matches the number 41513.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information are:\n\n1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions:\n\n1. The stadium must have the largest capacity among those opened after 2015.\n2. The stadium in question should be \"new trabzon stadium\" with a capacity of 41,513.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Identify stadiums opened after 2015 and compare their capacities.\n\n  - New Trabzon Stadium: Capacity = 41,513; Opening Year = 2016\n  - Stadyum Samsun: Capacity = 34,658; Opening Year = 2016\n  - New Gaziantep Stadium: Capacity = 33,200; Opening Year = 2016\n  - New Antalya Stadium: Capacity = 33,000; Opening Year = 2016\n  - New Sakarya Stadium (second entry): Capacity = 28,710; Opening Year = 2016\n\n- **Condition 2**: Check if \"new trabzon stadium\" has the largest capacity.\n\nFrom the list of stadiums opened after 2015, \"new trabzon stadium\" indeed has the highest capacity of 41,513. No other stadium opened after 2015 has a larger capacity.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **New Trabzon Stadium**:\n  - Capacity: Row 4, Column \"capacity\"\n  - Opening Year: Row 4, Column \"opening\"\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "To verify the claim about Trabzon, we need to determine whether there is a stadium in Trabzon with a capacity of less than 11,000 as per the given table.\n\n1. **Identify Stadiums in Trabzon:**\n   - From the table, locate rows where the \"city\" column has the value \"trabzon.\"\n\n2. **Check Capacity for Trabzon Stadiums:**\n   - For each stadium found in Trabzon, check the corresponding value in the \"capacity\" column.\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim Against Data:**\n   - The claim states that the lowest capacity match in Trabzon has a capacity of 11,000 or more (since it mentions 11,000 as a threshold). We need to ensure there are no capacities below this value for stadiums in Trabzon.\n\n4. **Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - Identify the rows containing \"trabzon\" in the \"city\" column.\n   - Extract values from the \"capacity\" column for these rows.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - The table shows one stadium in Trabzon:\n     - Row 4, \"new trabzon stadium,\" with a capacity of 41,513.\n   - Since there is only one stadium listed and its capacity is 41,513, which is greater than 11,000, the claim holds true.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is TRUE because there are no stadiums in Trabzon with a capacity less than 11,000.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this are from row index 4 for both \"city\" and \"capacity\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"city\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
