We are looking for the row where this column has a value of 21.\n\n2. **Check Score Column**:\n   Once we identify the correct row, we need to verify if the \"score\" column matches \"5 - 4\".\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- Row with `february` = 21 corresponds to `game` = 63.\n- Check the \"score\" for this row: it is indeed \"5 - 4\".\n\nThus, both conditions in the claim are met. The relevant cells are from row index 10 (since indexing starts at 0) and the columns \"february\" and \"score\".\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
