    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of it against the given table:\n\n1. **\"Italy have 2 gold medals\":** We must check Italy's gold medal count.\n2. **\"3 total medals\":** We must verify Italy's total medal count.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the table for Italy:\n\n- The row corresponding to \"italy\" is at index 10 (considering zero-based indexing).\n- According to the table, under the column \"gold\", Italy has a value of 0.\n- Under the column \"total\", Italy has a value of 1.\n\nNow let's evaluate the claim against these observations:\n\n1. **Gold Medals Claim:** The claim states that Italy have 2 gold medals, but according to the table, they have 0 gold medals. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n   \n2. **Total Medals Claim:** The claim states that Italy have a total of 3 medals, but according to the table, they have a total of 1 medal. Thus, this part of the claim is also false.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- For the gold medal count: `row_index` = 10 and `column_name` = \"gold\"\n- For the total medal count: `row_index` = 10 and `column_name` = \"total\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
