    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding \"The Addams Family Musical\" awards in 2010, we need to evaluate two parts of the claim against the table data:\n\n1. **Tony Awards:**\n   - The claim states that \"The Addams Family Musical have not win any tony award.\"\n     - We look for rows where `award` is \"tony award\".\n     - There are two such rows:\n       - Row 0: Andrew Lippa, Best Original Score, Nominated.\n       - Row 1: Kevin Chamberlin, Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical, Nominated.\n     - Both results are \"nominated\", so no Tony Awards were won.\n\n   - The claim also states that it was nominated for 2 Tony Awards.\n     - As identified above, there are exactly two nominations listed under Tony Awards, matching the claim.\n\n2. **Outer Critics Circle Award:**\n   - The claim states that it has not won any Outer Critics Circle Award but was nominated for 2.\n     - We look for rows where `award` is \"outer critics circle award\".\n     - There are five such rows:\n       - Row 13: Nathan Lane, Outstanding Actor in a Musical, Nominated.\n       - Row 14: Bebe Neuwirth, Outstanding Actress in a Musical, Nominated.\n       - Row 15: Kevin Chamberlin, Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical, Nominated.\n       - Row 16: Carolee Carmello, Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical, Nominated.\n       - Row 17: Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch, Outstanding Set Design (Play or Musical), Won.\n     - Four results are \"nominated\" and one result is \"won\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following conditions based on the table:\n\n1. The show \"The Addams Family Musical\" was nominated for the Tony Award in both the \"Outstanding Music\" and \"Outstanding Lyrics\" categories.\n2. It did not win either of those Tony Award categories.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the provided table data:\n\n- **Tony Award for Outstanding Music**: \n  - The table does not list any nomination under the category \"outstanding music\" for a Tony award in 2010. Thus, there is no evidence that it was nominated for this category at all.\n  \n- **Tony Award for Outstanding Lyrics**:\n  - Similarly, there is no row indicating a nomination for \"outstanding lyrics\" under the Tony awards in 2010.\n\nBased on these findings, the show \"The Addams Family Musical\" was not even nominated for either of those Tony categories according to this table. Therefore, it could not have lost them because it wasn't nominated.\n\nNow, let's format our conclusion as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The claim is true because the show did not receive nominations for those Tony categories as per this table.\n- Relevant cells are checked to confirm there were no entries under \"tony award\" for \"outstanding music\" or \"outstanding lyrics\". These correspond to row indices 6 and 7 in the markdown table, where these categories would be if they existed.",
