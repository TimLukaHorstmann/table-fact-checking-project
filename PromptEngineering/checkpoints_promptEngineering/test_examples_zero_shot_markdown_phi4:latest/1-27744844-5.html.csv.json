    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Tyreke Evans scoring the most points on November 6 when he scored 30 points is true or false, we need to evaluate two parts of the claim:\n\n1. **Tyreke Evans scored 30 points on November 6**:\n   - We look at the row where the \"date\" column is \"november 6\".\n   - In this row, the game number is 6, and the \"high points\" column indicates that Tyreke Evans scored 30 points.\n   - Therefore, this part of the claim is supported by the data.\n\n2. **Tyreke Evans scored the most points in any game up to November 6**:\n   - We need to compare his score on November 6 with his scores in all previous games listed before that date.\n   - Checking each relevant row before and including November 6, we see:\n     - Game 4 (November 1): Tyreke Evans scored 23 points.\n     - Game 5 (November 3): Tyreke Evans scored 21 points.\n     - Game 6 (November 6): Tyreke Evans scored 30 points.\n\n   - In all previous games, his highest score was 23 points on November 1. Thus, the score of 30 points on November 6 is indeed the highest he achieved up to that point in time according to the table.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are true based on the data provided, the entire claim is supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n\nRelevant cells include those where Tyreke Evans' scores and game dates are specified:\n- Row index 6 for November 6 with a high score of 30 points.\n- Row indices 4 and 5 to compare his earlier scores (23 and 21, respectively).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
