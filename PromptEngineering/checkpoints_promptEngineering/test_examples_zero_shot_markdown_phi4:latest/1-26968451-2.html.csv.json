    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Michael Lembeck directed series number 39, 'Fly Solo'\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Director of Series Number 39**: The claim states that Michael Lembeck directed this episode.\n2. **Title of Series Number 39**: The title should be \"Fly Solo\".\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows in the markdown table:\n\n- **Row Index for Series Number 39**:\n  - The row where `series` is `39` contains:\n    - Directed by: Michael Lembeck\n    - Title: Flying solo\n\nNow, let's verify each condition from the claim against this information:\n\n1. **Director**: The director listed for series number 39 is indeed \"Michael Lembeck\", which matches the claim.\n2. **Title**: The title listed for series number 39 is \"Flying solo\". This does not match exactly with the claimed title \"Fly Solo\" (note the difference in capitalization and wording).\n\nSince the title does not perfectly match, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"directed by :\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
