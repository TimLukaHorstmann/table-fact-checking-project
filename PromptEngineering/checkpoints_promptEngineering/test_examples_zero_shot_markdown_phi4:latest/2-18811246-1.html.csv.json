The table only provides information about where Manfred Kokot performed and not where he is originally from.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table does not provide any information about Manfred Kokot's place of origin; it only indicates that his record was set in Berlin.\n   - Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported as true based on the data provided because \"be from\" requires knowledge about his birthplace or hometown, which is not available.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
