    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Tom Richardson having the highest number of wickets taken is true or false, we need to examine the \"wickets taken\" column in the table.\n\nLet's identify and compare the values:\n\n1. **John Hearne**: 212 wickets\n2. **Tom Richardson**: 174 wickets\n3. **Johnny Briggs**: 166 wickets\n4. **Arthur Mold**: 166 wickets\n5. **Bill Lockwood**: 150 wickets\n\nFrom this comparison, it is clear that Tom Richardson has taken 174 wickets, which is not the highest number in the column. John Hearne has taken the most with 212 wickets.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Tom Richardson have the highest number of wicket take of any player\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those in the \"wickets taken\" column for each player:\n\n- Row index 0, Column name: \"wickets taken\"\n- Row index 1, Column name: \"wickets taken\"\n- Row index 2, Column name: \"wickets taken\"\n- Row index 3, Column name: \"wickets taken\"\n- Row index 4, Column name: \"wickets taken\"\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
