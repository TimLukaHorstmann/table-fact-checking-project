Specifically, we're interested in checking if this model has a \"natural wood keyboard\" feature.\n\n1. Locate the row corresponding to `clps306`:\n   - The row for `clps306` is at index 3 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. Check the \"natural wood keyboard\" column for this row:\n   - In the \"natural wood keyboard\" column for `clps306`, the entry is \"no\".\n\nThe claim states that \"the keyboard model clps306 be not a natural wood product.\" The data shows \"no\" under the \"natural wood keyboard\" feature for `clps306`, which supports the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is true.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the model cvp501 hammer grade\" is true or false, we need to understand what this implies about the features of the model 'cvp501'. The term \"hammer graded\" could refer to either having a \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" feature set as \"yes\" or the \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" feature being set as \"yes\". Based on typical usage, \"hammer grade\" is likely referring to the presence of an actual hammer mechanism which might be represented by the \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" column.\n\nLet's examine the 'cvp501' row in the table:\n\n1. Check the \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" column for model 'cvp501':\n   - In the row corresponding to cvp501, this column is marked as \"yes\".\n\n2. The claim does not refer explicitly to \"graded hammer three (gh3)\", so there's no need to consider that column for this particular claim.\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n- The model 'cvp501' does indeed have the \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" feature set to \"yes\", which supports the claim regarding having a hammer grade.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell for verification is where 'cvp501' intersects with the \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer (non gh3)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere:\n- `row_index` is 13 because 'cvp501' is the 14th model in the table (index starting at 0).\n- The relevant column name to check for this claim is \"graded hammer (non gh3)\".",
