We must locate row 16 (since indexing starts at 0) in the table, which corresponds to week 17.\n\n2. **Check the Result for Week 17**:\n   - Once we've identified the correct row (week 17), we examine the \"result\" column to determine whether the Dolphins won or lost. The claim asserts that it was not a win for the Dolphins.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - In row 16, under the week labeled as \"17\", the result is listed as \"l 27 - 24\". The 'l' indicates a loss.\n   \n4. **Verification Against Claim**:\n   - Since the result is a loss ('l'), it supports the claim that the Dolphins did not win in week 17.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is true because the table shows a loss for the Dolphins in week 17.

There should be 37 fewer crowd attendance in week 15 than in week 14.\n\nLet's verify these against the table data:\n\n- **Week 14**:\n  - Result: \"w 27 - 9\" (Win)\n  - Attendance: 73609\n\n- **Week 15**:\n  - Result: \"w 23 - 17\" (Win)\n  - Attendance: 73572\n\nThe claim states that both games were losses, but in week 14 the result is a win and in week 15 it's also a win. Therefore, the first condition of the claim is not satisfied.\n\nAdditionally, while the attendance difference between week 15 and week 14 is indeed 37 (73609 - 73572 = 37), this does not matter since the first condition fails.\n\nGiven that the games were not losses, the claim is false. We need to identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Week 14:\n  - Result: Row index 13, Column \"result\"\n  - Attendance: Row index 13, Column \"attendance\"\n\n- Week 15:\n  - Result: Row index 14, Column \"result\"\n  - Attendance: Row index 14, Column \"attendance\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
