    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the game on April 16, 2008, we need to verify each condition mentioned in the claim against the provided table:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim specifies \"April 16, 2008\". In the table, this date corresponds to row index 7.\n\n2. **Teams Playing Against Each Other**: \n   - The claim states that both the Rockets and Clippers played against each other. According to the table in row 7, the visitor is \"clippers\" and the home team is \"rockets\", confirming that these two teams played against each other.\n\n3. **Location of the Game**:\n   - The claim mentions that both teams played at their own home. However, the table shows that the Clippers were the visitors and the Rockets were the home team on April 16, 2008. This means the game was held at the Rockets' home venue, not a neutral or shared location.\n\n4. **Outcome of the Game**:\n   - The claim states the result as \"the rocket lose 75 to 93\". In the table, it shows the score \"75 - 93\" with Clippers being the visitors (indicated by their score first). Therefore, the Rockets lost to the Clippers with a score of 75-93.\n\n5. **Teams' Performance**:\n   - The leading scorer for this game was Corey Maggette from the Clippers with 22 points, which aligns with the table's information in row index 7 under \"leading scorer\".\n\nFrom these verifications:\n\n- The date and participating teams match.\n- However, the claim that both teams played at their own home is incorrect. Only the Rockets were playing at home.\n- The game outcome (score) matches what is stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, since one part of the claim (\"both teams play at their own home\") is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check these conditions are:\n- Row index 7 for \"date\", \"visitor\", \"home\", \"score\", and \"leading scorer\".\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
