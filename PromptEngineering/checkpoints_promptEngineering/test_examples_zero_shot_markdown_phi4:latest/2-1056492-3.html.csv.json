    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check each row in the table for two conditions over the seasons from 2003 through 2012:\n\n1. The number of teams (`tms`) should be less than 13.\n2. The position (`pos`) should be less than 8.\n\nWe will examine each row and identify any that do not satisfy both conditions.\n\n### Row Analysis\n\n- **Row 0 (Season 2003):**\n  - `tms = 12` (less than 13)\n  - `pos = 11` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 1 (Season 2004):**\n  - `tms = 13` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 10` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 2 (Season 2005):**\n  - `tms = 13` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 8` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 3 (Season 2006):**\n  - `tms = 14` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 7` (less than 8)\n\n- **Row 4 (Season 2007):**\n  - `tms = 14` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 12` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 5 (Season 2008):**\n  - `tms = 14` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 11` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 6 (Season 2009):**\n  - `tms = 15` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 15` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 7 (Season 2010):**\n  - `tms = 15` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 15` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 8 (Season 2011):**\n  - `tms = 16` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 12` (not less than 8)\n\n- **Row 9 (Season 2012):**\n  - `tms = 16` (not less than 13)\n  - `pos = 10` (not less than 8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that there should be no team with both conditions satisfied. However, we found:\n\n- Row 0 satisfies the condition for `tms < 13`, but not `pos < 8`.\n- Row 3 satisfies the condition for `pos < 8`, but not `tms < 13`.\n\nNo row satisfies both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the provided table and verify the conditions specified in the claim:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Condition 1**: \"there be no division present in the table with a season after 2012\"\n   - This implies that for any row in the table where the `season` is greater than 2012, there should not exist any entry.\n   - From the table, all seasons listed are up to and including 2012. Therefore, this condition holds as there are no entries for seasons after 2012.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: \"that reach the round of 16 in the fa cup\"\n   - This part requires checking if any entry for seasons 2013 or later (if they existed) reached the \"round of 16\" stage in the FA Cup.\n   - Since there are no entries for seasons after 2012, this condition is trivially satisfied.\n\n### Verification:\n- Check each row to ensure that the season does not exceed 2012. The highest season listed is 2012, so Condition 1 is met.\n- Since there are no rows with a season beyond 2012, there can't be any that reach the \"round of 16\" in the FA Cup after 2012.\n\nSince both conditions required by the claim are satisfied (trivially for the second condition due to lack of data), we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
