So this supports part of the claim as it had no zero placement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe table shows that Mark McCumber did not place in the \"top - 5\" only during the Masters Tournament. The PGA Championship has a non-zero count in the top 5 column, so it does not support the claim as an example where he didn't place at all in the top 5.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE** because the PGA Championship should not be included as one of the tournaments with no top-5 placements.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nWe identify relevant cells to verify this conclusion:\n\n- For \"Masters Tournament\", check `Top - 5` (row_index = 0).\n- For \"PGA Championship\", check `Top - 5` (row_index = 3).\n\nHere is the JSON response with the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
