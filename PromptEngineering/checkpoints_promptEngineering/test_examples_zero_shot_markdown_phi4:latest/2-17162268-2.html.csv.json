    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Jack Nicklaus and his wins, we need to assess two main components:\n\n1. **Number of Wins**: The claim states that \"Jack Nicklaus have win the most year.\" We need to determine whether Jack Nicklaus has won more times than any other player listed in the table.\n\n2. **Country of Origin**: The claim specifies that he is from Australia, but we need to verify his actual country as per the table.\n\n3. **Years Won**: It mentions his wins expanded from 1962 to 1980. We will check if this range matches the years provided in the table for Jack Nicklaus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Number of Wins:\n- From the \"player\" column, we see that Jack Nicklaus has four entries (years won: 1962, 1967, 1972, 1980).\n- Hale Irwin also has multiple wins in different years (1974, 1979, 1990) but only three total.\n- Other players have fewer or single-year wins.\n\nJack Nicklaus indeed has the most number of wins among the listed players with four victories.\n\n#### Country of Origin:\n- The \"country\" column lists Jack Nicklaus as being from the United States, not Australia. Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\n#### Years Won:\n- According to the table, Jack Nicklaus's years won are 1962, 1967, 1972, and 1980.\n- These years align with the range mentioned in the claim (expanded from 1962 to 1980).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim fails because it incorrectly states that Jack Nicklaus is from Australia. Although his number of wins and the years won are correct, the error regarding his country makes the entire claim false.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- The cells relevant for verifying the \"most year\" part are those pertaining to the player's name, years won, and total wins.\n- For checking the country, the specific cell that mentions Jack Nicklaus's nationality is needed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
