According to the table:\n   - In row index 0 (Maryland 1), Robert Bauman is listed as the incumbent.\n   \n2. **Party Affiliation Check**: The claim specifies that Robert Bauman should be a Democratic incumbent. However, according to the table:\n   - In row index 0 (Maryland 1), Robert Bauman's party affiliation is listed as Republican.\n\n3. **District Check**: The claim mentions Maryland district 7. According to the table:\n   - In row index 4 (Maryland 7), Parren Mitchell is the incumbent, not Robert Bauman.\n   \nGiven these points, Robert Bauman is neither associated with Maryland district 7 nor a Democratic party member.
