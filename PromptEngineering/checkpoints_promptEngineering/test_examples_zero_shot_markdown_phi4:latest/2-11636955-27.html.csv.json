Locate Peter Schaefer's row:\n   - Peter Schaefer is listed on the 3rd row of the table.\n   - The 'pl gp' value for Peter Schaefer is 3.\n\n2. Locate Brent Sopel's row:\n   - Brent Sopel is listed on the 6th row of the table.\n   - The 'pl gp' value for Brent Sopel is 42.\n\n3. Compare the values from their respective rows in the 'pl gp' column:\n   - Peter Schaefer played in 3 playoff games.\n   - Brent Sopel played in 42 playoff games.\n\n4. Evaluate the claim based on these values:\n   - The claim states that Peter Schaefer played in more playoff games than Brent Sopel.\n   - This is not true, as Peter Schaefer's playoff games (3) are fewer than Brent Sopel's playoff games (42).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
