It's the last entry in the table, confirming it aired last.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Viewer Count\n- The claim further states that this was also the least-watched episode with 5.01 million viewers.\n- We need to compare its viewer count (5.01 million) against all other episodes listed in the \"us viewers (in million)\" column.\n\nLet's list the viewer counts from the table:\n\n1.

Let's verify this by checking the relevant columns for each row:\n\n- **Column \"original air date\"** contains the air dates for the episodes.\n- We'll extract these dates and calculate the gaps (difference in days) between consecutive episodes.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how to verify the claim step-by-step:\n\n1. **Extract Air Dates:**\n   - Episode 1: September 22, 2010\n   - Episode 2: September 29, 2010\n   - Other dates are not directly relevant for this specific claim but are necessary for completeness and ensuring no shorter gap exists.\n\n2. **Calculate the Gaps Between Consecutive Episodes:**\n   - Gap between episode 1 (September 22, 2010) and episode 2 (September 29, 2010): \n     \\[\n     \\text{Gap} = \\text{September 29, 2010} - \\text{September 22, 2010} = 7 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n   - Proceed to calculate gaps for all other consecutive episodes:\n     - Episode 2 and episode 3: October 6, 2010 \u2192 7 days\n     - Episode 3 and episode 4: October 13, 2010 \u2192 7 days\n     - Episode 4 and episode 5: October 20, 2010 \u2192 7 days\n     - Episode 5 and episode 6: October 27, 2010 \u2192 7 days\n     - Episode 6 and episode 7: November 3, 2010 \u2192 6 days\n     - Episode 7 and episode 8: November 17, 2010 \u2192 14 days\n     - Episode 8 and episode 9: November 24, 2010 \u2192 7 days\n     - Episode 9 and episode 10: December 8, 2010 \u2192 14 days\n     - Episode 10 and episode 11: January 5, 2011 \u2192 28 days\n     - Episode 11 and episode 12: January 19, 2011 \u2192 14 days\n     - Episode 12 and episode 13: January 26, 2011 \u2192 7 days\n     - Episode 13 and episode 14: February 2, 2011 \u2192 7 days\n     - Gap from episode 14 to episode 15: April 18, 2011 (a significant gap due to a hiatus)\n     - Episode 15 and episode 16: April 20, 2011 \u2192 2 days\n     - Episode 16 and episode 17: April 27, 2011 \u2192 7 days\n     - Further gaps follow similar calculations.\n\n3. **Identify the Shortest Gap:**\n   - From our calculations above, the shortest gap found is between episodes 15 (April 18, 2011) and 16 (April 20, 2011), which is indeed 2 days.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that the shortest gap is between episode 1 and episode 2 being only 2 days apart is false.\n   - Instead, the shortest gap is actually between episodes 15 and 16.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells for verifying the air date gaps are from the \"original air date\" column for all rows.
