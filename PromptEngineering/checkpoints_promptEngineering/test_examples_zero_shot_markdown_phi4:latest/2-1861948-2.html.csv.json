Additionally, for the claim to hold true as the only occurrence, no other entries in the table should have the label \"warner bros records.\"\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Date: September 14, 1992\n  - Label: 4ad\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Date: September 14, 1992\n  - Label: 4ad\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Date: July 6, 1998\n  - Label: 4ad\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Date: September 15, 1992\n  - Label: warner bros records\n  - This matches the condition for being a date with the label \"warner bros records.\"\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Date: November 2, 1999\n  - Label: 4ad\n\nFrom this evaluation, Row 3 is indeed the only row where the label is \"warner bros records\" and matches the specified date of September 15, 1992.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"sep , 1992 be the earliest date\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to examine the 'date' column for all entries and identify the earliest date.\n\n1. **Extract Dates**: The relevant column here is 'date'. We'll extract each date from this column:\n   - Row 0: September 14, 1992\n   - Row 1: September 14, 1992\n   - Row 2: July 6, 1998\n   - Row 3: September 15, 1992\n   - Row 4: November 2, 1999\n\n2. **Identify Earliest Date**: We compare all these dates to find the earliest one.\n   - The year component is our first comparison point. All years are 1992 or later, with two entries in 1992.\n   - Among the 1992 entries:\n     - September 14, 1992 (Row 0)\n     - September 14, 1992 (Row 1)\n     - September 15, 1992 (Row 3)\n   - The earliest among these is September 14, 1992.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that \"sep , 1992 be the earliest date.\" This implies any date in September 1992 should be considered the earliest.\n   - We found that September 14, 1992, appears and is indeed the earliest date present in the table.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there are dates in September 1992 (specifically September 14, 1992), and these are the earliest, the claim is TRUE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verification include all rows with a 'date' of September 14 or 15, 1992.\n   - Row indices for these dates are 0, 1, and 3.\n\nThus, the JSON object should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
