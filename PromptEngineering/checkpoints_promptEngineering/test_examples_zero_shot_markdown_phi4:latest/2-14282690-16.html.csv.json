    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Croatia's matches between June and August, we need to examine the relevant rows in the table. The claim states:\n\n1. \"Croatia only play 1 game between June and August.\"\n2. \"It be against Bulgaria.\"\n\nLet's break down each part of this claim using the data provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Timeframe: June to August\nWe need to identify matches involving Croatia that took place between June and August:\n\n- **June**: Row 152, Date is 4 June.\n- **July**: No matches listed for July.\n- **August**: Row 153, Date is 17 August.\n\n### Analyzing Each Relevant Match\n\n1. **Row 152**\n   - Date: 4 June\n   - Description: World cup 2006 qualifier\n   - Opponent: Bulgaria vs Croatia\n   - This match involves Croatia playing against Bulgaria in June.\n\n2. **Row 153**\n   - Date: 17 August\n   - Description: Friendly\n   - Opponent: Brazil vs Croatia\n   - This match involves Croatia playing against Brazil in August.\n\n### Verification of the Claim\n\n- According to Row 152, Croatia played one game against Bulgaria on 4 June.\n- According to Row 153, Croatia also played a second game (a friendly) against Brazil on 17 August.\n- Therefore, between June and August, Croatia played two games, not just one.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that Croatia only played one game in this period and that it was against Bulgaria. However, we have identified that there were actually two games during the specified timeframe (one against Bulgaria and another against Brazil). Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBased on our analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those that contain the dates and opponents for the games involving Croatia in June (Row 152) and August (Row 153).",
