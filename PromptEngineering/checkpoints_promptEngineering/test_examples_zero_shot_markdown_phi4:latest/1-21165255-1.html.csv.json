    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the number in season for 4300062 be 19\" is true or false, we need to verify two pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The production code `4300062` corresponds to which row.\n2. In that row, check the value under the column \"no in season\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows and columns:\n\n- Locate the row with the production code `4300062`. From the table:\n  - Row index 21 (62nd entry) has the production code `4300062`.\n  \n- Check the \"no in season\" for this row:\n  - In row index 21, under the column \"no in season\", the value is 18.\n\nThe claim states that the number in season should be 19 for production code `4300062`, but from our check, it is actually 18. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- Row index 21 with column name \"no in season\".\n- Row index 21 with column name \"production code\".\n\nThe JSON object representing this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
