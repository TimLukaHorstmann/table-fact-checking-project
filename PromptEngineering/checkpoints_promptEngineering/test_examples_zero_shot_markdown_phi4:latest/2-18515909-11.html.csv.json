    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"player geremi have win only 1 fifa club world championship,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Geremi has won exactly 1 FIFA Club World Championship.\n2. There are no additional wins for Geremi in any other competitions listed.\n\nWe'll examine the relevant row and columns in the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: The player \"geremi\" is located at the last but one entry before \"totals,\" which corresponds to row index 16 (considering the header as row 0).\n  \n- **Column Name**: We need to check both:\n  - The column \"fifa club world championship\" for verifying if Geremi has exactly 1 win.\n  - Other columns (\"la liga\", \"copa del rey\", \"uefa champions league\") to ensure there are no additional wins in these competitions.\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- **Row Index 16, Column \"fifa club world championship\"**: The value is 1. This supports the claim that Geremi has won exactly 1 FIFA Club World Championship.\n  \n- **Other Columns for Row Index 16**:\n  - \"la liga\": Value is 0.\n  - \"copa del rey\": Value is 0.\n  - \"uefa champions league\": Value is 0.\n\nThese values confirm that Geremi has no additional wins in the other competitions listed.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"fifa club world championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"la liga\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"copa del rey\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"uefa champions league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
