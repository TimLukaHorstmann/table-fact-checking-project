    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down and analyze the claim:\n\n### Claim:\n\"When marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3 - 1.\"\n\n#### Steps for Evaluation:\n1. **Identify Rows with \"Marseille\" as Team 1:**\n   - We need to find any row where \"marseille\" appears in the \"team 1\" column.\n\n2. **Check the First Leg Score:**\n   - Once we identify the relevant row, check the \"1st leg\" column to see if the score is indeed \"3 - 1\".\n\n#### Table Analysis:\n- Look through each row for \"Marseille\":\n  - The last row shows \"marseille\" in the \"team 1\" column.\n  \n- Verify the first leg's score for Marseille:\n  - In that row, check the \"1st leg\" column which reads \"3 - 1\".\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nIdentify the specific cells relevant to verifying this claim:\n- The cell containing \"marseille\" in the \"team 1\" column.\n- The cell with \"3 - 1\" in the \"1st leg\" column for that row.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Bolton Wanderers' scores in the first and second legs being the same is true or false, we need to examine the relevant cells in the table.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\" We will locate the row corresponding to Bolton Wanderers and check their scores in both legs:\n\n- **Row Index**: From the table, Bolton Wanderers are listed in the third row (index 2).\n  \n- **Relevant Columns**:\n  - \"1st leg\" column: This contains the score for the first leg of the match. For Bolton Wanderers, it shows \"1 - 1\".\n  - \"2nd leg\" column: This contains the score for the second leg of the match. For Bolton Wanderers, it shows \"0 - 1\".\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The first leg score is \"1 - 1\", meaning Bolton Wanderers scored 1 goal in their home game.\n- The second leg score is \"0 - 1\", meaning Bolton Wanderers scored 0 goals in the away game.\n\nSince the scores are different (1 goal in the first leg and 0 goals in the second leg), the claim that the scores be the same for both legs is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells**: \n- The cells to verify this claim are located at row index 2, in the \"1st leg\" column and \"2nd leg\" column.\n\nThus, the JSON object with the result is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
