Thus, we are looking for games played against the Mariners.\n   - We also need to ensure these games occurred in June.\n\n3. **Count Jefferson's Losses Against Mariners in June**:\n   - For each relevant row, confirm if all conditions (opponent is Mariners, date is in June) are met.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Date: June 1\n  - Opponent: Mariners\n  - Loss: Jefferson (0 - 5)\n  - This matches the criteria.\n  \n- **Row 11**:\n  - Date: June 12\n  - Opponent: Mariners\n  - Loss: Jefferson (1 - 6)\n  - This matches the criteria.\n\nNo other rows mention \"jefferson\" in the 'loss' column for games against the Mariners in June.

Games involving the Blue Jays.\n  2. Those games must have gone into extra innings (indicated by a score format that includes \"(x)\", where \"x\" is the number of extra innings).\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to focus on rows where the opponent's name could imply a game played by the Blue Jays. In this context, the opponents are specified as \"mariners,\" \"angels,\" \"athletics,\" \"yankees,\" \"red sox,\" and \"orioles.\"\n\n2. **Check for Extra Innings:**\n   - The score column indicates extra innings if it contains parentheses (e.g., \"5 - 4 (10)\").\n   \n3. **Evaluate Each Row:**\n\n    - June 23, Red Sox: Score is \"4 - 3 (11)\" \u2014 This game went into 11 extra innings.\n    - June 28, Yankees: Score is \"5 - 3 (10)\" \u2014 This game went into 10 extra innings.\n\n4. **Determine the Blue Jays' Involvement:**\n   - The table lists games against specific teams: Mariners, Angels, Athletics, Yankees, Red Sox, and Orioles.\n   - We assume these are all potential opponents of the Blue Jays based on historical context since no explicit mention of \"Blue Jays\" is present in the opponent column.\n\n5. **Count Games with Extra Innings for Blue Jays:**\n   - Two games have extra innings:\n     - June 23 vs Red Sox\n     - June 28 vs Yankees\n\nSince both identified games are potentially involving the Blue Jays and meet the criterion of going into extra innings, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n**Relevant Cells Identification:**\n\n- June 23 (Row Index 22): Score column shows \"4 - 3 (11)\"\n- June 28 (Row Index 25): Score column shows \"5 - 3 (10)\"\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to identify instances in the table where a game played by the Blue Jays went into extra innings in June 1979. In baseball, games that go into extra innings typically have more than nine innings.\n\nHere are the steps to verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Games with Extra Innings**: Look for scores that suggest extra innings, such as:\n   - A score with a higher number of runs after the ninth inning.\n   - Explicit mention in parentheses indicating an inning count beyond nine (e.g., \"10\" or \"11\").\n\n2. **Count Relevant Games**: Check how many games fit this criterion.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- On June 13 against the Angels, one game score is 9 - 8. This suggests a possible extra inning game.\n- On June 23 against the Red Sox, one game score is 4 - 3 (11), explicitly indicating 11 innings.\n- On June 28 against the Yankees, one game score is 5 - 3 (10), explicitly indicating 10 innings.\n\nThese three games are identified as extra inning games. Therefore, the claim that \"the Blue Jays play 3 games that go into extra innings in June of 1979\" is supported by the data.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row index 12: The score column shows \"9 - 8\", suggesting an extra inning game.\n- Row index 22: The score column shows \"4 - 3 (11)\", explicitly indicating extra innings.\n- Row index 28: The score column shows \"5 - 3 (10)\", explicitly indicating extra innings.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"the blue jays swept the oakland athletics in the 3 game series from June 19th to 29th in 1979,\" we need to verify two main aspects:\n\n1. **Date Range**: The games must be played between June 19 and June 29.\n2. **Outcome**: The Blue Jays must have won all three games against the Oakland Athletics during this period.\n\nLet's analyze the table step-by-step based on these criteria:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games Against Athletics\nFrom the table, identify the games where the opponent is \"athletics\":\n\n- June 8: Athletics (2 - 1) | Huffman (2 - 6)\n- June 9: Athletics (5 - 0) | Keough (0 - 8)\n- June 10: Athletics (12 - 1) | Underwood (0 - 9)\n\n### Step 2: Check Date Range\nThe games against the Oakland Athletics occurred on:\n- June 8\n- June 9\n- June 10\n\nThese dates fall within the range of June 19 to June 29. Therefore, these games do not meet the date criteria specified in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince none of the games against the Athletics were played between June 19 and June 29, the Blue Jays did not sweep the Athletics during this period.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing the dates, opponents, and scores for games against the Athletics:\n\n- Row 7: Date \"june 8\", Opponent \"athletics\"\n- Row 8: Date \"june 9\", Opponent \"athletics\"\n- Row 9: Date \"june 10\", Opponent \"athletics\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the blue jays play the angel 5 times in June of 1979\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to evaluate several aspects:\n\n1. **Opponent Matches**: The claim concerns matches against the \"angels\". We need to count how many times the Blue Jays played against the Angels.\n\n2. **Date of Matches**: All matches should occur in June 1979 according to the claim. Hence, all relevant dates must fall within this month.\n\n3. **Total Count**: After identifying which games are played against the \"angels\" and confirming they are from June 1979, we need to count these instances.\n\nLet's analyze each row of the table for matches against the Angels:\n\n- Row index 3: opponent = \"angels\", date = june 4\n- Row index 4: opponent = \"angels\", date = june 5\n- Row index 5: opponent = \"angels\", date = june 6\n- Row index 12: opponent = \"angels\", date = june 13 (two games on the same day)\n- Row index 13: opponent = \"angels\", date = june 13\n- Row index 14: opponent = \"angels\", date = june 14\n\nFrom this examination, we find that there are indeed five matches against the Angels in June:\n\n1. June 4 (Row 3)\n2. June 5 (Row 4)\n3. June 6 (Row 5)\n4. June 13 (Row 12 and Row 13; two games on this date)\n5. June 14 (Row 14)\n\nAll these matches are confirmed to be in June, aligning with the claim that they occurred in \"June of 1979\" (although the year is not explicitly stated in the table, it's implied by context).\n\nThus, based on our analysis:\n\n- The Blue Jays play against the Angels five times.\n- All games occur within the month of June.\n\nThe relevant cells for these matches are the rows where the opponent is \"angels\" and the date is any day in June. These are:\n- Row 3: Columns 'date' and 'opponent'\n- Row 4: Columns 'date' and 'opponent'\n- Row 5: Columns 'date' and 'opponent'\n- Row 12: Columns 'date' and 'opponent'\n- Row 13: Columns 'date' and 'opponent'\n- Row 14: Columns 'date' and 'opponent'\n\nSince the row index for June 13 appears twice due to two matches on that day, both rows are relevant.\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
