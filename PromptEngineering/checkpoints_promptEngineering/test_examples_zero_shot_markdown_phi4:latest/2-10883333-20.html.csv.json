The actual difference is 11 goals.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For calculating score differences, we need the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" for all rows.\n- Specifically, for verifying the Junction Oval game, we look at Row 1's scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that there were 14,155 fewer people in attendance at the game held at VFL Park compared to the one at the MCG.\n\nLet's extract the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the row with the match at VFL Park:**\n   - In the table, we find the entry for the home team \"footscray\" against \"hawthorn\" at \"vfl park\".\n   - The crowd size for this game is 15,601.\n\n2. **Identify the row with the match at the MCG:**\n   - The entry for the home team \"richmond\" against \"carlton\" at \"mcg\".\n   - The crowd size for this game is 49,756.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in crowd sizes:**\n   - Difference = Crowd at MCG - Crowd at VFL Park\n   - Difference = 49,756 - 15,601 = 34,155\n\nThe claim states that there were 14,155 fewer people at the game at VFL Park than at the MCG. However, our calculation shows a difference of 34,155.\n\nSince the calculated difference (34,155) does not match the claimed difference (14,155), the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For VFL Park:\n  - Row index: 5\n  - Column name: \"crowd\"\n\n- For MCG:\n  - Row index: 4\n  - Column name: \"crowd\"\n\nThe JSON response reflecting our findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
