    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must evaluate it step-by-step:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"2 third of the judges appointed have more than 10 years to go until their mandatory retirement.\"\n\nThis implies that at least two-thirds (or approximately 66.67%) of the judges should have more than 10 years remaining until their mandatory retirement.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Count Total Number of Judges**:\n   The total number of rows in the table is 9, representing 9 judges.\n\n2. **Identify Judges with More Than 10 Years Remaining**:\n   We will look at the \"years until mandatory retirement\" column and count how many values are greater than 10.\n\n3. **Calculate Two-Thirds**:\n   Calculate two-thirds of the total number of judges: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = 6 \\). Thus, we need at least 6 judges to have more than 10 years remaining until their mandatory retirement for the claim to be true.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nLet's evaluate each judge based on \"years until mandatory retirement\":\n\n- **Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez**: 6 years (not > 10)\n- **Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda**: 11 years (> 10) - relevant\n- **Erick Kolthoff Caraballo**: 17 years (> 10) - relevant\n- **Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton**: 0 year (not > 10)\n- **Liana Fiol Matta**: 2 years (not > 10)\n- **Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez**: 27 years (> 10) - relevant\n- **Mildred Pab\u00f3n Char\u00f1eco**: 13 years (> 10) - relevant\n- **Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres**: 15 years (> 10) - relevant\n- **Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n**: 19 years (> 10) - relevant\n\nRelevant cells (judges with more than 10 years remaining):\n\n- Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda (Row 1)\n- Erick Kolthoff Caraballo (Row 2)\n- Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez (Row 6)\n- Mildred Pab\u00f3n Char\u00f1eco (Row 7)\n- Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres (Row 8)\n- Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n (Row 9)\n\nThere are 6 judges with more than 10 years remaining, which is equal to two-thirds of the total number of judges.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince exactly six judges have more than 10 years until their mandatory retirement, fulfilling the requirement that two-thirds or more do so, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
