The claim specifies goals with indices greater than 4. In this context, since indexing starts at 1 in the table:\n   - Goals with indices greater than 4 are those that start from index 5 onward.\n  \n2. Checking the table for any rows where \"goal\" is greater than 4:\n   - The only row available in the table beyond goal 4 is row 5 (indexing starts at 1).\n\n3. For row 5, we check the 'result' column to see if it matches \"3 - 1\":\n   - In row 5, the result is given as \"3 - 2\".\n\nThe claim states that for goals with an index larger than 4, the result should be \"3 - 1\". Since there is no goal with a result of \"3 - 1\" in the table beyond goal 4 (in fact, row 5 has a different result), the claim does not hold true.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for checking this are those in row 5 under both 'goal' and 'result'.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is adjusted to start from 0 in the JSON response (hence row index 4 represents row 5 in human terms).",
