Determine the earliest round in which a player from Central Florida was picked.\n\nLet's analyze the table step by step:\n\n- **Identify Players from Central Florida:**\n  - Look at the \"team\" column for entries that mention \"central florida\".\n  - We find one entry:\n    - Row index 2, Column \"player\": Kevin Smith\n    - Row index 2, Column \"team\": central florida\n\n- **Determine the Round:**\n  - Check the \"round\" column for the row where Kevin Smith is listed.\n  - From the relevant row (row index 2), we find:\n    - Row index 2, Column \"round\": 3\n\n- **Verify Earliest Round Condition:**\n  - The claim states that round 3 is the earliest round for a player from Central Florida to be picked.\n  - Since Kevin Smith from Central Florida was picked in round 3 and this is the only player from Central Florida listed, round 3 is indeed the earliest (and only) round.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 2, Column \"player\"\n- Row index 2, Column \"team\"\n- Row index 2, Column \"round\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
