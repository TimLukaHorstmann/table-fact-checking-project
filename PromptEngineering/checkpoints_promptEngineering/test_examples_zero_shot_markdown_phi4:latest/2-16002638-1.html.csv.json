    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the number of wins each season from 2003 to 2009 and check if they are all different.\n\nThe table provides us with the following information about the number of wins per season:\n\n- **2003**: 6 wins\n- **2004**: 6 wins\n- **2005**: 5 wins\n- **2006**: 3 wins\n- **2007**: 9 wins\n- **2008**: 5 wins\n- **2009**: 2 wins\n\nNow, let's compare the number of wins for each season:\n\n1. In 2003, there are 6 wins.\n2. In 2004, there are also 6 wins.\n3. In 2005, there are 5 wins.\n4. In 2006, there are 3 wins.\n5. In 2007, there are 9 wins.\n6. In 2008, there are again 5 wins.\n7. In 2009, there are 2 wins.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- The number of wins in 2003 (6) is the same as in 2004 (6).\n- The number of wins in 2005 (5) is the same as in 2008 (5).\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the dundee hurricane do not win the same number of games in any of the seasons they play between 2003 and 2009\" is FALSE because there are repeated numbers of wins across different years.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for checking this claim are those under the \"wins\" column for each season:\n\n- Row index 0, Column name: \"wins\"\n- Row index 1, Column name: \"wins\"\n- Row index 2, Column name: \"wins\"\n- Row index 3, Column name: \"wins\"\n- Row index 4, Column name: \"wins\"\n- Row index 5, Column name: \"wins\"\n- Row index 6, Column name: \"wins\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
