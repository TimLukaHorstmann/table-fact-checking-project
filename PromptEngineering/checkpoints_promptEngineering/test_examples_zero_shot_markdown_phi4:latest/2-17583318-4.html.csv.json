    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze it step by step against the data provided in the markdown table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \n\"When there be 10 appearances at UEFA and less than 4 at League Cup, the total number of appearances in the Premier be 44.\"\n\nThis can be broken down into conditions:\n1. Appearances in the UEFA cup should be exactly 10.\n2. Appearances in the League cup should be less than 4.\n3. If both conditions above are met, then check if the Premier league appearances total to 44.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Find rows where UEFA Cup is 10:**\n   - Michael Dawson has 10 appearances at UEFA.\n   - Pascal Chimbonda also has 10 appearances at UEFA.\n\n2. **Check League Cup condition for these rows (less than 4):**\n   - For Michael Dawson, League Cup appearances are 4 (not less than 4).\n   - For Pascal Chimbonda, League Cup appearances are 4 (also not less than 4).\n\nSince neither player meets both conditions simultaneously, there's no instance in the table where a player has 10 UEFA Cup appearances and fewer than 4 League Cup appearances. Therefore, we cannot verify if their Premier League appearances total to 44 because the initial conditions aren't met.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is not supported by any row in the table as none of them satisfy both criteria simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"uefa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"premier league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
