However, given that we are assessing the claim about Magdalena Maleeva, and assuming this dataset is specifically related to her career (as no other names or players are mentioned), we consider all matches listed.\n\n4. **Review Table Data:**\n   - We scan through the table for any entry where the \"surface\" column indicates a match was played on \"carpet\" or \"carpet (i)\".\n\n5. **Extract Relevant Entries:**\n   - From the table, two entries have surfaces as \"carpet (i)\":\n     1. Row index 11: Surface is \"carpet (i)\", opponent is Conchita Mart\u00ednez.\n     2. Row index 12: Surface is \"carpet (i)\", opponent is Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario.\n\n6. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The table shows exactly two matches played on a carpet surface for Magdalena Maleeva, confirming that she only played two matches on this type of court.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"Magdalena Maleeva's pro tennis career spanned 12 years, beginning in 1993 and ending in 2005,\" we need to examine the table for relevant data points related to Magdalena Maleeva's matches within these years.\n\nThe claim consists of three parts:\n1. The career began in 1993.\n2. The career ended in 2005.\n3. The duration was 12 years, which implies a span from 1993 through 2005 inclusive.\n\nLet's break down the table to verify each part:\n\n- **Part 1: Career Beginning in 1993**\n  - We need to find entries for Magdalena Maleeva starting from 1993.\n  - The first relevant entry is:\n    - Row Index: 2, Column Name: \"edition\", Date: July 19, 1993\n    - This matches the claim that her career began in 1993.\n\n- **Part 2: Career Ending in 2005**\n  - We need to find entries for Magdalena Maleeva up until 2005.\n  - The last relevant entry is:\n    - Row Index: 32, Column Name: \"edition\", Date: July 10, 2005\n    - This matches the claim that her career ended in 2005.\n\n- **Part 3: Duration of 12 Years**\n  - From the above findings, her career started on or before July 19, 1993, and ended on or after July 10, 2005.\n  - The span from 1993 to 2005 inclusive is indeed 13 calendar years, but if she only played in these specific tournament matches from start of 1993 to end of 2005, the pro career could be considered spanning roughly 12 competitive years.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are verified by the table data:\n- Her career began in 1993.\n- It ended in 2005.\n- The duration is approximately 12 years when considering the span from start of 1993 to end of 2005, despite being 13 calendar years.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the evidence in the table. Therefore, we conclude that the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"edition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"edition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify Matches for Magdalena Maleeva:**\n   - From the table, we look for entries labeled \"Europe / Africa Group I\" which are:\n     - 1998 (3 matches)\n     - 2002 (4 matches)\n     - 2003 (3 matches)\n     - 2005 (3 matches)\n\n**2.

Compare Match Counts:**\n   - The maximum number of matches played in any single edition from the table is 4, which occurred during the Europe/Africa group in 2002.\n   - No other individual edition has more than 4 matches.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"Magdalena Maleeva played more matches in the Europe/Africa Group than any other edition\" is true because she played 4 matches in the 2002 Europe/Africa Group, which is the highest number for any single edition listed.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant rows are those under the \"Europe / Africa group I\" column that list match counts:\n  - Row 15 (1998 Europe/Africa)\n  - Row 16 to 19 (2002 Europe/Africa)\n  - Row 20 to 22 (2003 Europe/Africa)\n  - Row 23 to 25 (2005 Europe/Africa)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Magdalena Maleeva's pro tennis career ended in 2003,\" we need to assess if the data in the table provides evidence supporting or refuting this statement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:** The claim specifies a year, 2003, as the end of Magdalena Maleeva's professional tennis career.\n2. **Table Examination:** We are looking for any records indicating matches involving Magdalena Maleeva after 2003 to refute the claim or confirming her last match was in 2003 to support it.\n\n- The table provides a series of tennis match results across various years, including data from 1991 to 2005.\n- Each row includes an \"edition,\" \"round,\" \"date,\" \"surface,\" \"opponent,\" and \"result.\"\n- We specifically need to look for any matches involving Magdalena Maleeva after the year 2003.\n\n**Relevant Observations:**\n- There is no direct mention of Magdalena Maleeva as an opponent in the table.\n- The table does include a match from April 23, 2005, which suggests tennis activity continued at least up to that date. However, this specific entry lists different opponents and players.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Since there are entries after 2003 (e.g., 2005) but no mention of Magdalena Maleeva in these records or any indication her career ended in 2003 based on the table data, we cannot verify that her career ended in 2003 from this information alone.\n- The relevant rows for examining matches post-2003 are:\n  - Row index 29: \"2005 europe / africa group i\" with \"jelena jankovi\u0107\"\n  - Row index 30: \"2005 europe / africa group i\" with \"anna smashnova\"\n  - Row index 31: \"2005 europe / africa group i\" with \"natalie grandin\"\n  - Row index 32: \"2005 europe / africa group i\" with \"zs\u00f3fia gubacsi\"\n  - Row index 33: \"2005 europe / africa group i\" with \"micha\u00eblla krajicek\"\n  - Row index 34 and 35: \"2005 world group ii play-offs\" post-2003\n\nNone of these rows involve Magdalena Maleeva, but their existence does not confirm her career's end in 2003.\n\nThus, the claim cannot be supported as TRUE based on this table alone.
