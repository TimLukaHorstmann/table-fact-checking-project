    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim into its components and verify each part against the table data.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **\"There be no defensive end pick\":** We need to check if there are any rows in the table where the `position` column contains \"defensive end\".\n\n2. **\"An overall smaller than 2\":** We need to ensure that there are no entries with an `overall` value less than 2.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Checking for Defensive End:**\n   - Scan through each row and look at the `position` column.\n   - Row index 1 (second row) has `position` as \"defensive end\" and `name` is \"tony brackens\". Therefore, there is a defensive end pick in the table.\n\n2. **Checking for Overall Less Than 2:**\n   - Scan through each row and look at the `overall` column.\n   - The smallest value in the `overall` column is 2, which occurs in rows indexed 0 (first row) where `name` is \"kevin hardy\".\n   - No values are less than 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There is a defensive end pick present in the table, so the first part of the claim (\"there be no defensive end pick\") is FALSE.\n- The second part of the claim is TRUE as there are no overall picks smaller than 2.\n\nSince one part of the claim is false, the entire claim is considered FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n1. **For Defensive End Check:**\n   - Row index 1, column \"position\" (defensive end).\n   - Row index 1, column \"overall\" (33) to show it exists and confirm its presence.\n   \n2. **For Overall Less Than 2 Check:**\n   - Row index 0, column \"overall\" (2) to confirm no value is less than 2.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
