    "resp": "```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe claim in question pertains to the purpose of the church as described by Vatican II's Gaudium et Spes, which is a document of Catholic social teaching. The claim states that according to this document, the church has only one purpose: that the kingdom of God may come and the salvation of the human race may be accomplished.\n\nTo determine whether this claim can be verified or refuted by the provided table:\n\n1. **Nature of the Claim**: The claim is a theological statement about the purpose of the church according to a specific document (Gaudium et Spes). It does not involve any numerical data, statistics, or measurable quantities that could be compared against the figures in the table.\n\n2. **Content of the Table**: The table provides statistical data related to populations and percentages of Catholics in various regions around the world. The columns include:\n   - `region`: Geographic region.\n   - `total population`: Total number of people in each region.\n   - `catholic`: Number of Catholics in each region.\n   - `% catholic`: Percentage of the total population that is Catholic in each region.\n   - `% of global catholic pop`: Percentage contribution to the global Catholic population.\n\n3. **Relevance**: The table contains no information about theological doctrines, church purposes, or interpretations from Vatican II's documents. It strictly deals with demographic data concerning Catholics globally and does not provide any insight into religious teachings or ecclesiastical intentions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the claim is about a doctrinal statement rather than statistical evidence, none of the cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim. The answer must be \"FALSE\" because the table cannot support or refute a theological assertion regarding church purpose as described by Gaudium et Spes.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object correctly reflects that the table does not contain any information pertinent to the claim, resulting in an empty list of relevant cells.",

They are considered successors of the Apostles in a spiritual sense, reflecting their role in maintaining the teachings and traditions of the church.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- The table provides statistical data about populations and percentages related to Catholicism across different regions:\n  - **Columns**: region, total population, catholic, % catholic, % of global catholic pop.\n  - This data is purely quantitative and focuses on demographics, not ecclesiastical structures or roles.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n1. The claim discusses the administrative roles within the Church (archbishops and bishops), which are not covered in any cell of this table.\n2. The concept of being a \"successor of the 12 apostles\" is theological rather than statistical and cannot be verified by the numerical data presented.\n\nGiven that none of the table's cells provide information about ecclesiastical roles or the spiritual succession mentioned in the claim, there are no relevant cells to verify this statement based on the provided table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the table does not contain any data related to ecclesiastical structures or theological concepts mentioned in the claim, it is impossible to verify the claim using the information given.
