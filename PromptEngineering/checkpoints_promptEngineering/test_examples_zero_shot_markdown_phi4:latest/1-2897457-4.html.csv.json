The relevant column for this task is \"nationality.\"\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We will examine each row corresponding to pick numbers 64 through 84.\n\n2. **Count Canadian Players**:\n   - Check the \"nationality\" column for entries labeled as \"Canada.\"\n   - Count these occurrences.\n\n3. **Count United States Players**:\n   - Similarly, check the \"nationality\" column for entries labeled as \"United States.\"\n   - Count these occurrences.\n\n4. **Compare Counts**: Compare the counts of Canadian players and United States players to verify if there are fewer Canadian players than U.S. players.\n\nLet's count:\n\n- **Canadian Players**:\n  - Row 65: Brent Grieve\n  - Row 69: Allain Roy\n  - Row 72: Reid Simpson\n  - Row 73: Jim Mckenzie\n  - Row 75: J F Quintin\n  - Row 76: Eric Dubois\n  - Row 77: Doug Macdonald\n  - Row 79: Todd Nelson\n  - Row 80: Jackson Penney\n  - Row 83: Andre Racicot\n\n  Total Canadian players = 10\n\n- **United States Players**:\n  - Row 64: Mark Brownschidle\n  - Row 66: Matt Martin\n  - Row 67: Jim Cummins\n  - Row 71: Brett Hauer\n  - Row 81: Jim Maher\n  - Row 82: Trent Klatt\n\n  Total U.S. players = 6\n\nNow, compare the counts:\n- Canadian players (10) > United States players (6)\n\nThe claim states there are fewer Canadian players than U.S. players.
