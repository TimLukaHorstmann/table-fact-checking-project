    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the segment c for Netflix s07e05 indeed shows as \"sandwich s cookie\". Here's how we can approach this task:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are looking at episode 14-05 in the table.\n   - The corresponding netflix series is s07e05.\n\n2. **Locate the Row:**\n   - From the table, locate the row where \"series ep\" is 14 - 05 and \"netflix\" is s07e05.\n   - This corresponds to the fifth row in the markdown table (indexing starts at zero).\n\n3. **Verify Segment C:**\n   - In the identified row (row index 4), we need to check the value in the \"segment c\" column.\n   - According to the table, for row index 4 (\"series ep\" = 14 - 05 and \"netflix\" = s07e05), the segment c is listed as \"sandwich s cookie\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The value of segment c matches exactly with what is claimed in the statement.\n\nThus, based on this verification process, the claim is true. The relevant cell for checking this information is found at row index 4 and column name \"segment c\". Here's how we present this in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"segment c\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
