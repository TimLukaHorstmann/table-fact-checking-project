    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to examine specific pieces of information from the provided table related to \"episode part four.\" The claim states two conditions: \n1. There were 10.6 million viewers for episode part four.\n2. Episode part four had a run time of 24:57.\n\nLet's break down these claims and find the relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Viewers (in millions) for Episode Part Four**: The claim specifies that there were 10.6 million viewers for this episode. In the table, we need to look at the \"viewers (in millions)\" column under the row labeled \"part four.\"\n\n2. **Run Time of Episode Part Four**: The claim mentions a run time of 24:57 for this episode. We should examine the \"run time\" column under the same row.\n\nNow, let's locate these cells in the table:\n- For \"viewers (in millions),\" we find that part four has 10.6 million viewers.\n- For \"run time,\" part four is listed with a duration of 24:57.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are met according to the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's how the relevant cells map out:\n- **Row index** for \"part four\" is 3 (since indexing typically starts from 0).\n- The column names corresponding to these checks are \"viewers (in millions)\" and \"run time.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
