This particular game had an attendance of 42,172 and it was indeed the highest among all games listed.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Check the Result Against St. Louis Cardinals:**\n   - Locate the row where the opponent is \"st louis cardinals.\"\n   - The table shows that in week 1, on September 21, 1975, the result against the St. Louis Cardinals was a loss (L) with a score of 23-20.\n   - This confirms the first part of the claim.\n\n2. **Check Attendance:**\n   - Confirm the attendance for this game is indeed 42,172.\n   - Review all attendance figures in the table to determine if 42,172 is the highest.\n     - Week 1: 42,172\n     - Week 2: 45,218\n     - Week 3: 29,444\n     - Week 4: 44,043\n     - Week 5: 64,843\n     - Week 6: 45,811\n     - Week 7: 49,342\n     - Week 8: 43,751\n     - Week 9: 44,595\n     - Week 10: 28,686\n     - Week 11: 50,860\n     - Week 12: 52,809\n     - Week 13: 38,501\n     - Week 14: 56,267\n\n   Upon reviewing the attendance figures, it is clear that the highest attendance recorded in the table is 64,843 (Week 5 against Los Angeles Rams), which is higher than 42,172.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that the game with an attendance of 42,172 was the one with the highest attendance, but upon verification, this is incorrect.
