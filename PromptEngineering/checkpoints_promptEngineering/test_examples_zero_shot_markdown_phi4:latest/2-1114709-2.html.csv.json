    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we must analyze whether \"Ligier Gitanes\" earned a total of 37 points in races during the year 1989 according to the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Rows Related to Ligier Gitanes:**\n   - We need to locate any rows where the team is named \"Ligier Gitanes.\"\n\n2. **Check Year and Points for Ligier Gitanes:**\n   - The claim specifies the year 1989, so we must look at that specific year.\n   - We also need to sum up the points attributed to \"Ligier Gitanes\" in 1989.\n\n3. **Verify Against Table Data:**\n\n   From the table:\n   - Rows with the team name containing \"ligier gitanes\":\n     - Row 11: Team = \"ligier gitanes\", Year = 1991, Points = 0\n     - Row 12: Team = \"ligier gitanes\", Year = 1991, Points = 0\n     - Row 13: Team = \"ligier gitanes blondes\" (not exactly \"ligier gitanes\"), Year = 1992, Points = 2\n\n   There are no rows for the year 1989 with \"Ligier Gitanes.\" Therefore, they did not earn any points in that year.\n\n4. **Determine if Ligier Gitanes Earned a Total of 37 Points:**\n   - Since there is no entry for Ligier Gitanes in 1989 and the total points for all related entries (1991 & 1992) sum to 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, it's clear they did not earn 37 points.\n\nThus, the claim \"ligier gitanes 2 time earn 37 point in race during 1989\" is FALSE.
