From the table:\n- Row 15 (\"Princess Party\") has \"elaine ko\" listed as the writer.\n\nNow that we've identified the row with Elaine Ko as the writer (Row 15), we need to check if Michael Spiller directed this episode:\n- The \"Directed By\" column for Row 15 lists \"Michael Spiller.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is true. Here's the relevant information:\n\n- Elaine Ko wrote the episode in Row 15.\n- Michael Spiller directed the same episode in Row 15.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object should be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
