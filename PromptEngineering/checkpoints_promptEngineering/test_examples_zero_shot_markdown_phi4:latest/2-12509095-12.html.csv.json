The match should have been played on a grass surface.\n2. The partner for that match should be Mardy Fish.\n\nLet's check each row of the table against these conditions:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - `outcome`: winner\n  - `date`: july 7, 2008\n  - `surface`: grass (matches condition 1)\n  - `partner`: mardy fish (matches condition 2)\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions.\n\n- **Other Rows:** \n  - All other rows either do not have the surface as \"grass\" or the partner is not \"Mardy Fish\".\n\nSince Row 0 meets both criteria, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell information for this verification includes:\n\n1. Surface from Row 0\n2.
