    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table and compare them with the statement made in the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"the biggest margin of victory come when everton defeat crystal palace 6 - 0.\"\n\nWe will verify this by following these steps:\n1. Identify all matches from the table where a team has won by a margin greater than or equal to six goals.\n2. Check if any match in the table shows Everton defeating Crystal Palace with a score of 6 - 0.\n3. Compare the margins of victory for all identified matches to confirm if this is indeed the biggest.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- Row 12: The match between Crystal Palace and Everton has a score of 0 - 6, indicating that Everton defeated Crystal Palace by six goals. This aligns with the claim.\n  \nNext, we need to check other rows for matches with victory margins greater than or equal to six goals:\n\n- Reviewing each row from the table:\n  - Rows with scores: \n    - Row 4: Blackburn Rovers vs Bristol Rovers (5 - 1), a margin of four goals.\n    - Row 12: Crystal Palace vs Everton (0 - 6), a margin of six goals.\n\nNo other match in the table has a victory margin greater than or equal to six goals. \n\nTherefore, the biggest margin of victory is indeed when Everton defeats Crystal Palace with a score of 6 - 0, which supports the claim.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row 12: columns \"home team\", \"score\", and \"away team\" since they contain the information about the match result between Crystal Palace and Everton.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify if Everton had a match with a 6-0 victory.\n2. Compare this margin of victory against all other matches listed in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Locate Everton's Match:**\n   - Scan through the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns for Everton's name.\n   - In row 12, Everton is listed as the home team with a score of 6-0 against Crystal Palace. This confirms a 6-0 victory by Everton.\n\n2. **Check if Tottenham Hotspur is involved in this match:**\n   - Verify the \"away team\" column for any mention of Tottenham Hotspur.\n   - In row 7, Tottenham Hotspur lost to West Bromwich Albion with a score of 1-0, not involving Everton.\n\n3. **Identify the Largest Margin of Victory:**\n   - Evaluate all matches in the table to find the one with the largest goal difference:\n     - Row 12 has Everton winning 6-0 (a margin of 6 goals).\n     - Other rows show smaller margins.\n   - The match involving Everton and Crystal Palace is indeed the one with the biggest margin of victory.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the largest margin of victory was when \"Everton defeat[ed] Tottenham Hotspur 6-0.\"\n   - While Everton did achieve a 6-0 win, it was against Crystal Palace, not Tottenham Hotspur.\n   - Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Everton's largest victory margin (6-0) was against Crystal Palace, not Tottenham Hotspur.
