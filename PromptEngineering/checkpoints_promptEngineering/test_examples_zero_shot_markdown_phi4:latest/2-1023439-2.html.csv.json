    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze each part of the statement in relation to the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entry**: \n   - The title \"Under the Influence\" appears only once in the table for the year 1986.\n   \n2. **Year Verification**:\n   - The claim mentions both years, 1985 and 1986. We need to verify if there is an entry for 1985 that corresponds with \"Under the Influence\". \n   - According to the table, \"Under the Influence\" appears only in the year 1986.\n\n3. **US Chart Position Verification**:\n   - For the year 1986, we see that \"Under the Influence\" has a US chart position of 56.\n   \n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim inaccurately includes the year 1985 for \"Under the Influence\", which is not present in the table for that year. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully true as it incorrectly states the title appeared on the chart in both 1985 and 1986.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of relevant cells:\n- The cell at row index 2 with column name \"year\" is checked to verify the year (1986) for \"Under the Influence\".\n- The cell at row index 2 with column name \"title\" confirms the title as \"Under the Influence\".\n- The cell at row index 2 with column name \"us\" verifies that the chart position in the US was indeed 56.",
