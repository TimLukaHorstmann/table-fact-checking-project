    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the entrant team lotus have 0 point for the year 1963,\" we need to verify two conditions in the table:\n\n1. The row where the year is 1963.\n2. In that specific row, check if the entrant is \"team lotus\" and the points are equal to 0.\n\nLet's analyze the table based on these conditions:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Find the row with the year 1963.\n  - The first row has `year = 1963`.\n\n- **Condition 2**: In this row, check if:\n  - The entrant is \"team lotus\".\n  - The points are equal to 0.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions for the relevant row:\n\n- **Row Index 0** (since indexing typically starts at 0 in programming contexts):\n  - `year = 1963` (matches the condition).\n  - `entrant = \"team lotus\"` (matches the condition).\n  - `points = 0` (matches the condition).\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from row index 0 in the columns \"year,\" \"entrant,\" and \"points.\"\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each year and check if Team Lotus earned less than 10 points in those years.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We need to examine the rows corresponding to different years where \"team lotus\" participated.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Each Year**:\n   - **1963**: The entry for this year shows that Team Lotus earned 0 points.\n   - **1964**: In this year, Team Lotus earned 11 points.\n   - **1966**: There are three entries for this year with different chassis and engines, but all show that Team Lotus earned 1 point.\n\n3. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The claim states: \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 point.\"\n   - We see that in 1963, they indeed had less than 10 points.\n   - In 1964, they had more than 10 points (11), which satisfies the condition of not being a year with less than 10 points.\n   - In 1966, they had only 1 point across all entries, which is less than 10. This contradicts the claim that 1963 was the \"only\" such year.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 1966 also has years where Team Lotus earned fewer than 10 points, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**: \n   - We need to check the 'year' and 'points' columns for each row that involves Team Lotus.\n   - Relevant cells are those with \"year\" as 1963, 1964, and all instances of 1966 along with their corresponding points.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
