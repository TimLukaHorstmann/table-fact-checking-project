    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we must analyze each part of the claim against the data provided in the markdown table.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n1. \"Skip Kendall, John Cook, Kenny Perry and Tiger Woods all tie for tenth place.\"\n2. They have a score of 278 each.\n3. They come in at 1 under par.\n\nNow let's check these parts against the table:\n\n### Part 1: Tenth Place\n- The table shows that Skip Kendall, Kenny Perry, and Tiger Woods are tied for 10th place with a score of 279, as indicated by the \"t10\" notation.\n- John Cook is in 9th place with a score of 278.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim about them all tying for tenth place is false. John Cook does not share the tie for tenth place.\n\n### Part 2: Score\n- Skip Kendall's score is 279 (72 + 68 + 68 + 71).\n- John Cook's score is 278 (71 + 68 + 70 + 69).\n- Kenny Perry's score is 279 (69 + 72 + 70 + 68).\n- Tiger Woods' score is 279 (66 + 72 + 70 + 71).\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim about them all having a score of 278 is false. Only John Cook has that score, while the others have a score of 279.\n\n### Part 3: Par\n- Skip Kendall's to par is 1.\n- John Cook's to par is 2.\n- Kenny Perry's to par is 1.\n- Tiger Woods' to par is 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim about coming in at 1 under par is partially true for Skip Kendall, Kenny Perry, and Tiger Woods but false for John Cook (who is 2 under par).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nFrom the analysis above, we need the relevant cells from the table that pertain to these findings:\n\n- **Row Index 9** (John Cook)\n  - Column: `place`\n  - Column: `score`\n  - Column: `to par`\n\n- **Row Index 10 and Row Index 11** (Skip Kendall and Kenny Perry)\n  - Column: `place`\n  - Column: `score`\n  - Column: `to par`\n\n- **Row Index 12** (Tiger Woods)\n  - Column: `place`\n  - Column: `score`\n  - Column: `to par`\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
