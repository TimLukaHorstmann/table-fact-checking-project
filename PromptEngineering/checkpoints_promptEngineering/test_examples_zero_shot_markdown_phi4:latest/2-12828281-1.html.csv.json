    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the game play on december 2 , 1963 be week 15,\" we need to verify two main conditions: \n\n1. Check if there is a game listed in the table for December 2, 1963.\n2. Determine whether such a game would correspond to week 15.\n\nLet's analyze these points:\n\n- The claim references \"december 2 , 1963,\" but all dates provided in the table are from September 13, 1964, through December 20, 1964. Hence, there is no entry for December 2, 1963.\n  \n- The table shows data for weeks 1 to 14, with no games listed beyond week 14 (December 6 and December 20, 1964). Therefore, even if a game were played on December 2, 1963, it would not be week 15 of this particular season as outlined in the table.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The date \"December 2, 1963\" does not appear in any row of the table.\n- Week 15 is not present or relevant to the listed games.\n\nThe claim cannot be true based on the provided data. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.
