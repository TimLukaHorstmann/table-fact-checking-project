This should appear in the \"result\" column.\n\n4. **Record after the Game**: The record is stated as \"1 - 3\". We need to verify this in the \"record\" column.\n\nLet's examine these conditions against the table:\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Opponent: New Orleans Saints\n  - Game Site: Louisiana Superdome\n  - Result: L 13 - 9 (Loss)\n  - Record: 1 - 3\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by row 4.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine several components from the table:\n\n1. **Location Check**: We need to verify if there's a game played at \"tampa stadium\" where the team loses against the \"new orleans saints\".\n2. **Result Check**: The result of this specific game must be a loss (\"L\").\n3. **Record Check**: After this game, the record should be \"1 - 3\".\n\nLet's go through each relevant condition:\n\n- **Location and Opponent**:\n  - Looking at the row for Week 4, we see that there is a game against the \"new orleans saints\" with the game site listed as \"louisiana superdome\", not \"tampa stadium\". Therefore, this particular game doesn't meet the location requirement.\n\n- **Record After Game**:\n  - The record after the Week 4 game (\"new orleans saints\") is indeed \"1 - 3\", which matches part of the claim.\n  \nSince the game against the \"new orleans saints\" did not occur at \"tampa stadium\", this means that the team never had a record of \"1 - 3\" in a losing game against the \"new orleans saints\" specifically at \"tampa stadium\".\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells to Verify:**\n\n- Week 4's entire row is relevant because it contains all necessary information regarding opponent, result, game site, and record. \n\nHere's the JSON representation of this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
