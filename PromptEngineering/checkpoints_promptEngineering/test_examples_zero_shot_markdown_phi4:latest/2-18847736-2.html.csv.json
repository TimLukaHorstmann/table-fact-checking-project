    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify two aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify the attendance for the game between the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets on September 30.\n2. Compare this attendance figure with all other games' attendances in the season to check if it's the highest.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Find the relevant game**: We look at the row where the date is \"sept 30\" and the opponent is \"new york jets.\" This corresponds to row index 5.\n  \n- **Check attendance for this game**: The attendance for this game (row 5) is recorded as 51,496.\n\n- **Compare with other games' attendances**:\n  - Row 1: 69,441\n  - Row 2: 56,233\n  - Row 3: 46,187\n  - Row 4: 66,011\n  - Row 5: 51,496 (New York Jets game)\n  - Row 6: 52,419\n  - Row 7: 45,597\n  - Row 8: 61,096\n  - Row 9: 47,741\n  - Row 10: 70,273\n  - Row 11: 50,193\n  - Row 12: 80,374\n  - Row 13: 38,016\n  - Row 14: 69,174\n  - Row 15: 78,087\n  - Row 16: 49,915\n\n- **Identify the highest attendance**: The highest attendance is in row 12 with 80,374 attendees for the game against Cleveland Browns.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since the attendance for the September 30 game (51,496) is not the highest compared to other games' attendances, particularly the 80,374 in row 12, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant cells** include all attendance figures and specifically the cell for the New York Jets game on September 30:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
