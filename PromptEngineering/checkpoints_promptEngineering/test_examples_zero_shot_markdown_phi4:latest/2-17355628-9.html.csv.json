    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the Oklahoma City Thunder defeat the San Antonio Spurs 2 times in March of 2009,\" we need to check two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The matches between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs.\n2. The outcomes of those matches, specifically checking for victories.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n- **Identify relevant games:**\n  - We look for entries where \"team\" is either \"san antonio\" or \"oklahoma city thunder.\" Since all games are from Oklahoma City Thunder's perspective, we only need to check the \"team\" column for \"san antonio.\"\n  \n- **Check dates:**\n  - Ensure that these games occurred in March 2009. The \"date\" column provides this information.\n\n- **Determine outcomes:**\n  - Check if the game was a win (\"w\") or a loss (\"l\"). We need wins against San Antonio Spurs.\n\n### Relevant Rows:\n\n1. **Row 67:**\n   - Date: March 16\n   - Team: san antonio\n   - Outcome: w (win)\n   - Record: 19 - 48\n\n2. **Row 74:**\n   - Date: March 31\n   - Team: san antonio\n   - Outcome: w (win)\n   - Record: 21 - 53\n\nBoth rows confirm that the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the San Antonio Spurs twice in March 2009.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the Oklahoma City Thunder break 100 point 5 times during March,\" we need to check the table for games played in March where the team scored more than 100 points.\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns**: The column \"score\" contains the scores of the games, which is essential for determining if the team scored over 100 points.\n\n2. **Check each row**:\n   - Row 60: Score = 96 (not > 100)\n   - Row 61: Score = 88 (not > 100)\n   - Row 62: Score = 90 (not > 100)\n   - Row 63: Score = 89 (not > 100)\n   - Row 64: Score = 99 (not > 100)\n   - Row 66: Score = 95 (not > 100)\n   - Row 67: Score = 78 (not > 100)\n   - Row 68: Score = 96 (not > 100)\n   - Row 70: Score = 97 (not > 100)\n   - Row 71: Score = 89 (not > 100)\n   - Row 72: Score = 96 (not > 100)\n   - Row 73: Score = 84 (not > 100)\n   - Row 74: Score = 96 (not > 100)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The Oklahoma City Thunder did not score more than 100 points in any game during March.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 74, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
