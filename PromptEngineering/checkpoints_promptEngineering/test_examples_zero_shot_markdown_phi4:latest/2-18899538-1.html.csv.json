Check the Relevant Column:\n   - We are interested in the \"os x\" column, which describes whether each software supports OS X.\n   - In the table, the value under the \"os x\" column for \"home media center\" is \"no.\"\n\n3. Determine if the Claim is True or False:\n   - The claim states that \"the home media center have no o x,\" which means the entry should be \"no\" in the \"os x\" column.\n   - Since the value is indeed \"no,\" the claim is supported by the data.\n\n4. List Relevant Cells:\n   - We only need to reference one cell to verify this claim, specifically where the row index is 9 (for \"home media center\") and the column name is \"os x.\"\n\nBased on these observations, we can conclude that the claim is true. The relevant cells in JSON format are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"os x\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
