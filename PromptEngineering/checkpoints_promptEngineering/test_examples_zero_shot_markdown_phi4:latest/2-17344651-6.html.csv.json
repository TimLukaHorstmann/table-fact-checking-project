The Knicks did not win any of their home games against Boston based on this data.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
