It reads \"baby buggy bunny\", which matches the claim.\n\n- **Verify the director for this specific date:**\n  - Next, in the same row, we check the 'director' column to find \"charles m jones\". The claim states it should be \"i freleng\", but here it's different.\n\nSince one part of the condition is not met (the director is not \"i freleng\" as claimed), the entire statement is false. \n\nNow, let\u2019s identify and list these relevant cells:\n\n1.
