Let's identify the relevant cells for this determination:\n\n- For \"2 of the championship have a hard surface\":\n  - Check all rows where \"surface\" is listed:\n    - Row index 0: Surface is \"hard\".\n    - Row index 1: Surface is \"hard\".\n    - Row index 3: Surface is \"hard\".\n    - Row index 4: Surface is \"hard\".\n\n- For \"...but the 1998 Rome championship have a clay surface\":\n  - Check row for any mention of \"1998\" and \"Rome\", which does not exist.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are those that list surfaces:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
