    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the jim beam race team do 5 lap on 1 time occasion\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for entries related to the Jim Beam Racing team and check if there was an instance where a driver completed exactly 5 laps fewer than the total number of laps (78).\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n1. Identify rows associated with the \"Jim Beam Racing\" team:\n   - **Jason Richards**: Laps = 76, Grid = 13\n   - **Will Davison**: Laps = 5, Grid = 7\n\n2. Calculate laps behind for each driver from Jim Beam Racing:\n   - Jason Richards: 78 - 76 = 2 laps behind (not relevant to the claim)\n   - Will Davison: 78 - 5 = 73 laps behind (relevant since this is more than 5 laps, but we need exactly 5)\n\n3. Check if any driver from Jim Beam Racing completed exactly 5 fewer laps than the total:\n   - Neither Jason Richards nor Will Davison completed exactly 5 laps fewer than the total of 78.\n\nBased on this analysis, there was no instance where a Jim Beam Racing team member completed exactly 5 laps behind the total number of laps. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Row index 7 (Jason Richards): Laps = 76\n- Row index 14 (Will Davison): Laps = 5\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim implies checking whether Jamie Whincup ever started a race from the fourth position on the grid.\n\nLet's examine the relevant part of the table:\n\n- **Jamie Whincup** appears only once in this specific table instance with these details:\n  - Name: jamie whincup\n  - Team: team vodafone\n  - Laps: 78\n  - Time/Retired: 2:11:45.5992\n  - Grid: 1\n\nFrom the table, we see that Jamie Whincup's grid position in this instance is 1. There are no other entries for Jamie Whincup to check if he ever started from a different position. Thus, based on the provided data, his highest recorded starting position (grid) is 1.\n\nThe claim states his \"highest grid be 4,\" which implies that at some point, he started in the fourth position or better. Since we only have data for him starting from position 1 and no record of him starting from position 4, the claim is false based on this table's information.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify:\n\n- The cell containing Jamie Whincup's grid position: row index 0 (since he is the first entry) in the \"grid\" column.\n  \nThe JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
