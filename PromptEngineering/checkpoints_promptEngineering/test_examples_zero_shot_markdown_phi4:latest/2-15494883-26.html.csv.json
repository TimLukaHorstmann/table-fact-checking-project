    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"none of the airports on the list have seen a decrease in use\" is true or false, we need to focus specifically on the \"annual change\" column within the table provided.\n\nThe \"annual change\" column indicates the percentage change in passenger numbers compared to the previous period. If any value in this column were negative, it would indicate a decrease in the number of passengers, which would contradict the claim.\n\nLet's examine each entry under the \"annual change\" column:\n\n1. **Rank 1 - S\u00e3o Paulo**: 12.8%\n2. **Rank 2 - S\u00e3o Paulo**: 11.7%\n3. **Rank 3 - Bras\u00edlia**: 45.1%\n4. **Rank 4 - Rio de Janeiro**: 30.4%\n5. **Rank 5 - Rio de Janeiro**: 9.2%\n6. **Rank 6 - Salvador**: 20.0%\n7. **Rank 7 - Porto Alegre**: 11.6%\n8. **Rank 8 - Belo Horizonte**: 7.5%\n9. **Rank 9 - Recife**: 16.1%\n10. **Rank 10 - Curitiba**: 13.0%\n11. **Rank 11 - Fortaleza**: 24.0%\n12. **Rank 12 - Florian\u00f3polis**: 7.8%\n13. **Rank 13 - Manaus**: 10.3%\n14. **Rank 14 - Bel\u00e9m**: 13.5%\n15. **Rank 15 - Vit\u00f3ria**: 6.1%\n\nAll values in the \"annual change\" column are positive, indicating an increase in passenger numbers for each listed location.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"all of the airports on the list have seen a decrease in use,\" we need to examine the \"capacity in use\" column for each airport listed in the table. The claim suggests that all values in this column should represent a decrease, which would mean they should be less than 100%. A value over 100% indicates an increase or full capacity usage exceeding the expected baseline.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data:\n\n- S\u00e3o Paulo (Rank 1): Capacity in use = 113.4%\n- S\u00e3o Paulo (Rank 2): Capacity in use = 78.4%\n- Bras\u00edlia (Rank 3): Capacity in use = 134.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro (Rank 4): Capacity in use = 40.2%\n- Rio de Janeiro (Rank 5): Capacity in use = 152.7%\n- Salvador (Rank 6): Capacity in use = 69.1%\n- Porto Alegre (Rank 7): Capacity in use = 52.7%\n- Belo Horizonte (Rank 8): Capacity in use = 213.0%\n- Recife (Rank 9): Capacity in use = 63.5%\n- Curitiba (Rank 10): Capacity in use = 81.2%\n- Fortaleza (Rank 11): Capacity in use = 77.3%\n- Florian\u00f3polis (Rank 12): Capacity in use = 125.7%\n- Manaus (Rank 13): Capacity in use = 75.4%\n- Bel\u00e9m (Rank 14): Capacity in use = 49.3%\n- Vit\u00f3ria (Rank 15): Capacity in use = 222.5%\n\nThe claim is only true if all entries are below 100%. However, we can identify several airports where the capacity in use exceeds 100%, indicating an increase:\n\n- S\u00e3o Paulo (Rank 1) with 113.4%\n- Bras\u00edlia (Rank 3) with 134.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro (Rank 5) with 152.7%\n- Belo Horizonte (Rank 8) with 213.0%\n- Florian\u00f3polis (Rank 12) with 125.7%\n- Vit\u00f3ria (Rank 15) with 222.5%\n\nSince there are multiple instances where the capacity in use is greater than 100%, it means not all airports have seen a decrease in use.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.
