We look for the entry where this value is 41, as it represents the 15th episode based on the counting pattern (27-28, 29, etc.).\n\n2. **Check if It Belongs to the Third Season:**\n   - The column for seasons is titled \"no in season\". For the third season, we expect episodes numbered from 21 onwards (1-12 for the first season, 13-24 for the second season). Thus, episode number 41 should be part of the third season.\n\n3. **Verify Production Code:**\n   - The column for production codes is titled \"production code\". We need to check if this entry has a value of 315 for episode number 41.\n\n**Relevant Data Extraction from the Table:**\n\n- From the table, we find:\n  - Row with `no in series` = 41\n  - In that row, `no in season` = 15 (indicating it is part of the third season)\n  - The `production code` for this entry is indeed 315\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data as the 15th episode in the third season does have a production code of 615.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index 12 corresponds to the entry for episode number 41.",
