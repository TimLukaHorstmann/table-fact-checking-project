We need to locate this row in the table.\n\n2. **Check the Competition:**\n   - The competition specified is \"Super League XII\". Ensure that this matches the competition listed in the identified row.\n\n3. **Verify the Score:**\n   - Check if the score for the game on this date and under this competition is indeed \"52 - 22\".\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n- **Locate Row with Date \"15 / 04 / 07\":**  \n  We scan through the table to find the row where the date matches \"15 / 04 / 07\". This corresponds to row index 11.\n\n- **Check Competition in this Row:**\n  - The competition listed for row index 11 is \"Super League XII\", which aligns with the claim.\n\n- **Verify the Score:**\n  - The score for the game on this date and under this competition is indeed \"52 - 22\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe conditions of the claim are fully supported by the table data.
