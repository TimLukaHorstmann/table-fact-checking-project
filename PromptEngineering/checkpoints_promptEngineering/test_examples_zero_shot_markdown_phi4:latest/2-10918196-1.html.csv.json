The opponent column helps us verify this since all listed teams are those that the New York Jets faced.\n\nNext, count the number of wins and losses:\n- Wins ('w') and losses ('l') are indicated in the result column.\n  \nCounting from the table:\n\n1. **Week 1:** Loss to Denver Broncos (L)\n2. **Week 2:** Win against Miami Dolphins (W)\n3. **Week 4:** Win against New England Patriots (W)\n4. **Week 5:** Loss to Philadelphia Eagles (L)\n5. **Week 6:** Loss to Los Angeles Raiders (L)\n6. **Week 8:** Loss to Buffalo Bills (L)\n7. **Week 9:** Win against New York Giants (W)\n8. **Week 10:** Win against Miami Dolphins (W)\n9. **Week 11:** Win against Indianapolis Colts (W)\n10. **Week 12:** Win against Cincinnati Bengals (W)\n11. **Week 13:** Win against New England Patriots (W)\n12. **Week 14:** Loss to Indianapolis Colts (L)\n13. **Week 15:** Win against Washington Redskins (W)\n14. **Week 16:** Loss to Dallas Cowboys (L)\n15. **Week 17:** Loss to Buffalo Bills (L)\n16. **Week 18:** Loss to Houston Oilers (L)\n\nNow, calculate the totals:\n- Wins: 8\n- Losses: 8\n\nThe claim states that the New York Jets took 3 more wins than losses during the season.
