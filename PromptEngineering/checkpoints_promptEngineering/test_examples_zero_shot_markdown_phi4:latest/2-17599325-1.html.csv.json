    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be 1 race during 3 month, january, july and october,\" we need to analyze the table for races occurring in January, July, and October.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **January:**\n   - Check the \"date\" column for entries starting with \"january.\"\n   - Row 0: \"27 january\" indicates a race took place in January.\n   - Thus, there is 1 race in January.\n\n2. **July:**\n   - Check the \"date\" column for entries starting with \"july.\"\n   - No row has a date starting with \"july.\"\n   - Therefore, there are no races in July.\n\n3. **October:**\n   - Check the \"date\" column for entries starting with \"october.\"\n   - Row 7: \"23 october\" indicates a race took place in October.\n   - Thus, there is 1 race in October.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There is 1 race in January and 1 race in October. However, there are no races in July. The claim states that there should be exactly 1 race each in January, July, and October.\n\nSince the condition for July is not met (0 races instead of 1), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For January: Row 0, \"date\" column.\n- For October: Row 7, \"date\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check for instances where a driver won more than one race on the same circuit.\n\nThe claim states: \"the only driver to win both races on the same circuit be Lex Davison.\"\n\n1. Identify any circuits where multiple races are held:\n   - **Lowood Circuit**: \n     - 15 June, Queensland Road Racing Championship, Winner: Alec Mildren\n     - 31 August, Lowood Trophy, Winner: Alec Mildren\n\n2. Verify if Lex Davison won more than one race on the same circuit:\n   - Lex Davison is listed as a winner only once in the table for the Australian Grand Prix at Mount Panorama Circuit.\n\n3. Conclusion:\n   - Alec Mildren won two races on Lowood Circuit.\n   - Lex Davison did not win any multiple races on the same circuit.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Alec Mildren, not Lex Davison, is the driver who won both races on the same circuit (Lowood Circuit).\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- For the first race at Lowood Circuit: Row 4, Column \"winner\"\n- For the second race at Lowood Circuit: Row 5, Column \"winner\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
