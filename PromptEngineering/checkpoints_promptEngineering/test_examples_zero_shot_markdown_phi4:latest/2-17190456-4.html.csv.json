We need to check the \"points\" column in row index 12, which shows 20 points, matching the claim.\n\nThe score part of the claim is incorrect because it states that St. Louis scored 3 and Pittsburgh scored 2, whereas the table shows the opposite (Pittsburgh 2, St. Louis 3).\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 12, column \"date\" for date verification.\n- Row index 12, column \"score\" for score verification.\n- Row index 12, column \"points\" for points accumulation verification.\n\nSince the score part of the claim is incorrect, the overall claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, this condition fails.\n\n3. **Attendance Check:**\n   - The claim mentions an attendance of \"5307.\"\n   - For December 21 (row index 9), under column 'attendance,' it indeed shows 5307, satisfying this part of the claim.\n\n4. **Points Accumulated Check:**\n   - The claim states that Pittsburgh had accumulated \"18 points\" on this date.\n   - In row index 9, under column 'points,' it shows \"18,\" which matches the claim.\n\nSince one condition (Pittsburgh hosting Minnesota) is incorrect, the entire claim is false. Now, let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- **Row Index:** 9\n- **Column Names:**\n  - \"date\" to confirm the date.\n  - \"home\" to check if Pittsburgh was the home team or visitor.\n  - \"attendance\" to verify the crowd size.\n  - \"points\" to confirm the points accumulated.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
