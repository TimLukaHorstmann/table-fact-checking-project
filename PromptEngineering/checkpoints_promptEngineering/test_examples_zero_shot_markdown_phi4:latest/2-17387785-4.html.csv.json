    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Andy Tate being the shortest player on Bradford Bulls is true or false, we need to examine the relevant columns from the table: \"player,\" \"position,\" and \"weight & height\" for all players who were previously at Bradford Bulls.\n\nFirst, let's list out each player along with their height if they are associated with the previous club \"bradford bulls\":\n\n1. **Sam Burgess**: 6 ft 4 in\n2. **Craig Kopczak**: 6 ft 4 in\n3. **Matt James**: 6 ft 3 in\n4. **Steve Crossley**: 6 ft 2 in\n5. **Julien Rinaldi**: 5 ft (no inches specified, but given as \"13 st\" and the context suggests short stature)\n6. **Andy Tate**: 6 ft 3 in\n7. **Tom Olbison**: 6 ft 1 in\n8. **Elliott Whitehead**: 6 ft\n9. **James Donaldson**: 5 ft 10 in\n10. **Duane Straughheir**: 6 ft\n\nThe claim states that Andy Tate is the shortest player from Bradford Bulls. To verify this, we need to compare his height of \"6 ft 3 in\" with all players from Bradford Bulls:\n\n- Julien Rinaldi is listed as 5 ft, making him shorter than Andy Tate.\n- James Donaldson is 5 ft 10 in, which is also shorter than Andy Tate.\n\nSince Julien Rinaldi and James Donaldson are both shorter than Andy Tate, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for these players:\n\n- Andy Tate: \"player\" at row index 24, \"weight & height\" at column name.\n- Julien Rinaldi: \"player\" at row index 16, \"weight & height\" at column name.\n- James Donaldson: \"player\" at row index 29, \"weight & height\" at column name.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"weight & height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"weight & height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"weight & height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
