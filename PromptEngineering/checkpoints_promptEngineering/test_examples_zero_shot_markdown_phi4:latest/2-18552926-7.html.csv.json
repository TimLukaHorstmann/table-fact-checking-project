    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"David Duchovny was nominated for best actor in leading role - drama series every other year\" is true or false, we need to check each relevant row from the table and verify David Duchovny's nomination status in those years.\n\n### Relevant Data Extraction:\n\n1. **1995**: \n   - Category: Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series\n   - Recipient/ Nominee: David Duchovny\n   - Result: Nominated\n\n2. **1996**:\n   - Category: Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series\n   - Recipient/Nominee: David Duchovny\n   - Result: Won (not nominated)\n\n3. **1997**:\n   - Category: Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series\n   - Recipient/ Nominee: David Duchovny\n   - Result: Nominated\n\n4. **1998**:\n   - Category: Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series\n   - Recipient/Nominee: David Duchovny\n   - Result: Nominated\n\n### Verification:\n\n- 1995: Nominated\n- 1996: Not nominated (won instead)\n- 1997: Nominated\n- 1998: Nominated\n\nThe claim suggests that David Duchovny should be nominated every other year. Let's break this down by the years mentioned in the table:\n\n- **1994**: No nomination data for 1994, so we start from 1995.\n- **1995 (odd year)**: Nominated\n- **1996 (even year)**: Not nominated (won instead)\n- **1997 (odd year)**: Nominated\n- **1998 (even year)**: Nominated\n\nAccording to the claim, he should be nominated in every other year starting from 1995. This means:\n\n- 1995: Should be nominated (TRUE)\n- 1996: Should not be nominated (TRUE)\n- 1997: Should be nominated (TRUE)\n- 1998: Should not be nominated (FALSE)\n\nSince the pattern breaks at 1998, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those related to \"Best Actor in Leading Role - Drama Series\" for the years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.
