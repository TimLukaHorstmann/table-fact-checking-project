The \"score\" for the September 1st game should be \"3 - 0\" indicating a win.\n2. The \"attendance\" for this game should be \"19196.\"\n\nLet's examine these details step by step using the provided table:\n\n- **Row Index**: Identify the row corresponding to September 1st. In the markdown table, rows are typically zero-indexed when considered programmatically. So, September 1st corresponds to the first row (index 0).\n\n- **Score Verification**:\n  - Look at the \"score\" column for this row.\n  - The cell contains \"3 - 0,\" which confirms a win as stated in the claim.\n\n- **Attendance Verification**:\n  - Check the \"attendance\" column for this row.\n  - The cell shows \"19196,\" matching the claim's attendance figure.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, and thus the entire claim is true. \n\nNow, let's construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object correctly identifies that both relevant conditions in the claim are true and specifies the cells from which these details were verified.",

This discrepancy indicates a factual inaccuracy.\n\nGiven these checks:\n\n- Date and opponent match.\n- The score matches as well, confirming it was indeed an 8 - 1 win against the Yankees.\n- However, the attendance figure provided in the claim is incorrect; it should be 23380, not 3380.\n\nDue to this discrepancy regarding the attendance number, the claim cannot be considered fully true.

We'll extract the runs from this column for all games in September.\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Runs**:\n   - For each row, split the score string into two parts (home and away scores).\n   - Sum these two numbers to get the total combined runs for that game.\n\n3. **Compare Combined Runs**:\n   - Calculate the combined runs for the game on September 1st.\n   - Compare this value with the combined runs of all other games in September to check if it is indeed the lowest.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- **September 1**: Score = \"3 - 0\", Combined Runs = 3 + 0 = 3\n- **September 2**: Score = \"8 - 5\", Combined Runs = 8 + 5 = 13\n- **September 3**: Score = \"4 - 2\", Combined Runs = 4 + 2 = 6\n- **September 4**: Score = \"6 - 2\", Combined Runs = 6 + 2 = 8\n- **September 5**: Score = \"5 - 1\", Combined Runs = 5 + 1 = 6\n- **September 6**: Score = \"2 - 1\", Combined Runs = 2 + 1 = 3\n- **September 7**: Score = \"4 - 0\", Combined Runs = 4 + 0 = 4\n- **September 8**: Score = \"12 - 10\", Combined Runs = 12 + 10 = 22\n- **September 9**: Score = \"2 - 0\", Combined Runs = 2 + 0 = 2\n- **September 10**: Score = \"3 - 2\", Combined Runs = 3 + 2 = 5\n- **September 11**: Score = \"8 - 7\", Combined Runs = 8 + 7 = 15\n- **September 12**: Score = \"7 - 3\", Combined Runs = 7 + 3 = 10\n- **September 13**: Score = \"6 - 3\", Combined Runs = 6 + 3 = 9\n- **September 14**: Score = \"3 - 2\", Combined Runs = 3 + 2 = 5\n- **September 15**: Score = \"7 - 3\", Combined Runs = 7 + 3 = 10\n- **September 17**: Score = \"4 - 3\", Combined Runs = 4 + 3 = 7\n- **September 18**: Score = \"3 - 2\", Combined Runs = 3 + 2 = 5\n- **September 19**: Score = \"3 - 0\", Combined Runs = 3 + 0 = 3\n- **September 20**: Score = \"4 - 3 (11)\", Combined Runs = 4 + 3 = 7 (ignoring extra innings)\n- **September 21**: Score = \"5 - 4 (10)\", Combined Runs = 5 + 4 = 9 (ignoring extra innings)\n- **September 22**: Score = \"8 - 1\", Combined Runs = 8 + 1 = 9\n- **September 23**: Score = \"3 - 2\", Combined Runs = 3 + 2 = 5\n- **September 24**: Score = \"12 - 5\", Combined Runs = 12 + 5 = 17\n- **September 25**: Score = \"3 - 2\", Combined Runs = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe game on September 1st had a combined total of 3 runs. However, both the games on September 6th and September 19th also had a combined total of 3 runs. Therefore, the claim that the combined run on September 1st was the lowest is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Check if any of these rows have a score with 12 runs.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- The table does not list any row where the opponent is \"Blue Jays.\" Therefore, there are no scores listed against them.\n- Consequently, since there is no record of the Blue Jays being an opponent, we cannot verify if they scored 12 runs in any game during September from this table.\n\nBased on the information provided:\n\n- The claim states that the Blue Jays scored 12 runs once during September. However, without any data listing games against them, we cannot confirm or deny such a score for the Blue Jays.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by the data available in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells would be all cells under the \"opponent\" column where they might have been listed as \"Blue Jays,\" but since none exist:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
