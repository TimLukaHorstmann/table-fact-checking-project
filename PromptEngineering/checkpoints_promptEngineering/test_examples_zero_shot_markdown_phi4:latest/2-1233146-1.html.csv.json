    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"in 2003 at the uefa intertoto cup the first and second round were tied in the first leg,\" we need to check the table for entries from the year 2003 under the competition named \"uefa intertoto cup.\" We specifically look for results labeled as ties (i.e., matches with a score of '1 - 1' or similar) during both the first and second rounds.\n\nHere's how we break it down:\n\n1. **Identify relevant entries from 2003** under the competition \"uefa intertoto cup\":\n   - The table shows two such entries:\n     - First round against \"altay sk\" with a score of '1 - 3'.\n     - Second round against \"fc slovan liberec\" with a score of '0 - 2'.\n\n2. **Verify if these results are ties** in the first leg:\n   - The first round result ('1 - 3') is not a tie.\n   - The second round result ('0 - 2') is also not a tie.\n\nSince neither match from 2003 during the \"uefa intertoto cup\" resulted in a tie, we can conclude that the claim is false. \n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells for verification:\n- **Row Index 17**: \"first round\", score '1 - 3'\n- **Row Index 18**: \"second round\", score '0 - 2'\n\nThe JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
