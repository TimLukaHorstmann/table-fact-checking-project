Based on the table:\n- The move actually occurred between the end of the \"2000 - 01\" season and the beginning of the \"2001 - 02\" season, which corresponds to the years 2001.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the actual move happened earlier than stated in the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells are those indicating the team names and seasons around the transition:\n\n- Row index 0: Indicates \"vancouver grizzlies.\"\n- Rows index 5 and 6: Cover the last season for Vancouver (\"2000 - 01\") and the first season for Memphis (\"2001 - 02\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the Grizzlies' best win percentage in the 2012-2013 season, we need to examine the relevant data from the table, focusing specifically on the \"win%\" column. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The claim mentions a win percentage (610), so the relevant column is \"win%\".\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Win Percentage**:\n   - For each season listed in the table, check the value under the \"win%\" column.\n   \n3. **Compare the Values**:\n   - Find the highest value recorded under the \"win%\" column across all seasons.\n\n4. **Check Specific Claim Details**:\n   - The claim states that the best win percentage was 610 during the 2012-2013 season. We need to verify if this is indeed the maximum and occurs in that specific season.\n\n5. **Data Extraction**:\n   - From the table, we extract the following relevant values from the \"win%\" column:\n     - 1995 - 96: 183\n     - 1996 - 97: 171\n     - 1997 - 98: 232\n     - 1998 - 99: 160\n     - 1999 - 00: 268\n     - 2000 - 01: 280\n     - 2001 - 02: 280\n     - 2002 - 03: 341\n     - 2003 - 04: 610 (Memphis Grizzlies)\n     - 2004 - 05: 549\n     - 2005 - 06: 598\n     - 2006 - 07: 268\n     - 2007 - 08: 268\n     - 2008 - 09: 293\n     - 2009 - 10: 488\n     - 2010 - 11: 561\n     - 2011 - 12: 621\n     - 2012 - 13: 683\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The highest win percentage in the table is 683, which occurs during the 2012-2013 season.\n   - The win percentage of 610 occurred in the 2003-04 season.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that the best win percentage was 610 in the 2012-2013 season is incorrect because the highest win percentage (683) was actually achieved in the 2012-2013 season, not 610.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".
