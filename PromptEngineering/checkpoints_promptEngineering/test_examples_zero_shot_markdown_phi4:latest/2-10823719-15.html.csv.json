    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided, let's break down each component of the claim and verify it against the relevant columns in the markdown table.\n\nThe claim states:\n\"Richmond's play against the away team Geelong to a crowd of 20777 at the Western Oval on July 14, 1979.\"\n\n1. **Teams Involved:**\n   - The claim mentions Richmond playing against the away team Geelong.\n   - From the table, we see that in row with index 4:\n     - Home team is \"hawthorn\" and away team is \"geelong\".\n     - In row with index 5:\n       - Home team is \"richmond\" and away team is \"fitzroy\".\n   - Therefore, Richmond did not play against Geelong.\n\n2. **Crowd Size:**\n   - The claim mentions a crowd size of 20,777.\n   - From the table, we see that in row with index 4:\n     - Crowd = 20,777\n   - However, this corresponds to the game between Hawthorn and Geelong, not Richmond.\n\n3. **Venue:**\n   - The claim states the venue is \"Western Oval\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Western Oval hosts the match in row with index 1 (Footscray vs. St Kilda).\n   - No match was played at Western Oval on July 14 between Richmond and Geelong.\n\n4. **Date:**\n   - The claim mentions the date as \"July 14, 1979\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Games on July 14 are in rows with index 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n     - The game involving Richmond is on July 15 (row index 5).\n\nSince none of the conditions match (Richmond did not play against Geelong; the crowd size does not correspond to a Richmond vs. Geelong match at Western Oval on July 14), the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for checking these aspects are:\n\n- \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns from rows with index 4 and 5.\n- \"crowd\" column from row with index 4.\n- \"venue\" column from row with index 1.\n- \"date\" column from row with index 5.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
