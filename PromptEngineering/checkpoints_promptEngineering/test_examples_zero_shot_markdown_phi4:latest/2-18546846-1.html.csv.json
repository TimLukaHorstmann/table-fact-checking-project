    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the team (in this case, it seems to be referring to a team named \"49ers\" although they aren't explicitly mentioned in the table) played against the Los Angeles Dons exactly once during the 1947 season according to the given table.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify the Column**: We are interested in the \"opponent\" column since it lists which teams were played against.\n2. **Search for 'Los Angeles Dons'**:\n   - Look through each row in the \"opponent\" column to see if \"los angeles dons\" appears.\n   - Count how many times this name appears.\n\n### Checking Each Row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Opponent is \"brooklyn dodgers\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 1**: Opponent is \"los angeles dons\" (First match found)\n- **Row 2**: Opponent is \"baltimore colts\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 3**: Opponent is \"new york yankees\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 4**: Opponent is \"buffalo bills\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 5**: Opponent is \"baltimore colts\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 6**: Opponent is \"chicago rockets\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 7**: Opponent is \"cleveland browns\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 8**: Opponent is \"los angeles dons\" (Second match found)\n- **Row 9**: Opponent is \"new york yankees\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 10**: Opponent is \"cleveland browns\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 11**: Opponent is \"chicago rockets\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 12**: Opponent is \"brooklyn dodgers\" (Not relevant)\n- **Row 13**: Opponent is \"buffalo bills\" (Not relevant)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Los Angeles Dons appear twice in the table (rows 1 and 8). Therefore, the claim that they were played only once during the season is false.\n\nNow we identify the relevant cells to check this:\n\n- Row 1: The opponent column shows \"los angeles dons\".\n- Row 8: The opponent column again shows \"los angeles dons\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
