    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The opponent \"Green Bay Packers\" appears as an opponent twice.\n2. The dates when \"Green Bay Packers\" were the opponents should be September 4, 1988 and December 11, 1988.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the relevant information from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Instances of \"Green Bay Packers\"\n\n- **Row 7**: The opponent is listed as \"green bay packers\" with a date of October 16, 1988.\n- **Row 15**: The opponent is again listed as \"green bay packers\" with a date of December 11, 1988.\n\nFrom these observations, the \"Green Bay Packers\" appear twice in the table, but on different dates than specified in the claim (October 16 and December 11, 1988).\n\n### Step 2: Verify Dates\n\n- The claim states that the games against the Green Bay Packers were on September 4, 1988 and December 11, 1988.\n  \nFrom the table:\n\n- **September 4, 1988** (Row 1): The opponent is \"buffalo bills\".\n- **December 11, 1988** (Row 15): The opponent is indeed \"green bay packers\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that the Green Bay Packers were the opponents on September 4, 1988, and December 11, 1988, is incorrect. They only appeared as an opponent on December 11, 1988.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
