This does not meet the condition of a total score being 3.\n\n- **Row 12**:\n  - Score: 2 - 2 (This is a draw)\n  - Result: draw\n  - Total score = 2 + 2 = 4 points. This exceeds the total score condition of 3, but it's still relevant as it\u2019s a draw.\n\nBased on this examination, there are no matches where the total score equals exactly 3 and the result is a draw.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the most number of point score in a match be 3 and it be a draw\" is false. The only draws we identified were with scores adding up to either 2 or 4 points, not 3.\n\nThe relevant rows for verifying this are Row 3 (score 1 - 1), Row 11 (score 1 - 1), and Row 12 (score 2 - 2). These rows confirm the absence of a match meeting both conditions simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
