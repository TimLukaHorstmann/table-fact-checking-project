    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"ask riga be unable to qualify for the final round,\" we need to examine whether ASK Riga qualified based on their aggregate score in comparison to other teams in the table.\n\n1. **Aggregate Score Examination**:\n   - The relevant row for ASK Riga is the last one, which shows an aggregate score of 142 - 137 against Cholet.\n   - Since 142 is greater than 137, ASK Riga won on aggregate and qualified based on their match with Cholet.\n\n2. **Comparison with Other Teams**:\n   - We need to compare ASK Riga's aggregate score (142) with the aggregate scores of other teams to see if they have a better chance of qualifying.\n   - The table provides the following aggregate scores for each team:\n     - \u0161iauliai: 136 - 167\n     - amsterdam: 133 - 146\n     - energa czarni slupsk: 136 - 151\n     - swans allianz: 146 - 139 (qualified with a higher score than ASK Riga)\n     - panellinios: 154 - 124 (qualified with a higher score than ASK Riga)\n     - triumph: 146 - 159\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Teams with better aggregate scores than ASK Riga (142) are swans allianz (146), and panellinios (154).\n   - Teams with worse aggregate scores than ASK Riga are \u0161iauliai, amsterdam, energa czarni slupsk, and triumph.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Although ASK Riga has a better aggregate score than some teams, they do not have the best overall performance compared to swans allianz and panellinios.\n   - However, without additional rules or tiebreakers provided in the table (such as away goals), we cannot definitively say they are unable to qualify for the final round solely based on this data. They did win their match.\n\nThus, based on the information given, ASK Riga is able to qualify over some teams but not others with better scores. The claim \"ask riga be unable to qualify for the final round\" cannot be fully supported as true without additional context or rules.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
