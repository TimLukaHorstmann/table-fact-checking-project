    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1972 be the year when Rowan Barrett be bear\" is true or false, we must interpret and verify it against the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Interpretation of Claim**: \n   - The phrase seems to suggest that 1972 is both the birth year and the age of Rowan Barrett.\n   - However, logically, if 1972 is his birth year, he cannot also be 41 years old at the same time in 2013 (the implied current year).\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"Rowan Barrett\" in the table.\n   - Check both the \"year born (age)\" column and the calculated age based on the birth date provided.\n\n3. **Details from Table**:\n   - Row for \"Rowan Barrett\":\n     - Birth Year: 1972\n     - Age: 41\n     - Birth Date: November 24, 1972\n\n4. **Age Calculation**:\n   - If he was born on November 24, 1972, and the current year implied by his age is 2013, then as of November 23, 2013, he would indeed be turning 41.\n   - Thus, both the birth year (1972) and the age (41) are consistent with each other given that the current date has not yet passed November 24, 2013.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is true because both pieces of information in the table are internally consistent with each other when considering the implied current year as 2013.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response indicating the verification of this claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year born (age)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"current club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The \"year born (age)\" column at row index 5 is directly relevant as it provides the birth year and age.\n- Although not explicitly necessary for determining truth, mentioning the current club helps confirm context.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if Rans Brempong's height in the table matches the value specified in the claim.\n\n1. **Identify Rans Brempong\u2019s entry:** \n   - In the given table, each player has a unique row. We need to locate \"rans brempong\" in the \"player\" column.\n   \n2. **Locate Rans Brempong:**\n   - By scanning the rows, we find that Rans Brempong is listed in the 11th row (indexing from 0, this makes it row index 10).\n\n3. **Check height for Rans Brempong:**\n   - The \"height\" column for Rans Brempong indicates a value of \"2.04\".\n   \n4. **Verify claim against table data:**\n   - The claim states that the height should be \"2.04\". From the table, we confirmed that Rans Brempong's recorded height is indeed \"2.04\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the table confirms that Rans Brempong's height is 2.04, the claim is fully supported.\n\nTherefore, based on this verification, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
