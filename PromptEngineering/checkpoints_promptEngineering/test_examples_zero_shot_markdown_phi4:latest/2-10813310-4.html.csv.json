However, since the claim does not mention the outcome, this detail is irrelevant to verifying the truth of the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both conditions (venue and score) specified in the claim are satisfied by the information in row 20.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those containing the venue \"the stoop\" and the score \"24 - 28\", both found in row 20 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"mcnamara score 3 / 4 goal when the venue be the stoop,\" we need to analyze the relevant details provided in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the Venue**: The claim specifically refers to a match held at \"the stoop.\" We must find any row(s) where the \"venue\" column matches this location.\n\n2. **Check for Matches at \"The Stoop\"**:\n   - From the table, we can identify that there is one match played at \"the stoop,\" which is on the date 31 / 8 / 97.\n   \n3. **Verify McNamara's Goals**: Once we have identified this row, we need to check the \"goals\" column for McNamara's performance in this specific match:\n   - On 31 / 8 / 97, at \"the stoop,\" the goals column indicates: `mcnamara 4 / 4`.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states that McNamara scored \"3 / 4\" goals at this venue, but according to the table, he actually scored \"4 / 4.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the actual record of McNamara's performance (4/4) does not match the claimed performance (3/4), the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Row and Column Information**:\n   - The relevant row index for this information is 30 (as it corresponds to the 31 / 8 / 97 entry in a zero-indexed list).\n   - Relevant columns are \"venue\" and \"goals.\"\n\nThus, based on the analysis above:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
