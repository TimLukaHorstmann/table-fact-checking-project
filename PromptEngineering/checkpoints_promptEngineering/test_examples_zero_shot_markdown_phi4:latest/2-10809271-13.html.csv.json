    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is true based on the provided table, we need to evaluate relevant data points.\n\nThe claim involves two main components:\n1. The location of Prince Park.\n2. Whether Carlton is the home team at that venue.\n\nFrom the table, each row represents a game with specified columns for \"home team\", \"venue\", and other details like scores and dates. Our task is to find if there's an entry where:\n- The \"venue\" column indicates \"princes park\".\n- The \"home team\" column corresponds to \"carlton\".\n\nLet's examine each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Home Team: essendon\n   - Venue: windy hill\n   - Prince Park is not mentioned here.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Home Team: collingwood\n   - Venue: victoria park\n   - Prince Park is not mentioned here.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Home Team: carlton\n   - Venue: princes park\n   - This row matches both criteria of the claim: Carlton is the home team, and the venue is Princes Park.\n\n4. **Rows 3 to 5**:\n   - None of these rows mention Princes Park as a venue.\n\nBased on this evaluation, Row 2 provides evidence that supports the claim. Therefore, the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is true for the given data.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row 2, \"home team\"\n- Row 2, \"venue\"\n\nThus, our conclusion in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
