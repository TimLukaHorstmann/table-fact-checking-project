    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Alonzo Mourning be a player in the year 1985 - 1986\" is true or false, we need to check the table for Alonzo Mourning's entry and see if it corresponds to the specified years.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The first step is to look at the \"year\" column since the claim specifies a particular time period (\"1985 - 1986\").\n\n2. **Find Alonzo Mourning's Entry**: Next, we need to find the row where the player name matches \"Alonzo Mourning\". Once located, examine the value in the \"year\" column for that row.\n\n3. **Compare Year Values**:\n   - According to the table provided, Alonzo Mourning is listed under the years \"1987 - 1988\".\n   - The claim states he should be a player during \"1985 - 1986\".\n\n4. **Determine Truth Value**: Since Alonzo Mourning's entry does not match the year \"1985 - 1986\", the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to record the row index of Alonzo Mourning and look at both the \"year\" column and the \"player\" (or equivalent) column.\n   - From the table, Alonzo Mourning's information is in the 9th row (indexing starts from 0).\n\nThe JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis solution confirms that the claim is false based on the data in the table, and it identifies the relevant cells used to verify this.",
