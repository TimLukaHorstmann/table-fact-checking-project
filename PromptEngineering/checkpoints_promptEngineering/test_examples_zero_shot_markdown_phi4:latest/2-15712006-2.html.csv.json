Compare their positions:\n   - If Russia is just behind Italy, then Russia should have a ranking round rank that is one more than Italy\u2019s (i.e., Italy should be 5 and Russia should be 6).\n\n4. Actual comparison:\n   - Italy's ranking round rank: 6\n   - Russia's ranking round rank: 5\n\nSince Russia's position is ahead of Italy, not behind, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are:\n\n- For Italy: row index 8, column \"ranking round rank\"\n- For Russia: row index 9, column \"ranking round rank\"\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"ranking round rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"ranking round rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
