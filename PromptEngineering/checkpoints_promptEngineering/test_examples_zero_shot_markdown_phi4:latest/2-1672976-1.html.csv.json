    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must first understand the context of the claim and analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Understanding the Claim:\nThe claim states: \"there be 3 team in the big ten challenge that do not have any win.\" This implies there are three teams with zero wins listed under some category related to the Big Ten Challenge. However, upon examining the list of institutions in the table, none explicitly mention being part of the Big Ten Conference or participating in a Big Ten Challenge.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\nThe table lists various college football teams and their respective records broken down into overall, home, away, and neutral wins and losses:\n\n1. **Identifying Teams with Zero Wins:**\n   - Notre Dame Fighting Irish\n   - Pitt Panthers\n   - Syracuse Orange\n\nThese are the three institutions in the table with zero wins across all categories (overall wins, home wins, away wins, neutral wins).\n\n2. **Checking Big Ten Conference Membership:**\n   The teams listed in the table:\n   - Boston College Eagles\n   - Clemson Tigers\n   - Duke Blue Devils\n   - Florida State Seminoles\n   - Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\n   - Maryland Terrapins\n   - Miami Hurricanes\n   - North Carolina Tar Heels\n   - NC State Wolfpack\n   - Notre Dame Fighting Irish\n   - Pitt Panthers\n   - Syracuse Orange\n   - Virginia Cavaliers\n   - Virginia Tech Hokies\n   - Wake Forest Demon Deacons\n\nNone of these teams are part of the Big Ten Conference. The only school traditionally associated with the Big Ten is Notre Dame, which has been an independent for most sports and occasionally participates in the Big Ten as a non-member.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\nThe claim refers to teams in the \"Big Ten Challenge\" without any wins. However, none of the institutions listed are part of or compete in a Big Ten event according to their conference affiliations based on the given data. The three teams with zero wins (Notre Dame, Pitt, and Syracuse) are not participating in a Big Ten Challenge.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE** because it incorrectly associates these teams with the Big Ten Conference or Challenge when they do not participate under such designation based on this table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nSince all institutions with zero overall wins are relevant for verifying the lack of any team from the Big Ten Challenge having wins, we identify their rows and \"wins\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's first break down what the claim states:\n\n- **Claim:** \"The North Carolina Tar Heels will be the only team in the Big Ten Challenge whose win and loss totals be the same.\"\n\nWe need to verify two things:\n1. Whether the North Carolina Tar Heels have equal wins and losses.\n2. If any other team listed has equal wins and losses.\n\nLet's examine these points:\n\n1. **North Carolina Tar Heels:**\n   - Wins = 7\n   - Losses = 7\n\nThe claim suggests that they will be unique in this regard, but first, we should check if they actually have equal wins and losses now.\n\n2. **Checking Other Teams:**\n   - Boston College Eagles: Wins = 6, Losses = 1 (Not equal)\n   - Clemson Tigers: Wins = 9, Losses = 5 (Not equal)\n   - Duke Blue Devils: Wins = 12, Losses = 2 (Not equal)\n   - Florida State Seminoles: Wins = 6, Losses = 8 (Not equal)\n   - Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets: Wins = 4, Losses = 9 (Not equal)\n   - Maryland Terrapins: Wins = 10, Losses = 4 (Not equal)\n   - Miami Hurricanes: Wins = 2, Losses = 4 (Not equal)\n   - North Carolina Tar Heels: Wins = 7, Losses = 7 (Equal)\n   - NC State Wolfpack: Wins = 5, Losses = 8 (Not equal)\n   - Notre Dame Fighting Irish: Wins = 0, Losses = 0 (Equal but not relevant as they are both zero)\n   - Pitt Panthers: Wins = 0, Losses = 0 (Equal but not relevant as they are both zero)\n   - Syracuse Orange: Wins = 0, Losses = 0 (Equal but not relevant as they are both zero)\n   - Virginia Cavaliers: Wins = 8, Losses = 5 (Not equal)\n   - Virginia Tech Hokies: Wins = 3, Losses = 5 (Not equal)\n   - Wake Forest Demon Deacons: Wins = 10, Losses = 3 (Not equal)\n\nFrom this analysis, the North Carolina Tar Heels are indeed one of only two teams with equal wins and losses. However, the other three teams listed (Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Pitt Panthers, Syracuse Orange) all have zero wins and zero losses, which technically meet the condition but aren't relevant because they don\u2019t match a scenario of having non-zero wins equalling their losses.\n\nSince \"the only team\" implies no others, it should exclude these cases.
