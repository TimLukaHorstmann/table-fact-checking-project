We will consider entries with dates falling in this range:\n   - From \"12 november 2007\" to \"12 april 2010\".\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Entries**:\n   - Entry from \"12 november 2007\": Outcome is \"runner-up\".\n   - Entry from \"26 may 2008\": Although slightly outside the specified end date of April 2010, this could be considered if inclusive interpretation applies due to proximity. Outcome is \"runner-up\".\n   - Entry from \"12 april 2010\": Outcome is \"runner-up\".\n\n3. **Calculate Win Rate**:\n   - Total Matches: 3 (including entry on May 26, 2008).\n   - Wins: 0 (all outcomes are \"runner-up\").\n   - Losses/Runner-ups: 3.\n\n4. **Compute the Claimed Win Rate**:\n   - Winning Percentage = (Number of Wins / Total Matches) * 100 = (0 / 3) * 100 = 0%.\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Win Rate**:\n   - The claim states an \"80% win rate,\" which is not supported by the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated win rate within the specified period is 0%, significantly different from the claimed 80%.
