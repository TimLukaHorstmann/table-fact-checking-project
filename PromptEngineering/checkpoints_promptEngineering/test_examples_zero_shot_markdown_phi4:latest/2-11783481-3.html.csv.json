Therefore, there is no player who meets both conditions in the claim.\n\nSince no player meets the specified criteria, the relevant cell check for \"long\" with value 0 cannot be performed because such a player does not exist. Thus, the statement about having \"0 be the long\" under these conditions is false by default since the situation described (a player with over 30 carries and 0 yards) does not occur.\n\nThe conclusion is that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells needed to verify this:\n\n- **steve bellisari**:\n  - Carries: `30` (does not satisfy \"over 30 carries\")\n  - Yards: `54`\n  - Long: `20`\n\nSince Steve Bellisari was the closest candidate with exactly 30 carries and more than 0 yards, we confirm that he does not meet both conditions.
