    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the relevant part of the table that pertains to the claim: \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class.\"\n\nThe claim specifically addresses the number of poles (pole positions) for the Moto2 class. Therefore, we will focus on finding the row and column related to this aspect.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: The table lists different classes including 125 cc, 250 cc, MotoGP, Moto2, and a total summary.\n   - From the table, \"moto2\" is listed as one of the classes in the first column (class) at row index 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The claim concerns poles, which corresponds to the \"pole\" column in the table.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: Locate the intersection of row index 3 (\"moto2\") and the \"pole\" column.\n   - At this intersection, the value is 0.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states there are zero poles in the Moto2 class, which matches the value found (0) at that specific cell.\n\nSince the table confirms that there are indeed 0 pole positions for the Moto2 class, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell needed to verify this claim is located at row index 3 and column \"pole\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" against the provided table, we need to focus on the relevant data points related to the \"moto2\" class and the number of poles.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: The row corresponding to the \"moto2\" class is crucial for this evaluation.\n   - From the table, the \"moto2\" class appears in the third row (index 3 if starting from zero).\n\n2. **Check Pole Column for moto2**:\n   - Locate the \"pole\" column in the table, which is the fourth column.\n   - For the \"moto2\" class (row index 3), check the value under the \"pole\" column.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that there are \"4 pole have a moto2 class\".\n   - In the table, the value for poles in the \"moto2\" row is 0.\n   - Since 0 does not equal 4, the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cell to verify the claim is:\n- Row index: 3 (for \"moto2\")\n- Column name: \"pole\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
