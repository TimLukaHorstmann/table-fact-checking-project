This matches the condition for the claim.\n\n   - **September 5:**\n     - Match against Mets with a score of \"3 - 0\".\n     - One team scored zero points (Mets lost 3-0 to their opponent). This also matches the condition for the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Uniqueness and Completeness:**\n\n   - We need to ensure that no other games in the table have either team scoring zero points except those on September 2 and September 5.\n   \n   - Check all entries for any additional instances where a game ended with \"0\" as one of the scores:\n     - September 1: Score is \"7 - 4\".\n     - September 3: Score is \"9 - 7\".\n     - September 6-14, 16-28: All games have non-zero scores for both teams.\n\n   - No other dates in the table show a score where one team scored zero points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that only on September 2 and September 5 did either team hold an opponent to zero points.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two key aspects of the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. The attendance figure for the game on September 19.\n2. Whether this attendance figure is indeed the lowest compared to all other games listed.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- First, identify the row corresponding to September 19 from the table:\n  - Row with \"september 19\" in the first column shows that the opponent was the Marlins and the attendance was recorded as 20,202.\n\n- Next, compare this attendance number against all other games listed in the \"attendance\" column of the table:\n\n1. **September 1**: Attendance is 28,393.\n2. **September 2**: Attendance is 23,150.\n3. **September 3**: Attendance is 23,122.\n4. **September 5**: Attendance is 48,302.\n5. **September 7 (first game)**: Attendance is 55,797.\n6. **September 7 (second game)**: Attendance is 54,980.\n7. **September 8**: Attendance is 38,921.\n8. **September 9**: Attendance is 40,554.\n9. **September 10**: Attendance is 38,665.\n10. **September 11**: Attendance is 39,994.\n11. **September 13**: Attendance is 45,105.\n12. **September 14 (first game)**: Attendance is 43,950.\n13. **September 14 (second game)**: Attendance is 39,776.\n14. **September 16**: Attendance is 30,319.\n15. **September 17**: Attendance is 32,821.\n16. **September 18**: Attendance is 39,070.\n17. **September 20**: Attendance is 28,757.\n18. **September 21**: Attendance is 28,173.\n19. **September 22**: Attendance is 36,796.\n20. **September 23**: Attendance is 39,322.\n21. **September 24**: Attendance is 41,430.\n22. **September 26**: Attendance is 44,145.\n23. **September 27**: Attendance is 45,177.\n24. **September 28**: Attendance is 44,945.\n\n- After checking all the attendance figures in the table, we can see that no other game has an attendance number lower than 20,202 for September 19. \n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is indeed true because the game on September 19 had the lowest attendance of any listed game with only 20,202 attendees.\n\n**Relevant cells to verify:**\n- Attendance on September 19: Row index 18, Column name \"attendance\".\n- All other attendance figures need comparison: Rows 0 through 24 (excluding postponed dates), Column name \"attendance\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
