The row with the \"global (itunes)\" entry indicates a release date of 19 November 2012.\n2. Other countries had earlier physical releases ranging from 17 October 2008 to 5 December 2008.\n\nThe claim specifies that this iTunes release was the first international one, and based on the table:\n- There were multiple physical releases in different regions before the global iTunes release date of 19 November 2012.\n- Thus, while it might be true that this was a first iTunes release globally, other earlier non-iTunes releases occurred internationally.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"black ice be first release on itunes, internationally\" is not supported as the first international release (considering physical formats) happened before the global iTunes release.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those with the date and format information for both the physical releases and the iTunes release.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Black Ice was never released as an LP, only as a CD\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to check each row for the presence of \"LP\" in the \"format\" column.\n\nThe table provides information about the release format for different countries and dates. The key part of the claim is that there should be no entries labeled as \"LP\" in any form other than potentially being combined with \"CD\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Europe, 17 October 2008)**: \n   - Format: \"cd , double lp\"\n   - This indicates that an LP was released.\n\n2. **Row 2 (United Kingdom, 20 October 2008)**:\n   - Format: \"cd , double lp\"\n   - This also indicates that an LP was released.\n\n3. **Row 3 (United Kingdom, 1 December 2008)**:\n   - Format: \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\"\n   - No LP mentioned here.\n\n4. **Row 4 (United States, 20 October 2008)**:\n   - Format: \"cd\"\n   - Only CD is mentioned.\n\n5. **Row 5 (Japan, 22 October 2008)**:\n   - Format: \"cd\"\n   - Only CD is mentioned.\n\n6. **Row 6 (Germany, 5 December 2008)**:\n   - Format: \"cd (limited edition steel - box)\"\n   - No LP mentioned here.\n\n7. **Row 7 (Global (iTunes), 19 November 2012)**:\n   - Format: \"digital download\"\n   - Neither CD nor LP is mentioned, as it's a digital release.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that there are entries in rows 0 and 2 where the format includes an LP. This directly contradicts the claim that \"Black Ice was never released as an LP.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
