    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the record for June 13 be 29 - 32,\" we need to verify the content of the \"record\" column on the row corresponding to June 13.\n\n1. Identify the relevant row:\n   - The date in question is \"June 13.\" From the table, this corresponds to the 11th row (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. Check the value in the \"record\" column for that row:\n   - For \"June 13,\" the opponent is \"Phillies,\" and we need to find the \"record\" associated with this date.\n   - According to the table, on June 13, the record listed is \"29 - 32.\"\n\n3. Compare the value from the table with the claim:\n   - The claim states that the record should be \"29 - 32.\"\n   - From the table, we observe that the record for June 13 is indeed \"29 - 32.\"\n\nSince both values match, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cell from which this information was verified is located at row index 10 (using zero-based indexing) and in the column named \"record.\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the record for June 13 be under 29 - 32,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify the Date**: The claim specifies June 13, so we should look at the row corresponding to this date.\n2. **Find the Relevant Row**: In the table, June 13 is listed as:\n   ```\n   | june 13 | phillies   | 4 - 3   | spoljaric (0 - 3)   |        26799 | 29 - 32  |\n   ```\n\n3. **Check the Record**: The column labeled \"record\" for June 13 shows \"29 - 32.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that the record should be \"under 29 - 32.\" In baseball, a team's win-loss record is usually written in the format \"wins - losses.\" Thus, \"under 29 - 32\" would mean either fewer than 29 wins or more than 32 losses.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The record for June 13 is exactly \"29 - 32,\" not under it. Therefore, the claim is false because the condition of being \"under 29 - 32\" is not met.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n   - Row index 11 (corresponding to June 13) in the \"record\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
