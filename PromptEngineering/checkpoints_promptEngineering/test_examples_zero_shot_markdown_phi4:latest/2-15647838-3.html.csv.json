    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"attendance be over 70000 7 time in virginia tech hokies bowl game,\" we need to assess two key conditions from the table:\n\n1. Check if there are seven instances where attendance was over 70,000.\n2. Verify if these games were Virginia Tech Hokies' bowl games.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Attendance Over 70,000:**\n   - We need to find rows in the table where the \"attendance\" column is greater than 70,000.\n   - Relevant entries are:\n     - Row 5: 72,683 (1995 Sugar Bowl)\n     - Row 9: 79,280 (2000 Sugar Bowl)\n     - Row 10: 72,202 (2001 Gator Bowl)\n     - Row 15: 77,340 (2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl)\n     - Row 16: 74,411 (2007 Orange Bowl)\n\n   This shows only five instances where attendance was over 70,000.\n\n2. **Check for Virginia Tech Hokies' Games:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention \"Virginia Tech Hokies\" in any of the games.\n   - We need to cross-reference each game against known records or context (not available directly from this table) to identify if it was a Virginia Tech game.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are only five instances with attendance over 70,000 and no explicit mention of Virginia Tech Hokies in the provided data, the claim is not supported.\n   - Additionally, even without verification of the teams involved, the count itself (seven times) does not match.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"6 out of 20 games were the Gator Bowl, with the first in 1994,\" we need to analyze the table and check for two main conditions:\n\n1. Count how many times the Gator Bowl appears in the table.\n2. Identify if one of these appearances is indeed from the year 1994.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table and extract the relevant information:\n\n- **Row 9**: Season = 1994, Bowl Game = Gator Bowl\n- **Row 16**: Season = 2000, Bowl Game = Gator Bowl\n- **Row 17**: Season = 2001, Bowl Game = Gator Bowl\n- **Row 19**: Season = 2005, Bowl Game = Gator Bowl\n\nFrom the table, we can see that \"Gator Bowl\" appears 4 times. Therefore, it is not correct to state that there are 6 Gator Bowl games in this dataset.\n\nNow let's check if any of these occurrences were the first in 1994:\n\n- The first instance of a Gator Bowl game in the table is indeed from the year 1994 (Row 9).\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude:\n- The claim that there are \"6 out of 20 games\" for the Gator Bowl is false; it's actually only 4.\n- It is true that one of these Gator Bowl appearances was in 1994.\n\nAs a result, the overall claim is FALSE because the first part about the number of Gator Bowl games being six does not hold true. Here are the relevant rows and columns to verify this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"bowl game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"bowl game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"bowl game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"bowl game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
