The company name is stated as \"nut poker league\" in the claim, which should match exactly with the company name given in the table.\n2. The money requested is mentioned as 50,000 but received 75,000; this must be verified against the corresponding row's values.\n3. The date provided for the episode is September 7, 2006.\n\nLet\u2019s break down each part:\n\n1. **Company Name:**\n   - In the table, the company name in episode 6 is \"nuts poker league.\" This closely matches the claim of \"nut poker leauge\" considering common typographical errors or misspellings that could occur verbally but should be exact for written claims.\n\n2. **Money Requested and Received:**\n   - The money requested in the table under episode 6 is indeed 50,000.\n   - The amount received as per the table for episode 6 is noted to be 65,000, which contradicts the claim that mentions they received 75,000.\n\n3. **Date of Airing:**\n   - Episode 6 aired on September 7, 2006, matching the date provided in the claim.\n\nGiven these points, the key discrepancies are with the actual money received (claim states 75,000 while table shows 65,000) and a slight variation in spelling of \"nuts poker league.\" The claim is therefore not fully accurate based on the data available in the table.\n\nNow, let\u2019s specify which cells were relevant to checking this claim:\n\n- **Row Index**: 5 corresponds to episode 6.\n- **Columns**:\n  - `episode`: To verify the episode number (not directly checked here but necessary context).\n  - `first aired`: To confirm the date (September 7, 2006).\n  - `entrepreneur (s)`: For confirming which entrepreneurs presented in this episode.\n  - `company or product name`: \"nuts poker league\" matches closely to \"nut poker leauge.\"\n  - `money requested`: Confirms as 50,000.\n  - `...` : Note the discrepancy with `received amount`, not a column but inferred from context.\n\nThus, relevant cells include those for the episode number and date, company name, and the money requested. The inconsistency in the received amount is critical.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"first aired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
