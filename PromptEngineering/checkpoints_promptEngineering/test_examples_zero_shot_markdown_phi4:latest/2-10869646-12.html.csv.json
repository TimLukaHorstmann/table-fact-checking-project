    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in the table related to the crowd sizes for each venue on June 22, 1974.\n\nThe claim states: \"during the 1974 VFL season, Princes Park recorded the highest crowd participation.\"\n\nLet's analyze the relevant column (\"crowd\") to find out which venue had the largest attendance:\n\n1. **Princes Park** (Hawthorn vs Richmond): Crowd size is **15,710**.\n2. Arden Street Oval: Crowd size is **9,016**.\n3. Junction Oval: Crowd size is **12,519**.\n4. Windy Hill: Crowd size is **25,867**.\n5. MCG: Crowd size is **23,336**.\n6. VFL Park: Crowd size is **16,320**.\n\nComparing the crowd sizes:\n- Princes Park has a crowd of 15,710.\n- The highest attendance recorded in this table is at Windy Hill with a crowd of 25,867.\n\nFrom this analysis, it's clear that Princes Park did not have the highest crowd participation on June 22, 1974. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells for verifying this:\n\n- Row index 1 (Hawthorn vs Richmond at Princes Park) has a crowd size of **15,710**.\n- Row index 3 (Essendon vs Collingwood at Windy Hill) has a crowd size of **25,867**, which is higher than that at Princes Park.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are those in the \"crowd\" column for rows with data from Princes Park and Windy Hill.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
