The claim specifies two key conditions:\n   - \"Mike Skinner's busiest race year be 2001\"\n   - \"with 14 starts\"\n\n2. The first condition refers to the year 2001 being Mike Skinner's busiest race year, which implies that we need to check if he had the highest number of starts in any given year.\n\n3. The second condition specifies that in 2001, there were exactly 14 starts. We will look for this specific entry under the \"starts\" column.\n\nSteps:\n- Check the \"year\" and \"starts\" columns for each row to find where Mike Skinner had his maximum number of starts.\n- Verify if 2001 is indeed the year with the highest count in the \"starts\" column.\n- Confirm that the \"starts\" value for 2001 is 14.\n\nLet's review the relevant data from the table:\n\n| year | starts |\n|------|--------|\n| 1987 |   1    |\n| 1992 |   1    |\n| 1994 |   5    |\n| 1999 |  13    |\n| 2000 |   8    |\n| 2001 |  14    |\n| 2003 |   1    |\n| 2006 |   9    |\n\n- The maximum number of starts in any year, as per the table, is indeed 14.\n- This occurs in the year 2001.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are verified with the data from the relevant cells:\n\n- For year 2001 and \"starts\" equal to 14:\n  - Row index: 5\n  - Columns: \"year\", \"starts\"\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in these cells. \n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"starts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Mike achieved the highest number of top 5 finishes in any given year, specifically in 2001.\n2. He did not win any race (i.e., have a \"wins\" value greater than zero) in 2001.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table for each year to verify these conditions:\n\n- **1987**: \n  - Top 5: 0\n  - Wins: 0\n\n- **1992**:\n  - Top 5: 0\n  - Wins: 0\n\n- **1994**:\n  - Top 5: 0\n  - Wins: 0\n  \n- **1999**: \n  - Top 5: 1\n  - Wins: 1\n\n- **2000**:\n  - Top 5: 1\n  - Wins: 0\n\n- **2001**:\n  - Top 5: 6 (the highest in any year)\n  - Wins: 0\n\n- **2003**: \n  - Top 5: 0\n  - Wins: 0\n\n- **2006**: \n  - Top 5: 0\n  - Wins: 0\n\nNow, let's verify the claim using these observations:\n\n1.
