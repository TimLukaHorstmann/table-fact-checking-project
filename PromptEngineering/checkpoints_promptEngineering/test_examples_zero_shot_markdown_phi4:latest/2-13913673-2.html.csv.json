    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that only one game was postponed during the entire season and it was the April 23 match against the Royals, we need to examine the relevant part of the table focusing on games with potential postponements.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table for any mention of a postponement:\n\n1. **April 22**: Game against Royals - Result: 15-1 (no postponement).\n2. **April 23**: Game against Royals is marked as \"postponed (rain) rescheduled for April 24\". This indicates that this game was indeed postponed and rescheduled.\n3. **April 24**: There are two entries for the game on April 24 against the Royals, which were originally set for April 23 but moved due to rain:\n   - First entry: Result 9-6\n   - Second entry: Result 2-0\n\nThere is no mention of any other postponed games in the rest of the table. Each subsequent row up to and including April 30 does not contain any indication of postponements.\n\nSince only one game was explicitly marked as \"postponed\" and rescheduled, which matches the claim about the April 23 match against the Royals, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to examine the conditions specified and compare them with the relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Condition: \"the lowest scoring game\"**\n   - We need to find all games with a low score by comparing the total runs scored (sum of both teams' scores) for each row.\n\n2. **Condition: \"on April 24 against the Royals, the score be 2 - 0\"**\n   - This specifies both the date and opponent along with the exact score that needs verification.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Games on April 24 Against the Royals:**\n   - From the table, there are two entries for April 24 against the Royals:\n     - Row 22: Score is 9 - 6\n     - Row 23: Score is 2 - 0\n\n2. **Check for Lowest Scoring Game(s):**\n   - We calculate total runs scored in each game and identify the lowest scores.\n     - For example, April 29 against Mariners (7 - 2) has a total score of 9 runs.\n     - Among all games listed, the following have the lowest total scores:\n       - April 24 (Row 23), with a total score of 2 (Royals vs. Team: 0 - 2).\n       - Other low-scoring games include:\n         - April 19 against Twins (3 - 0) = 3 runs\n         - April 20 against Twins (2 - 1) = 3 runs\n         - April 28 against Yankees (5 - 2) = 7 runs\n\n   - The lowest score is found in row 23 with a total of 2 runs.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies that the lowest scoring game was on April 24 against the Royals, and the score should be 2 - 0.\n   - Row 23 corresponds to this condition exactly (Score: 2 - 0).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conditions of the claim are fully met by row 23 in the table.\n\nBased on these steps, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To verify the claim \"there be a 7 - 2 score against both the mariner and the yankee,\" we need to check two specific conditions in the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a game where the score was 7 - 2 against the Mariners.\n2. Identify if there is another game where the score was 7 - 2 against the Yankees.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step using the given data:\n\n**Step 1: Look for the score \"7 - 2\" in the table**\n\n- We need to check each row under the column \"score\" for the entry \"7 - 2\".\n\n**Step 2: Check if these scores are against Mariners and Yankees respectively**\n\n- Once we find the rows with a \"7 - 2\" score, verify which team (\"opponent\") was involved in those games.\n\n**Checking Rows:**\n\n- **Row 2**: Score is \"7 - 2\", Opponent is \"white sox\". (Not relevant)\n- **Row 12**: Score is \"7 - 3\", Opponent is \"athletics\". (Not a match for the score)\n- **Row 13**: Score is \"7 - 1\", Opponent is \"athletics\". (Not a match for the score)\n- **Row 26**: Score is \"4 - 3\", Opponent is \"yankees\". (Not relevant)\n- **Row 27**: Score is \"6 - 4\", Opponent is \"yankees\". (Not relevant)\n- **Row 28**: Score is \"5 - 2\", Opponent is \"yankees\". (Not a match for the score)\n- **Row 25**: Score is \"6 - 4\", Opponent is \"yankees\". (Not relevant)\n- **Row 26**: Score is \"4 - 3\", Opponent is \"yankees\". (Not relevant)\n- **Row 27**: Score is \"1 - 0\", Opponent is \"yankees\". (Not a match for the score)\n- **Row 28**: Score is \"5 - 2\", Opponent is \"yankees\". (Not a match for the score)\n\nThe only row with a \"7 - 2\" score:\n- **Row 11**: Score is \"7 - 2\", Opponent is \"athletics\".\n\nNow, verify if there's another \"7 - 2\" score against the Yankees:\n\n- We have already checked all relevant rows. None of them showed a \"7 - 2\" game against the Yankees.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that there was a 7 - 2 score against both Mariners and Yankees. However, we found only one instance of a 7 - 2 score against the Athletics, not the Mariners or Yankees. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
