This discrepancy makes it necessary to check if they are indeed referring to the same person or if this is an error in spelling.\n\n2. **Position**: The claim states that Andre Owen was a guard. According to the table, \"andre owens\" plays as a \"guard,\" which matches the position mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Years for Jazz**: The claim specifies the years \"2005 - 06.\" In the table, \"andre owens\" played from \"2005 - 06,\" confirming this part of the claim.\n\n4. **School/Club Team**: The claim mentions \"houston jazz club.\" The table lists \"andre owens\" as having a school/club team \"houston.\" The term \"jazz club\" is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that \"houston\" refers to the Houston Rockets, an NBA team, which aligns with playing for the Jazz (Utah Jazz) in terms of being an NBA player.\n\n5. **Nationality**: While not directly relevant to the claim's truthfulness, \"andre owens\" is listed as from the United States, but this does not affect the evaluation of the other conditions.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The discrepancy in spelling (\"owen\" vs. \"owens\") raises a question about whether they refer to the same person.\n- All other aspects (position, years, and team) align with the table's information.\n\nConsidering the evidence available, the claim is mostly supported except for the potential name mismatch.
