    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if the average result for week 13 is indeed a loss (denoted as \"l\") with the specific score of 28 - 17.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Week 13:**\n   - The table entry for week 13 shows:\n     - Date: 1984-11-26\n     - Opponent: Miami Dolphins\n     - Result: l 28 - 17\n     - Game Site: Miami Orange Bowl\n     - Attendance: 74884\n\n2. **Interpretation of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the average result for week 13 be l 28 - 17.\"\n   - Since there is only one game in week 13, the average result for this week would simply be the result of this single game.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - The result for week 13 is indeed a loss (l) with the score of 28 - 17.\n   - Therefore, the average result for week 13 is exactly the same as the result of the single game played that week.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is only one entry for week 13 and it matches the claim perfectly, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell to verify this claim is from row index 12 (corresponding to week 13) in the \"result\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17,\" we need to understand and verify two aspects:\n\n1. **Identify the results relevant to calculation**: The claim implies calculating an average of some game results, specifically targeting a scoreline of \"28 - 17.\" We must check if any games in the table have this exact result.\n\n2. **Check week 12's relevance**: Determine what is meant by \"week 12 be the average\" and whether it matches with any calculated averages from identified scores.\n\n**Step-by-step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Game Results:**\n   - Scan through the \"result\" column to identify if there are any games with a score of \"28 - 17.\"\n   - In this table, no game has the result \"28 - 17.\"\n\n2. **Check Week 12's Result:**\n   - Locate row corresponding to week 12.\n   - Row index for week 12 is `11` (considering zero-based indexing).\n   - The result of week 12 is \"l 31 - 20\" at the Houston Oilers game.\n\n3. **Determine if Week 12 Matches Claim:**\n   - Since no games have a result of \"28 - 17,\" there's nothing to average.\n   - Therefore, it cannot be said that \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17\" since such a score does not exist in the table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is false because there are no games with a result of \"28 - 17,\" and thus week 12 cannot represent an average of non-existent scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation for the relevant cells:\n- Row index `11` is included because it represents week 12's result.\n- Row index `7` (and any other rows) could have been checked if there were instances of a score \"28 - 17,\" but in this case, none exist.
