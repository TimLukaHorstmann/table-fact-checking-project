We will extract the relevant cells containing the player's name and country for verification.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- The cell at row index 3 in the \"player\" column contains \"David Frost\".\n- The cell at row index 3 in the \"country\" column contains \"south africa\".\n\nThe JSON object with the answer is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
