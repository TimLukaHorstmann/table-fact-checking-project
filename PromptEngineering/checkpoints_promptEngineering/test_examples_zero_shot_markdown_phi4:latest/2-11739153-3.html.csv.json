    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Minnesota play more home than away games in the 2007 season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and count the number of home and away games for Minnesota.\n\n### Relevant Columns:\n1. **Visitor**: Indicates if the game was an away game for Minnesota.\n2. **Home**: Indicates if the game was a home game for Minnesota.\n\n### Analysis:\n- A row where \"Minnesota\" is listed under the \"visitor\" column indicates an away game.\n- A row where \"Minnesota\" is listed under the \"home\" column indicates a home game.\n\nLet's count:\n\n#### Away Games (Visitor = Minnesota):\n1. October 13: minnesota vs phoenix\n2. October 14: minnesota vs anaheim\n3. October 16: minnesota vs los angeles\n4. October 20: minnesota vs st louis\n5. October 24: minnesota vs calgary\n6. October 25: minnesota vs edmonton\n7. October 28: minnesota vs colorado\n\nTotal Away Games: 7\n\n#### Home Games (Home = Minnesota):\n1. October 4: chicago vs minnesota\n2. October 6: columbus vs minnesota\n3. October 10: edmonton vs minnesota\n4. October 21: colorado vs minnesota\n\nTotal Home Games: 4\n\n### Conclusion:\nMinnesota played 7 away games and 4 home games, so they played more away games than home games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Rows where \"visitor\" is Minnesota (away games): 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11\n- Rows where \"home\" is Minnesota (home games): 2, 7, 8, 12\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
