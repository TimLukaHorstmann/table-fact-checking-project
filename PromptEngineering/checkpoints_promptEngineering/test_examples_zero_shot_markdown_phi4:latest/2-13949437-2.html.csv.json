    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze each relevant piece of information in the table concerning the condition mentioned: \"3 of the tallest buildings in Portland between 1907 to present have been bank buildings.\"\n\n1. **Identify Tallest Buildings:** \n   - We first identify which buildings are listed as the tallest during specific time periods by looking at the \"years as tallest\" column.\n   \n2. **Verify Bank Buildings:**\n   - Then, we need to determine if these tallest buildings were indeed bank buildings.\n\n### Detailed Verification:\n\n1. **Wells Fargo Building (Row 0):** \n   - Years as Tallest: 1907 - 1911\n   - Name indicates it is a bank building (\"wells fargo\").\n   \n2. **Yeon Building (Row 1):**\n   - Years as Tallest: 1911 - 1913\n   - The name does not indicate it is a bank building.\n\n3. **American Bank Building (Row 2):** \n   - Years as Tallest: 1913 - 1927\n   - Name indicates it is a bank building (\"american bank\").\n\n4. **Public Service Building (Row 3):**\n   - Years as Tallest: 1927 - 1962\n   - The name does not indicate it is a bank building.\n\n5. **Hilton Portland Hotel (Row 4):**\n   - Years as Tallest: 1963 - 1965\n   - The name indicates it is a hotel, not a bank building.\n\n6. **Harrison West Condominium Tower (Row 5):**\n   - Years as Tallest: 1965 - 1969\n   - The name does not indicate it is a bank building.\n\n7. **Union Bank of California Tower (Row 6):** \n   - Years as Tallest: 1969 - 1970\n   - Name indicates it is a bank building (\"union bank\").\n\n8. **Standard Insurance Center (Row 7):**\n   - Years as Tallest: 1970 - 1972\n   - The name does not indicate it is a bank building.\n\n9. **Wells Fargo Center (Row 8):**\n   - Years as Tallest: 1972 - present\n   - Name indicates it is associated with Wells Fargo, which is a bank.\n\n### Summary:\n- From the analysis, we find that the following buildings were tallest and are identified as bank buildings:\n  1. Wells Fargo Building (Row 0)\n  2. American Bank Building (Row 2)\n  3. Union Bank of California Tower (Row 6)\n  4. Wells Fargo Center (Row 8)\n\nSince there are four buildings that were the tallest and have names indicating they are bank buildings, the claim that \"3 of the tallest building in Portland between 1907 to present have been bank buildings\" is indeed true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for verification pertain to those rows which are confirmed as tallest during a period and having a name indicative of being a bank:\n\n- Wells Fargo Building: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n- American Bank Building: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n- Union Bank of California Tower: {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the locations of the tallest buildings in Portland as listed in the markdown table, we need to evaluate two parts of the claim:\n\n1. \"4 of the tallest building have been on 6th avenue.\"\n2. \"3 of them have been on 5th avenue.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n### Part 1: Buildings on 6th Avenue\n\nWe will check each row for buildings located on 6th Avenue by examining the 'street address' column.\n\n- **Wells Fargo Building**: Address is \"309 sw 6th avenue\" - Located on 6th Avenue.\n- **Public Service Building**: Address is \"920 sw sixth avenue\" - Located on 6th Avenue.\n- **Hilton Portland Hotel**: Address is \"921 sw sixth avenue\" - Located on 6th Avenue.\n\nFrom the table, three buildings are located on 6th Avenue. Therefore, the claim that four buildings have been there is incorrect.\n\n### Part 2: Buildings on 5th Avenue\n\nWe will now check each row for buildings located on 5th Avenue by examining the 'street address' column.\n\n- **Yeon Building**: Address is \"522 sw 5th avenue\" - Located on 5th Avenue.\n- **Standard Insurance Center**: Address is \"900 sw fifth avenue\" - Located on 5th Avenue.\n- **Wells Fargo Center**: Address is \"1300 sw 5th avenue\" - Located on 5th Avenue.\n\nFrom the table, three buildings are located on 5th Avenue. This part of the claim is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that four buildings have been on 6th Avenue and three on 5th Avenue. We found only three buildings on 6th Avenue and three on 5th Avenue.
