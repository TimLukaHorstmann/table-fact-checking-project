    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table and verify if the qualify score for the year 1961 matches the given value of 145.144.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: The claim mentions the year 1961. In markdown tables, rows are indexed starting from 0. Therefore, we need to look at row index 0 (the first row) for the year 1961.\n\n2. **Locate the Column**: The column of interest is \"qual\", which stands for the qualification score.\n\n3. **Verify the Value**: Check if the value in the \"qual\" column for the year 1961 is indeed 145.144.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- Row index 0 corresponds to the year 1961.\n- In this row, under the \"qual\" column, the value listed is 145.144.\n\nSince the value matches exactly with what the claim states, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE. The relevant cell for verification is located at row index 0 and the \"qual\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"qual\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
