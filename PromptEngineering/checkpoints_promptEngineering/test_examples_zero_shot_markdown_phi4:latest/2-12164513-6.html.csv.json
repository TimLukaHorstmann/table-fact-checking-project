According to the table, there are two entries on this date:\n     - Row index 12: \"atlanta\", with a score of \"9 - 7\"\n     - Row index 13: \"atlanta\", with a score of \"7 - 1\"\n\n2. **Opponent Verification**:\n   - The opponent mentioned in the claim is \"atlanta\". Both entries on September 13 correspond to games against Atlanta, which matches this part of the claim.\n\n3. **Score Verification**:\n   - The first game (row index 12) has a score of \"9 - 7\", matching the score mentioned in the claim.\n   - The second game (row index 13) has a different score (\"7 - 1\"), which is irrelevant since we're focusing on the first entry to match the score part of the claim.\n\n4. **Pitcher Verification**:\n   - For the first game on September 13 (row index 12), \"wright\" is listed as the pitcher with a record of \"(14 - 7)\", matching exactly what is claimed.\n\nBased on these verifications, all parts of the claim are correct for the first entry on September 13. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object that captures this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The game in question involves \"seo\" as indicated by the loss entry: \"seo (4 - 9)\".\n2. The result of the game must be a loss for seo.\n3. The attendance at this game was \"14691\".\n\nLet's examine each part systematically:\n\n- **Identifying the relevant rows**: We need to find rows where \"loss\" mentions \"seo\". From the table:\n  - Row with index 7: \"september 8 | florida | 3 - 0 | seo (4 - 9) | 14691\"\n  \n- **Verifying the loss condition**: In this row, the game is indeed a loss for \"seo\" as indicated by \"seo (4 - 9)\".\n  \n- **Checking the attendance**: The attendance in this row is correctly listed as \"14691\".\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim include:\n- The row index where \"seo (4 - 9)\" appears.\n- The column indicating \"loss\" for verification of the loss condition.\n- The column indicating \"attendance\" to confirm the attendance figure.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cell information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
