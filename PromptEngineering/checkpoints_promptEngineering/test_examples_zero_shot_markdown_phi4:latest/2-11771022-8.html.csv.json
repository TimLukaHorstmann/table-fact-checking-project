    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify all games where Florida played against Pittsburgh.\n2. Find the attendance for each of these identified games.\n3. Compare this attendance with the attendances from other games listed in the table to see if it is indeed the lowest.\n\nLet's evaluate the relevant parts of the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games between Florida and Pittsburgh\n\nFrom the table, we find:\n- On March 6th, the game was \"pittsburgh vs florida\" with an attendance of 17,012. This corresponds to row index 2.\n\n### Step 2: Check Attendances for All Other Games\n\nNow let's list the attendances for all games (including the one identified):\n\n| Date     | Attendance |\n|----------|------------|\n| March 2  | 15,314     |\n| March 4  | 16,478     |\n| **March 6** | **17,012**   |\n| March 8  | 16,614     |\n| March 12 | 15,233     |\n| March 14 | 19,321     |\n| March 16 | 15,704     |\n| March 20 | 18,546     |\n| March 22 | 18,502     |\n| March 25 | 16,110     |\n| March 27 | 17,301     |\n| March 29 | 17,832     |\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Lowest Attendance\n\nFrom this list:\n- The lowest attendance is 15,233 (March 12 game against NY Islanders), not 17,012.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Florida played Pittsburgh in the game with the lowest attendance\" is false since the Florida vs. Pittsburgh game did not have the lowest attendance; instead, it was higher than several other games listed.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for this determination are:\n- The row where Florida played against Pittsburgh (March 6), particularly noting the \"attendance\" value.\n- Rows of all other games to compare attendances.\n\n**Relevant rows and columns:**\n- March 6 game: `{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n- All other game attendances for comparison:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n  - `{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}`\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
