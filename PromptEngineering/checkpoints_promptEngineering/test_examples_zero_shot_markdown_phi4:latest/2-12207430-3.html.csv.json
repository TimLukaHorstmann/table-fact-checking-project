    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about a Kansas City Royals victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th and its impact on the Blue Jays' record, we need to verify several conditions:\n\n1. The game between Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays must have occurred on May 12.\n2. The result of this game should be a victory for the Kansas City Royals.\n3. This victory should adjust the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 record to 18-12.\n\nLet's examine these points using the provided table:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: Check if there is an entry dated \"may 12\" involving the Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays.\n   - Upon examining the table, row with `date: may 12` involves \"royals\" as the opponent and not the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\n2. **Opponent Verification**: Identify which team played against whom on May 12.\n   - In the row for `date: may 12`, the opponent is listed as \"royals,\" indicating that the game was between the home team (not specified but inferred from context) and the Royals, not the Blue Jays.\n\n3. **Game Result Verification**: Check if there's a Royals victory on May 12.\n   - The score for `date: may 12` is `3 - 1`, meaning the Royals won that game.\n\n4. **Impact on Record**: Confirm how this result would affect the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 record.\n   - Since the table does not mention a game involving the Blue Jays on May 12, there's no data to support any change in their record due to this specific game.\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n\n- The claim mentions the Kansas City Royals defeating the Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th and resulting in an adjustment of the Blue Jays\u2019 record. However, according to the table:\n  - The game on May 12 involved the Royals, but not the Blue Jays.\n  - There is no mention or implication in the table that a game involving the Blue Jays occurred on this date.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- **The claim is FALSE** because there is no evidence within the provided data supporting any interaction between the Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th, nor any record adjustment for the Blue Jays as claimed.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response with identified cells that help verify this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON shows the relevant row and columns where we confirm that the game involved the Royals but not the Blue Jays on May 12th.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about whether the Kansas City Royals beat a team with an 18 - 12 record after May 12th, we must analyze relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   The claim mentions the date after May 12th when the Royals played against another team (implied to be the Blue Jays). We need to locate all instances where the opponent is \"royals\" after May 12th and check if they won with a record of 18 - 12.\n\n2. **Examine Rows for 'Royals' Post-May 12:**\n   - **May 11**: Royals are opponents, but this date does not satisfy the condition since it\u2019s before May 12.\n   - **May 12**: Royals are opponents; however, the record remains at \"18 - 11\" after the game. This is also before or on May 12 and thus irrelevant for our condition.\n   \n3. **Check Record Post-Games with 'Royals':**\n   There are no entries where the Royals played as opponents after May 12th in this table.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since there are no rows where \"royals\" appear as an opponent after May 12th, and thus no change in record to \"18 - 12\" following such a game against them or any other team implied to be the Blue Jays, the claim is unsupported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells for examining this are the ones involving games against the Royals on May 11th and May 12th, specifically focusing on the \"date,\" \"opponent,\" and \"record\" columns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
