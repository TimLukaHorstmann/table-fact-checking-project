This corresponds to the first row (row index 0).\n\n- Next, check the value in the \"incoming head coach\" and \"date of appointment\" columns for this row:\n  - The incoming head coach should be \"pedro caixinha\".\n  - The date of appointment should be \"10 july 2010\".\n\nNow let's verify these:\n\n- In the first row (row index 0), we find:\n  - Team: uni\u00e3o de leiria\n  - Incoming head coach: pedro caixinha\n  - Date of appointment: 10 july 2010\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in this row.
