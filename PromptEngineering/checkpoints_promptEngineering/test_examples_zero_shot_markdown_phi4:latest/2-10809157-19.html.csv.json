Identify the row where the venue is \"western oval\":\n      - From the table, we see that the row with \"venue: western oval\" corresponds to:\n        ```markdown\n        | home team   | home team score   | away team       | away team score   | venue          | crowd | date           |\n        | footscray   | 14.10 (94)        | essendon        | 12.10 (82)        | western oval   | 16043 | 23 august 1969 |\n        ```\n      - This is the last row of the table, i.e., row index 5.\n\n   b.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check specific conditions against the data provided in the markdown table:\n\n1. **Carlton's Score**: The claim states that \"carlton score 20.7\". We should look for Carlton as the home team and verify if their score was indeed \"20.7\".\n\n2. **Opponent Team**: The claim mentions Richmond as the opposing team. Thus, we must ensure that Richmond is listed as the away team in the same row where Carlton's score matches.\n\n3. **Venue Name**: According to the claim, the match took place at \"prince park\". We should confirm that the venue for this particular game was recorded as \"princes park\".\n\n4. **Date Consistency**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the claim, it is implicitly understood that all conditions must occur on the same date if multiple matches are listed.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions by checking the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Identification**: Look for Carlton as the home team. In row index 2:\n  - Home Team: \"carlton\"\n  - Home Team Score: \"20.7 (127)\"\n  - Away Team: \"richmond\"\n  - Venue: \"princes park\"\n\n- **Score Verification**: The score \"20.7\" matches exactly with the data in row 2.\n\n- **Opponent Check**: Richmond is listed as the away team in row 2, which aligns with the claim.\n\n- **Venue Name Verification**: The venue \"princes park\" matches the claim's mention of \"prince park\", considering it might be a minor discrepancy or typo.\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data in row 2.
