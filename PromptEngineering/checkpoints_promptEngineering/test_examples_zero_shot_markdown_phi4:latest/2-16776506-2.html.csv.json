The claim is: \"Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent in the final on a hard surface on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand.\"\n\nWe will break down the claim into its components and check them one by one:\n\n1. **Date**: The date given in the claim is 6 February 2000.\n2. **Location**: The location mentioned is Wellington, New Zealand.\n3. **Surface**: The surface specified is hard.\n4. **Opponent**: The opponent named is Mirielle Dittmann.\n\nNext, we will identify the relevant row(s) in the table that match these conditions:\n\n- The date \"6 February 2000\" appears in Row 2 of the table.\n- In Row 2, the location \"Wellington, New Zealand\" matches the claim.\n- The surface is listed as \"hard,\" which also matches the claim.\n- The opponent in the final is listed as \"Mirielle Dittmann,\" which aligns with the claim.\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are met by Row 2. However, the outcome for this row is \"runner-up,\" not \"winner.\" Since the claim does not specify an outcome (like being a winner or runner-up), we only need to ensure that the other conditions match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table, and the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells from Row 2 are:\n- Date\n- Location\n- Surface\n- Opponent in final\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
