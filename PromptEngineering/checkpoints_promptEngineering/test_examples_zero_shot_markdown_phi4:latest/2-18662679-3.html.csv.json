    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate the times listed in the table for Russia and Estonia, as well as check if their time difference is less than 3 seconds.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - Russia's row (rank 3) has a time of \"5:39.18\".\n   - Estonia's row (rank 4) has a time of \"5:42.22\".\n\n2. **Calculate the time difference between Russia and Estonia:**\n   - Convert both times to seconds for easier comparison.\n     - Russia: \\(5 \\times 60 + 39.18 = 339.18\\) seconds\n     - Estonia: \\(5 \\times 60 + 42.22 = 342.22\\) seconds\n\n3. **Compute the difference in time:**\n   - Difference: \\(342.22 - 339.18 = 3.04\\) seconds.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that the closest time is between Estonia and Russia, with a difference of less than 3 seconds.\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of 3.04 seconds, which is not less than 3 seconds.\n\nSince the calculated time difference does not satisfy the condition in the claim, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Row index 3 (Russia), Column: \"time\"\n- Row index 4 (Estonia), Column: \"time\"\n\nThe final JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
