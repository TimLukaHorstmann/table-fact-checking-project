    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each part of it against the provided table.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\n1. **\"essendon play an away game at windy hill\":**\n   - Look for a row where the \"home team\" is \"windy hill\".\n   - Check if in this row, the \"away team\" is \"essendon\".\n\n2. **\"hawthorn play at vfl park\":**\n   - Find the row where \"hawthorn\" is listed as either the home or away team.\n   - Verify that the \"venue\" for this match is \"vfl park\".\n\n### Evaluation Using the Table\n\n- For **essendon**:\n  - The table shows essendon as the \"home team\" with \"home team score\" and venue \"windy hill\". Therefore, they are playing a home game, not an away game.\n\n- For **hawthorn**:\n  - In the last row of the table, hawthorn is listed as the \"home team\" with the \"venue\" being \"vfl park\". This part of the claim is correct since Hawthorn plays at VFL Park in this instance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim contains one true statement and one false statement. Since both parts need to be true for the entire claim to be considered true, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table\n\n1.
