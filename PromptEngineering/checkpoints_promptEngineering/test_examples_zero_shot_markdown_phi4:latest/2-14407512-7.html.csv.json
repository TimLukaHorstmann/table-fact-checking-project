The value here is **130**.\n- Check the value in the **2nd (m)** column for Andreas Kofler. The value here is **139**.\n\n#### Verification:\n1. **1st (m) > 124.5:**\n   - For Andreas Kofler, the value in the \"1st (m)\" column is **130**, which is indeed greater than **124.5**.\n   \n2. **2nd (m) > 136:**\n   - For Andreas Kofler, the value in the \"2nd (m)\" column is **139**, which is also greater than **136**.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the data from the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The cells we examined to verify this claim are located at row index 4 for both \"1st (m)\" and \"2nd (m)\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
