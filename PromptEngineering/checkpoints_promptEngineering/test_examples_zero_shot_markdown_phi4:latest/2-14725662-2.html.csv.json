    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the game against Michigan took place at Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN,\" we need to verify two aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify which row corresponds to the game against Michigan.\n2. Check the 'site' column for this specific row to confirm if it mentions \"memorial stadium minneapolis , mn.\"\n\nLet's go through the process step by step:\n\n- First, locate the row where the opponent is \"michigan.\" From the table, this is found in row index 8 (considering the first row as index 0):\n  - Date: 11 / 21 / 1931\n  - Opponent: michigan\n  - Site: michigan stadium ann arbor , mi\n  - Result: l0 - 6\n  - Attendance: 37251\n\n- Next, examine the 'site' column for this row. It lists \"michigan stadium ann arbor , mi,\" not \"memorial stadium minneapolis , mn.\"\n\nSince the site is different from what the claim states, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The opponent column at row index 8.\n- The site column at row index 8.\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
