The claim focuses on identifying the home team for Round 1.\n2. According to the table, the data structure is as follows:\n   - Column names include: `round`, `date`, `home team`, `score`, `away team`, `attendance`, and `stadium`.\n3. We need to check the \"home team\" column under Row 0 (since markdown tables are zero-indexed) to verify which team is listed as playing at home in Round 1.\n\nLet's examine the relevant cell:\n- **Row Index**: 0\n- **Column Name**: \"home team\"\n- The content of this cell: \"pohang steelers\"\n\nThe cell indicates that Pohang Steelers are indeed the home team for Round 1. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the JSON response reflecting our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify all the rows where Pohang Steelers are mentioned as the away team.\n2. Determine if round 5 is indeed their last away game by checking subsequent rounds for any other games listed with them as the away team.\n\nLet's examine each row of interest:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Home Team: Pohang Steelers\n  - Away Team: Adelaide United\n\n  This indicates a home game for Pohang Steelers in round 1.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team: Adelaide United\n  - Away Team: Pohang Steelers\n\n  This indicates an away game for Pohang Steelers in round 5.\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - Home Team: Changchun Yatai\n  - Away Team: Adelaide United\n\n  Neither the home nor away team is Pohang Steelers, so this row is not relevant to their games.\n\nBy checking these rows, we see that:\n\n- Round 1 was a home game for Pohang Steelers.\n- Round 5 was an away game for Pohang Steelers.\n\nThere are no other rounds listed where Pohang Steelers play as the away team beyond round 5.
