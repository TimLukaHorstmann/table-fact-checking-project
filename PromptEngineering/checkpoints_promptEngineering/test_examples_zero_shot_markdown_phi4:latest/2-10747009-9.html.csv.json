The difference is \\( |73 - 51| = 22 \\).\n   - **Geelong vs Fitzroy**: Scores are 87 (Geelong) to 80 (Fitzroy). The difference is \\( |87 - 80| = 7 \\).\n   - **Collingwood vs Carlton**: Scores are 83 (Collingwood) to 95 (Carlton). The difference is \\( |83 - 95| = 12 \\).\n\n   The closest game is between Geelong and Fitzroy with a score difference of 7.\n\n2. **Location**: The claim states the location was Glenferrie Oval, but the closest game occurred at Corio Oval.\n\n3. **Teams Involved**: The claim mentions Hawthorn vs Richmond, but the closest game involved Geelong vs Fitzroy.\n\n4. **Scores**: The claim provides scores of 9.6 for Hawthorn and 9.2 for Richmond. The table shows scores as 9.6 (60) for Hawthorn and 9.20 (74) for Richmond. The scores match, but this is irrelevant since the game was not the closest.\n\n5. **Crowd Size**: The claim states a crowd of 17,000, which matches the Essendon vs South Melbourne game, not the Hawthorn vs Richmond game.\n\nBased on these checks, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify are:\n\n- Home team score and away team score for each row to determine the closest game.\n- Venue column to check the location of the closest game.\n- Crowd column to verify the crowd size mentioned in the claim.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
