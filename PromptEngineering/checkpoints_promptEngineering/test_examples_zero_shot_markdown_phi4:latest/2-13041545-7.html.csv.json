Verify if the attendance for these games includes an attendance number of \"10226\", and it is indeed the smallest among them.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Games with Score \"1 - 3\"\nWe will check each row in the table to find entries where the `score` column matches \"1 - 3\":\n\n- **Row 11**: score is \"1 - 2\" (not a match)\n- **Row 12**: score is \"8 - 5\" (not a match)\n- **Row 13**: score is \"4 - 7\" (not a match)\n- **Row 14**: score is \"2 - 4\" (not a match)\n- **Row 15**: score is \"6 - 3\" (not a match)\n- **Row 16**: score is \"5 - 2 (13)\" (not a match)\n- **Row 17**: score is \"3 - 7\" (not a match)\n- **Row 18**: score is \"3 - 2\" (not a match)\n- **Row 19**: score is \"6 - 4\" (not a match)\n- **Row 20**: score is \"1 - 3\" \u2192 Match\n- **Row 21**: score is \"4 - 1\" (not a match)\n- **Row 22**: score is \"7 - 1\" (not a match)\n- **Row 23**: score is \"12 - 6\" (not a match)\n- **Row 24**: score is \"5 - 6\" (not a match)\n- **Row 25**: score is \"2 - 7\" (not a match)\n- **Row 26**: score is \"3 - 4\" (not a match)\n- **Row 27**: score is \"2 - 4\" (not a match)\n- **Row 28**: score is \"3 - 10\" (not a match)\n- **Row 29**: score is \"0 - 1\" (not a match)\n- **Row 30**: score is \"3 - 5\" (not a match)\n\nFrom this, we find that only Row 20 has the score of \"1 - 3\".\n\n### Step 2: Check Attendance for Matches\nNow, we check the `attendance` column in Row 20:\n\n- **Row 20**: attendance is \"10226\"\n\nSince Row 20 is the only row with a score of \"1 - 3\", its attendance value of \"10226\" is trivially the smallest (and indeed the only one).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim that \"10226 be the smallest attendance of a game that have a score of 1 - 3\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Row Index 19**: refers to the score \"1 - 3\".\n- **Row Index 19**: also has the attendance of \"10226\".",
