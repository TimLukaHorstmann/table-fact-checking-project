The fighter's last win was in the year 2001.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions one by one using relevant data from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: First Loss in 2003\n- We examine the \"date\" column to identify when losses occur:\n  - Row 6 has a date of 2003, and it is labeled as a loss against \"junior pitbull\".\n  - Row 7 also indicates a loss with a specific date: \"4 November 2003\", against \"zuluzinho\".\n\nSince both row 6 and row 7 are losses in the year 2003, this confirms that the fighter's first recorded loss happened in 2003.\n\n### Condition 2: Last Win in 2001\n- We examine the \"date\" column to identify when wins occur:\n  - Row 5 shows a win against \"luigi maiolini\" in 1999.\n  - There are no entries for wins in the year 2001.\n\nThe table does not have any records of wins after 1999, and there are no wins recorded in 2001. Therefore, the claim that the last win was in 2001 is incorrect because the last win mentioned is from 1999.\n\nBased on this analysis, the first condition is satisfied (first loss in 2003), but the second condition is not (last win was not in 2001).\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE.
