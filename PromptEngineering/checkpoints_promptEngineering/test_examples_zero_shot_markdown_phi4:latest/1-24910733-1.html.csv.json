    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim that \"all of the episode list originally air before November 2007,\" we need to examine the \"original air date\" column for each row in the table. Specifically, we will check if any episodes have an original air date in November 2007 or later.\n\nHere is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Row 2**: \n   - Original Air Date: October 3, 2007\n   - This episode aired before November 2007.\n\n2. **Row 3**:\n   - Original Air Date: October 10, 2007\n   - This episode aired before November 2007.\n\n3. **Row 4**:\n   - Original Air Date: October 17, 2007\n   - This episode aired before November 2007.\n\n4. **Row 5**: \n   - Original Air Date: October 24, 2007\n   - This episode aired before November 2007.\n\n5. **Row 6**:\n   - Original Air Date: October 31, 2007\n   - This episode aired before November 2007.\n\n6. **Row 7**: \n   - Original Air Date: November 14, 2007\n   - This episode aired in November 2007.\n   \n7. **Row 8**:\n   - Original Air Date: November 21, 2007\n   - This episode aired in November 2007.\n\nThe claim states that all episodes originally aired before November 2007. However, rows 7 and 8 have air dates of November 14, 2007, and November 21, 2007, respectively. Therefore, the claim is false as these two episodes aired during November 2007.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for determining this are from row indexes 6 and 7 in the \"original air date\" column.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding viewership numbers in a TV series episode table, we will analyze the relevant parts of the claim and verify them against the data provided.\n\nThe claim has two main assertions:\n1. \"The 3rd episode have the second highest number of viewer.\"\n2. \"The 8th episode have the highest.\"\n\nTo evaluate these assertions:\n\n**Assertion 1: The 3rd episode have the second highest number of viewers**\n- Look at the \"no in series\" column to identify which row corresponds to the 3rd episode.\n- The 3rd episode is in the third row (index 2, considering 0-based indexing).\n- Check the \"us viewers (millions)\" for this row: it lists 12.4 million viewers.\n- Now compare this number with the viewership numbers of all other episodes to confirm if 12.4 million is indeed the second highest:\n  - Episode 1: 12.3 million\n  - **Episode 2 (Row Index 2, Column \"us viewers (millions)\": 12.4 million)**\n  - Episode 3: 11.81 million\n  - Episode 4: 11.77 million\n  - Episode 5: 11.21 million\n  - Episode 6: 11.45 million\n  - Episode 7: 8.44 million\n- The highest viewership is 12.3 million (Episode 1), so the second highest is indeed 12.4 million, which corresponds to Episode 3.\n\n**Assertion 2: The 8th episode have the highest**\n- Look at the \"no in series\" column to identify which row corresponds to the 8th episode.\n- The 8th episode is in the eighth row (index 7).\n- Check the \"us viewers (millions)\" for this row: it lists 8.44 million viewers.\n- Compare this number with all other episodes to determine if it's indeed the highest:\n  - Episode 1: 12.3 million\n  - Episode 2: 12.4 million\n  - Episode 3: 11.81 million\n  - Episode 4: 11.77 million\n  - Episode 5: 11.21 million\n  - Episode 6: 11.45 million\n  - **Episode 7 (Row Index 7, Column \"us viewers (millions)\": 8.44 million)**\n- The highest is actually 12.4 million, not 8.44 million.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Assertion 1 is TRUE.\n- Assertion 2 is FALSE.\n\nThe overall claim is FALSE because the second part of the assertion is incorrect. We need to identify and list the relevant cells for verification:\n\nRelevant cells are those used in the comparison process:\n- \"us viewers (millions)\" for each episode, specifically checking rows 1, 2, and 7 for determining the highest and second-highest values.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
