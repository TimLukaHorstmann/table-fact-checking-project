We disregard this as well.\n- **Week 4**: Result is \"l 16 - 14\", indicating a loss, so no need to consider the score here either.\n- **Week 5**: Result is \"l 24 - 20\". This is also a loss and won't be considered.\n\nThe only winning game from weeks 1 through 5 has a team score of 28 points in week 1.
