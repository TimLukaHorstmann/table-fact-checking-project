Both these teams played on August 13th, 1966.\n\nWe will check each relevant row in the table for these conditions.\n\n- In Row 0:\n  - Home Team: St Kilda\n  - Away Team: South Melbourne\n  - Date: 13 August 1966\n\n- In Row 1:\n  - Home Team: Essendon\n  - Away Team: Fitzroy\n  - Date: 13 August 1966\n\n- **In Row 2** (this row is directly relevant):\n  - Home Team: Collingwood\n  - Away Team: North Melbourne\n  - Date: 13 August 1966\n  \nThis matches the claim, as it states that on August 13th, 1966, the away team was North Melbourne and the home team was Collingwood.\n\n- In Row 3:\n  - Home Team: Carlton\n  - Away Team: Melbourne\n  - Date: 13 August 1966\n\n- In Row 4:\n  - Home Team: Richmond\n  - Away Team: Geelong\n  - Date: 13 August 1966\n\n- In Row 5:\n  - Home Team: Hawthorn\n  - Away Team: Footscray\n  - Date: 13 August 1966\n\nSince the condition in row 2 matches exactly with the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are located in Row 2 under \"home team,\" \"away team,\" and \"date.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
