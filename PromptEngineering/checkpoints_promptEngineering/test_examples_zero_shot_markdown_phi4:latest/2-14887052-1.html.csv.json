Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: We look through each row of the table to find where the \"just ratio\" is listed as \"16:13\".\n2. **Verify Claimed Value**: Once we locate this row, we will verify if the corresponding value for \"size (steps)\" is 12.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n- The first relevant entry in our search should have a \"just ratio\" of \"16:13\". Scanning through the table, we find it at:\n  - Row index 11 (counting starts from 0), where the \"just ratio\" is listed as \"16:13\".\n\n- Next, we check the value for \"size (steps)\" in this row.

The highest \"size (steps)\" associated with this ratio.\n2. Whether the error value for this size is +6.31.\n\nLet's examine each condition:\n\n### Step 1: Identify entries with the ratio \\(16:13\\)\n\nFrom the provided table, locate rows where the \"just ratio\" column equals \\(16:13\\):\n\n- **Row 11**:\n  - \"interval name\": inverted 13th harmonic\n  - \"size (steps)\": 12\n  - \"error\": +8.25\n\n### Step 2: Verify the conditions in the claim\n\n1. **Size (Steps) Condition**: The claim states that the highest size (steps) for ratio \\(16:13\\) should be 12. From step 1, we observe that there is only one entry with this ratio and it indeed has a size of steps equal to 12.\n\n2. **Error Condition**: The claim specifies an error value of +6.31. However, the row identified (row 11) has an error of +8.25, not +6.31.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe first condition is met because there's no higher step size than 12 for ratio \\(16:13\\). However, the second condition is not satisfied as the error value is +8.25, not +6.31.\n\nTherefore, based on the information and verification, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells involved in verifying the claim:\n\n- **Row Index**: 11\n  - Column \"size (steps)\": Value = 12\n  - Column \"error\": Value = +8.25\n\nThe JSON output is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"size (steps)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"error\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
