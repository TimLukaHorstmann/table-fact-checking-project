    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the most number of games occur before the 1947 championship\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and count the number of games played in each final match up until and including 1946. Then compare these counts with those from matches after 1947.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - We are interested in counting the games for matches before and including 1947, and then comparing them to those after 1947.\n\n2. **Count Games Before and Including 1947:**\n   - 1942 Match:\n     - Score: \"2 - 6 , 2 - 6 , 2 - 6\"\n     - Number of games = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n   - 1946 Match:\n     - Score: \"6 - 3 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 1\"\n     - Number of games = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n   - 1947 Match:\n     - Score: \"3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 10 - 8 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3\"\n     - Number of games = 3 + 3 + 18 + 4 + 6 = 34\n\n   Total games before and including 1947 = 9 (1942) + 9 (1946) + 34 (1947) = 52\n\n3. **Count Games After 1947:**\n   - 1948 Match:\n     - Score: \"12 - 14 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 3 - 6\"\n     - Number of games = 26 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 35\n   - 1949 (Wembley Pro) Match:\n     - Score: \"6 - 2 , 4 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 4 - 6\"\n     - Number of games = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12\n   - 1949 (US Pro) Match:\n     - Score: \"9 - 7 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5\"\n     - Number of games = 16 + 3 + 3 + 12 = 34\n\n   Total games after 1947 = 35 (1948) + 12 (1949 Wembley Pro) + 34 (1949 US Pro) = 81\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - Games before and including 1947: 52\n   - Games after 1947: 81\n\nThe claim is that the most number of games occur before the 1947 championship, which is not true as there are more games played after 1947.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim is FALSE.\n  \n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this, we need to look at all rows with scores and determine the number of games in each final. Therefore, the relevant cells include the \"score in the final\" column for all years provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
