    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each condition in the claim and compare it with the data in the table.\n\n1. The first part of the claim states \"the packer\" which refers to the Green Bay Packers team.\n2. It mentions that they scored \"the least amount of point (6)\" during a game.\n3. Finally, it specifies the opponent as \"versus the lion,\" which is likely referring to the Detroit Lions.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the table:\n\n- The first occurrence where the \"Green Bay Packers\" are mentioned in the \"opponent\" column is in week 4 (row index 3), and they scored 14 points. This score is not the least as we're looking for a game with only 6 points scored.\n- In week 8 (row index 7), the Green Bay Packers played again, this time the Lions are the opponents (\"green bay packers\" in the opponent column, which seems to be an error since they can't play against themselves) and they scored 6 points. This is indeed the lowest score mentioned for a game involving the Packers.\n- The claim also says \"versus the lion,\" but there's no team listed as \"lions\" or \"detroit lions\" in the table. However, based on common knowledge about NFL teams, it is reasonable to infer that when the table refers to \"green bay packers,\" the opponent should have been the Detroit Lions since they are known rivals and this is a well-known matchup.\n- The claim does not contain any other specific conditions that we need to check against the table.\n\nTherefore, according to the available data in the table and common knowledge about NFL teams, the Packers scored their least amount of points (6) in week 8. However, there is an issue with the table itself as it lists \"green bay packers\" as both the team playing and the opponent for week 8. This error must be acknowledged in our final assessment.\n\nTaking into account that we are inferring that the opponent should have been the Detroit Lions based on common knowledge, despite the lack of explicit mention in the table, and acknowledging the error in the \"opponent\" column, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE with regards to the score being 6 points. However, the accuracy regarding the specific opponent (Detroit Lions) is inferred rather than directly supported by the data provided.\n\nHere's our JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The table error regarding the opponent for week 8 has been acknowledged but is not directly addressed in the JSON response since the claim's accuracy is based on inferred information.",
