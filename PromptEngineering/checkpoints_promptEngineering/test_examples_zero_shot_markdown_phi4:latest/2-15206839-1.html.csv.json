    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Ipatinga in the provided table, we need to focus on two specific conditions mentioned:\n\n1. **\"Ipatinga have lost more than 14 games\":**\n   - We look at the \"lost\" column for the row corresponding to Ipatinga.\n   - The table shows that Ipatinga has a value of 21 in the \"lost\" column.\n\n2. **\"drawn 8\":**\n   - We look at the \"drawn\" column for the same row.\n   - The table indicates that Ipatinga has a value of 8 in the \"drawn\" column.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions:\n\n- For the first condition (\"lost more than 14 games\"), since Ipatinga lost 21 games, this is indeed more than 14. Therefore, this part of the claim is true.\n  \n- For the second condition (\"drawn 8\"), since Ipatinga has drawn exactly 8 games, this part of the claim is also true.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied according to the table data.\n\nNext, identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The row index for Ipatinga in the table is 19 (since indexing starts from 0).\n- The column name \"lost\" corresponds to the first condition.\n- The column name \"drawn\" corresponds to the second condition.\n\nBased on this analysis, both conditions are fully supported by the data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data for the team \"sport\" in the table provided.\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"sport have a difference of 3 with 52 point\"\n\nLet's break down what needs to be checked against the table:\n\n1. **Points Check**:\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to \"sport\".\n   - Verify if the team has 52 points.\n   \n2. **Difference Check**:\n   - Again, locate the row for \"sport\".\n   - Verify if the difference is indeed 3.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The row index for \"sport\" is 11 (considering the first row as index 0).\n- In this row, under the 'team' column, it lists \"sport\".\n- Under the 'points' column, it shows 52.\n- Under the 'difference' column, it shows 3.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is true. The relevant cells to verify this information are:\n\n- Points (row index 11, column name \"points\")\n- Difference (row index 11, column name \"difference\")\n\nThus, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of it against the table:\n\n1. **Claim about \"ipitanga\"**: The team name in the table is spelled as \"ipatinga\", not \"ipitanga\". Therefore, any reference to a different spelling would lead us to investigate further.\n\n2. **Points and Games Played**:\n   - According to the claim, the team achieved 75 points with fewer than 30 games played.\n   - In the table, \"ipatinga\" (or the misspelled \"ipitanga\") has 35 points after playing 38 games. Therefore, it's impossible for them to have 75 points in this dataset.\n\n3. **Number of Games Lost**:\n   - The claim states they lost 17 games.\n   - In the table, \"ipatinga\" indeed lost 21 games, not 17.\n\nGiven these checks:\n\n- The spelling mismatch suggests that we should verify if another team could fit the description given by the claim. \n- No other team in the table has 75 points or fewer than 30 games played.\n- None of the teams have exactly 17 losses while having 75 points and less than 30 games played.\n\nSince none of these conditions are met for any team, the claim is false. The relevant cells to check would be those concerning \"ipatinga\" since it seems like a misspelling issue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
