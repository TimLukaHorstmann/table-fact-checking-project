    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"both week 8 and week 10 didn't have a game or opponent,\" we need to examine the table for entries corresponding to weeks 8 and 10.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: The \"week\" column indicates which row corresponds to which week. We are specifically interested in the rows that match week 8 and week 10.\n\n2. **Examine each week**:\n   - Week 8: Scan through the table, but there is no entry for week 8.\n   - Week 10: There is an entry where \"week\" equals 10. The opponent listed is \"green bay packers,\" and the result shows a loss (l 29 - 16), with attendance recorded.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - For week 8, there is no game or opponent mentioned in the table.\n   - For week 10, there is a game against the green bay packers, contradicting part of the claim that both weeks did not have games or opponents.\n\nSince week 10 does indeed have a game and an opponent, the entire claim is false. \n\n**Relevant cells for verification**:\n- Row index corresponding to week 8: This row is missing.\n- Row index for week 10: The relevant columns are \"week,\" \"opponent,\" and \"result.\"\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this analysis will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each part of it against the given table:\n\n1. **Score Condition**: The claim states that when the score is \"9 - 7\", this occurs in week 10.\n   - We check all rows for a result where one team's score is 9 and the other's is 7.\n\n2. **Week Condition**: According to the claim, such a match must occur in week 10.\n   - Identify if any row with the score \"9 - 7\" corresponds to week 10.\n\n3. **Opponent Condition**: The opponent for this specific game should be \"san diego chargers\".\n   - For the identified row where the scores are \"9 - 7\", verify that the opponent listed is indeed \"san diego chargers\".\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the table:\n\n- **Score Check**:\n  - Row 9 (Week 9): Result is \"l 9 - 7\" against \"kansas city chiefs\".\n  - Row 10 (Week 10): Result is \"l 29 - 16\" against \"green bay packers\".\n\nThe score \"9 - 7\" appears in row 9, not row 10.\n\n- **Week Check**:\n  - The score \"9 - 7\" does not appear in week 10; it's in week 9.\n\n- **Opponent Check**:\n  - In the row where the score is \"9 - 7\", the opponent is \"kansas city chiefs\", not \"san diego chargers\".\n\nSince none of these conditions are satisfied (the scores, week, and opponent do not match as per the claim), we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
