In the table, under the \"matches\" column for Mark Taylor (last row), it shows a value of 113, which corresponds with the claim.\n\n2. **Number of Innings**: The claim specifies 110 innings. According to the table, in the \"innings\" column for Mark Taylor, there is an entry of 110, matching the claim.\n\n3. **Batting Average**: Lastly, the batting average claimed is 32.23. In the table, under the \"average\" column for Mark Taylor, this value is indeed 32.23, confirming the claim.\n\nAll these relevant pieces of data from the table align with what is stated in the claim.
