    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the seattle seahawks play against the new york jet on sunday, november 27,\" we need to examine the table for entries corresponding to November 27 and verify which team played on that date.\n\n1. **Identify relevant column**: The columns relevant to verifying this claim are \"date\" (to identify if the game is on November 27) and \"opponent\" (to confirm which team is playing).\n\n2. **Locate the row with the correct date**:\n   - Look for the row where the \"date\" is \"sunday november 27\".\n\n3. **Verify the opponent**:\n   - Check the \"opponent\" column in that row to see if it lists the \"new york jets\".\n\n4. **Check if Seattle Seahawks are mentioned**:\n   - Confirm whether the \"seattle seahawks\" are mentioned as playing on November 27, either directly or indirectly.\n\nNow, let's apply this process:\n\n- In row 11, we have:\n  - \"date\": sunday november 27\n  - \"opponent\": new york jets\n\nThis confirms that on Sunday, November 27, the team played against the New York Jets.
