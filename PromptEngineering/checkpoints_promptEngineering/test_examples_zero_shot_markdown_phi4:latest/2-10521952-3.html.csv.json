    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding competitions held at \"stadio olimpico, serravalle\", we need to examine each row in the provided table and identify if there are multiple entries with this venue.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**:\n   - Scan through each row in the table to find matches for the column \"venue\" equal to \"stadio olimpico, serravalle\".\n\n2. **Check for duplicates**:\n   - Count how many times \"stadio olimpico, serravalle\" appears as a venue.\n\n3. **Verify competition uniqueness**:\n   - For each occurrence of \"stadio olimpico, serravalle\", check the \"competition\" column to see if there are different competitions listed for this venue.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Venue is \"szusza stadium , budapest\".\n- Row 1: Venue is \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\".\n- **Row 2**: Venue is \"stadio olimpico , serravalle\", Competition is \"uefa euro 2012 qualifying\".\n- Row 3: Venue is \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\".\n- Row 4: Venue is \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\".\n- Row 5: Venue is \"estadi comunal , andorra la vella\".\n- Row 6: Venue is \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\".\n\nFrom the table, \"stadio olimpico , serravalle\" appears only once in row 2 with the competition \"uefa euro 2012 qualifying\". There are no other rows indicating a different competition at this venue.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there be \"2 competition at stadio olimpico, serravalle\" is not supported by the data. The answer is FALSE.\n\nHere's the relevant cell for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of it against the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Result:** \"when the result be 1 - 1\"\n   - We look for a row where the 'result' column equals \"1 - 1\".\n\n2. **Date:** \"the date be 8 october 2010\"\n   - The same row should have the 'date' column as \"8 october 2010\".\n\n3. **Score:** \"with a score of 3 - 1\"\n   - In that row, the 'score' column should be \"3 - 1\".\n\n4. **Venue:** \"and venue of pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\"\n   - Finally, the 'venue' in that row should be \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\".\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Result = 1 - 1:**\n  - Looking at the table, only one entry has a result of \"1 - 1\" which is on row index 6.\n\n- **Date = 8 october 2010:**\n  - On row index 6, the date is \"16 october 2012\", not \"8 october 2010\".\n\nSince the 'date' does not match, we do not need to check further conditions for this part of the claim.\n\n- **Score = 3 - 1:**\n  - On row index 6, the score is \"1 - 1\", which also doesn't match \"3 - 1\".\n\n- **Venue = pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest:**\n  - The venue on row index 6 is indeed \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\". However, since other conditions do not match, this part becomes irrelevant.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim does not hold true because the date and score conditions are not met. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo verify the claim, we needed to check the following cells:\n- Row index 6 for 'result' (matches \"1 - 1\")\n- Row index 6 for 'date' (does not match \"8 october 2010\")\n- Row index 6 for 'score' (does not match \"3 - 1\")\n- Row index 6 for 'venue' (matches \"pusk\u00e1s stadium , budapest\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
