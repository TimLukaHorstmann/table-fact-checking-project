We will analyze each row and focus on the \"transfer fee\" column.\n\n1. **Identify Players with Transfer Fees:**\n   - **Row 0:** Player - Marcello Trotta, Transfer Fee - 750000\n     - This indicates that Marcello Trotta has a transfer fee.\n   - **Row 1:** Player - Oliver Nicholas, Transfer Fee - free\n     - No transfer fee for Oliver Nicholas.\n   - **Row 2:** Player - Alex Pla, Transfer Fee - undisc\n     - \"undisc\" implies undisclosed, not a standard monetary fee.\n   - **Row 3:** Player - Jorge Guinovart, Transfer Fee - undisc\n     - Similar to row 2, no standard transfer fee.\n   - **Row 4:** Player - J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan, Transfer Fee - undisc\n     - Again, \"undisc\" implies undisclosed, not a standard monetary fee.\n   - **Row 5:** Player - Gunnar Nielsen, Transfer Fee - free\n     - No transfer fee for Gunnar Nielsen.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only player with a specified monetary transfer fee is Marcello Trotta (750000).

It mentions that Marcello Trotta was the only player with a transfer fee during this period.\n\nLet's break down the relevant parts of the claim:\n\n- **Marcello Trotta** is mentioned specifically, so we need to check his row in the table.\n  \n  | date        | pos   | player          | from club        | transfer fee   |\n  |:------------|:------|:----------------|:-----------------|:---------------|\n  | sep 2008    | fw    | marcello trotta | napoli           | 750000         |\n\n  - Marcello Trotta has a recorded transfer fee of \"750000\". This satisfies the part of the claim stating he had a transfer fee.\n\n- Next, we need to check if any other players listed in this table have a transfer fee:\n\n  1. **Oliver Nicholas**:\n     | date        | pos   | player          | from club        | transfer fee   |\n     |:------------|:------|:----------------|:-----------------|:---------------|\n     | 12 oct 2008 | df    | oliver nicholas | arsenal          | free           |\n\n     - Oliver Nicholas joined on a \"free\" transfer, meaning no transfer fee was involved.\n\n  2. **Alex Pla**:\n     | date        | pos   | player          | from club        | transfer fee   |\n     |:------------|:------|:----------------|:-----------------|:---------------|\n     | 20 oct 2008 | mf    | alex pla        | ud cornell\u00e0      | undisc         |\n\n     - \"undisc\" likely stands for undisclosed, indicating no publicly announced transfer fee.\n\n  3. **Jorge Guinovart**:\n     | date        | pos   | player          | from club        | transfer fee   |\n     |:------------|:------|:----------------|:-----------------|:---------------|\n     | 20 oct 2008 | mf    | jorge guinovart | ud cornell\u00e0      | undisc         |\n\n     - Similarly, \"undisc\" indicates no publicly announced transfer fee.\n\n  4. **J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan**:\n     | date        | pos   | player          | from club        | transfer fee   |\n     |:------------|:------|:----------------|:-----------------|:---------------|\n     | 17 feb 2009 | df    | j\u00e9r\u00e9my helan    | rennes           | undisc         |\n\n     - \"undisc\" indicates no publicly announced transfer fee.\n\n  5. **Gunnar Nielsen**:\n     | date        | pos   | player          | from club        | transfer fee   |\n     |:------------|:------|:----------------|:-----------------|:---------------|\n     | 25 feb 2009 | gk    | gunnar nielsen  | blackburn rovers | free           |\n\n     - Joined on a \"free\" transfer, meaning no transfer fee was involved.\n\nFrom the analysis above, Marcello Trotta is indeed the only player with a publicly announced transfer fee. All other players either joined for free or had an undisclosed fee.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"in the 2008 - 09 Manchester City FC season, Marcello Trotta be the only one with a transfer fee\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
