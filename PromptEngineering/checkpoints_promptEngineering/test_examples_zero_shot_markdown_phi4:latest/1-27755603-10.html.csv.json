    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether the Detroit Pistons lost more than eight games during the specified period in their 2010-2011 season as listed in the table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"the detroit piston lose over 8 game[s] during this period of their 2010 - 2011 season.\" This means we need to count how many losses (\"L\") are recorded for Detroit Pistons in this table and check if they exceed eight.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We should focus on the \"game\", \"team\", and \"record\" columns, as these will help us determine:\n   - The games played during the period.\n   - Which team was playing (ensuring it is the Detroit Pistons).\n   - Whether each game resulted in a loss or win.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Game**:\n   - The table lists 13 games from March 1 to March 26, with outcomes and records provided for each game.\n   - We need to check if \"team\" column entries indicate that the Detroit Pistons played these games. \n   - Then, we verify which of these games resulted in a loss by checking the first character in the \"score\" column (i.e., an 'l' indicates a loss).\n\n4. **Counting Losses**:\n   - Game 62: vs Milwaukee \u2013 l\n   - Game 63: vs Minnesota \u2013 l\n   - Game 64: vs Washington \u2013 w\n   - Game 65: vs San Antonio \u2013 l\n   - Game 66: vs Oklahoma City \u2013 l\n   - Game 67: vs Denver \u2013 l\n   - Game 68: vs Toronto \u2013 w\n   - Game 69: vs New York \u2013 w\n   - Game 70: vs Atlanta \u2013 l\n   - Game 71: vs Miami \u2013 l\n   - Game 72: vs Cleveland \u2013 l\n   - Game 73: vs Indiana \u2013 w\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - The Detroit Pistons lost in games 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, and 72.\n   - This totals to 8 losses.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the Pistons lost exactly 8 games during this period, they did not lose \"over\" 8 games. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells correspond to each game's team and score entries indicating a loss.
