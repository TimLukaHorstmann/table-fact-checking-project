Let's identify relevant rows from the table based on:\n   - Competition column for \"1990 world cup qualifying\".\n   - Result column matching \"1 - 0\".\n\n3. Reviewing the table, we have:\n   - Row with date \"november 19 , 1989\" has competition \"1990 world cup qualifying\" and result \"1 - 0\". This is a match.\n\n4. The claim specifically mentions \"1990 world cup qualify\", which likely refers to \"1990 world cup qualifying\". Based on this interpretation, the relevant row for verification is:\n   - Row index: 1\n   - Competition column matches \"1990 world cup qualifying\".\n   - Result column matches \"1 - 0\".\n\n5.
