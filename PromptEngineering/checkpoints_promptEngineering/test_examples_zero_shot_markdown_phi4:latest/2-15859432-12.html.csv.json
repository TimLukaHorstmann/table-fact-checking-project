    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze each row in the table and check if there exists a weight associated with both a block value of 340 and a spike value of 353.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 0 weight value associate with 340 block and 353 spike.\"\n\nLet's break down this process:\n\n1. Identify rows where the `block` is equal to 340.\n2. From these identified rows, further check if any have a `spike` value of 353.\n3. If such rows exist, verify the corresponding `weight`.\n\nNow let\u2019s go through each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: Block = 316, Spike = 351 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 1**: Block = 320, Spike = 340 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 2**: Block = 335, Spike = 356 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 3**: Block = 319, Spike = 337 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 4**: Block = 330, Spike = 353 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 5**: Block = 326, Spike = 354 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 6**: Block = 331, Spike = 345 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 7**: Block = 331, Spike = 351 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 8**: Block = 333, Spike = 353 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 9**: Block = 332, Spike = 357 (Does not match criteria)\n- **Row 10**: Block = 340, Spike = 353 (Matches both block and spike criteria)\n\nIn row 10, the weight is 94. Thus, there exists a weight value associated with a `block` of 340 and a `spike` of 353.\n\nThe claim states that \"there be 0 weight value associate\" which means no such weight should exist. Since we found at least one instance where these criteria are met (row 10), the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to check:\n\n- Row 10:\n  - Block = 340\n  - Spike = 353\n  - Weight = 94\n\nNow, let's present the final JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"block\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"spike\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"weight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
