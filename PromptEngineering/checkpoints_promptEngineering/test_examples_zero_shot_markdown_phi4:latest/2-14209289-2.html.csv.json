    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to carefully examine the table provided.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"after defeat Montreal, Pittsburgh's record be 3 - 0 - 2.\"\n\n1. **Identify the game against Montreal:**\n   - The relevant row in the table is where the home team is Montreal and the score indicates a defeat for Pittsburgh.\n   - From the table:\n     ```\n     | date       | visitor      | score   | home       | record    |\n     | october 15 | montreal     | 2 - 5   | pittsburgh | 3 - 0 - 2 |\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Pittsburgh's record after this game:**\n   - The \"record\" column on October 15 shows Pittsburgh's record as \"3 - 0 - 2\".\n   - This means they had 3 wins, 0 losses, and 2 ties up to that point.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant row for this check is the one corresponding to October 15, where the game against Montreal is listed.\n- Specifically, we need to look at the \"record\" column on that date.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index is 4 (0-based index) for the game against Montreal, and the column name is \"record\" to verify Pittsburgh's record after that game.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate it based on the provided table data.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n\n1. **\"before october 15,\"** indicates that we should only consider games played on or before October 14.\n2. **\"montreal be the visitor in the game\"** means we're looking for a row where \"visitor\" is \"montreal\".\n3. **\"that lead to a 3 - 0 - 2 record\"** specifies that after this game, the \"record\" should read \"3 - 0 - 2\".\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify games before October 15:**\n   - These are the games on:\n     - October 6\n     - October 8\n     - October 10\n\n2. **Check for Montreal as visitor in these games:**\n   - On October 10, \"visitor\" is indeed \"montreal\".\n\n3. **Verify if this game results in a \"3 - 0 - 2\" record:**\n   - After the October 10 game, the \"record\" column reads \"1 - 0 - 2\".\n   - The next update to \"record\" (after the October 13 game) is \"2 - 0 - 2\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no instance where a Montreal visitor game leads directly to a \"3 - 0 - 2\" record before October 15.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are from the rows corresponding to:\n- October 10 (to check if Montreal was the visitor)\n- Any row with a record update after October 10 and before or on October 14 (none exist that fulfill the conditions)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
