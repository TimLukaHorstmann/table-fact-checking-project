Identify what is meant by the \"first game\" and the \"second game.\" Typically, this would mean looking at games sorted chronologically by time.\n2. Sort the games based on their starting times:\n   - The time column contains these entries in order from row 0 to row 4: 10:00, 12:00, 15:00, 14:00, 14:00.\n\n3. After sorting by time:\n   - First game (earliest time): 10:00 (row 0)\n   - Second game (next earliest time): 12:00 (row 1)\n   - Third game (next after that): 14:00 (row 3 or row 4, both have the same time)\n   - Fourth game: 14:00 (the remaining one from row 3 or row 4)\n   - Fifth game: 15:00 (row 2)\n\nFrom this sorted order:\n- The first game starts at 10:00.\n- The second game starts at 12:00.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the first game starts at 14:00 and the second game starts at 14:00\" is FALSE. \n\nNext, identify which cells (rows) are relevant to verify this claim:\n- For the first part of the claim (\"the first game starts at 14:00\"), we need to look at rows containing \"time\": 10:00, 12:00, 15:00.\n- For the second part of the claim (\"the second game starts at 14:00\"), similarly, we check against the same times but in sequence.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 0 (time: 10:00) - first game time\n- Row index 1 (time: 12:00) - second game time\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
