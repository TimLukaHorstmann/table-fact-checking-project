However, we've found that the actual highest attendance occurred in Week 4.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Week 4 has a higher attendance than Week 7, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The cell corresponding to Week 4's attendance: Row Index 3 (since weeks start from index 0), Column Name \"attendance\".\n   - The cell corresponding to Week 7's attendance: Row Index 6, Column Name \"attendance\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
