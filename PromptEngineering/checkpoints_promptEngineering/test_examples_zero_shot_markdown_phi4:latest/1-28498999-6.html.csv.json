    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the statement: \"martin laird be not 1 of the 2 who have 24 event.\"\n\nWe need to check two conditions from the table:\n1. Identify players who have exactly 24 events.\n2. Verify if Martin Laird is one of these players and see if there are indeed only two such players.\n\nFirst, let's identify all players with 24 events:\n\n- From row index 1 (player: matt kuchar), the 'events' column has a value of 24.\n- From row index 9 (player: martin laird), the 'events' column also has a value of 24.\n\nThus, there are two players with 24 events:\n- Matt Kuchar\n- Martin Laird\n\nThe claim states that \"martin laird be not 1 of the 2 who have 24 event.\" However, we've identified that Martin Laird is indeed one of the two players who have 24 events.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. \n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- Row index 8 (Martin Laird), column 'events': value is 24.\n- Row index 0 (Matt Kuchar), column 'events': value is 24.\n\nThese are the relevant cells that help us determine the truth of the claim.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
