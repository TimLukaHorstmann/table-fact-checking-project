    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the \"high points\" column of the table, as this column indicates the highest number of points scored by a player in each game.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The \"high points\" column contains information about the maximum points scored by any player in each game.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game**:\n   - Game 3: Vince Carter scored 15 points.\n   - Game 4: Vince Carter scored 19 points.\n   - Game 5: Vince Carter scored 18 points.\n   - Game 6: Vince Carter scored 34 points.\n   - Game 7: Vince Carter scored 33 points.\n   - Game 8: Vince Carter scored 23 points. Others scored 8 points (combined total, not individually).\n   - Game 9: Vince Carter and Lamond Murray each scored 13 points.\n   - Game 10: Chris Bosh scored 25 points.\n   - Game 11: Vince Carter scored 20 points.\n   - Game 12: Vince Carter scored 21 points. Others scored 6 points (combined total, not individually).\n   - Game 13: Vince Carter scored 15 points. Others scored 9 points (combined total, not individually).\n   - Game 14: Vince Carter scored 43 points.\n   - Game 15: Vince Carter scored 20 points. Others scored 8 points (combined total, not individually).\n   - Game 16: Lamond Murray scored 14 points. Chris Bosh scored 10 points.\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum Points Scored**: From the data in the \"high points\" column, the highest score by an individual player is Vince Carter's 43 points during Game 14 against Atlanta.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim**: The claim states that the most points scored by a Raptor in a game is 99. However, based on our analysis of the table, the maximum is 43 points, not 99.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since no player scored 99 points in any game, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Rows**: All rows need to be checked to ensure none has a high point value of 99 or more. Thus, all rows are relevant for verifying this particular claim.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
