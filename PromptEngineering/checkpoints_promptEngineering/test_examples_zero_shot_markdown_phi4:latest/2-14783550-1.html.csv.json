To verify this, we calculate the difference in their gold medal counts:\n   - Difference = Gold medals by China - Gold medals by Iran\n   - Difference = 43 - 4 = 39\n\nSince the calculated difference is exactly 39, the claim matches with the data provided in the table.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells from the table to support this verification:\n\n- The gold medal count for China is found at row index 0 under the \"gold\" column.\n- The gold medal count for Iran is found at row index 1 under the \"gold\" column.\n\nGiven these checks, the claim is accurate based on the data provided in the table.
