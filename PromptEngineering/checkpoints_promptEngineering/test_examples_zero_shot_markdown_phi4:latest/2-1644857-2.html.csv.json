    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the statement:\n\nThe claim consists of two parts:\n1. Scotland has stolen ends less than 9.\n2. Craig Brown is the skip for the United States.\n\nWe'll verify each part against the table provided:\n\n1. **Scotland's Stolen Ends:**\n   - Locate the row where \"scotland\" is listed as the country and check the value in the \"stolen ends\" column.\n   - In the table, under the \"country\" column, Scotland corresponds to `row_index 1`.\n   - The \"stolen ends\" for Scotland is `10`.\n\n2. **Craig Brown's Role:**\n   - Locate the row where \"united states\" is listed as the country and check who the skip is.\n   - In the table, under the \"country\" column, United States corresponds to `row_index 6`.\n   - The \"skip\" for the United States is indeed Craig Brown.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the claim based on these findings:\n\n- The first part of the claim states that Scotland has stolen ends less than 9. We found that Scotland actually has 10 stolen ends, which does not satisfy this condition.\n- The second part of the claim correctly identifies Craig Brown as the skip for the United States.\n\nSince one part of the claim is false (Scotland's stolen ends are not less than 9), the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n1. For Scotland's stolen ends: \n   - `row_index`: 1\n   - `column_name`: \"stolen ends\"\n\n2. For Craig Brown being the skip for the United States:\n   - `row_index`: 6\n   - `column_name`: \"skip\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
