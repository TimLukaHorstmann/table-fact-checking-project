    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table provided in markdown format, we need to verify several components of the claim against the relevant data:\n\n1. **Home Team**: The claim mentions \"fitzroy\" as the home team.\n2. **Away Team**: It states \"south melbourne\" is the away team.\n3. **Score Comparison**:\n   - Fitzyroy's score: 11.22 (88)\n   - South Melbourne's score: 12.15 (87)\n\n4. **Outcome**: The claim indicates that fitzroy loses to south melbourne.\n\nTo verify these points, let's examine the relevant cells from the first row of the table:\n\n- The \"home team\" in the first row is indeed \"fitzroy\".\n- The \"away team\" in the same row is \"south melbourne\".\n- The \"home team score\" shows \"11.22 (88)\".\n- The \"away team score\" shows \"12.15 (87)\".\n\nThe claim states that fitzroy loses to south melbourne, and based on the scores provided:\n- Fitzyroy: 11.22 (88) = 88 points\n- South Melbourne: 12.15 (87) = 87 points\n\nSince 88 is greater than 87, fitzroy actually wins against south melbourne with a score of 88 to 87.
