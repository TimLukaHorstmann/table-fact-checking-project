    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to calculate the average away team score for all games played on 19 June 1971 and compare it with the claimed value of 10.81.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"away team score\" column since we need to compute the average of these scores.\n   - The relevant rows are all rows in the table, as they all correspond to games played on 19 June 1971.\n\n2. **Extract Away Team Scores:**\n   - Convert each away team score from its format (e.g., \"3.5\" or \"8.17\") into a decimal number.\n   - The conversion involves calculating the total points by multiplying the first number by 6 (as each goal is worth 6 points) and adding it to the second number.\n\n3. **Perform Calculations:**\n   - Row 0: North Melbourne's score = 3 * 6 + 5 = 23\n   - Row 1: Geelong's score = 3 * 6 + 3 = 21\n   - Row 2: Fitzroy's score = 8 * 6 + 17 = 65\n   - Row 3: Essendon's score = 11 * 6 + 5 = 71\n   - Row 4: Collingwood's score = 6 * 6 + 10 = 46\n   - Row 5: South Melbourne's score = 2 * 6 + 6 = 18\n\n4. **Calculate the Average:**\n   - Sum of scores = 23 + 21 + 65 + 71 + 46 + 18 = 244\n   - Number of games = 6\n   - Average score = 244 / 6 \u2248 40.67\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Value:**\n   - The claimed average away team score is 10.81, which does not match the calculated average of approximately 40.67.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because the calculated average away team score (approximately 40.67) is significantly different from the claimed value of 10.81.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The margin of victory can be determined by subtracting the away team score from the home team score.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. **Carlton vs North Melbourne**:  \n   - Home Team Score: 114  \n   - Away Team Score: 23  \n   - Margin of Victory: 114 - 23 = 91\n\n2. **St Kilda vs Geelong**:\n   - Home Team Score: 99  \n   - Away Team Score: 21  \n   - Margin of Victory: 99 - 21 = 78\n\n3. **Richmond vs Fitzroy**:\n   - Home Team Score: 47  \n   - Away Team Score: 65  \n   - Margin of Victory: 47 - 65 = -18 (Fitzroy won)\n\n4. **Hawthorn vs Essendon**: \n   - Home Team Score: 104  \n   - Away Team Score: 71  \n   - Margin of Victory: 104 - 71 = 33\n\n5. **Footscray vs Collingwood**:\n   - Home Team Score: 63  \n   - Away Team Score: 46  \n   - Margin of Victory: 63 - 46 = 17\n\n6. **Melbourne vs South Melbourne**: \n   - Home Team Score: 49  \n   - Away Team Score: 18  \n   - Margin of Victory: 49 - 18 = 31\n\nNow, compare the margins:\n\n- Carlton's margin is 91.\n- St Kilda's margin is 78.\n- Richmond has a negative margin (loss).\n- Hawthorn's margin is 33.\n- Footscray's margin is 17.\n- Melbourne's margin is 31.\n\nThe smallest positive margin of victory is for Footscray vs Collingwood, which is 17.
