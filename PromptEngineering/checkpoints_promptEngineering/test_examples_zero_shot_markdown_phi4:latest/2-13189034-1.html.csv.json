We must locate the corresponding row in the table.\n\n2. **Check Relevant Column:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row for July 2007, check Hammond's vehicle entry under the column titled \"Hammond's Vehicle\".\n\n3. **Verify Claim Details:**\n   - The claim specifies that a \"dogsled (with Matty McNair)\" was used by Hammond. We need to confirm if this description matches exactly or closely with what is listed in the table.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- Locate the row where \"month & year\" is \"July 2007\":\n  ```markdown\n  | month & year   | episode                      | title       | hammond 's vehicle                  | clarkson 's vehicle                      | may 's vehicle                                  | back - up                              | budget              |\n  |:---------------|:-----------------------------|:------------|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------|\n  | july 2007      | series 9 , episode 7         | polar special   | dogsled (with matty mcnair )        | 2007 toyota hilux (race winner)          | 2007 toyota hilux (race winner)                 | n / a                                  | n / a               |\n  ```\n\n- In the row for July 2007, Hammond's vehicle is listed as \"dogsled (with matty mcnair)\".
