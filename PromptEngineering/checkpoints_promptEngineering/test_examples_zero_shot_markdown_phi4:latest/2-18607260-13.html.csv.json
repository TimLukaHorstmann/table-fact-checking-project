    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the scores on June 18 and June 28, we need to analyze the relevant rows in the provided table for those specific dates.\n\n1. **Identify Rows by Date:**\n   - The claim refers to two dates: June 18 and June 28.\n   - We will search for these dates in the \"date\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Check Scores on Each Date:**\n   - For each identified date, we need to check the corresponding score from the \"score\" column.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that both games have a score of 2 - 0.\n   - We will verify if this is true for both dates.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- **June 18, 1998:** \n  - Looking at the table, there is no entry for June 18. Therefore, we cannot find any game with a score of 2 - 0 on this date.\n\n- **June 28, 1998:** \n  - The table shows an entry for June 28:\n    - \"score\": 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\n  - This does not match the claimed score of 2 - 0.\n\nSince there is no game on June 18 and the game on June 28 does not have a score of 2 - 0, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- For June 28:\n  - Row index for June 28 entry is 13.\n  - Relevant column is \"score\".\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
