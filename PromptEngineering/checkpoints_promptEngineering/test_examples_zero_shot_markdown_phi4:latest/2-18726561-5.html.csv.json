Thus, this part of the claim is false.\n\n3. **Southampton as Away Team:**\n   - In row 4, Southampton is the away team against West Bromwich Albion on 14 February 1976.\n\n4. **Stoke City in Relation to Southampton:**\n   - No match listed where Stoke City is the home team and Southampton is the away team. Thus, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince neither condition in the claim is satisfied by any matches in the table, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- For Sunderland as home team: Row 9\n- For Chelsea and Sunderland relationship: No matching row\n- For Southampton as away team: Row 4\n- For Stoke City and Southampton relationship: No matching row\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"replay\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
