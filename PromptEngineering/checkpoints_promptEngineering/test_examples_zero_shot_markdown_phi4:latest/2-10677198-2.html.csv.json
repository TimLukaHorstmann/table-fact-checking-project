    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding earthquake magnitudes before February 12, 1953, we need to examine all entries in the table with dates preceding this date and verify if their magnitudes were indeed greater than or equal to 6.5.\n\nHere's a step-by-step examination:\n\n1. **January 23, 1909 (Row Index: 18)**\n   - Magnitude: 7.3\n   - This satisfies the condition as it is greater than 6.5.\n\n2. **May 25, 1923 (Row Index: 17)**\n   - Magnitude: 5.7\n   - This does not satisfy the condition because it is less than 6.5.\n\nSince we found an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.7 before February 12, 1953, which violates the claim that all magnitudes should be at least 6.5, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant rows to verify this are those listed above for January 23, 1909, and May 25, 1923. \n\nNow we will present our findings in JSON format as required:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"magnitude\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
