    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"maher - al shemari coach for kuwait\" is true or false, we need to examine two aspects of the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Coach for Kuwait**: Look at the row where the club name is \"kuwait\" and check the \"coach\" column.\n2. **Verify Maher Al-Shemari's Association**: Check if Maher Al-Shemari is listed as a coach in any part of the table.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Locate the Kuwait Row**: \n   - The row for the club \"kuwait\" is row 2.\n   - In this row, under the \"coach\" column, we find \"dragan\".\n\n2. **Check Maher Al-Shemari's Role**:\n   - Look through each row to see if \"maher al-shemari\" appears in the \"coach\" column.\n   - He is listed as a coach for the club \"al naser\", which is found in row 7.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n- The claim states that Maher Al-Shemari is the coach for Kuwait. However, from the table:\n  - \"dragan\" is the coach for Kuwait (row 2).\n  - Maher Al-Shemari is not associated with Kuwait but with \"al naser\" (row 7).\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n\n- The relevant cells to verify this are from row 2 (\"kuwait\" club) and row 7 (\"al naser\" club), specifically in the \"coach\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON output with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"coach\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
