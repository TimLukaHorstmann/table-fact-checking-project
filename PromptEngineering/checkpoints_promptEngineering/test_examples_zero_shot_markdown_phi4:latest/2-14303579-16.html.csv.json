Let's verify each one:\n\n- For **Dave Hynek**, at row 4, the \"nationality\" is listed as \"canada\", which supports the claim.\n- For **Robin Lang**, at row 5, the \"nationality\" is also listed as \"canada\", further supporting the claim.\n\nSince both players are indeed from Canada according to the table, the claim is supported by the data. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.
