His name is listed as the eighth entry.\n  \n- **Matches Played**:\n  - Check the \"matches\" column for Graham McKenzie (row index 8). The value is 60.\n\n- **Career Span**:\n  - Check the \"career\" column for Graham McKenzie (row index 8).

The total number of \"overs\" bowled by Brett Lee should be 2755.1.\n\nLet's identify the relevant row and columns in the table for these checks:\n\n- **Row for Brett Lee**: This is found at `row_index: 3` (since markdown tables are typically considered to start indexing from 0).\n\n- **Column for \"best\" score**: The column name is \"best\".\n- **Column for \"maidens\"**: The column name is \"maidens\".\n- **Column for \"overs\"**: The column name is \"overs\".\n\nNow, we extract and verify the relevant data:\n\n1.
