The key factors here are:\n\n1. Identifying which rows correspond to games played against the \"Cincinnati Bengals.\"\n2. Verifying whether this match is indeed listed as occurring during \"week 16.\"\n\nLet's examine each row of the table focusing on these conditions:\n\n- **Row Index 0 (Week 1)**: Opponent is \"los angeles rams\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 1 (Week 2)**: Opponent is \"new york giants\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 2 (Week 3)**: Opponent is \"cleveland browns\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 4 (Week 5)**: Opponent is \"minnesota vikings\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 5 (Week 6)**: Opponent is \"dallas cowboys\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 6 (Week 7)**: Opponent is \"washington redskins\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 7 (Week 8)**: Opponent is \"dallas cowboys\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 8 (Week 9)**: Opponent is \"pittsburgh steelers\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 9 (Week 10)**: Opponent is \"philadelphia eagles\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 10 (Week 11)**: Opponent is \"new york giants\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 11 (Week 12)**: Opponent is \"philadelphia eagles\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 12 (Week 13)**: Opponent is \"chicago bears\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 13 (Week 14)**: Opponent is \"houston oilers\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 14 (Week 15)**: Opponent is \"washington redskins\" - Not relevant.\n- **Row Index 15 (Week 16)**: Opponent is \"cincinnati bengals\", and it matches week 16 as specified in the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, the first game against the Cincinnati Bengals occurs during Week 16.
