Verify if Marc Roskin is listed as the director for those episodes.\n\n**Relevant Conditions:**\n- The \"season\" column should be equal to 1 to identify episodes in season 1.\n- The \"directed by\" column should contain \"Marc Roskin\" for any episode that matches the first condition.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 45:** Season is 1, directed by Dean Devlin. Marc Roskin is not the director.\n- **Row 46:** Season is 2. This row does not belong to season 1.\n- **Row 47:** Season is 3. This row does not belong to season 1.\n- **Row 48:** Season is 4.
