    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about North Carolina's scores in the table, we need to verify two specific conditions: \n\n1. The preliminaries score for North Carolina should be 8.068.\n2. The evening gown score for North Carolina should be 8.472.\n\nLet's examine the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Locate \"North Carolina\" in the table, which corresponds to the row with index 7 (considering the first row as state names is index 0).\n- Check the \"preliminaries\" column for this row: The value should be 8.068.\n- Check the \"evening gown\" column for this row: The value should be 8.472.\n\nNow, let's validate these against the table:\n\n1. For \"North Carolina\" (row index 7), the preliminaries score is indeed listed as 8.068.\n2. For \"North Carolina\" (row index 7), the evening gown score is indeed listed as 8.472.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim match the data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 7, column name \"preliminaries\"\n- Row index 7, column name \"evening gown\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
