Identify if there is any other competition listed in the table that takes place in April.\n2. Verify if \"Ballantine's Championship\" is indeed scheduled for April.\n\nLet's examine the relevant column from the table, specifically the \"dates\" column which provides the time frame for each tournament.\n\n### Examination of Dates:\n- **Row 0**: Ballantine's Championship - dates: apr 25 - 28\n- **Row 1**: GS Caltex Maekyung Open - dates: may 9 - 12\n- **Row 2**: SK Telecom Open - dates: may 16 - 19\n- **Row 3**: Happiness Kwangju Bank Open - dates: may 23 - 26\n- **Row 4**: Gunsan CC Open - dates: may 30 - jun 2\n- **Row 5**: Boseong CC Classic - dates: aug 1 - 4\n- **Row 6**: Solaseado Pine Beach Open - dates: aug 8 - 11\n- **Row 7**: KPGA Championship - dates: aug 15 - 18\n- **Row 8**: Dongbu Promi Open - dates: sep 12 - 15\n- **Row 9**: Shinhan Donghae Open - dates: sep 26 - 29\n- **Row 10**: Munsingwear Match Play Championship - dates: oct 4 - 6\n- **Row 11**: CJ Invitational - dates: oct 10 - 13\n- **Row 12**: Kolon Korea Open - dates: oct 17 - 20\n- **Row 13**: Herald Kyj Tour Championship - dates: oct 29 - nov 1\n\nFrom this examination, we see that only the \"Ballantine's Championship\" is scheduled for April.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine two parts of it:\n\n1. **\"September and December be the most popular month to host golf tournament in Korea\":**\n\n   - We should count how many tournaments occur in each month from the \"dates\" column.\n   - Relevant months from the table:\n     - April: 1 tournament\n     - May: 4 tournaments\n     - June: 0 tournaments\n     - August: 3 tournaments\n     - September: 2 tournaments\n     - October: 3 tournaments\n     - November: 1 tournament\n\n   - From this, we see that May has the most tournaments (4). Therefore, September is not one of the months with the most tournaments. December does not have any tournaments listed.\n\n2. **\"Those tournaments be only worth 6 OWGR points on average\":**\n\n   - We need to check if all tournaments in September and October have 6 OWGR points.\n   - From the table:\n     - For September (row indices 9, 10):\n       - Row 9: 6 OWGR points\n       - Row 10: 6 OWGR points\n     - For October (row indices 11, 12, 13):\n       - Row 11: 6 OWGR points\n       - Row 12: 14 OWGR points\n       - Row 13: 14 OWGR points\n\n   - Not all tournaments in September and October have 6 OWGR points since there are entries with 14 OWGR points.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because neither September nor December hosts the most tournaments, and not all tournaments in these months (or just September) average to 6 OWGR points. The relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n- For the tournament count: Dates column for each row.\n- For OWGR points: \"owgr points\" column for rows corresponding to September and October.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"owgr points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"owgr points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"owgr points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"owgr points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"owgr points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
