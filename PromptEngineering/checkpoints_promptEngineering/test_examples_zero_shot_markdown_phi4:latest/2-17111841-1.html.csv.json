    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Episode 4 be the earliest episode number that originally air on June 8, 2008,\" we need to check two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify episodes that aired on June 8, 2008.\n2. Determine if Episode 4 is indeed the first (earliest) episode with this air date.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are:\n- **Row Index:** Look at each row corresponding to an episode's details, focusing particularly on the \"original airdate\" and \"episode\" columns.\n- **Column Name:** Specifically, check the \"episode\" column to verify the episode number and the \"original airdate\" column to find episodes airing on June 8, 2008.\n\nHere is a breakdown of relevant cells:\n\n- Row Index 3:\n  - Column: \"episode\"\n  - Value: 4\n- Row Index 3:\n  - Column: \"original airdate\"\n  - Value: \"8 june 2008\"\n\nUpon checking these conditions, we confirm that Episode 4 is indeed the first episode to be aired on June 8, 2008.\n\nThe claim is supported by this verification. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 june 2008 be 4,\" we need to analyze the data from the table for episodes with the specified airdate and compare their viewership.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Episodes with Airdate \"8 June 2008\":**\n   - From the table, locate rows where \"original airdate\" is \"8 june 2008.\"\n\n2. **Check Viewership Numbers:**\n   - For those episodes, check the \"viewers (millions)\" column to determine which episode had the least viewership.\n\n3. **Verify Episode Number:**\n   - Confirm if this episode with the least viewership has an episode number of 4 as claimed.\n\n**Table Analysis:**\n\n- Row 4 corresponds to \"8 june 2008\" with:\n  - Episode number = 4\n  - Viewers (millions) = 1.364\n\nSince there is only one episode with this airdate, it automatically has the least viewership among episodes with that date.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row index 3 corresponds to episode number 4.\n- Relevant columns are \"original airdate,\" \"viewers (millions),\" and \"episode.\"\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
