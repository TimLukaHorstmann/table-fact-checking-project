    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Francis II be the spouse of the queen who be the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies,\" we need to analyze the relevant information from the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Queen Daughter of Ferdinand I**:\n   - We look for a row in the \"father\" column that matches \"Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\".\n   - This is found at `row_index` 1, where the name is \"Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies\".\n\n2. **Check Francis II's Spouse Status**:\n   - We now need to verify if Francis II is listed as the spouse for this queen.\n   - In the row identified above (`row_index` 1), we check the \"spouse\" column, which lists \"Francis II\".\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies (daughter of Ferdinand I) has Francis II as her spouse.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells for this verification are:\n- The row where the queen's father is \"Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\" (`row_index` 1).\n- The column that provides the name of her spouse (\"spouse\").\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"father\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"spouse\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
