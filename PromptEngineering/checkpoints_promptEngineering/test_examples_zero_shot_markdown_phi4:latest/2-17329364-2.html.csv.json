Verify each condition from the claim against these columns:\n   - The \"outgoing manager\" column confirms it's Miguel Brindisi.\n   - The \"manner of departure\" column states that he resigned, which matches the claim.\n   - The \"date of departure\" is listed as Sep 4, 2008, aligning with the date mentioned in the claim.\n\nAll conditions from the claim are supported by the data in the table.

The claim states: \"the outgoing manager for team necaxa be salvador reyes.\"\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to the team 'necaxa'.**\n   - From the table, necaxa is listed in the fifth row (index 4 if zero-based).\n\n2. **Check the column for 'outgoing manager' to see who it was for necaxa.**\n   - In the fifth row, under the \"outgoing manager\" column, the name listed is salvador reyes.\n\n3. **Verify that this matches with the claim's statement.**\n   - The claim mentions that the outgoing manager should be \"salvador reyes.\" This matches exactly with what we find in the table for necaxa.\n\nSince both the team and the outgoing manager match the details provided in the claim, it is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 4 (fifth row), Column \"team\"\n- Row index 4, Column \"outgoing manager\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"incoming manager, miguel brindisi be hire sep 5 , 2008,\" we need to verify two main components from the table:\n\n1. Identify if Miguel Brindisi is listed as an incoming manager.\n2. Check if the date of hiring for any team with Miguel Brindisi as an incoming manager matches Sep 5, 2008.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n- **Identify Incoming Managers**: We need to find rows where the \"incoming manager\" column lists \"miguel brindisi.\" Upon checking the table, we see that in Row 2 (index starts from 0), \"dar\u00edo franco\" is listed as the incoming manager for Atlas. However, Miguel Brindisi appears in the \"outgoing manager\" column for Atlas in Row 2.\n\n- **Check Date of Hiring**: For any team where Miguel Brindisi might be an incoming manager, we should check if the date matches Sep 5, 2008.\n\nSince there is no instance of Miguel Brindisi listed as an incoming manager, the claim cannot be true. Therefore, we don't need to further verify the date of hiring for this specific name in the role of an incoming manager.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- Row 2, \"incoming manager\" to check who was actually hired (it's not Miguel Brindisi).\n- Row 2, \"date hired\" to ensure that no hiring date matches Sep 5, 2008 for Miguel Brindisi.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row 2, \"incoming manager\"\n2. Row 2, \"date hired\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incoming manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date hired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
