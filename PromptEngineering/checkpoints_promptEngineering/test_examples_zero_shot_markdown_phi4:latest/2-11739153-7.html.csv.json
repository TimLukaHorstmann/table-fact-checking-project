This column indicates who was the deciding factor for each game listed in the table. We will count how many times \"harding\" and \"backstrom\" appear in this column.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Count the occurrences of \"harding\" in the decision column.\n2. Count the occurrences of \"backstrom\" in the decision column.\n3. Compare these counts to see which one is greater.\n\nLet's go through each row and count:\n\n- Row 0: Backstrom\n- Row 1: Backstrom\n- Row 2: Backstrom\n- Row 3: Backstrom\n- Row 4: Harding\n- Row 5: Harding\n- Row 6: Backstrom\n- Row 7: Backstrom\n- Row 8: Backstrom\n- Row 9: Harding\n- Row 10: Backstrom\n- Row 11: Backstrom\n- Row 12: Backstrom\n- Row 13: Backstrom\n\nCount of \"harding\": Rows 4, 5, and 9 (3 times)\n\nCount of \"backstrom\": All other rows except the ones listed for Harding (10 times)\n\nSince Backstrom has more appearances in the decision column than Harding does, the claim is false.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For Harding: Rows 4, 5, and 9\n- For Backstrom: Rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
