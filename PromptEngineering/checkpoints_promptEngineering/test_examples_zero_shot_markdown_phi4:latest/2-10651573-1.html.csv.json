    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the two games with the highest attendance have loss as a result,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the table. Specifically, we should focus on the \"attendance\" and \"result\" columns because the claim concerns both attendance figures and game results.\n\n1. **Identify the Top Two Attendance Figures:**\n   - Examine each row for the highest values in the \"attendance\" column.\n   - From the table:\n     - Week 1: Attendance = 75,000\n     - Week 2: Attendance = 38,741\n     - Week 3: Attendance = 40,175\n     - Week 4: Attendance = 15,456\n     - Week 5: Attendance = 48,105\n     - Week 6: Attendance = 28,201\n     - Week 7: Attendance = 56,543\n\n   - The highest attendance is in week 1 (75,000), and the second-highest is in week 7 (56,543).\n\n2. **Check Results for Top Two Attendances:**\n   - For Week 1:\n     - Result = W (win)\n   - For Week 7:\n     - Result = W (win)\n\n3. **Analyze Claim Validity:**\n   - The claim states that the two games with the highest attendance resulted in losses.\n   - However, both identified games (weeks 1 and 7) were wins.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the claim is false because the games with the highest attendances did not result in losses; they were wins instead. The relevant cells to verify this are from rows corresponding to these weeks and columns for \"attendance\" and \"result.\"\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze specific conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. The claim states: \"the cleveland brown play the detroit lion 2 time.\"\n   - We need to find two occurrences where the opponent is \"detroit lions.\"\n\n2. The claim further specifies results:\n   - \"The result for 1 be a win\" means one of these games should have a 'w' (win) in the result column.\n   - \"The result for the other be a loss\" means the other game should have an 'l' (loss).\n\nLet's verify this using the table:\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Opponent: \"detroit lions\"\n  - Result: \"l 17 - 0\" (a loss)\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Opponent: \"detroit lions at akron\"\n  - Result: \"l 31 - 14\" (a loss)\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Cleveland Browns played against Detroit Lions twice. However, both results were losses ('l'). There is no instance where they won ('w') a game against the Detroit Lions.\n\nThus, the claim does not hold true because there was no win against the Detroit Lions as per the table data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
