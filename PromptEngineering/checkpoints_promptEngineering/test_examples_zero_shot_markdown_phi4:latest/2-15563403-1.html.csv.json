If either condition fails, the claim is false.\n\nLet's examine each column relevant to these parts:\n\n1. **Constitutional Ticket Column:**\n   - Check every cell in this column:\n     - Rows with names should be marked as False.\n     - Rows explicitly marked \"(none)\" are acceptable.\n\n2. **Socialist Ticket Column for William Karlin:**\n   - Locate the row where \"william karlin\" appears under this column.\n\nAfter examining these conditions:\n\n- For the Constitutional ticket, all cells in that column except those labeled \"(none)\" have no names filled.\n- William Karlin is indeed listed in the Socialist ticket column.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied, the claim is true.
