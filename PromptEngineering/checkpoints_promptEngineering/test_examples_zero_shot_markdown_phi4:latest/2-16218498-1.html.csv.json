    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"there be more than 2 teams that have the same score during the 1st leg,\" we need to examine the scores from the \"1st leg\" column in each row.\n\nLet's list out these scores:\n\n1. Row 0: botswana defence force xi vs mbabane highlanders - Score: 1\n2. Row 1: arsenal (maseru) vs eleven arrows fc - Score: 3\n3. Row 2: cd el\u00e1 nguema vs primeiro de agosto - Score: 2\n4. Row 3: lprc oilers vs mighty blackpool - Score: 1\n5. Row 4: asc police vs as real bamako - Score: 1\n6. Row 5: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia - Score: 0\n7. Row 6: saint-george sa vs al ittihad - Score: 2\n8. Row 7: saint-louis fc vs young africans - Score: 1\n9. Row 8: sahel sc vs postel sport - Score: 2\n10. Row 9: tourbillon fc vs forces arm\u00e9es ca - Score: 0\n\nNow, count the frequency of each score:\n\n- Score 1 appears in rows 0, 3, 4, and 7 (4 times)\n- Score 3 appears in row 1 (1 time)\n- Score 2 appears in rows 2, 6, and 8 (3 times)\n- Score 0 appears in rows 5 and 9 (2 times)\n\nThe score \"1\" is shared by four teams during the first leg. This satisfies the condition of more than two teams having the same score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nIdentify relevant cells with their row indices and column names:\n\n- Row 0, Column: 1st leg\n- Row 3, Column: 1st leg\n- Row 4, Column: 1st leg\n- Row 7, Column: 1st leg\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
