This implies we need to find a situation where the field goal percentage is NOT 594.\n   - However, for row 5, the field goal percentage IS 594, which contradicts the requirement of the condition in the claim.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- The row with 2.4 blocks per game does not satisfy the condition \"where not field goal percentage be 594\". Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to consider the following cells:\n- `blocks per game` for selection 5.\n- `field goal percentage` for selection 5.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are from row index 4 (since markdown table indices start at 0), specifically in the columns \"blocks per game\" and \"field goal percentage\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"blocks per game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"field goal percentage\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
