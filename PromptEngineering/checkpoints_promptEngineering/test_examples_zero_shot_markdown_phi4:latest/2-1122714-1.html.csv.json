    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"james hunt ran on grid 2 for 73 lap\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The driver named \"james hunt\" is indeed listed in the table.\n2. For this driver:\n   - The number of laps completed should be 73.\n   - The starting position (\"grid\") should be 2.\n\nLet's check each condition against the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Condition Verification\n\n1. **Driver Name**:\n   - In the first row, we see that the \"driver\" is listed as \"james hunt\". This confirms that James Hunt is part of the dataset.\n\n2. **Number of Laps**:\n   - For the driver \"james hunt\", the \"laps\" column shows a value of 73. This matches the claim's condition regarding the number of laps completed.\n\n3. **Starting Grid Position**:\n   - In the same row for \"james hunt\", the \"grid\" column indicates a starting position of 2, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSince all conditions mentioned in the claim are satisfied based on the table data, we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim are:\n- The cell containing the driver's name \"james hunt\" (row index 0).\n- The cell indicating the number of laps completed by James Hunt (row index 0, \"laps\").\n- The cell showing the grid position for James Hunt (row index 0, \"grid\").\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
