However:\n- For South Korea, their best performances were in 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n- For Chinese Taipei, their best performances were in 1994 and 1998.\n\nSince Chinese Taipei's best performance was not in 2010, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing \"gold\", \"silver\", and \"bronze\" for each year from 1990 to 2010 for both South Korea and Chinese Taipei.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- For **South Korea**:\n  - Row 3: Gold in 2002\n  - Row 5: Gold in 2006\n  - Row 6: Gold in 2010\n\n- For **Chinese Taipei**:\n  - Row 2: Silver in 1990\n  - Row 3: Gold in 1994\n  - Row 4: Gold in 1998\n  - Row 5: Bronze in 2006\n  - Row 6: Bronze in 2010\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table for the performance of China (referred to as \"chine\" in the claim, which seems to be a typo) in terms of medal placement.\n\n### Analyzing Each Relevant Row:\n\n1. **Year: 1990, Location: Beijing**\n   - Gold: South Korea\n   - Silver: Chinese Taipei\n   - Bronze: Philippines\n   - China did not place at least silver.\n\n2. **Year: 1994, Location: Hiroshima**\n   - Gold: Chinese Taipei\n   - Silver: South Korea\n   - Bronze: China\n   - China placed bronze, which is less than silver.\n\n3. **Year: 1998, Location: Bangkok**\n   - Gold: Chinese Taipei\n   - Silver: South Korea\n   - Bronze: Philippines\n   - China did not place at all.\n\n4. **Year: 2002, Location: Busan**\n   - Gold: South Korea\n   - Silver: Japan\n   - Bronze: Philippines\n   - China did not place at least silver.\n\n5. **Year: 2006, Location: Doha**\n   - Gold: South Korea\n   - Silver: Japan\n   - Bronze: Chinese Taipei\n   - China did not place at least silver.\n\n6. **Year: 2010, Location: Guangzhou**\n   - Gold: South Korea\n   - Silver: China\n   - Bronze: Chinese Taipei\n   - China placed silver.\n\n### Summary:\n- China only achieved a placement of at least silver once (in 2010).\n- The claim that \"China have a very strong team at the Asian Games, always place at least silver\" is false because they did not consistently place at least silver in all listed years.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- For each year from 1990 to 2010, we need to check the \"silver\" and \"bronze\" columns to see if China placed at least silver.\n- Specifically, relevant cells are those where China is mentioned as either silver or bronze (or higher).\n\nRelevant cells include:\n\n1. **Row Index: 1**\n   - Column Name: Bronze\n\n2. **Row Index: 5**\n   - Column Name: Silver\n\nThus, the JSON object with the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
