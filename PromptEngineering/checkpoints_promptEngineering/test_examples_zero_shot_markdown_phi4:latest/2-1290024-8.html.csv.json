This confirms that the type matches the claim.\n\n3. **Checking Incorporation in UTA:**\n   The claim states these locomotives should be incorporated into UTA (Union Terminal Railway). We check:\n   - In row index 1, under the \"1958 uta\" column, it shows `7`. This indicates that there were 7 units of class pg incorporated into UTA in 1958.\n\n4. **Quantity Made vs. Incorporated:**\n   To verify if all were incorporated:\n   - The \"quantity made\" for this class is listed as `7` in the row index 1.\n   - Since 7 locomotives were made and 7 were incorporated (as per \"1958 uta\"), it implies that all were indeed incorporated into UTA.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 1 for the columns: \"class\", \"type\", \"quantity made\", and \"1958 uta\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"quantity made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1958 uta\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

They should be the latest withdrawn (i.e., have the latest \"date withdrawn\").\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n### Check for \"Last Made\" Condition:\n- We will compare the \"date made\" column across all rows to find the most recent date.\n- The relevant dates are:\n  - pp: 1896 - 1911\n  - pg: 1899 - 1904\n  - q: 1899 - 1904\n  - qg: 1903 - 1904\n  - p: 1904 - 1906\n  - ql: 1904 - 1910\n  - qgt: 1905\n  - lqg: 1906 - 1908\n  - rt: 1908 - 1911\n  - nqg: 1911\n  - nlqg: 1911\n  - qgt2: 1911\n  - s: 1913\n  - sg: 1913\n\nThe latest \"date made\" is for classes 's' and 'sg', both in 1913.\n\n### Check for \"Latest Withdrawn\" Condition:\n- We will compare the \"date withdrawn\" column across all rows to find the most recent date.\n- The relevant dates are:\n  - pp: 1957 - 1963\n  - pg: 1960 - 1964\n  - q: 1951 - 1963\n  - qg: 1962 - 1963\n  - p: 1956 - 1960\n  - ql: 1932 - 1960\n  - qgt: 1957 - 1960\n  - lqg: 1958 - 1963\n  - rt: 1958 - 1963\n  - nqg: 1958 - 1963\n  - nlqg: 1961\n  - qgt2: 1957\n  - s: 1964 - 1965\n  - sg: 1961 - 1965\n\nThe latest \"date withdrawn\" is for classes 's' and 'sg', both ending in 1965.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Classes 'd' and 'dg' are not present in the table, so they cannot be the last made or the latest withdrawn.\n- The actual classes with the latest \"date made\" and \"date withdrawn\" are 's' and 'sg'.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.
