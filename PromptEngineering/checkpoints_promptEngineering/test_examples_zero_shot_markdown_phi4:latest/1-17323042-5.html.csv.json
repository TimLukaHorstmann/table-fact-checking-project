    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two key aspects from the table:\n\n1. The team's record when they play against Orlando on November 28.\n2. The date and opponent of the game on November 28.\n\nLet's analyze these step by step using the relevant data in the table:\n\n- **Locate the Game Played on November 28:**\n  - From the table, we see that game number 16 is played on November 28 against Boston. This can be confirmed from the \"date\" and \"team\" columns.\n  \n- **Check the Record for the Game Against Orlando on November 26:**\n  - The team plays against Orlando on November 26 (game number 15). From the table, the record after this game is 7 - 8. This information can be confirmed from the \"date\", \"team\", and \"record\" columns.\n\n- **Verify the Record After Playing Against Boston on November 28:**\n  - After playing against Boston on November 28 (game number 16), the record becomes 7 - 9, as shown in the table. This is confirmed by the \"record\" column for game number 16.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim states that the team has a record of 7 - 8 when they play Orlando on November 28. However, they played against Boston on November 28, not Orlando.\n- The record of 7 - 8 pertains to after playing Orlando on November 26, not November 28.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly associates the date and opponent with a specific team record.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used in this verification:\n\n1. Game number 15: \n   - Row index 14 (0-based index)\n   - Columns: \"date\", \"team\", and \"record\"\n\n2. Game number 16:\n   - Row index 15\n   - Columns: \"date\", \"team\", and \"record\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
