Clinger Jr., first elected in 1978 (not in the 1980s).\n   - **pennsylvania7**: Curt Weldon, first elected in 1986 (in the 1980s).\n   - **pennsylvania9**: Bud Shuster, first elected in 1972 (not in the 1980s).\n   - **pennsylvania12**: John Murtha, first elected in 1974 (not in the 1980s).\n   - **pennsylvania17**: George Gekas, first elected in 1982 (in the 1980s).\n   - **pennsylvania18**: Rick Santorum, first elected in 1990 (not in the 1980s).\n   - **pennsylvania19**: William F. Goodling, first elected in 1974 (not in the 1980s).\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Pennsylvania District 17 is the only district with an incumbent first elected in the 1980s.\n   - However, Curt Weldon from Pennsylvania District 7 was also first elected in the 1980s.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there are two districts (pennsylvania7 and pennsylvania17) where incumbents were first elected in the 1980s.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to include the \"first elected\" column for all rows since they were checked against the condition of being elected in the 1980s.\n   - Specifically, we focus on rows with incumbents first elected in the 1980s: pennsylvania7 and pennsylvania17.\n\nHere is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
