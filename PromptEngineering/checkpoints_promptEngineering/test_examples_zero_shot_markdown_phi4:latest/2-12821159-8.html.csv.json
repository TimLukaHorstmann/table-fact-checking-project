The runner-up for a specific tournament (Habsburg Classic) should be Rick Huiskamp.\n2. The margin of victory for that tournament should be 10 strokes.\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- We'll look at the row corresponding to the \"habsburg classic\" as it is explicitly mentioned in the claim.\n  \n### Analysis:\n1. **Row Index 2**: \n   - Tournament: \"habsburg classic\"\n   - Runner-up: \"rick huiskamp\"\n   - Margin of victory: \"10 strokes\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied based on the information from this row:\n\n- The runner-up is indeed Rick Huiskamp.\n- The margin of victory is indeed 10 strokes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim regarding Rick Huiskamp's position and margin in the table, we need to analyze the information provided.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - We look for entries where \"Rick Huiskamp\" is listed as a runner-up.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row 3 contains \"runner - up: rick huiskamp\".\n\n2. **Check margin of victory in the identified row:**\n   - In this specific row (Row 3), the \"margin of victory\" is 10 strokes.\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim based on these findings:**\n   - The claim states that Rick Huiskamp was a runner-up with a single-digit margin of victory.\n   - From Row 3, Rick Huiskamp indeed was a runner-up, but the margin of victory was 10 strokes, which is not a single-digit number.\n\nTherefore, based on the table's data, the claim is false because while Rick Huiskamp did finish as a runner-up, the margin of victory was not single-digit. \n\nNow we'll construct the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
