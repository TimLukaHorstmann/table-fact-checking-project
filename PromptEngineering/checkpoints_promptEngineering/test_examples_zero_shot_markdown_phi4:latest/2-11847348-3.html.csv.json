    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n1. That Bok\u0161i\u0107 is the only player who scored exactly 8 goals in the league.\n2. Confirm if the number of goals for other players in the league column does not equal 8.\n\nWe will focus on the \"league\" column of the table because it contains information about the number of goals each player scored in the league, which directly addresses the claim.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Bok\u0161i\u0107\u2019s Goals**: Check if Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals listed under the \"league\" column.\n2. **Check Other Players for League Goals**:\n   - Review each player\u2019s entry in the \"league\" column to ensure no other player scored exactly 8 league goals.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n- **Bok\u0161i\u0107's Record**: The row index is 0, and in the \"league\" column, Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals. This supports the claim that Bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 goals.\n  \n- **Other Players\u2019 Records**:\n  - For each player (from row index 1 to 18), check if any of them have 8 goals in the \"league\" column.\n\nHere is a detailed look at relevant cells:\n\n| Row Index | Player     | League Goals |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| 0         | bok\u0161i\u0107     | 8            |\n| 1         | whelan     | 4            |\n| 2         | n\u00e9meth     | 3            |\n| 3         | ince       | 2            |\n| 4         | cooper     | 2            |\n| 5         | queudrue   | 2            |\n| 6         | marinelli  | 2            |\n| 7         | mustoe     | 2            |\n| 8         | deane      | 1            |\n| 9         | johnston   | 1            |\n| 10        | greening   | 1            |\n| 11        | stockdale  | 1            |\n| 12        | festa      | 1            |\n| 13        | windass    | 1            |\n| 14        | southgate  | 1            |\n| 15        | carbone    | 1            |\n| 16        | ehiogu     | 1            |\n| 17        | murphy     | 0            |\n| 18        | wilson     | 0            |\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that no other player has exactly 8 league goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107 is indeed the only player who scored 8 league goals.\n- Thus, the claim \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be the only player to score 8 goal in the league\" is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\nThe relevant cells are all those in the \"league\" column that confirm Bok\u0161i\u0107's unique status and the absence of any other players with 8 goals.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table and check each player's total goals scored across all competitions (league, FA Cup, League Cup). The claim specifically states that Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are the only players who have scored 2 or more goals.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps:\n\n1. Identify players with a \"total\" score of 2 or more:\n   - From the table, we look at the column \"total\".\n\n2. Check which players meet this criterion:\n   - **Cooper**: Total = 2\n   - **Marinelli**: Total = 2\n   - **Mustoe**: Total = 2\n   - **Queudrue**: Total = 2\n\n3. Verify if these are the only players with a total of 2 or more:\n   - Check other rows to ensure no other player has a \"total\" score of 2 or more.\n\n4. Confirm that all other players have a \"total\" score less than 2:\n   - **Bok\u0161i\u0107**: Total = 8\n   - **Whelan**: Total = 7\n   - **N\u00e9meth**: Total = 6\n   - Other players (Ince, Deane, Johnston, Greening, Stockdale, Festa, Windass, Southgate, Carbone, Ehiogu) have totals less than 2.\n   - Murphy and Wilson scored 1 goal each in the League Cup.\n   - Cambell scored 1 goal in the FA Cup.\n   - Own goals are not considered individual players.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Bok\u0161i\u0107, Whelan, and N\u00e9meth also have totals of 2 or more, which contradicts the claim that only Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue scored 2 or more goals.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because there are additional players (Bok\u0161i\u0107, Whelan, and N\u00e9meth) who also scored 2 or more goals.
