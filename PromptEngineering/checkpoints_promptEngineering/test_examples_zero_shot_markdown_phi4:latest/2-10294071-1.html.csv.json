    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify each part of it against the provided table:\n\n1. **Player Name**: The claim references \"dragutin miti\u0107\". According to the table, there is a row for \"dragutin miti\u0107\", so this part of the claim matches.\n\n2. **Ties Played**: The claim states \"29.0 tie\", which implies that the number of ties played should be 29. In the table, under the \"ties played\" column for \"dragutin miti\u0107\", it is indeed listed as 29.\n\n3. **Debut Year**: The claim mentions a debut year of 1936. For \"dragutin miti\u0107\", the \"debut\" column in the table shows 1936, which matches the claim.\n\nAll parts of the claim are consistent with the information in the table for \"dragutin miti\u0107\". Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row index 3 (for \"dragutin miti\u0107\"), column \"ties played\"\n- Row index 3, column \"debut\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"debut\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"29 be the number of tie play with a debut year of 1930,\" we need to check two conditions in the table for each player:\n1. The \"ties played\" value should be 29.\n2. The \"debut\" year should be 1930.\n\nWe will go through the rows one by one:\n\n- **Row 0 (\u017eeljko franulovi\u0107):**  \n  - Ties Played: 22\n  - Debut Year: 1967\n\n- **Row 1 (boro jovanovi\u0107):**  \n  - Ties Played: 25\n  - Debut Year: 1959\n\n- **Row 2 (franjo kukuljevi\u0107):**  \n  - Ties Played: 18\n  - Debut Year: 1930\n\n- **Row 3 (dragutin miti\u0107):**  \n  - Ties Played: 29\n  - Debut Year: 1936\n\n- **Row 4 (josip palada):**  \n  - Ties Played: 37\n  - Debut Year: 1933\n\n- **Row 5 (ilija panajotovi\u0107):**  \n  - Ties Played: 11\n  - Debut Year: 1953\n\n- **Row 6 (nikola pili\u0107):**  \n  - Ties Played: 23\n  - Debut Year: 1961\n\n- **Row 7 (franjo pun\u010dec):**  \n  - Ties Played: 26\n  - Debut Year: 1933\n\n- **Row 8 (slobodan \u017eivojinovi\u0107):**  \n  - Ties Played: 24\n  - Debut Year: 1981\n\nNow, we check the relevant conditions:\n- Only Row 3 has \"Ties Played\" as 29.\n- Only Row 2 has a \"Debut Year\" of 1930.\n\nNo row satisfies both conditions simultaneously.
