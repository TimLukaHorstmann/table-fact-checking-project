The team \"young africans\" is listed, and we need to check their performance:\n\n- **Row 9** corresponds to \"young africans.\"\n- In the \"agg\" column, it shows that young africans have a score of \"2 - 0,\" which indicates they won both legs combined.\n- The scores for the individual matches are:\n  - 1st leg: \"2 - 0\"\n  - 2nd leg: \"0 - 0\"\n\nThe aggregate result of \"2 - 0\" implies that young africans scored a total of 2 goals over the two-legged match, resulting in them winning the aggregate.\n\nIn terms of points:\n- Winning both legs results in 3 points for each win (standard football scoring system).\n- The first leg was won by young africans with \"2 - 0,\" earning them 3 points.\n- The second leg ended in a draw with \"0 - 0,\" earning them 1 point.\n\nThus, the total points scored by young africans over both legs is 4 points (3 from the first leg and 1 from the second leg).\n\nThe claim states that they scored \"2 points\" in the tournament. This statement refers to the number of goals scored, not points earned. Since the table shows that they scored a total of 2 goals across both matches, this part of the claim is correct.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim about young africans scoring 2 goals is accurate.
