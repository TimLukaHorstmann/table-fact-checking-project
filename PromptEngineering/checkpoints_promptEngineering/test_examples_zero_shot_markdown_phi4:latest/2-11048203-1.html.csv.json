    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Hatem Aqel is true or false based on the table provided, we need to analyze each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Competitions Ended on October 28, 2013**:\n   - The claim mentions a competition that ended on this date.\n   - From the table, the entry for \"28 october 2013\" shows a match in Amman with a score of 1-0 and result 'win' under the category \"friendly.\"\n   - This indicates that there was an event (a friendly match) involving Hatem Aqel on this date.\n\n2. **Competitions Started on December 16, 2003**:\n   - The claim mentions a competition starting on this date.\n   - From the table, the entry for \"16 december 2002\" shows a match in Kuwait with a score of 1-1 and result 'draw' under the category \"2002 arab nations cup.\"\n   - This indicates that there was an event (a match in the Arab Nations Cup) involving Hatem Aqel on this date.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is partially supported by the table. The table shows a competition starting on December 16, 2002 (not 2003), and one ending on October 28, 2013. Thus, the specifics of the start year in the claim are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
