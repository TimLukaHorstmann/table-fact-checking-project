    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Bryce Molder's standing in the table, we need to verify two specific conditions from the provided data:\n\n1. **Position**: The claim states that Bryce Molder came in 8th (tied for 8th). We need to check if his place is listed as \"t8\" in the table.\n\n2. **Score Relative to Par**: The claim asserts that Bryce Molder's score is \"-1 to par\". We will compare this with the \"to par\" value given in the table.\n\nWe will now identify and examine the relevant cells for each condition from the markdown table:\n\n### Examination of Conditions\n\n- **Position**:\n  - From the table, we check the row where Bryce Molder's name appears.\n  - **Row**: 8 (since markdown tables start indexing from zero)\n  - **Column**: \"place\"\n  - The value in this cell is \"t8\", which supports the claim that he came in tied for 8th.\n\n- **Score Relative to Par**:\n  - From the table, we check the row where Bryce Molder's name appears.\n  - **Row**: 8\n  - **Column**: \"to par\"\n  - The value here is \"e\", which stands for even par (0). This indicates that his score was neither above nor below par. Therefore, it does not support the claim of being \"-1 to par\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our examination:\n- Bryce Molder's position as \"t8\" supports part of the claim.\n- However, his \"to par\" status is even (0), contradicting the assertion that he was \"-1 to par\".\n\nThus, the overall claim is **FALSE**.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
