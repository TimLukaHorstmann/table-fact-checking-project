    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate each condition specified in it against the provided table.\n\n**Claim:** \n\"The song with point smaller than 54, a draw smaller than 4 and a place smaller than 10 be eu mesmo.\"\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. **Point smaller than 54:**\n   - We examine the 'points' column to find entries where the value is less than 54.\n   - The relevant rows based on this condition are:\n     - Draw 1, Song \"start stop\", Points 33\n     - Draw 2, Song \"eu mesmo\", Points 42\n     - Draw 10, Song \"top model\", Points 34\n\n2. **Draw smaller than 4:**\n   - We examine the 'draw' column to find entries where the draw number is less than 4.\n   - The relevant rows based on this condition are:\n     - Draw 1, Singer \"vnia maroti\", Song \"start stop\"\n     - Draw 2, Singer \"t\u00f3 leal\", Song \"eu mesmo\"\n     - Draw 3, Singer \"patricia antunes\", Song \"canto em portugu\u00eas\"\n\n3. **Place smaller than 10:**\n   - We examine the 'place' column to find entries where the place is less than 10.\n   - All rows have places between 1 and 10, so all rows meet this condition.\n\nNow, we need to find any row that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously:\n\n- **Draw smaller than 4** gives us potential draws: 1, 2, 3\n- **Point smaller than 54** further limits it to draws 1 and 2 (since draw 3 has 91 points).\n- **Place smaller than 10** is satisfied by all rows, but we are already limited to draws 1 and 2.\n\nThus, the only candidates that satisfy all conditions are:\n- Draw 1: Song \"start stop\"\n- Draw 2: Song \"eu mesmo\"\n\nThe claim specifies that the song should be \"eu mesmo\". Since draw 2 indeed has \"eu mesmo\" with points less than 54, draw less than 4, and place less than 10, it satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are those from row index 1 (0-based indexing) that correspond to these conditions:\n\n- Row index 1: \"draw\", \"singer\", \"song\", \"points\", \"place\" for draw number 2 and song \"eu mesmo\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"singer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
