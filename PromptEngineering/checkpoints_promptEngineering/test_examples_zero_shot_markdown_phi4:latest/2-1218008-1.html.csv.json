The Brewers won (Milwaukee score > St. Louis score).\n- **Row 2**: Score is \"milwaukee brewers - 4 , st louis cardinals - 5\".

Since all durations here far exceed 3 minutes, this part of the claim is trivially satisfied.\n  \n- Identify if any other game lasted longer than 3 hours (as per the claim):\n  - Row 4 (October 16) at 184 minutes is the longest.\n  - Other games with more than 180 minutes are:\n    - Row 5 (October 17): 182 minutes\n\nThus, October 16 is not the only game longer than 3 hours; there's another one on October 17 that also exceeds this duration.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that the October 16 game is the **only** one longer than 3 hours. Since October 17 also qualifies, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from row 4 (October 16) and row 5 (October 17) in the \"time\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to extract and verify the scores for all matches involving the St. Louis Cardinals from the provided table. Specifically, we will focus on the \"score\" column since it contains the relevant data about how many runs each team scored in each game.\n\nThe score format provided indicates that the home team's score is listed first, followed by the away team\u2019s score after a dash (e.g., \"milwaukee brewers - 10 , st louis cardinals - 0\"). Therefore, to extract the St. Louis Cardinals' scores, we need to:\n\n1. Identify which team is listed first in each game.\n2. Extract the second number when the Cardinals are listed as the away team or the first number if they are listed as the home team.\n\nLet's go through each row of the table that involves the Cardinals and extract their score:\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Score: \"milwaukee brewers - 10 , st louis cardinals - 0\"\n  - Cardinals' score: 0\n  - Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Score: \"milwaukee brewers - 4 , st louis cardinals - 5\"\n  - Cardinals' score: 5\n  - Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Score: \"st louis cardinals - 6 , milwaukee brewers - 2\"\n  - Cardinals' score: 6\n  - Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Score: \"st louis cardinals - 5 , milwaukee brewers - 7\"\n  - Cardinals' score: 5\n  - Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Score: \"st louis cardinals - 4 , milwaukee brewers - 6\"\n  - Cardinals' score: 4\n  - Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Score: \"milwaukee brewers - 1 , st louis cardinals - 13\"\n  - Cardinals' score: 13\n  - Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n- **Row 7:**\n  - Score: \"milwaukee brewers - 3 , st louis cardinals - 6\"\n  - Cardinals' score: 6\n  - Relevant cell: {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\nThe extracted scores for the St. Louis Cardinals are 0, 5, 6, 5, 4, 13, and 6.\n\nNow we will verify if these scores match what is claimed:\n- The claim states: \"the st louis cardinal score in all their matches.\"\n- This implies providing a complete list of scores for the Cardinals across their games. \n\nThe claim does not specify any particular number or pattern to check against; it simply requests verification that we have extracted and noted all the scores correctly.\n\nSince all necessary scores were successfully identified and listed, we can say that the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
