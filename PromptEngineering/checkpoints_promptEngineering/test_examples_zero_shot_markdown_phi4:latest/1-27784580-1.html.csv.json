    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Episode with Title \"suki to ietara iinoni\":**\n   - This corresponds to episode 5 in the table.\n\n2. **Find the Rating for \"suki to ietara iinoni\":**\n   - The rating for episode 5 is 17.4%.\n\n3. **Identify the Episode with the Lowest Rating:**\n   - We need to compare all the ratings:\n     - ep 1: 22.4%\n     - ep 2: 19.2%\n     - ep 3: 15.6%\n     - ep 4: 15.5%\n     - ep 5: 17.4%\n     - ep 6: 13.4%\n   - The lowest rating is 13.4% for episode 6.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Ratings:**\n   - Subtract the lowest rating (13.4%) from the rating of \"suki to ietara iinoni\" (17.4%):\n     \\[\n     17.4\\% - 13.4\\% = 4.0\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare the Calculated Difference with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\"\n   - We calculated a difference of 4.0%, not 5.8%.\n\n6. **Determine if the Claim is TRUE or FALSE:**\n   - Since the calculated difference (4.0%) does not match the claimed difference (5.8%), the claim is FALSE.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells are those containing the ratings for episode 5 and episode 6, as well as their row indices.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
