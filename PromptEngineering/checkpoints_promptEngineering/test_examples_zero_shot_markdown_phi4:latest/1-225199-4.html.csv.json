The relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row index 7 (considering zero-based indexing) and column \"district\"\n- Row index 7 and column \"date successor seated\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date successor seated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the successor's seating date in Virginia's 11th district, we need to identify the relevant row and column from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim mentions \"Virginia 11th\" district.\n   - From the table, locate the row with \"virginia 11th\" in the \"district\" column.
