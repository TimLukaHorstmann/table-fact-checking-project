    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the bronze medals for volleyball won by South Korea and Japan, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table provided.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n- **Claim**: \"South Korea and Japan both receive zero bronze medal for volleyball.\"\n\nThe key points to verify here are:\n1. Both South Korea and Japan should have zero bronze medals.\n2. The context is specifically about the sport of volleyball, but this detail isn't directly available in the table provided.\n\n### Relevant Data from the Table:\n\n| Rank   | Nation               | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n|:-------|:---------------------|-----:|-------:|-------:|------:|\n| 2      | South Korea (KOR)    |    1 |      0 |      0 |     1 |\n| 3      | Japan (JPN)          |    0 |      2 |      0 |     2 |\n\n### Verification:\n- **South Korea**: The table shows that South Korea received 0 bronze medals.\n- **Japan**: Similarly, the table indicates that Japan also received 0 bronze medals.\n\nThe claim about zero bronze medals is consistent with what's shown in the table for both countries. However, there are two main points to consider:\n1. The claim mentions \"volleyball\" specifically but does not provide any detail or breakdown by sport within this table.\n2. The table does not specify which sports these medals were won in.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that the table does not break down medal counts by sport (including volleyball), we cannot definitively confirm whether South Korea and Japan received zero bronze medals specifically for volleyball; it only confirms they have zero overall bronze medals.\n\nThus, based on the information available in the table alone:\n- **Answer**: The claim can't be fully validated with respect to the specific context of volleyball because there's no data about sports breakdown. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE\" concerning the specificity required by the claim (volleyball).\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n1. South Korea (row index 2) under \"Bronze\".\n2. Japan (row index 3) under \"Bronze\".\n\nHere\u2019s the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
