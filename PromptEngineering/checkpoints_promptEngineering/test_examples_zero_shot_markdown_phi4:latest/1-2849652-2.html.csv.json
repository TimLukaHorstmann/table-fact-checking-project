Look for the row where:\n   - **season** is \"winter\"\n   - **sport** is \"gymnastics\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- The row with \"winter\" and \"gymnastics\" as values corresponds to the third row (index 2, considering 0-based indexing).\n\nNext, check the value in the \"of divisions\" column for this row:\n- For \"winter gymnastics,\" the \"of divisions\" is listed as **1**.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are met by the data in this row, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim include:\n- Row 2 (0-based index), Column: \"season\"\n- Row 2 (0-based index), Column: \"sport\"\n- Row 2 (0-based index), Column: \"of divisions\"\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of divisions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
