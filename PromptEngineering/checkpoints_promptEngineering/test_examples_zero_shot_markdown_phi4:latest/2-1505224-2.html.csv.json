    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"French Guiana be a territory of France\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to look for relevant entries in the table that pertain to French Guiana and its status as a territory of France.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The table includes several columns: `country`, `territory`, `name`, `birth date`, and `death date`.\n   - To verify if French Guiana is a territory of France, we need to focus on the rows where the column `territory` is \"french guiana\".\n   \n2. **Check for French Guiana in the Table:**\n   - The row with index 3 (zero-based indexing) has the `country` as \"france\" and the `territory` as \"french guiana\". This entry corresponds to Eudoxie Baboul.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Since there is an entry where French Guiana is listed as a territory under France, this supports the claim that French Guiana is indeed a territory of France according to the information in the table.\n\n4. **Determine Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n     - `row_index`: 3\n     - `column_name`: \"country\" (value: \"france\")\n     - `row_index`: 3\n     - `column_name`: \"territory\" (value: \"french guiana\")\n\nBased on the above analysis, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"territory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify specific information from the table against the details provided in the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"the birth date for Luce Maced, from French Guiana, be 2 May 1901\".\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant person and location**:\n   - The claim refers to \"Luce Maced\" who is from \"French Guiana\".\n   \n2. **Locate the row in the table corresponding to this information**:\n   - In the table, we find a row where the name is \"Lucie Maced\" (note the slight spelling difference as 'c' instead of '\u00e7'), and the territory is \"Guadeloupe\", not \"French Guiana\". However, it's important to note that there might be an error in the claim regarding the territory.\n\n3. **Verify the birth date**:\n   - According to the table, Luce Maced (Lucie Maced) has a birth date of \"2 May 1886\".\n\n4. **Compare with the claimed birth date**:\n   - The claim states the birth date should be \"2 May 1901\", which does not match the actual birth date in the table, \"2 May 1886\".\n\nSince the birth date in the claim does not match the entry in the table for Luce Maced (Lucie Maced), and also considering the discrepancy in territory mentioned, the claim is false.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- The row index corresponding to Lucie Maced is 5.\n- The columns of interest are \"territory\" and \"birth date\".\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- Row 5, Column: territory\n- Row 5, Column: birth date\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"territory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"birth date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
