The electorate \"collingwood\" should appear in one of the rows.\n2. For that row, the province column must indicate \"nelson.\"\n\nLet's examine each relevant piece of data step-by-step:\n\n- First, identify where the \"collingwood\" electorate is listed. \n  - In Row 3, under the \"member\" column, we have \"andrew richmond,\" and under the \"electorate\" column, it states \"collingwood.\"\n\n- Next, check the province for this row.\n  - Still in Row 3, under the \"province\" column, the value is \"nelson.\"\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (i.e., \"collingwood\" electorate is listed and assigned to the \"nelson\" province), we can confirm that the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's construct the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"electorate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure indicates that the claim is true based on the information in the provided table and specifies the cells relevant to verifying this truth.",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"nelson be not the province for the electorate of collingwood,\" we need to verify the relationship between the 'electorate' and 'province' columns in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We are specifically interested in the row where the 'electorate' is \"collingwood.\"\n\n2. **Check Corresponding Province**:\n   - Locate the row with the 'electorate' \"collingwood\" to check what province it corresponds to.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - In the given table, the row with 'electorate' as \"collingwood\" is at `row_index` 2.\n   - The corresponding 'province' for this electorate is \"nelson.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Nelson should not be the province for the electorate of Collingwood.\n   - Since the table shows that Nelson *is* indeed the province for the electorate of Collingwood, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Determine Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this are those in `row_index` 2 under the 'electorate' and 'province' columns.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"electorate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
