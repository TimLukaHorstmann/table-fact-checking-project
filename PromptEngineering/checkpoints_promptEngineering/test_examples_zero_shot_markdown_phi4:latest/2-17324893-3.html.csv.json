Therefore, the claim that a Philadelphia Flyers game occurs later than a Chicago Black Hawks game is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cells to verify this are from:\n  - Row 11 for \"Chicago Black Hawks.\"\n  - Rows 13 and 17 for \"Philadelphia Flyers.\"\n\nNow let's structure this information into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object correctly identifies the rows and columns relevant to verifying the claim, with indices adjusted for zero-based indexing used in programming contexts.",
