(Note: The table does not explicitly list wins, but we can deduce it from points, draws, and losses.)\n\n2. **Understand Scoring System:**\n   - Assuming a standard scoring system in football/soccer:\n     - A win typically gives 3 points.\n     - A draw gives 1 point.\n     - A loss gives 0 points.\n\n3. **Calculate Points from Known Data for Corinthians:**\n   - From the table, for \"corinthians\":\n     - `points` = 35\n     - `played` = 20\n     - `drawn` = 3\n     - `lost` = 1\n\n4. **Determine Wins and Total Points if Undefeated:**\n   - Let \\( W \\) be the number of wins.\n   - The points from wins can be calculated as \\( 3W \\).\n   - Points from draws are \\( 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\) (since they have drawn 3 games).\n   - Total points with these results: \\( 3W + 3 = 35 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( W \\): \n     \\[\n     3W + 3 = 35 \\\\\n     3W = 32 \\\\\n     W = \\frac{32}{3} \\approx 10.67\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( W \\) must be an integer, Corinthians won 11 games (since they cannot win a fraction of a game).\n\n5. **Check Number of Games Played and Remaining:**\n   - Total `played` games = 20.\n   - Wins + Draws + Losses = Total played games:\n     \\[\n     11 (\\text{wins}) + 3 (\\text{draws}) + 1 (\\text{loss}) = 15\n     \\]\n   - Games left to play: \\( 20 - 15 = 5 \\).\n\n6. **Evaluate Undefeated Scenario:**\n   - To be undefeated, Corinthians would need no more losses.\n   - They have already lost 1 game.\n   - If they win all the remaining 5 games, they will finish with:\n     - Total wins = \\( 11 + 5 = 16 \\)\n     - Draws = 3\n     - Losses = 1 (already occurred)\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states they are \"only 1 game away from being undefeated.\"\n   - However, they have already lost 1 game and need to play 5 more games.\n   - Therefore, they are not just one game away; they need to win all remaining 5 games without any further losses.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if Corinthians could have been undefeated with only five more wins. An undefeated season means zero losses.\n\nLet's break down the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Corinthians' Current Record:**\n   - Played: 20 games\n   - Drawn: 3 games\n   - Lost: 1 game\n\n2. **Current Wins Calculation:**\n   - Total games played = Wins + Draws + Losses\n   - Therefore, Wins = Total games played - Draws - Losses\n   - For Corinthians: Wins = 20 - 3 - 1 = 16 wins\n\n3. **Undefeated Scenario:**\n   - To be undefeated over a hypothetical full season of 25 games (20 already played + 5 more), Corinthians would need:\n     - 0 losses\n     - Therefore, all remaining 5 games must be either wins or draws.\n\n4. **Current Losses and Potential Wins:**\n   - Corinthians currently have 1 loss.\n   - To achieve an undefeated record over the full season of 25 games, they can afford at most 1 draw in the remaining 5 games (since 0 losses are required).\n   - Therefore, they need to win all 5 remaining games.\n\nThe claim states that \"the corinthian be 5 game away from be undefeeated their entire season.\" This implies that if Corinthians had won those 5 additional games, they would have been undefeated. Based on the current data:\n\n- They have already lost 1 game.\n- If they win all 5 remaining games, they will finish with 21 wins and 3 draws, resulting in no losses.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Corinthians' \"played\" (20)\n- Corinthians' \"drawn\" (3)\n- Corinthians' \"lost\" (1)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the team portuguesa santista do not have any draw during the 1941 season,\" we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\nThe claim focuses on two main aspects:\n1. The identification of the team named \"portuguesa santista.\"\n2. Checking the number of draws (\"drawn\") for this specific team.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Team:**\n   - Locate the row in the table where the team is listed as \"portuguesa santista.\" In markdown tables, rows are typically ordered from top to bottom starting with index 0.\n   - Looking at the data:\n     - Row index 7 corresponds to the team name \"portuguesa santista.\"\n\n2. **Check for Draws:**\n   - For the identified team in row 7, check the column labeled \"drawn.\"\n   - In this case, the value in the \"drawn\" column is `7`.\n\nThe claim states that portuguesa santista did not have any draws during the season, implying a value of `0` in the \"drawn\" column. However, from our analysis:\n- The team \"portuguesa santista\" has recorded 7 draws.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the data clearly shows that portuguesa santista had several drawn matches.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are found at row index 7 in both the \"team\" and \"drawn\" columns. \n\nHere's the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
