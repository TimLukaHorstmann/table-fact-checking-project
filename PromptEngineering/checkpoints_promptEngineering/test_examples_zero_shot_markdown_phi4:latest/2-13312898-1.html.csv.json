    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the colt draft 3 player from oklahoma\" is true or false based on the provided table, let's break down and verify each part of the claim against the data.\n\n1. **Draft Round**: The claim specifies round 3.\n2. **Player College**: The claim states that the player should be from Oklahoma.\n3. **Colt Draft Player**: While not directly related to a specific name in the table, we assume this implies any general draft pick information is applicable, as no specific player or team (other than 'colts') context is given.\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant row in the table:\n\n- The table lists the draft picks by round, with each row corresponding to a single pick.\n- Row 2 corresponds to Round 3. We need to check if this pick satisfies both conditions: it should be from Oklahoma and it should be the third round.\n\nHere is what Row 2 contains:\n- `round`: 3\n- `pick`: 1\n- `overall`: 26\n- `name`: Buck McPhail\n- `position`: Fullback\n- `college`: Oklahoma\n\nThis information confirms that in Round 3, the player drafted was Buck McPhail from Oklahoma.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by this data:\n\n- The round is indeed 3.\n- The player (Buck McPhail) is from Oklahoma.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the colt draft 3 player from oklahoma\" is true. Now, let's specify the relevant cells for verification:\n\nRelevant Cells:\n- Row Index 2 (because Round 3 corresponds to row index 2)\n  - `round`: Confirms it's round 3\n  - `college`: Confirms the college is Oklahoma\n\nThe JSON response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
