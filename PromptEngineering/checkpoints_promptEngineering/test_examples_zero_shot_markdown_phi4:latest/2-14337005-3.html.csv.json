Therefore, we must check the row with the date corresponding to May 11 and verify if the opponent listed for that day is indeed \"Cleveland Indians.\"\n\nHere are the steps involved:\n\n1. Locate the row in which the \"date\" column contains \"may 11.\"\n2. Verify the \"opponent\" column entry for this particular row.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The row with \"date: may 11\" is identified as Row 10 (considering indexing starting from 0).\n- In this row, the \"opponent\" column shows \"cleveland indians.\"\n\nSince both conditions are met (the date is May 11 and the opponent is Cleveland Indians), the claim that on May 11 the Cleveland Indians play is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.
