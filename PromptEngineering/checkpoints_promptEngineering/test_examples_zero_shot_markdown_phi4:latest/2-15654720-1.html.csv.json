Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- Row index 0 (2002 - 03 season):\n  - Column \"cashes\": Value is 6\n  - Column \"match play\": Value is 2\n  - Column \"events\": Value is 7\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"match play\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"6 cash have earnings of 39380,\" we need to examine two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify rows where the value in the \"cashes\" column is equal to 6.\n2. Check if any of these rows have an \"earnings\" value of 39380.\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps using the table data:\n\n- **Column: Cashes**\n  - We need to find all entries with a cash count of 6:\n    - Row 0 (2002 - 03): cashes = 6\n    - All other rows have different values in this column.\n\n- **Column: Earnings**\n  - Now, check the earnings for the row where cashes are 6:\n    - For Row 0 (2002 - 03), earnings = 9500\n\nThe condition of having \"earnings of 39380\" does not match with any rows where \"cashes is 6\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those that were checked for the values needed to verify the claim.
