    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and verify each part of the statement:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"the largest attendance of 44505\"**: We need to check if 44,505 is indeed the highest attendance number in the \"attendance\" column.\n2. **\"be at the game that took place on September 13, 1976\"**: We must confirm if this date corresponds with an attendance figure of 44,505.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- First, let's find out the highest value in the \"attendance\" column:\n  - Row 1: 77,683\n  - Row 2: 61,384\n  - Row 3: 44,505\n  - Row 4: 51,909\n  - Row 5: 59,110\n  - Row 6: 71,009\n  - Row 7: 45,144\n  - Row 8: 41,285\n  - Row 9: 61,157\n  - Row 10: 51,799\n  - Row 11: 36,539\n  - Row 12: 66,875\n  - Row 13: 43,475\n  - Row 14: 50,451\n\nThe highest attendance in the table is 77,683 (Row 1), not 44,505.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding attendance in specific games from the table provided, we need to focus on two main aspects:\n\n1. Identify and compare the attendance figures for the games against \"New England Patriots\" and \"Baltimore Colts\".\n2. Verify if the smallest attendance is indeed not at the game against the New England Patriots but rather at a game against the Baltimore Colts.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n**Identify relevant rows:**\n\n- **New England Patriots:** \n  - Game on October 24, 1976 (Week 7): Attendance = 45,144\n  - Game on November 7, 1976 (Week 9): Attendance = 61,157\n\n- **Baltimore Colts:** \n  - Game on October 17, 1976 (Week 6): Attendance = 71,009\n  - Game on December 12, 1976 (Week 14): Attendance = 50,451\n\n**Find the smallest attendance:**\n\n- Among the New England Patriots games, the smaller attendance is for Week 7: 45,144.\n- Among the Baltimore Colts games, the smaller attendance is for Week 14: 50,451.\n\n**Compare these figures to other attendances in the table:**\n\n- The lowest attendance across all games in the table occurs at:\n  - Game on November 21, 1976 (Week 11) against the San Diego Chargers with an attendance of 36,539.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"the smallest attendance be not at the game against the new england patriot but against baltimore colt.\" However, the actual smallest attendance was at a game against the San Diego Chargers, not either the New England Patriots or Baltimore Colts. Thus, this part of the statement is irrelevant since it does not mention any other team.\n\nTo validate the claim about the specific teams mentioned:\n- The smallest attendance among games against the New England Patriots (45,144) is indeed greater than the smallest attendance among games against the Baltimore Colts (50,451).\n\nThus, the statement \"the smallest attendance be not at the game against the new england patriot but against baltimore colt\" holds true based on the comparison between these two teams alone.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
