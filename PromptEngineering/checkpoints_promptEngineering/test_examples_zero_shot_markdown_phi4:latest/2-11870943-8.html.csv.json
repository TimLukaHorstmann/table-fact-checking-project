    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the categorization of US Open results from 2007 to 2012, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. The US Open should have a \"2r\" (second round) result for each year between 2010 and 2012.\n2. The US Open should have an \"sf\" (semi-final) result for each year between 2007 and 2009.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row for these conditions:\n\n- **Row: US Open**\n  - 2007: Result is \"2r\"\n  - 2008: Result is \"1r\"\n  - 2009: Result is \"2r\"\n  - 2010: Result is \"sf\"\n  - 2011: Result is \"3r\"\n  - 2012: Result is \"sf\"\n\n**Verification of Conditions:**\n\n- **Condition 1:** The US Open should have a \"2r\" result from 2010 to 2012.\n  - 2010: Result is \"sf\", not \"2r\".\n  - 2011: Result is \"3r\", not \"2r\".\n  - 2012: Result is \"sf\", not \"2r\".\n\nThe first condition fails as the results for 2010, 2011, and 2012 are not all \"2r\".\n\n- **Condition 2:** The US Open should have an \"sf\" result from 2007 to 2009.\n  - 2007: Result is \"2r\", not \"sf\".\n  - 2008: Result is \"1r\", not \"sf\".\n  - 2009: Result is \"2r\", not \"sf\".\n\nThe second condition also fails as the results for 2007, 2008, and 2009 are not all \"sf\".\n\nSince neither of the conditions in the claim holds true based on the table data, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells to Verify:**\n- US Open row (row index 3)\n  - Column for 2007\n  - Column for 2008\n  - Column for 2009\n  - Column for 2010\n  - Column for 2011\n  - Column for 2012\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2012\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
