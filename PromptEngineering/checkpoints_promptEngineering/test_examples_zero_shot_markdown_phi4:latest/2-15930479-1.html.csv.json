Check if \"David Lelay (fra)\" is the series leader at any point in time.\n\nLet's examine each relevant condition:\n\n- **Winner for Tour du Haut Var**: \n  - According to row 0, the winner of the \"Tour du Haut Var\" on February 24 is \"Davide Rebellin (ita).\"\n  \n- **Series Leader**:\n  - The series leader changes over time as per the table. We need to check if at any point in time before or after February 24, David Lelay was listed as the series leader.\n  - Row by row analysis shows that David Lelay becomes the series leader on May 4 (row 7) for the first time, and he remains so through several events until October 9.\n\nThus, since Davide Rebellin is the winner of the \"Tour du Haut Var\" and not David Lelay, the claim is FALSE.
