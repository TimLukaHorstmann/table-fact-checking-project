    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the provided table: \n\n1. The game against Philadelphia should be played at Pepsi Center.\n2. The attendance for this game should be 19,155 people.\n\nLet's identify the relevant row in the table:\n\n- From the \"team\" column, locate the entry that corresponds to the game against Philadelphia. According to the table, the game against Philadelphia is listed on December 26th (row 30).\n\nNow let's verify both conditions using this row:\n\n1. **Location**: The \"location attendance\" field for this row shows \"pepsi center 19155\". This confirms that the game was played at Pepsi Center.\n\n2. **Attendance**: The number of people in attendance, as stated in the same field (\"pepsi center 19155\"), is indeed 19,155.\n\nBoth conditions mentioned in the claim are satisfied by row 30. Thus, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"pepsi center 19175 be the location attendance during the game against philadelphia,\" we need to verify two main conditions from the table: \n\n1. The location attendance for the game against Philadelphia.\n2. Whether this location attendance is indeed 19,175.\n\nLet's evaluate these:\n\n- **Game against Philadelphia**: \n  - From the table, row 30 shows a game against \"philadelphia\" with date \"december 26.\"\n  \n- **Location Attendance**:\n  - In row 30, under the column \"location attendance,\" we see \"pepsi center 19155.\"\n\nComparing this to the claim:\n\n- The claimed attendance is \"pepsi center 19175\".\n- The actual recorded attendance from the table for the game against Philadelphia is \"pepsi center 19155\".\n\nSince these two numbers do not match, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cell in this evaluation comes from row 30, column \"location attendance.\"\n\nThus, the JSON response to this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that while evaluating the claim primarily requires checking row 30 for location and attendance, verifying the team (Philadelphia) is also relevant to ensure we're examining the correct game. Hence, two cells are noted: one confirming the team and another providing the actual attendance value.",
