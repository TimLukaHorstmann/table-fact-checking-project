    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant part of the table.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row and Column**:\n   - The row corresponding to Deon Kruis needs to be examined.\n   - Specifically, the column related to \"average\" is relevant because the claim concerns the batting average of Deon Kruis.\n\n2. **Locate Deon Kruis in the Table**:\n   - By scanning through the table, we find that Deon Kruis appears on row 18 (considering a zero-based index for rows).\n   \n3. **Check the \"Average\" Column for Deon Kruis**:\n   - In the \"average\" column of row 18 (Deon Kruis), the value is listed as \"n / a\". This indicates that there is no applicable average to calculate, likely because he played only one inning and was not out.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the average should be 0.1 for Deon Kruis.\n   - Since his batting average is marked as \"n / a\", it cannot logically or numerically equal 0.1 (or any other number).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the average is not applicable, the claim that it \"be 0.1\" is false.\n\n6. **List of Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for this verification is at row index 18 in the \"average\" column.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
