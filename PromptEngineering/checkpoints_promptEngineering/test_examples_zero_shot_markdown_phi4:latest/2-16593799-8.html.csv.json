Here's how to proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We are only interested in rows where the \"season\" is 2008.\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Scores**:\n   - For each game, sum the scores of both teams to get the total combined score.\n   - Record these scores along with their respective row indices for verification.\n\n3. **Sort and Analyze**: Sort the combined scores in descending order to identify the highest and second-highest values.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - Check if there are at least two games with a combined score of 10.\n   - Ensure that these are indeed the second-highest scores.\n\nLet's perform this analysis:\n\n- **Row 17**: Krung Thai Bank vs Kashima Antlers, Score: 1 - 9\n  - Combined Score = 1 + 9 = 10\n\n- **Row 18**: Beijing Guoan vs Krung Thai Bank, Score: 4 - 2\n  - Combined Score = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- **Row 19**: Krung Thai Bank vs Nam Dinh FC, Score: 9 - 1\n  - Combined Score = 9 + 1 = 10\n\n- **Row 20**: Nam Dinh FC vs Krung Thai Bank, Score: 2 - 2\n  - Combined Score = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- **Row 21**: Kashima Antlers vs Krung Thai Bank, Score: 8 - 1\n  - Combined Score = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- **Row 22**: Krung Thai Bank vs Beijing Guoan, Score: 5 - 3\n  - Combined Score = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n**Sorting the Combined Scores for 2008**:\n- 10 (Rows 17 and 19)\n- 9 (Row 21)\n- 8 (Row 22)\n- 6 (Row 18)\n- 4 (Row 20)\n\nThe highest combined score is 10, appearing in two games.
