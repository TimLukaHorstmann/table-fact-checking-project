    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if week 3's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is one of three games where the team won by fewer than 10 points.\n\n1. **Identify Week 3 Game Details**:\n   - Row for week 3: The opponent is \"tampa bay buccaneers\", and the result is \"w 14 - 9\".\n   - Calculate the point difference: 14 (score) - 9 (opponent score) = 5 points.\n   - Since they won by fewer than 10 points, week 3 meets this condition.\n\n2. **Identify Other Games Won by Fewer Than 10 Points**:\n   - We need to find all games where the team won and the point difference is less than 10.\n\n3. **Examine Each Game in the Table**:\n   - Week 1: Loss (opponent score higher, so not considered).\n   - Week 2: Win by 17 points (24-7), more than 10.\n   - Week 3: Already identified as a win by 5 points.\n   - Week 4: Win by 17 points (31-14), more than 10.\n   - Week 5: Win by 14 points (24-10), more than 10.\n   - Week 6: Win by 30 points (37-7), more than 10.\n   - Week 7: Win by 14 points (21-7), more than 10.\n   - Week 8: Loss (opponent score higher, so not considered).\n   - Week 9: Loss (opponent score higher, so not considered).\n\n4. **Count the Games Won by Fewer Than 10 Points**:\n   - Only week 3 qualifies as a win by fewer than 10 points.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that week 3 is one of three games won by fewer than 10 points.\n   - We found only one such game (week 3), not three.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification include those related to weeks where the team won and the point difference was calculated:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
