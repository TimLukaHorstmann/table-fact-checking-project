    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Kenneth Hanson should be listed as having won the mountain classification in his third stage.\n2. Lucas Sebastian Haedo should be listed as the winner of that same stage.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant columns and rows in the table for these conditions:\n\n- The \"mountains classification\" column will indicate who holds the mountains classification at each stage.\n- The \"winner\" column will show the winner of each stage.\n\nThe claim states that Kenneth Hanson's third stage as the mountain classification winner is when Lucas Sebastian Haedo wins a stage. We need to find:\n- When Kenneth Hanson first appears in the mountains classification (his 1st, 2nd, and then 3rd appearance).\n- If during his 3rd appearance, Lucas Sebastian Haedo is listed as the stage winner.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- In Stage 1, Kenneth Hanson does not appear in the \"mountains classification\" column.\n- In Stage 2, Kenneth Hanson also does not appear in the \"mountains classification\" column.\n- In Stage 3, Kenneth Hanson first appears in the \"mountains classification\" (his 1st appearance).\n- In Stage 4, Kenneth Hanson is listed again in the \"mountains classification\" (his 2nd appearance). Lucas Sebastian Haedo is the winner of this stage.\n- In Stage 5, Kenneth Hanson does not appear in the mountains classification.\n- In Stage 6, Kenneth Hanson does not appear in the mountains classification.\n\nKenneth Hanson's third appearance in the mountain classification column would be after Stage 4, but he doesn't reappear until Stage 3 (1st time), and Stage 4 (2nd time). He never gets a 3rd appearance. Therefore, it is impossible for his third stage as the mountains classification winner to coincide with any stage where Lucas Sebastian Haedo is listed as the winner.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- \"Mountains classification\" column in rows 1 through 6.\n- \"Winner\" column in rows 1 and 4 (where Lucas Sebastian Haedo wins).\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify this claim:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
