In the year 1811, the population is 1847.\n\nLet's examine the table for these specific years and populations:\n\n- The first row after the header lists the years in sequence: 1801, 1811, etc.\n- Correspondingly, the second row lists the population numbers associated with those years.\n\nFor the year 1801:\n- The column corresponding to \"year\" is 1801 (first column under \"population\").\n- The cell at this position shows a population of 1602.\n\nFor the year 1811:\n- The column corresponding to \"year\" is 1811 (second column under \"population\").\n- The cell at this position shows a population of 1847.\n\nBoth parts of the claim match the data in the table. Therefore, the entire claim is supported by the information provided.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n- For the year 1801 and population 1602: Row index 0 (population row), Column name \"1801\".\n- For the year 1811 and population 1847: Row index 0 (population row), Column name \"1811\".\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1801\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1811\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
