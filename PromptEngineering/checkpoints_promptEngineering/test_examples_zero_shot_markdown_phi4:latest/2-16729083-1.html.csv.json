    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. Check if the opponent in week 14 is \"kansas city chiefs.\"\n2. Check if the attendance for week 14 is \"74524.\"\n\nLet's analyze the relevant row from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n**Row 13 (Week 14):**\n- **Opponent:** The entry under the column \"opponent\" for week 14 is \"kansas city chiefs.\"\n- **Attendance:** The entry under the column \"attendance\" for week 14 is \"77778.\"\n\n### Comparison with Claim\n- The claim states that the opponent in week 14 is indeed \"kansas city chiefs,\" which matches our table data.\n- However, the claim also mentions an attendance of \"74524\" for week 14. This does not match the table's entry for week 14, which is \"77778.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the attendance part of the claim does not match the table's data, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 13, column name \"opponent\" (for opponent verification).\n- Row index 13, column name \"attendance\" (for attendance verification).\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
