    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim that \"Ferrari is the constructor of three cars in the race,\" we need to analyze the relevant column in the table provided: the \"constructor\" column.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The \"constructor\" column specifies which team constructed each car.\n2. **Search for 'Ferrari' Entries**: We need to count how many times \"Ferrari\" appears as the constructor in this column.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- Row 4: Michele Alboreto, Constructor is Ferrari\n- Row 5: Stefan Johansson, Constructor is Ferrari\n- No other entries have Ferrari listed as their constructor.\n\n**Count of Ferrari Entries**: There are exactly two rows where the constructor is Ferrari. Therefore, the claim that \"Ferrari is the constructor of three cars in the race\" is false because there are only two such instances.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 4 (Michele Alboreto) has Ferrari as a constructor.\n- Row 5 (Stefan Johansson) has Ferrari as a constructor.\n\nHere\u2019s the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
