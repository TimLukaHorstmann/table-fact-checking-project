The claim states: \"the series with the most episodes air after 'as sure as fate'.\" Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the row for 'as sure as fate':**\n   - This series airs from 4 May to 29 May.\n   - It has 20 episodes.\n   - Its row index is 3.\n\n2. **Check the number of episodes for all series airing after 'as sure as fate':**\n   - We need to consider only those rows with an \"airing date\" starting after 29 May.\n\n3. **Compare episode counts:**\n   - \"The duke of mount deer\" (1 Jun - 31 Jul): 45 episodes\n   - \"Old time buddy - to catch a thief\" (3 Aug - 4 Sep): 25 episodes\n   - \"Simply ordinary\" (7 Sep - 25 Sep): 15 episodes\n   - \"Web of love\" (28 Sep - 23 Oct): 20 episodes\n   - \"Journey to the west ii\" (26 Oct - 18 Dec): 42 episodes\n\n4. **Determine the series with the most episodes:**\n   - Among these, \"The duke of mount deer\" has the highest number of episodes at 45.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true because \"The duke of mount deer\" airs after \"as sure as fate\" and has the most episodes among the subsequent series.\n\n6. **Relevant cells for verification:**\n   - Row index 3 (for 'as sure as fate') to check its end date.\n   - Rows with airing dates after 29 May and their respective episode counts:\n     - Row index 4 (\"The duke of mount deer\")\n     - Row index 5 (\"Old time buddy - to catch a thief\")\n     - Row index 6 (\"Simply ordinary\")\n     - Row index 7 (\"Web of love\")\n     - Row index 8 (\"Journey to the west ii\")\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"airing date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"number of episodes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
