    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze specific details from the table:\n\n**Claim:** \"the philadelphia flyer beat the florida panther by 5 points on january 15, 1996\"\n\nLet's break down and verify each part of this claim:\n\n1. **Opponent Verification:**\n   - The opponent mentioned is \"florida panther.\"\n   - From the table, in row 46, the opponent listed for January 22 (not January 15) is \"florida panthers\" (note the plural form). No game against \"florida panther\" on January 15 is recorded.\n\n2. **Score Verification:**\n   - The claim states a win by 5 points.\n   - In row 46, where \"florida panthers\" are mentioned, the score is \"1 - 1 ot,\" indicating an overtime tie (no winner by any margin).\n\n3. **Date and Opponent Match:**\n   - On January 15, according to row 45, the opponent was \"dallas stars.\"\n   - The score on that date (row 45) was \"6 - 1,\" which is a win by 5 points.\n\n4. **Team Name Consistency:**\n   - The claim mentions \"philadelphia flyer,\" but there's no record of games involving this team in the table.\n   - On January 15, based on row 45, the winning team was not specified as Philadelphia Flyers in the table. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is FALSE because:\n- No game between \"Philadelphia Flyers\" and \"Florida Panther\" is recorded for January 15, 1996.\n- The only instance of a win by 5 points (row 45) involves the Dallas Stars on January 15.\n\nThus, based on the table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
