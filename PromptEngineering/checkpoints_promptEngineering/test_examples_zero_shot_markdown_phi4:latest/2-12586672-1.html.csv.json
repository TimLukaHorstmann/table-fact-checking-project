    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"player in the 1937 master tournament have to play 4 rounds,\" we must analyze the information provided in the table. The key aspect of this claim is whether each player played four rounds, as indicated by the column labeled \"score.\" \n\n1. **Understanding Table Columns:**\n   - Each row represents a player's performance.\n   - The \"score\" column shows individual round scores followed by a total and sometimes an equation summarizing these rounds.\n\n2. **Verification Process:**\n   - For each player, verify that there are four individual scores listed before the total score. This indicates four rounds of play.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1 (Byron Nelson):** Score is \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 2 (Ralph Guldahl):** Score is \"69 + 72 + 68 + 76 = 285\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 3 (Ed Dudley):** Score is \"70 + 71 + 71 + 74 = 286\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 4 (Harry Cooper):** Score is \"73 + 69 + 71 + 74 = 287\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 5 (Ky Laffoon):** Score is \"73 + 70 + 74 + 73 = 290\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 6 (Jimmy Thomson):** Score is \"71 + 73 + 74 + 73 = 291\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 7 (Al Watrous):** Score is \"74 + 72 + 71 + 75 = 292\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 8 (Tommy Armour):** Score is \"73 + 75 + 73 + 72 = 293\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 9 (Vic Ghezzi):** Score is \"72 + 72 + 72 + 77 = 293\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 10 (Leonard Dodson):** Score is \"71 + 75 + 71 + 77 = 294\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n   - **Row 11 (Jimmy Hines):** Score is \"77 + 72 + 68 + 77 = 294\" \u2013 Four rounds.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Each player has played four rounds, as evidenced by the structure of their scores in each row.\n\nTherefore, the claim that players in the 1937 Masters tournament had to play four rounds is supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no player scored below 70 in the final round\" is true or false, we need to examine the scores for each player in the fourth and final round of the golf tournament as recorded in the table.\n\nWe will look at the column labeled \"score,\" which includes a breakdown of rounds. The final score for each player is presented in this format: Round1 + Round2 + Round3 + FinalRound = TotalScore. Specifically, we need to extract the value representing the \"FinalRound\" from this summation for each player and check if any of these values are below 70.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- Byron Nelson: `66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283` (Final Round Score: **70**)\n- Ralph Guldahl: `69 + 72 + 68 + 76 = 285` (Final Round Score: **76**)\n- Ed Dudley: `70 + 71 + 71 + 74 = 286` (Final Round Score: **74**)\n- Harry Cooper: `73 + 69 + 71 + 74 = 287` (Final Round Score: **74**)\n- Ky Laffoon: `73 + 70 + 74 + 73 = 290` (Final Round Score: **73**)\n- Jimmy Thomson: `71 + 73 + 74 + 73 = 291` (Final Round Score: **73**)\n- Al Watrous: `74 + 72 + 71 + 75 = 292` (Final Round Score: **75**)\n- Tommy Armour: `73 + 75 + 73 + 72 = 293` (Final Round Score: **72**)\n- Vic Ghezzi: `72 + 72 + 72 + 77 = 293` (Final Round Score: **77**)\n- Leonard Dodson: `71 + 75 + 71 + 77 = 294` (Final Round Score: **77**)\n- Jimmy Hines: `77 + 72 + 68 + 77 = 294` (Final Round Score: **77**)\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that the lowest final round score is 70 by Byron Nelson. None of the players scored below 70 in the final round.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"no player scored below 70 in the final round\" is TRUE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used to verify the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
