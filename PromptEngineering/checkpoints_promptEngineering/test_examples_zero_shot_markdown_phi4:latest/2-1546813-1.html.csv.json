    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Solheim Cup being hosted in the USA on 7 occasions from 1990 through 2013 is true or false, we need to carefully analyze the given table and verify each part of the claim.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. The number of times the event was held in the USA.\n2. The time frame specified (from 1990 through 2013).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Identify Hosts in the USA:** We need to check the \"venue\" column for locations in the USA. According to the table:\n  - 2013: Colorado Golf Club, Colorado, USA\n  - 2009: Rich Harvest Farms, Illinois, USA\n  - 2005: Crooked Stick Golf Club, Indiana, USA\n  - 2002: Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota, USA\n  - 1998: Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA\n  - 1994: The Greenbrier, West Virginia, USA\n  - 1990: Lake Nona Golf & Country Club, Florida, USA\n\n- **Count the Occasions:** From the above list, there are indeed 7 occasions where the event was hosted in the USA.\n\n- **Verify Time Frame:** We need to ensure all these occurrences fall within the specified period (1990 through 2013). The years listed are:\n  - 2013\n  - 2009\n  - 2005\n  - 2002\n  - 1998\n  - 1994\n  - 1990\n\nAll these years fall within the range from 1990 to 2013.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are verified, the statement is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nTo verify this claim, we need to focus on the \"year\" and \"venue\" columns for each row that corresponds to a USA host:\n\n- Row index 9 (Year 2013): Venue includes \"USA\"\n- Row index 7 (Year 2009): Venue includes \"USA\"\n- Row index 5 (Year 2005): Venue includes \"USA\"\n- Row index 3 (Year 2002): Venue includes \"USA\"\n- Row index 1 (Year 1998): Venue includes \"USA\"\n- Row index -1 (Year 1994): Venue includes \"USA\"\n- Row index -3 (Year 1990): Venue includes \"USA\"\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": -1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": -3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
