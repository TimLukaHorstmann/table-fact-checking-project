    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the brighton hotel bombing happen in brighton, uk,\" we need to focus on two aspects of the table: the event name and its location.\n\n1. **Event Name**: The claim mentions \"brighton hotel bombing.\" We must find a row where the \"event\" column contains this exact text.\n2. **Location**: Once the correct row is identified based on the event, we need to verify that the \"location\" column matches \"brighton, uk.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant rows in the table:\n\n- In the row for the year 1984, the \"event\" is listed as \"brighton hotel bombing,\" which exactly matches the claim.\n- The corresponding \"location\" for this event is listed as \"brighton, uk,\" which also aligns with the claim.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied by this row. Therefore, the claim is TRUE based on the data provided in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
