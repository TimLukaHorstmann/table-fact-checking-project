    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions stated in the claim:\n\n1. Seve Ballesteros must be tied for 6th place.\n2. Seve Ballesteros must be from Spain.\n\nLet's evaluate these one by one using the table provided:\n\n### Condition 1: Seve Ballesteros is tied for 6th place\n- From the table, we see that Seve Ballesteros appears in row with \"t6\" as the value in the \"place\" column. This indicates that he is indeed tied for 6th position along with another player, Gary Koch.\n\n### Condition 2: Seve Ballesteros is from Spain\n- From the table, we see that in the \"country\" column of Seve Ballesteros's row, it states \"spain\". This confirms his nationality as claimed.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied based on the information provided in the table. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells for these verifications:\n- To verify that Seve Ballesteros is tied for 6th place, we look at the \"place\" column where he is listed as \"t6\".\n- To verify that Seve Ballesteros is from Spain, we refer to the \"country\" column where it states \"spain\".\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n1. For checking place: Row index 5, Column \"place\"\n2. For checking country: Row index 5, Column \"country\"\n\nNow, let's construct the JSON object as per the instructions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table, we need to verify each part of it:\n\n1. **\"the place t6 have money greater than 17333\":**\n   - We look at the rows labeled \"t6\". The players are Seve Ballesteros and Gary Koch.\n   - For both these entries, the money is listed as 22,000.\n   - Since 22,000 is indeed greater than 17,333, this condition is true.\n\n2. **\"to par +8\":**\n   - Again, looking at the rows labeled \"t6\", both players have a to-par score of \"+8\".\n   - This matches the claim, so this condition is also true.\n\n3. **\"and seve ballesteros as the player in australia\":**\n   - The row for Seve Ballesteros shows that he is from Spain, not Australia.\n   - This part of the claim is false.\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n- Two conditions are met (money greater than 17,333 and to-par of +8).\n- One condition fails (Seve Ballesteros being in Australia).\n\nOverall, because one part of the claim is false, the entire claim is considered FALSE. We identify the relevant cells as follows:\n\n- For money: rows with \"t6\" players have money 22,000.\n- For to-par: rows with \"t6\" players show \"+8\".\n- For player country: Seve Ballesteros's entry shows his country as Spain.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"money\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
