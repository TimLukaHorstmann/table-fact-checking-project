    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding the payouts for a \"four aces\" hand at different credit levels, we need to examine specific cells in the provided table. The relevant part of the table lists various hands and their corresponding credits based on different bet sizes (from 1 credit to 5 credits).\n\nThe claim is: \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit.\"\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Row for \"Four Aces\":**\n   - We need to find the row that corresponds to a \"four aces\" hand.\n\n2. **Verify Payouts at Different Credit Levels:**\n   - Check the payout for \"four aces\" with a 5-credit bet.\n   - Check the payout for \"four aces\" with a 1-credit bet.\n\n3. **Match the Claim to Table Data:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - The payout for \"four aces\" at 5 credits is listed as 800.\n     - The payout for \"four aces\" at 1 credit is listed as 160.\n\nThese observations directly match the claim's statement about the payouts, confirming that it is indeed true based on the data provided in the table.\n\nNext, we identify the relevant cells to verify this information:\n\n- **Row Index:**\n  - The row for \"four aces\" is the fifth row (0-based indexing), which corresponds to index 4.\n  \n- **Column Names:**\n  - For a 5-credit bet, check the column named \"5 credits.\"\n  - For a 1-credit bet, check the column named \"1 credit.\"\n\nUsing this information, we can construct the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine the relevant rows and columns in the table for the given conditions.\n\n1. The first part of the claim states: \"four ace yield 900 for 5 credit.\" We need to check if this is true by looking at the row for \"four aces\" and the column for \"5 credits\". According to the table, under \"four aces\" for 5 credits, the value is indeed 800. Thus, the claim that it yields 900 is incorrect.\n\n2. The second part of the claim states: \"the result for 1 credit would be 160.\" We need to verify this by looking at the row for \"four aces\" and the column for \"1 credit\". According to the table, under \"four aces\" for 1 credit, the value is indeed 160. This part of the claim is correct.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect (the yield of 900 for 5 credits), the entire claim cannot be true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- For checking the yield of 900 for 5 credits: \"four aces\" row at index 4 and \"5 credits\" column.\n- For verifying the result of 160 for 1 credit: \"four aces\" row at index 4 and \"1 credit\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
