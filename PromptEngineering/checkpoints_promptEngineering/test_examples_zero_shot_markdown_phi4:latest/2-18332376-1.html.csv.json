This supports part of the claim for 1999.\n  \n- **2000 Data:**\n  - There is no entry in the table for the year 2000, which means Antonio Pompa - Baldi could not have been first because there was no competition listed for that year.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is partially true for 1999 but false for 2000 due to the absence of any data for 2000.
