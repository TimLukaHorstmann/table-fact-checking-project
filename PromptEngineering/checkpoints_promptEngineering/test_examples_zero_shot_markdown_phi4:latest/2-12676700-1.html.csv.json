    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"before week 6, attendance at San Diego Chargers game total 13000,\" we need to evaluate the relevant information from the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Conditions**:\n   - The claim specifies \"before week 6,\" which means we only consider games that occurred in weeks 1 through 5.\n   - It also mentions \"San Diego Chargers game,\" so we are interested in any row where the opponent is the San Diego Chargers.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Weeks 1 to 5**:\n   - Week 1: The opponent is New York Titans, not relevant.\n   - Week 2: The opponent is Dallas Texans, not relevant.\n   - Week 3: The opponent is San Diego Chargers with an attendance of 13000. This row matches the conditions.\n   - Week 4: The opponent is Denver Broncos, not relevant.\n   - Week 5: The opponent is Denver Broncos again, not relevant.\n\n3. **Evaluate Attendance**:\n   - From week 1 to week 5, there is only one game against the San Diego Chargers in week 3 with an attendance of 13000.\n\n4. **Determine if the Claim is True or False**:\n   - The total attendance for games against the San Diego Chargers before week 6 is exactly 13000, as there was only one such game.\n   - Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Only the row corresponding to week 3 is relevant because it satisfies both conditions: it's a game against the San Diego Chargers and occurs before week 6.\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
