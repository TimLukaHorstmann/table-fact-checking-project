    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the game against Charlotte, we need to focus on a specific row in the table and verify the details concerning high points.\n\nThe claim states: \"the high point for charlotte be score by allen (23)\" which implies two conditions:\n1. The player who scored the highest points should be Allen.\n2. The number of points scored by this player should be 23.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n- **Identify the relevant row**: \n  - The game against Charlotte is listed in row with index 57 (since markdown indexing starts at 0). \n\n- **Check the \"high points\" column for this specific row**:\n  - For row 57, the entry under \"high points\" is \"allen (23)\".\n\nThis directly supports both conditions of the claim:\n1. Allen scored the highest points in that game.\n2. The number of high points he scored was indeed 23.\n\nGiven these checks, we can confidently conclude that the claim is TRUE based on the data provided.\n\nHere's the relevant information formatted as required:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
