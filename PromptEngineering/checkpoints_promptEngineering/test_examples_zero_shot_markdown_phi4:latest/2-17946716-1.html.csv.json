    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the game at the griffith stadium be october 9 , 1960,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The date of the game is October 9, 1960.\n2. The game site for this date is Griffith Stadium.\n\nLet's examine these relevant columns in the table:\n\n- **Date Column**: Identify the row where the \"date\" matches \"october 9 , 1960\".\n- **Game Site Column**: Check if the corresponding \"game site\" for that row is \"griffith stadium\".\n\nReviewing the table:\n- Row 3 has the date \"october 9, 1960.\"\n- The game site listed in this row is \"griffith stadium.\"\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant information from the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the date for week 3 in the given table, we need to verify whether the entry for week 3 matches the specified date \"October 9, 1960.\"\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that correspond to this claim are:\n\n- **Row Index**: Identify the row where week number is 3.\n- **Column Name**: The column of interest is \"date\" because we need to check what date is listed for week 3.\n\nLet's verify these details:\n\n1. Locate the entry for week 3 in the table:\n   - According to the table, the row corresponding to week 3 has:\n     ```\n     | week | date              |\n     |-----:|:------------------|\n     |    3 | October 9, 1960   |\n     ```\n\n2. Confirm the column value for \"date\" in this row is indeed \"October 9, 1960\".\n\nGiven these steps and observations, we can conclude that the claim matches the data from the table.\n\nThus, the JSON response indicating the outcome of the verification process is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
