    "resp": "To verify the claim against the table, we will evaluate each part of the statement and identify relevant cells in the markdown format table.\n\n1. **Netherfield's Losses:**\n   - The claim states that Netherfield lost the most games with 28 losses.\n   - Checking row 21 (team = \"netherfield\"), column \"lost\" shows a value of 28, which is indeed the highest number in this column.\n\n2. **Gateshead and Southport Draws:**\n   - The claim states that Gateshead and Southport tied for the most games drawn at 14.\n   - For Gateshead (row 3), checking column \"drawn\" confirms a value of 14.\n   - For Southport (row 7), checking column \"drawn\" also shows a value of 14.\n   - Both teams have the highest number of draws as no other team has more than 14.\n\n3. **Bangor City's Goals:**\n   - The claim states that Bangor City came in first position with 108 goals overall for the team.\n   - Checking row 0 (team = \"bangor city\"), column \"goals for\" shows a value of 108, which is indeed the highest number in this column.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to examine two conditions: \n1. Whether \"matlock town\" indeed has lost the highest number of games.\n2. Verify if this number is 23.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify \"matlock town\" in the table:**\n   - Look for the row where \"team\" is \"matlock town\".\n   - According to the table, \"matlock town\" is at `row_index` 20.\n\n2. **Check the number of games lost by \"matlock town\":**\n   - The column name for games lost is \"lost\".\n   - For \"matlock town\", located in `row_index` 20, the value under \"lost\" is 23.\n\n3. **Verify if any other team has lost more than or equal to 23 games:**\n   - We need to inspect each row's \"lost\" column for values greater than 23.\n   - By examining the table:\n     - Rows with teams losing more than 23 games are identified, particularly `row_index` 21 (\"netherfield\") and `row_index` 19 (\"tamworth\"), both having higher or equal numbers of losses (28 and 23 respectively).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"matlock town\" has lost 23 games but not the highest number of games, as \"netherfield\" has lost more with 28 games, the claim is incorrect.\n   \n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For confirming the team name:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"team\"}`\n  \n- For verifying the number of games lost by \"matlock town\":\n  - `{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}`\n\n- To ensure no other team has more losses:\n  - Check all relevant \"lost\" columns for numbers greater than or equal to 23.\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
