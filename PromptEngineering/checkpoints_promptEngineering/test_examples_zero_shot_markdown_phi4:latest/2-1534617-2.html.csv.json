    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to check each condition stated in the claim against the relevant cells of the table.\n\nThe claim consists of two parts:\n1. \"autumn gold have a 2007 - 08 of c\"\n2. \"players' have 2007 - 08 of q\"\n\nWe will examine these conditions one by one:\n\n### Condition 1: \"autumn gold have a 2007 - 08 of c\"\n- Look at the row for \"autumn gold\" in the table.\n- Find the column labeled \"2007 - 08\".\n- The value in this cell is `c`.\n\nThis condition is true.\n\n### Condition 2: \"players' have 2007 - 08 of q\"\n- Look at the row for \"players'\" in the table.\n- Find the column labeled \"2007 - 08\".\n- The value in this cell is `q`.\n\nThis condition is also true.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the entire claim is true. Now we identify the relevant cells used to verify these conditions:\n\n- For \"autumn gold have a 2007 - 08 of c\", the relevant cell is:\n  - Row: \"autumn gold\" (row index 0)\n  - Column: \"2007 - 08\"\n\n- For \"players' have 2007 - 08 of q\", the relevant cell is:\n  - Row: \"players'\" (row index 4)\n  - Column: \"2007 - 08\"\n\nNow, we can construct the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2007 - 08\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2007 - 08\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the specific cell in the table related to the event \"autumn gold\" for the year 2011 - 12.\n\nHere's how we can analyze it:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Event and Year**:\n   - The event mentioned in the claim is \"autumn gold\".\n   - The year specified is 2011 - 12.\n\n2. **Locate the Correct Row and Column**:\n   - From the table, the first row corresponds to the event \"autumn gold\".\n   - The columns correspond to years starting from \"2006 - 07\" up to \"2012 - 13\".\n\n3. **Find the Specific Cell**:\n   - For \"autumn gold\", locate the cell in the column labeled \"2011 - 12\". This is the seventh column.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The value in this cell (\"q\") needs to be checked against the claim.\n   - The claim states that the result should be \"c\" for 2011 - 12, but the table shows \"q\".\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The relevant cell is at row index 0 (first row) and column name \"2011 - 12\".\n- The actual value in this cell is \"q\", not \"c\".\n\nThus, the claim is false. Here's the JSON response reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2011 - 12\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
