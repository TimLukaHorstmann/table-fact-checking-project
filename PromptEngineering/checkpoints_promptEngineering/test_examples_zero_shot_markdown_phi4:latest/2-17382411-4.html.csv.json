    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if Bob Rule had the lowest high points in the specified games during the 1967-68 Seattle Supersonics season.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are looking for instances where \"Bob Rule\" is listed as having the highest points in a game.\n   - We will extract these values from the \"high points\" column and compare them to other players' high point scores in the same table.\n\n2. **Extract Bob Rule's High Points:**\n   - Game 10: November 2, Chicago - Bob Rule scored 27 points.\n   - Game 16: November 14, Boston - Bob Weiss scored 29 points (not relevant for Bob Rule).\n   - Game 20: November 21, LA Lakers - Bob Rule scored 47 points.\n   - Game 21: November 23, Boston - Bob Rule scored 26 points.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Players' High Points:**\n   - We need to check if any other player's high point score is lower than the lowest score by Bob Rule.\n   - The scores for Bob Rule are 27, 47, and 26.\n   - The lowest among these is 26 points.\n\n4. **Check All High Point Scores:**\n   - Game 9: Al Tucker scored 23 points.\n   - Game 11: Walt Hazzard scored 19 points.\n   - Game 12: Bob Weiss scored 20 points.\n   - Game 13: Walt Hazzard scored 20 points.\n   - Game 14: Walt Hazzard scored 33 points.\n   - Game 15: Walt Hazzard scored 26 points.\n   - Game 17: Walt Hazzard scored 30 points.\n   - Game 18: Bob Rule scored 31 points.\n   - Game 19: Bob Weiss scored 27 points.\n   - Game 22: Walt Hazzard scored 19 points.\n   - Game 23: Walt Hazzard scored 21 points.\n   - Game 24: Three players scored 20 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The lowest high point score in the table is 19 points (by Walt Hazzard in Games 11 and 22).\n   - Bob Rule's lowest high point score is 26, which is not the lowest overall.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"Bob Rule in the 1967-68 Seattle Supersonics season have the lowest high point\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
