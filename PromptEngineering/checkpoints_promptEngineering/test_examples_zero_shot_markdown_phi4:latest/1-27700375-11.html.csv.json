    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Jordan Farmar led the team in points for 5 straight games,\" we need to examine the \"high points\" column across multiple rows in the table and determine if Jordan Farmar was listed as having the highest points scored by a player on the team.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant game:\n\n1. **Game 75 (April 1):** \n   - High Points: Brandan Wright (15)\n   - Jordan Farmar is not mentioned, so he did not lead in this game.\n\n2. **Game 76 (April 3):**\n   - High Points: Deron Williams (18)\n   - Jordan Farmar is not mentioned, so he did not lead in this game.\n\n3. **Game 77 (April 5):** \n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (30)\n   - Jordan Farmar is not mentioned, so he did not lead in this game.\n\n4. **Game 78 (April 6):**\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (39)\n   - Jordan Farmar is not mentioned, so he did not lead in this game.\n\n5. **Game 79 (April 8):**\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (27)\n   - Jordan Farmar is not mentioned, so he did not lead in this game.\n\n6. **Game 80 (April 10):**\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (35)\n   - Jordan Farmar is not mentioned, so he did not lead in this game.\n\n7. **Game 81 (April 11):**\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (31)\n   - Jordan Farmar is not mentioned, so he did not lead in this game.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we see that Jordan Farmar never led in points for any of these games, let alone for five straight games. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the most highly attended game was against Minnesota at the Prudential Center,\" we need to analyze the attendance numbers in the provided table and check if the conditions mentioned in the claim hold true.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The relevant column for this analysis is \"location attendance\" because it contains the number of attendees for each game.\n   - We also need to verify the opponent (team) and location (\"Prudential Center\") as specified in the claim.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Numbers:**\n   - Game 75: Wells Fargo Center, 16,695\n   - Game 76: Prudential Center, 18,711\n   - Game 77: Prudential Center, 13,461 (against Minnesota)\n   - Game 78: The Palace of Auburn Hills, 14,554\n   - Game 79: Prudential Center, 18,023\n   - Game 80: Air Canada Centre, 17,755\n   - Game 81: Prudential Center, 13,853\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Attendance:**\n   - The highest attendance recorded is 18,711 for Game 76 against Miami at the Prudential Center.\n\n4. **Verify Conditions of the Claim:**\n   - According to the claim, the most highly attended game should be against Minnesota at the Prudential Center.\n   - The game against Minnesota (Game 77) had an attendance of 13,461, which is not the highest in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Game 76 has a higher attendance than Game 77, and Game 77 was indeed played at the Prudential Center but was not the most highly attended game, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Row index 2 (Game 77) contains information about playing against Minnesota at the Prudential Center.\n   - Rows with attendance numbers should be checked to find the highest one:\n     - Row indices 1, 3, 5, and 6 contain games played at the Prudential Center with higher attendances than Game 77.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 2 for game details against Minnesota and location.\n- Rows index 1, 3, 5, and 6 for attendance figures to identify the highest one.\n\nHere's the JSON response summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
