    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"emilio materassi drive a in 1927\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to evaluate specific parts of the claim against the relevant columns and cells within the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The claim includes three components that correspond to different columns:\n     - \"emilio materassi\" should match an entry in the \"driver\" column.\n     - \"1927\" should match an entry in the \"year\" column.\n     - \"drive a\" does not specify any specific column but implies participation, which can be confirmed if both previous conditions are met.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row:**\n   - Look for the row where the year is 1927 and the driver is Emilio Materassi.\n\n3. **Check the Table for Matching Entries:**\n   - In the table:\n     - The \"year\" column has an entry of \"1927\".\n     - The corresponding \"driver\" column in that same row should have \"emilio materassi\".\n\n4. **Verify the Match:**\n   - At `row_index 11`, we find:\n     - Year = 1927\n     - Driver = emilio materassi\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (year is 1927 and driver is Emilio Materassi), the claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
