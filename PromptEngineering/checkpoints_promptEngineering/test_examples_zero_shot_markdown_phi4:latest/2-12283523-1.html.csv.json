    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Francis Dickinson and his association with the Conservative Party in 1885, let's examine each part of the claim:\n\n1. **\"Francis Dickinson be the 1st member...in 1885\"**: We need to check whether Francis Dickinson was listed as a \"1st member\" for any election year in 1885.\n\n2. **\"...of the conservative party...\"**: If Francis Dickinson is found as the \"1st member,\" we must verify that his associated \"party\" is indeed \"conservative.\"\n\nFirst, let's analyze the table by checking each row:\n\n- The table does not have a row for the year 1885 under any election column.\n- Specifically, in the last row (row index 12), it states: \n  - **election**: 1885\n  - **1st member**: constituency abolished\n  - **1st party**: constituency abolished\n\nSince the table explicitly notes that the \"constituency\" was \"abolished\" for the year 1885, there is no \"1st member\" listed for this year. Thus, Francis Dickinson cannot be a first member in 1885.\n\nNext, let's confirm the details about Francis Dickinson:\n\n- Looking through the rows from 1841 to 1863 (row indices 3 to 7), we find:\n  - **1832**: row index 2\n    - **1st member**: Edward Ayshford Sanford \n    - **1st party**: whig\n  - **1841**:\n    - **1st member**: Francis Dickinson \n    - **1st party**: conservative\n\nFrancis Dickinson is indeed listed as the \"1st member\" in 1841 and associated with the Conservative Party. However, this information pertains to 1841, not 1885.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- There is no relevant entry for Francis Dickinson in 1885.\n- The claim that he was a first member of the conservative party in 1885 is not supported by any data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. The relevant cells to verify this are those from row index 12 (the year 1885) and row indices where Francis Dickinson appears as \"1st member\" for other years to confirm his correct association with the Conservative Party:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"election\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"1st member\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st member\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
