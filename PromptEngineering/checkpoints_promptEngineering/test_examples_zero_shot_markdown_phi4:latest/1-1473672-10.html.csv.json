Whether \"Rene Lambert\" was drafted with the 146th pick.\n\nLet's examine the table for the relevant information:\n\n- For \"Rene Lambert\":\n  - **Position**: The position column indicates that Rene Lambert is listed as playing \"right wing.\"\n  - **Pick**: The pick column shows that Rene Lambert was drafted with the 146th pick.\n\nBoth conditions match the details provided in the claim. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n\n- Row index 2 (since row indices start at 0), Column name \"position\" for verifying he plays as a \"right wing.\"\n- Row index 2, Column name \"pick\" for verifying he was drafted with the 146th pick.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
