    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the scores for both home and away teams in each game listed in the table. The claim states that the lowest score belongs to Fitzroy with a score of 20.10 (130). This implies that the claim is about identifying the lowest total score across all games.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Scores:**\n   - Each team's score is given in two formats: \"X.Y\" and \"(Z)\".\n   - \"X.Y\" represents goals (X) and behinds (Y).\n   - The total points are calculated as \\( \\text{Total Points} = 6 \\times X + Y \\).\n\n2. **Calculating Total Scores for Each Game:**\n   - For each game, we need to calculate the total score by adding the home team's score and the away team's score.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row:**\n   - **Row 0:** Geelong (41) vs Melbourne (83)\n     - Total Score = 41 + 83 = 124\n   - **Row 1:** Carlton (80) vs Footscray (50)\n     - Total Score = 80 + 50 = 130\n   - **Row 2:** South Melbourne (73) vs Hawthorn (84)\n     - Total Score = 73 + 84 = 157\n   - **Row 3:** Fitzroy (130) vs North Melbourne (108)\n     - Total Score = 130 + 108 = 238\n   - **Row 4:** Essendon (76) vs St Kilda (74)\n     - Total Score = 76 + 74 = 150\n   - **Row 5:** Richmond (84) vs Collingwood (97)\n     - Total Score = 84 + 97 = 181\n\n4. **Identifying the Lowest Total Score:**\n   - From the calculations above, the lowest total score is 124 from Row 0.\n\n5. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Fitzroy has the lowest score with a total of 130.\n   - However, the lowest total score is 124 (Row 0), not 130.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
