Sheffield Wednesday 0 - 1 Chelsea: Point differential = |0 - 1| = 1\n2. Everton 2 - 1 Coventry City: Point differential = |2 - 1| = 1\n3.

Identify the rows with replay matches:\n   - Row 3 mentions a replay between Blackpool and Newcastle United.\n   - Row 6 mentions a replay between Derby County and Huddersfield Town.\n   - Row 7 mentions a replay between Arsenal and Sheffield United.\n\n2. Check the dates of these replays from the \"attendance\" column (which contains the date):\n   - For row 3, the replay is on 24 February 1999.\n   - For row 6, the replay is on 24 February 1999.\n   - For row 7, the replay is on 23 February 1999.\n\n3. Compare these dates to verify if they all occur on the same day:\n   - Rows 3 and 6 have replays on 24 February 1999.\n   - Row 7 has a replay on 23 February 1999.\n\nSince not all replays occurred on the same day, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for this verification are those in the \"attendance\" column of rows with replay games:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table for \"tie no 5\". The claim states: \"tie no 5 have the same score for both team.\"\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to \"tie no 5\":\n   - From the table, \"tie no 5\" corresponds to the row with home team \"manchester united\" and away team \"fulham\".\n\n2. Check the \"score\" column for this tie:\n   - The score listed is \"1 - 0\", which indicates that Manchester United scored 1 goal and Fulham scored 0 goals.\n\n3. Evaluate the claim:\n   - For the scores to be the same, both teams should have scored an equal number of goals.\n   - In this case, the scores are not equal (1 for Manchester United vs. 0 for Fulham).\n\nBased on this evaluation, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim are found in the row corresponding to \"tie no 5\", specifically in the \"score\" column.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
