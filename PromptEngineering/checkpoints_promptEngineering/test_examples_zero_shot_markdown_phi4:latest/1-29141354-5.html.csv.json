The episode broadcast on 4 May 2012.\n2. Jessica Ennis is listed as \"Andrew and Jack's guest\" for that episode.\n\n### Relevant Columns:\n- **Column: `first broadcast`**: This helps us find the episode aired on 4 May 2012.\n- **Column: `andrew and jacks guest`**: This allows us to check if Jessica Ennis was Andrew and Jack\u2019s guest.\n\n### Checking Against the Table:\n\n1. **Find the episode that matches the date \"4 may 2012\":**\n   - The row with `episode = 05x03` has the first broadcast on \"4 may 2012\".\n\n2. **Check if Jessica Ennis is listed as Andrew and Jack's guest for this episode:**\n   - For the same row (`episode = 05x03`), we see that \"jessica ennis\" is indeed listed under the `andrew and jacks guest`.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index corresponding to `episode = 05x03`.\n  - Column: `first broadcast` for date verification.\n  - Column: `andrew and jacks guest` for confirming Jessica Ennis as a guest.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
