    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"liu song be not rank higher in 2007 / 2008 than in 2009 / 2010\" is true or false, we need to interpret what \"rank higher\" means in the context of this table and identify relevant data points for comparison.\n\n1. **Understanding Table Entries:**\n   - The entries like 'lq', 'a', 'wr', '1r', '2r', '3r', 'qf' represent different levels of performance or participation:\n     - 'lq' stands for \"lost in qualifying rounds\"\n     - 'a' typically means \"advance\" or similar (exact meaning might vary)\n     - 'nr' might mean \"not ranked\"\n     - 'wr' could indicate a win, such as \"world ranking\" or top position\n     - '1r', '2r', and '3r' likely represent reaching the first round, second round, and third round respectively in some tournament\n     - 'qf' stands for \"quarter-finals\"\n   - The term \"not held\" indicates that a particular event did not occur.\n\n2. **Comparing Liu Song's Performance:**\n   - For 2007 / 08:\n     - Look at each row to see if there are entries higher than 'lq', as this would suggest a better performance.\n     - Relevant rows with notable achievements are the ones containing 'a', 'qf', and potentially '1r'.\n\n   - For 2009 / 10:\n     - Similarly, look for any entries indicating achievement beyond 'lq'.\n     - Notable performances in this column include '1r' and '3r'.\n\n3. **Performing the Comparison:**\n   - In 2007 / 08, notable achievements are:\n     - Row 6: 'qf'\n     - Rows with 'a': 2, 4, 10, 11\n   - In 2009 / 10, notable achievements are:\n     - Row 8: '3r'\n     - Row 7: '1r'\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Liu Song's highest rank in 2007/08 is reaching the quarter-finals ('qf'), while in 2009/10, the highest achievement noted is reaching the third round ('3r').\n   - Assuming a standard progression of rounds (e.g., '1r' < '2r' < '3r' < 'qf'), Liu Song's performance is better in 2007/08 compared to 2009/10.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For 2007 / 08, the relevant cells are:\n     - Row 6, \"ranking tournaments\": 'qf'\n     - Rows 2, 4, 10, 11, \"ranking tournaments\": 'a'\n\n   - For 2009 / 10, the relevant cells are:\n     - Row 8, \"non-ranking tournaments\": '3r'\n     - Row 7, \"former ranking tournaments\": '1r'\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE as Liu Song ranked higher in 2007/08 than in 2009/10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"non-ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"former ranking tournaments\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Liu Song's worst ranking being 90th in the season of 2004/2005, we need to examine the relevant column and row within the provided table.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions:\n- \"Liu Song\"\n- \"worst ranking\"\n- \"90th\"\n- \"season of 2004 / 2005\"\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that we are looking at Liu Song's performance data for the season of 2004/2005. The table is structured with columns representing different seasons and rows presumably indicating different tournaments or events.\n\nThe column corresponding to the 2004/2005 season contains numerical values in its first row (90, 88, 72, etc.). These numbers likely represent rankings or scores for Liu Song in various tournaments during that season. The claim suggests that the worst ranking is \"90th.\"\n\nTo verify this:\n- Check the column labeled \"2004 / 05.\"\n- Identify if there are any values worse than 90 (since a higher number indicates a worse ranking).\n\nUpon inspection, we see that the first row of the 2004/05 column contains the value \"90.\" There are no other rows with numerical values in this column that exceed 90. Therefore, 90 is indeed the worst ranking for Liu Song during the 2004/2005 season.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2004 / 05\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However:\n\n- A position of \"wr\" (World Rank) is generally considered superior to any specific round number like \"1r.\" \n- Therefore, moving from a \"wr\" position in 2010/11 to a \"1r\" in 2011/12 actually signifies a drop in ranking performance.\n\nThis change from \"wr\" to \"1r\" represents a decline or fall in ranking by at least one rank. However, without specific numerical values for these abbreviations, we can't precisely quantify the difference as exactly three ranks. We only know it is lower, but not necessarily by three exact positions based on the information given.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that Liu Song's rank was \"three ranks lower\" in 2011/12 compared to 2010/11 cannot be confirmed with certainty from the data provided because we lack specific numerical ranking values.\n  \nThus, the answer is **FALSE**. \n\nHere are the relevant cells that were checked:\n- Row for \"ranking tournaments\": \n  - Column for 2010/11: Cell with \"wr\"\n  - Column for 2011/12: Cell with \"1r\"\n\n- Row for \"not held\":\n  - Column for 2010/11: Cell with \"wr\"\n  - Column for 2011/12: Cell with \"1r\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ranking tournaments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"not held\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, based on the information provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2005 / 06\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 10\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis conclusion is drawn because the table does not provide explicit numerical rankings necessary to verify a 40-place drop.",
