However, according to the table:\n\n- Sean McNamara directed \"blue in the face\" (Series 30).\n- Christopher B Pearman directed \"skunk'd\" (Series 37).\n\nSince the director for \"skunk'd\" is not Sean McNamara, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row 9 (\"blue in the face\"), column \"directed by\"\n- Row 16 (\"skunk'd\"), column \"directed by\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, based on our findings from the table:\n\n- \"a goat 's tale\" has 4.3 million viewers.\n- \"the road to audition\" also has 4.3 million viewers.\n\nSince neither episode has 4.6 million viewers, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
