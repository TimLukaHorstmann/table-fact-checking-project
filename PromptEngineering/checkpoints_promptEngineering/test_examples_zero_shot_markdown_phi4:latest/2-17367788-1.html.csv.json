    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"boston united lost 10 points, but come in 2nd position,\" we need to verify two conditions using the table:\n\n1. Check if Boston United originally had 10 more points than what is currently displayed.\n2. Verify their current standing compared to Wigan Athletic, which holds the second position.\n\nLet's examine these conditions:\n\n### Relevant Data for Boston United:\n- **Current Position**: Row index 0\n  - Current Points: 71\n  - Current Rank: 1\n\nFrom condition (1), if Boston United lost 10 points:\n- Previous Points = 71 + 10 = 81\n\nCondition (2) requires us to compare Boston United's current position with Wigan Athletic.\n\n### Relevant Data for Wigan Athletic:\n- **Current Position**: Row index 1\n  - Current Points: 65\n  - Current Rank: 2\n\nTo verify the claim, check:\n\n- Did Boston United originally have 81 points? \n  - If they had 81 points and lost 10, their current points would be 71. This aligns with the data in the table.\n  \n- Would a reduction of 10 points drop them below Wigan Athletic?\n  - With 65 points, Wigan Athletic is currently second. After losing 10 points, Boston United's new hypothetical point total (81 - 10 = 71) would still be above Wigan Athletic\u2019s 65 points.\n\nTherefore, even with a deduction of 10 points from the original 81, Boston United would not drop below Wigan Athletic to second position; they would remain first. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For \"boston united\":\n  - Points (column name: \"points 1\"): Current row index 0.\n  \n- For \"wigan athletic\" for comparison:\n  - Points (column name: \"points 1\"): Current row index 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that Boston United dropped to second position after losing 10 points is FALSE.
