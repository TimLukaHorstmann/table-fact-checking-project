The number before \"r\" represents the round number; thus:\n       - \"1r\" means she lost in the first round.\n       - \"2r\" would mean she advanced to the second round, and so on.\n\n2. **Analyze Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"australian open\" column across all years (2007-2012) to check if Tatjana Maria participated or lost in any of those years.\n   - The relevant data points for the Australian Open are:\n     - 2007: \"a\"\n     - 2008: \"a\"\n     - 2009: \"a\"\n     - 2010: \"1r\"\n     - 2011: \"1r\"\n     - 2012: \"a\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that she lost all of her games in the Australian Open.\n   - From our analysis, Tatjana Maria participated in 2010 and 2011, both times reaching only the first round (\"1r\"), meaning she indeed lost her match in those years.\n   - In 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2012, she did not participate (denoted by \"a\").\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Tatjana Maria either didn't participate or lost all matches when she participated (in the first round), the claim is supported.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to check are those under the \"australian open\" column from row indices 1 to 6 (2007-2012).\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"australian open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"australian open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"australian open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"australian open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"australian open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"australian open\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the player's win-loss record across all four Grand Slam tournaments from 2007 to 2012.\n\nThe claim states: \"she be 6 and 10 in win loss during this open\"\n\nThis implies a total of 6 wins and 10 losses over these years.\n\nLet's break down each tournament year by year:\n\n1. **Australian Open**:\n   - 2007: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2008: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2009: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2010: 1r (loss, 0-1)\n   - 2011: 1r (loss, 0-1)\n   - 2012: a (not played, 0-0)\n\n2. **French Open**:\n   - 2007: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2008: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2009: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2010: 2r (win, 1-0)\n   - 2011: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2012: a (not played, 0-0)\n\n3. **Wimbledon**:\n   - 2007: 2r (win, 1-0)\n   - 2008: 1r (loss, 0-1)\n   - 2009: 1r (loss, 0-1)\n   - 2010: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2011: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2012: a (not played, 0-0)\n\n4. **US Open**:\n   - 2007: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2008: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2009: 2r (win, 1-0)\n   - 2010: 1r (loss, 0-1)\n   - 2011: a (not played, 0-0)\n   - 2012: 2r (win, 1-0)\n\nNow, let's tally the total wins and losses:\n\n- **Wins**: \n  - French Open 2010: 1\n  - Wimbledon 2007: 1\n  - US Open 2009: 1\n  - US Open 2012: 1\n\n  Total Wins = 4\n\n- **Losses**:\n  - Australian Open 2010: 1\n  - Australian Open 2011: 1\n  - French Open 2010: 0 (since they won)\n  - Wimbledon 2008: 1\n  - Wimbledon 2009: 1\n  - US Open 2010: 1\n\n  Total Losses = 4\n\nThe player's total record from the table is 4 wins and 4 losses, which does not match the claim of \"6 and 10\" in win-loss.\n\nFinally, we verify with the career win-loss row:\n\n- Career Win-Loss: 4 - 12\n\nThis confirms the overall discrepancy. The relevant cells for verifying this are all the individual tournament results from 2007 to 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"australian open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"french open\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wimbledon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us open\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
