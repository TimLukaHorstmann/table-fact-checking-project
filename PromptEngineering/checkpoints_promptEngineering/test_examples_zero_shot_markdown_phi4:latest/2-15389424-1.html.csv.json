The number of games lost by Corinthians.\n\nHere's how to evaluate these using the provided table:\n\n- **Games Won by a Team:** In this context, it is implied that the \"points\" can be used to calculate the number of wins because typically in many football leagues, each win contributes 3 points and each draw contributes 1 point. The formula to derive wins from the total points, given the number of draws (`drawn`), is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Wins} = \\frac{\\text{Points} - (\\text{Draws} \\times 1)}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Games Lost by a Team:** The table directly provides this information under the \"lost\" column.\n\nLet's apply these to S\u00edrio and Corinthians:\n\n### For S\u00edrio:\n- Points = 26\n- Drawn = 4\n\nUsing the formula for wins:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Wins for S\u00edrio} = \\frac{26 - (4 \\times 1)}{3} = \\frac{22}{3} = 7.33 \n\\]\n\nSince the number of games won must be an integer, this calculation indicates that S\u00edrio has 7 wins (since you can't win a fraction of a game).\n\n### For Corinthians:\n- Lost = 2\n\nThe table directly gives us that Corinthians lost 2 games.\n\n### Comparison:\n\n- **S\u00edrio Wins:** 7\n- **Corinthians Losses:** 2\n\nSince 7 is greater than 2, the claim \"S\u00edrio win more games than Corinthians lost\" is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells in the table are those providing the necessary information to determine the number of wins for S\u00edrio and losses for Corinthians:\n\n- For S\u00edrio: The rows with `points` (26) and `drawn` (4), as well as the `lost` column (3).\n- For Corinthians: The `lost` column (2).\n\nHere is the JSON representation of these relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
