    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Paul J. Kilday's election in Texas District 20, we need to verify two specific aspects from the table:\n\n1. The first elected year for Paul J. Kilday in Texas District 20.\n2. Whether this was indeed his initial election.\n\nThe claim states that \"Paul J. Kilday be first elect in Texas 20 district in 1938.\" This implies he should have been initially elected to the seat in that year.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows and columns:\n\n- **Row Index:** The row corresponding to Paul J. Kilday is row index 19 (as markdown tables are zero-indexed).\n- **Column Name:**\n  - **district:** We need to confirm this is \"texas 20\" for the respective row.\n  - **incumbent:** This should be \"paul j kilday.\"\n  - **first elected:** The value here needs to be checked if it matches \"1938.\"\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- In row index 19, under the column \"district,\" we find \"texas 20.\"\n- Under \"incumbent\" in the same row, we have \"paul j kilday.\"\n- Finally, under \"first elected,\" the value is indeed \"1938.\"\n\nAll conditions match perfectly with the claim. Therefore, Paul J. Kilday was first elected to Texas District 20 in 1938.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion are:\n\n1. Row index 19, Column name: \"district\"\n2. Row index 19, Column name: \"incumbent\"\n3.

Identify who is the incumbent for the Texas 12 district.\n2.

This corresponds to row index 11 in the table.\n- Check the \"incumbent\" column for this row. The incumbent listed here is \"wingate h lucas.\"\n- Verify if \"Paul J Kilday\" appears as an incumbent in any district, specifically checking his row (row index 19).\n\nFrom these observations:\n- In Texas 12, the incumbent is Wingate H. Lucas.\n- Paul J. Kilday is the incumbent for Texas 20, not Texas 12.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Paul J. Kilday is not the incumbent in the Texas 12 district.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n1. Row index 11, \"incumbent\" (which shows Wingate H. Lucas).\n2.
