    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table and focus on two specific columns: \"country\" and \"to par\". The claim states that there are 4 players from the United States with a \"to par\" score of -5.\n\n1. **Identify Players from the US**:\n   - We will first locate all rows where the \"country\" column is \"united states\".\n\n2. **Check the \"To Par\" Score**:\n   - For each player identified as being from the United States, check their \"to par\" score to see if it is \"- 5\".\n\n3. **Count Relevant Entries**:\n   - Count how many players meet both criteria: they are from the United States and have a \"to par\" score of -5.\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows in detail:\n\n- Row 2: Player \"justin leonard\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 7\". Not relevant.\n- Row 4: Player \"fred couples\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 5\". Relevant.\n- Row 6: Player \"jim furyk\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 3\". Not relevant.\n- Row 7: Player \"tom kite\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 3\". Not relevant.\n- Row 9: Player \"mark calcavecchia\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 1\". Not relevant.\n- Row 10: Player \"jay haas\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 1\". Not relevant.\n- Row 11: Player \"davis love iii\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 1\". Not relevant.\n- Row 12: Player \"tom watson\" is from \"united states\" with \"to par\" = \"- 1\". Not relevant.\n\nFrom the analysis above, only one player, \"fred couples\", meets both criteria of being from the United States and having a \"to par\" score of -5. \n\nThus, the claim that \"4 players from the US have a to par score of -5\" is false. The relevant cells for verification are in row 4 under columns \"country\" and \"to par\".\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
