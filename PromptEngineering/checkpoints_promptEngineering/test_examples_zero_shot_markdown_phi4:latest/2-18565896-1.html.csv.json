    "resp": "To verify the claim about Poland and Spain, we need to check two conditions for each country:\n\n1. They didn't win any gold medals.\n2. Each has a total of 2 silver and bronze medals combined.\n\nLet's examine the table for these countries:\n\n### Poland:\n- **Gold Medals:** The table shows that Poland won 0 gold medals.\n- **Silver Medals:** Poland won 2 silver medals.\n- **Bronze Medals:** Poland won 0 bronze medals.\n- **Total Silver and Bronze:** \\(2 + 0 = 2\\)\n\n### Spain:\n- **Gold Medals:** The table shows that Spain won 0 gold medals.\n- **Silver Medals:** Spain won 2 silver medals.\n- **Bronze Medals:** Spain won 3 bronze medals.\n- **Total Silver and Bronze:** \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n\nThe claim states that both Poland and Spain have a total of 2 silver and bronze medals each. However, while Poland meets this condition (total of 2), Spain does not (total of 5).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- **Poland:**\n  - Gold Medals: Row index 14, Column name \"gold\"\n  - Silver Medals: Row index 14, Column name \"silver\"\n  - Bronze Medals: Row index 14, Column name \"bronze\"\n  - Total Silver and Bronze: Calculated from the above\n\n- **Spain:**\n  - Gold Medals: Row index 13, Column name \"gold\"\n  - Silver Medals: Row index 13, Column name \"silver\"\n  - Bronze Medals: Row index 13, Column name \"bronze\"\n  - Total Silver and Bronze: Calculated from the above\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
