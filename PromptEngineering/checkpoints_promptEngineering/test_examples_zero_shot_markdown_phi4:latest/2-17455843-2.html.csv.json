    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gateshead and newport county have replay and win their game\" is true or false, we need to analyze relevant information from the table about both Gateshead and Newport County.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Gateshead:**\n   - Look for any matches involving Gateshead in the original results (row 14) and any replays.\n   - In row 14, Gateshead played against Tranmere Rovers on November 29, 1930, with a score of 4-4, leading to a replay.\n   - In row 14, the replay match took place on December 3, 1930. Here, Gateshead lost to Tranmere Rovers with a score of 3-2.\n\n2. **Newport County:**\n   - Look for any matches involving Newport County in the original results (row 30) and any replays.\n   - In row 30, Newport County played against Dulwich Hamlet on November 29, 1930, resulting in a 2-2 draw, leading to a replay.\n   - In row 30, the replay match took place on December 4, 1930. Here, Newport County won against Dulwich Hamlet with a score of 4-1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Gateshead** had a replay but lost their game (score: 3-2).\n- **Newport County** had a replay and won their game (score: 4-1).\n\nThe claim states that both Gateshead and Newport County have replays and win.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess if the match involving Lincoln City has the highest total number of goals scored in a single game among all listed matches for the 1930 - 31 FA Cup.\n\n### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Total Goals Scored per Game**: For each match (including replays), calculate the sum of both teams' scores.\n2. **Compare with Lincoln City's Match**:\n   - Locate the match involving Lincoln City in row index 8, where they played against Barrow on November 29, 1930.\n   - The score for this match is \"Lincoln City\" 8 - 3 \"Barrow\", giving a total of 11 goals.\n\n3. **Verify if Any Other Match Has More Goals**:\n   - Go through the scores in each row to identify any game with more than 11 total goals.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- **Row 1**: Chesterfield vs. Notts County, 1 - 2 = 3 goals\n- **Row 2**: Nelson vs. Workington, 4 - 0 = 4 goals\n- **Row 3**: Rochdale vs. Doncaster Rovers, 1 - 2 = 3 goals\n- **Row 4**: Walsall vs. Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, 1 - 0 = 1 goal\n- **Row 5**: Folkestone vs. Sittingbourne, 5 - 3 = 8 goals\n- **Row 6**: Gillingham vs. Guildford City, 7 - 2 = 9 goals\n- **Row 7**: Crewe Alexandra vs. Jarrow, 1 - 0 = 1 goal\n- **Row 8 (Lincoln City)**: Lincoln City vs. Barrow, 8 - 3 = 11 goals\n- **Row 9**: Luton Town vs. Clapton Orient, 2 - 2 = 4 goals\n- Replays and other rows also have fewer than or equal to 11 goals.\n\nUpon examining all the games listed in the table, no match surpasses Lincoln City's game with a total of 11 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince no other match has more than 11 goals, the claim that \"Lincoln city have the highest scoring game within the 1930 - 31 FA Cup\" is true.
