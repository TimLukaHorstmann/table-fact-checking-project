    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions mentioned in the claim against the table:\n\n1. **\"jabaquara lost 14 games\"**: We need to check the 'lost' column for the row corresponding to 'jabaquara'.\n2. **\"have 57 against\"**: We need to check the 'against' column for the same row.\n\nLet's identify the relevant rows and columns:\n\n- The table shows that 'jabaquara' is listed in the last row (row index 10, considering zero-based indexing).\n- For 'jabaquara', we check:\n  - Column 'lost': Value should be 14.\n  - Column 'against': Value should be 57.\n\nNow, let's verify these values:\n\n- In row index 10 for column 'lost', the value is indeed 14.\n- In row index 10 for column 'against', the value is indeed 57.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
