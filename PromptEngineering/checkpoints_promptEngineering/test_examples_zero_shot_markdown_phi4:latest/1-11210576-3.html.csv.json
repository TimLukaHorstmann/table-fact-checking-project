First, identify the relevant row in the table:\n   - We look for the actor named \"Christian de la Fuente.\"\n\n2. Locate Christian de la Fuente's data:\n   - The relevant row is for the character \"Sam Belmontes,\" played by Christian de la Fuente.\n\n3. Check the duration for this actor:\n   - According to the table, Sam Belmontes has a duration of \"02x03 - 03x05.\"\n\n4. Compare with the claim:\n   - The claimed duration is exactly \"02x03 - 03x05,\" matching what's listed in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"duration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
