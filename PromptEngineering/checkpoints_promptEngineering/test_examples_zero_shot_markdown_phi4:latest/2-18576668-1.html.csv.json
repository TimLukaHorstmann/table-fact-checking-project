Row 19: Pro Tour in Los Angeles (28-30 October 2005)\n\nNow, let's verify the claim regarding these four events:\n\n- The last four games listed for season 5 are indeed from rows 16 to 19.\n- We need to check their locations:\n  - Row 17 and 19 have \"Los Angeles\" as the location.\n  - Row 18 has \"London\" as the location.\n\nThus, three of the events occur in Los Angeles or London. However, the event in Seattle (Row 16) does not match either city specified in the claim.\n\nThe claim states that all four games were held in these cities, but one was not. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON response detailing this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 10 events in 2011\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table and identify the entries where the year matches 2011.\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"date,\" as it contains information about when each event took place. We will look at the \"date\" column across all rows and count how many events occurred in 2011.\n\nHere's a detailed step-by-step verification:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Year 2011:**\n   - Row 19 (index starts from 0): The date is \"5 - 6 march 2005,\" which is not in 2011.\n   - Row 20: The date is \"17 - 20 may 2005,\" which is not in 2011.\n   - Row 21: The date is \"8 - 10 july 2005,\" which is not in 2011.\n   - Row 22: The date is \"28 - 30 october 2005,\" which is not in 2011.\n   - Row 23: The date is \"10 - 12 june 2011.\" This matches the year 2011.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Events in 2011:**\n   - Only one event from the table occurred in 2011, as identified in row 23.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states there are 10 events in 2011, but we only found 1 event.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cell for this verification is the \"date\" column of row 23.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
