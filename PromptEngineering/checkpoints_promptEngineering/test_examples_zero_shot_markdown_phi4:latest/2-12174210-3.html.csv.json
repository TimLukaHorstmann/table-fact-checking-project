    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Kaharoa School is true or false, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Whether Kaharoa School is coeducational (\"coed\").\n2. Whether Kaharoa School has a decile rating of 9.\n\nLet's examine the row corresponding to Kaharoa School in the provided markdown table to check these conditions:\n\n- **Name**: The name \"kaharoa school\" matches, so we locate this row.\n  \n  | name              | years   | gender   | area             | authority        | decile |\n  |:------------------|:--------|:---------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-------|\n  | kaharoa school    | 1 - 8   | coed     | rotorua district | state            | 9      |\n\nFrom the table, we see:\n\n- The \"gender\" column for Kaharoa School is listed as \"coed\", confirming it is indeed a coeducational school.\n- The \"decile\" column for Kaharoa School shows a value of 9.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data in this row. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells that support our determination:\n\n1. **Row Index**: For Kaharoa School, we need to find its position in the table. Starting from index 0 for \"aorangi school\", counting through each subsequent school, we find:\n   - Row 0: aorangi school\n   - ...\n   - Row 7: kaharoa school\n\n2. **Column Names**: The relevant columns are \"gender\" and \"decile\".\n\nSo the JSON object with our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gender\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"decile\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The range of years it covers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify the Row:**\n   - Locate \"lynmore primary school\" in the \"name\" column, which is at `row_index` 13.\n\n2. **Check Gender Type (Coed or Not):**\n   - Look at the \"gender\" column for this row.\n   - Relevant cell: \n     - `row_index`: 13\n     - `column_name`: \"gender\"\n   - The value in this cell is \"coed,\" which supports part of the claim.\n\n3. **Check Year Range:**\n   - Examine the \"years\" column for this row.\n   - Relevant cell:\n     - `row_index`: 13\n     - `column_name`: \"years\"\n   - The value here is \"1 - 6.\" According to the claim, it should be \"1 - 8.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe school does accept coed students, but it only covers years 1-6, not 1-8 as claimed.
