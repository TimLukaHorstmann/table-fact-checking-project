However, according to the table:\n\n- The college with the nickname \"blue hose\" is Presbyterian College.\n- It joined in 1965 and left in 1972 (not joined in 1972).\n- Its current conference is Big South, not SAC.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this claim, we need to examine the following cells:\n\n1.
