Check if Kennedy received 1132 votes in that same row.\n\nLet's examine each condition step-by-step using the data provided in the markdown table:\n\n### Step 1: Find Coakley with 66.2% of Votes\n- We look through the \"coakley %\" column to find a value of 66.2%. According to the table, this occurs in the row corresponding to \"suffolk\" where the \"coakley %\" is indeed listed as 66.2%.\n\n### Step 2: Check Kennedy's Votes in the Same Row\n- Now that we have identified the relevant row (Suffolk), we check the \"kennedy votes\" column for this row.\n- In the \"suffolk\" row, \"kennedy votes\" is listed as 1807.\n\n### Verification of Conditions:\n- The condition \"Kennedy win 1132 vote when Coakley win 66.2% of vote\" implies that Kennedy should have exactly 1132 votes in the same row where Coakley wins 66.2%.\n- In the identified row, while Coakley does indeed win 66.2%, Kennedy receives 1807 votes instead of 1132.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The first condition is met (Coakley wins 66.2% in Suffolk).\n- The second condition is not met (Kennedy receives 1807 votes, not 1132).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
