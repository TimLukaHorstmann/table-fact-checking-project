Each set for these 32 class 254 units should have 10 cars.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- For class 254, there are two entries:\n  - First entry: \"br eastern region br scottish region\" with a number of 32 and cars per set as 10.\n  - Second entry: \"br eastern region br scottish region\" with a number of 4 and cars per set as 10.\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n1. **Total Number of Class 254 Units**:\n   - The first entry contributes 32 units (253001 - 253032).\n   - The second entry contributes 4 units (253033 - 253037).\n   - Total = 32 + 4 = 36 units.\n\n2. **Cars per Set for the First 32 Units**:\n   - According to the first entry, there are 10 cars per set for these 32 units.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"32 class 254's,\" which refers to the first entry where there are indeed 32 units with 10 cars per set.
