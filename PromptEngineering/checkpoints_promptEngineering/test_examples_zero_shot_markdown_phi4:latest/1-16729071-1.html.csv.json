The relevant pieces of information required from this row include the 'date', 'opponent', and 'result'.\n\n1. **Row Index Identification**:  \n   - The claim pertains to a game on November 4, so we need to locate the row in the table with that date.\n   - Checking each row sequentially:\n     - Row 10 has \"November 4\" as its date.\n\n2. **Relevant Columns**:\n   - We focus on two columns: 'date' and 'result'.\n   - **Date**: This confirms which game is being referred to in the claim.\n   - **Result**: This specifies the outcome of the game, which we need to compare against the claim.\n\n3. **Verification Against Claim**:\n   - The cell under 'date' for row 10 contains \"November 4\", confirming it's the correct game.\n   - The cell under 'result' for row 10 shows \"w 10 - 3\".\n\nThe claim states that \"the November 4 game end with w 10 - 3\". Upon checking, both parts of this statement match what is recorded in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data, and we can conclude it to be TRUE.

We locate this in the table by finding the row where \"week\" is 15.\n\n2. **Game Site Verification**:\n   - According to the claim, the game site should be the \"Kingdome.\" We need to check the \"game site\" column for Week 15 to confirm it matches this location.\n\n3. **Attendance Verification**:\n   - The claim specifies an attendance figure of 60038. We must verify that the \"attendance\" value in the row corresponding to Week 15 is indeed 60038.\n\nUpon checking:\n\n- For Week 15, the table shows:\n  - Game site: \"kingdome\"\n  - Attendance: 60038\n\nAll conditions from the claim are satisfied by the data provided in the table.
