    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine specific details from the table:\n\n1. **Check if Gil Morgan represents the United States**: \n   - We look at the \"country\" column for Gil Morgan's row.\n   \n2. **Check if Gil Morgan ties for 7th place**:\n   - We verify that Gil Morgan is listed with a placement of \"t7\".\n   \n3. **Check the score to par for Gil Morgan**:\n   - We confirm that his \"to par\" value is \"-2\".\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- For Gil Morgan, we find him in row 11.\n  - The \"country\" column at row index 10 (since markdown tables are typically 0-indexed) shows \"united states\".\n  - The \"place\" column at row index 10 shows \"t7\".\n  - The \"to par\" column at row index 10 shows \"-2\".\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
