Calculating the number of days inclusive:\n    - October 8\n    - October 9\n    - (October 10 is not included)\n    - October 11\n    - October 12\n    - (October 13 is not included)\n    - October 14\n\n    This gives us a total span of 7 unique days, including the start and end dates.\n\n- The claim states it took place over \"6 days\". However, from our analysis, it spans 7 days. Therefore, this part of the claim does not align with the table data.\n\n- The claim also specifies \"October 1929\", which is consistent with all listed dates in the table (October 8 to October 14).\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The series spans 7 days rather than 6 as claimed.\n- All games took place in October 1929, which matches part of the claim.\n\nThus, because the number of days specified in the claim is incorrect, we determine that the claim is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are all the rows with the \"date\" column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We'll examine the attendance figures for each game held at these locations:\n\n1. **Wrigley Field**:\n   - Game 1 (October 8): Attendance = 50,740\n   - Game 2 (October 9): Attendance = 49,987\n\n2. **Shibe Park**:\n   - Game 3 (October 11): Attendance = 29,921\n   - Game 4 (October 12): Attendance = 29,921\n   - Game 5 (October 14): Attendance = 29,921\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that the attendance figures for games at Wrigley Field are different from those at Shibe Park.
