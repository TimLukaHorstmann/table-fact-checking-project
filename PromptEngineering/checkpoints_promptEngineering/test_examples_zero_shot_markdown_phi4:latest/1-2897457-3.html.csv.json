The claim suggests checking for players listed with more than one playing position, and specifically identifying if John Brill is the sole such player.\n\nWe can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Players with Multiple Positions**: Look through each row to see which players have multiple positions listed in the `position` column.\n2. **Verify Uniqueness**: Ensure that only John Brill has more than one position and no other player does.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant cell in the `position` column:\n\n- Row 8: \"John Brill\" is listed with \"left / right wing,\" indicating two positions.\n- No other row in the table shows a similar format of multiple positions for any other player. Each other player has only one position specified.\n\nSince John Brill is indeed the only player with more than one position, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cell corresponds to John Brill's entry in row index 8 (considering zero-based indexing), which lists his position as \"left / right wing.\"",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding the gender of players selected from draft picks 43 to 63 in 1989, we need to analyze the data provided in the table specifically related to these picks.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- **Claim**: \"100% of the player draft 43 - 63 in 1989 be male.\"\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n1. Identify all players from pick numbers 43 through 63.\n2. Evaluate the gender information based on typical naming conventions and historical context where applicable, as there is no explicit column indicating gender.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- **General Knowledge**: Historically and statistically speaking, nearly every professional NHL player has been male, especially during the era of 1989, when there were very few or no female players in the league.\n  \n- **Player Names**: All listed names from picks 43 to 63 are traditionally masculine based on common naming conventions.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for verification would be the entire rows from pick number 43 to 63 since we need to verify each player's information (although, strictly speaking, only their names and perhaps historical context are used to infer gender).\n\n- Row indices range from 0 to 20 (inclusive) corresponding to draft picks 43 to 63.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the typical naming conventions and the historical context of NHL drafts in 1989, all players listed from pick numbers 43 through 63 can be inferred as male.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"Blair Atcheynum be the first centre to be drafted 43-63,\" we need to verify two conditions:\n1. Blair Atcheynum must have been selected in the range from pick 43 to 63.\n2. He must be a center, and no other center should have been drafted before him within that same range.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Blair Atcheynum:**\n  - Row Index: 11\n  - Pick: 52\n  - Position: Right Wing\n\nFrom this information, Blair Atcheynum is not a center; he is listed as playing right wing. Therefore, he cannot be considered when checking for the first center drafted in picks 43-63.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any centers drafted before pick 52:\n\n1. **Stephane Morin:**\n   - Row Index: 0\n   - Pick: 43\n   - Position: Center\n\n2. **Rob Zamuner:**\n   - Row Index: 2\n   - Pick: 45\n   - Position: Left Wing\n\n3. **Jason Cirone:**\n   - Row Index: 3\n   - Pick: 46\n   - Position: Centre (not capitalized correctly in the table, but still center)\n\n4. **Scott Pellerin:**\n   - Row Index: 4\n   - Pick: 47\n   - Position: Left Wing\n\n5. **Wes Walz:**\n   - Row Index: 15\n   - Pick: 57\n   - Position: Centre\n\n6. **Murray Garbutt:**\n   - Row Index: 19\n   - Position: Centre\n\nFrom this list, we see that Stephane Morin was drafted at pick 43 as a center. Therefore, he is the first center to be selected in the range from picks 43-63.\n\nSince Blair Atcheynum is neither a center nor the first in the specified draft range, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Blair Atcheynum's row: Row Index 11 (pick number and position)\n- All centers within the range of pick numbers 43 to 63\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
