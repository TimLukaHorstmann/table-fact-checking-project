    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess the condition specified in the claim: \"only 4 drivers completed all 72 laps of the race at the 1998 Brazilian Grand Prix.\"\n\nWe will examine each relevant column from the table for this task:\n\n1. **Driver Column**: This contains the names of the drivers.\n2. **Laps Column**: This indicates the number of laps completed by each driver.\n3. **Time / Retired Column**: This shows either the completion time or reason for retirement, which can help verify if a driver retired before completing all laps.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions that 4 drivers completed all 72 laps. Therefore, we need to focus on rows where the \"laps\" value is 72 and see how many such entries exist. Additionally, any entry with \"Time / Retired\" indicating completion of 72 laps supports this condition.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: Mika H\u00e4kkinen | Laps: 72\n- **Row 1**: David Coulthard | Laps: 72\n- **Row 2**: Michael Schumacher | Laps: 72\n- **Row 3**: Alexander Wurz | Laps: 72\n\nThese four drivers have completed 72 laps, as shown by the \"laps\" column. Their \"Time / Retired\" also confirms they finished (with actual time or relative to another driver). No other rows show a lap count of 72.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that exactly 4 drivers completed all 72 laps:\n\n- Mika H\u00e4kkinen\n- David Coulthard\n- Michael Schumacher\n- Alexander Wurz\n\nThis supports the claim \"only 4 drivers complete all 72 laps.\"\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE.
