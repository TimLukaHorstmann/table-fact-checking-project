    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the opponent for April 14 be the new jersey devil\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in the table provided.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to:\n- The date: April 14\n- The opponent on that date\n\nLet's identify and check these conditions against the table:\n\n1. **Date Condition**: We need to find the row where the date is \"april 14\". This corresponds to Row Index 3 in the table.\n2. **Opponent Condition**: For the identified row (Row Index 3), we must verify that the opponent listed is \"new jersey devils\".\n\nNow, let's examine these details from the table:\n\n- In Row Index 3:\n  - The date column shows \"april 14\".\n  - The opponent column shows \"new jersey devils\".\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are met by the data in Row Index 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the information provided in the table. The relevant cells that confirm this are from Row Index 3 for both the date and opponent columns.\n\nThe JSON object with the answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
