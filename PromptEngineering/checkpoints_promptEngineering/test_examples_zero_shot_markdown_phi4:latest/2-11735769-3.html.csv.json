    "resp": "To verify the claim about Jerry Traino's nominations and wins in the awards for the years 2010 and 2011 based on the provided table, we need to examine specific cells of the table related to these criteria.\n\nThe claim states:\n\"Jerry Traino was nominated for 2 awards in 2010 and won both awards in 2011.\"\n\nWe will verify this by checking each year separately:\n\n### For the Year 2010:\n- The table lists two entries for 2010:\n  - **Row 2**: \n    - `year`: 2010\n    - `work`: iCarly\n    - `result`: nominated (for Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Big Kid Award)\n    \n  - **Row 3**:\n    - `year`: 2010\n    - `work`: iCarly\n    - `result`: won (for Australian Kids' Choice Awards, LOL Award)\n\nFrom these entries, we see that Jerry Traino was nominated once and won once in the year 2010. Therefore, he was not nominated for two awards as claimed.\n\n### For the Year 2011:\n- The table lists two entries for 2011:\n  - **Row 4**:\n    - `year`: 2011\n    - `work`: iCarly\n    - `result`: won (for UK Kids' Choice Awards, Nick UK's Funniest Person)\n    \n  - **Row 5**:\n    - `year`: 2011\n    - `work`: iCarly\n    - `result`: nominated (for Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brasil, Funniest Character)\n\nFrom these entries, we see that Jerry Traino won once and was nominated once in the year 2011. Therefore, he did not win both awards as claimed.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither part of the claim is fully supported by the table data. Hence, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells that were checked are:\n\n- For Year 2010:\n  - Row 2: year, work, result\n  - Row 3: year, work, result\n\n- For Year 2011:\n  - Row 4: year, work, result\n  - Row 5: year, work, result\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Jerry Traino (also known as iCarly's character Spencer), we need to verify two specific parts of the claim using the table provided:\n\n1. \"Win a total of 4 awards\":\n   - We will count the number of times \"won\" is listed in the \"result\" column for entries related to iCarly or Tuff Puppy, as Jerry Traino is primarily known from these shows.\n\n2. Specific categories:\n   - Check if he won 2 times for the \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\".\n   - Check if he won 2 times for \"nick uk 's funniest person\".\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row of the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Year: 2009\n  - Award: Teen Choice Awards\n  - Category: Choice TV Actor: Comedy\n  - Work: iCarly\n  - Result: Nominated\n\n  This does not count as a win.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Year: 2010\n  - Award: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards\n  - Category: Big Kid Award\n  - Work: iCarly\n  - Result: Nominated\n  \n  This does not count as a win.\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Year: 2010\n  - Award: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards\n  - Category: LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\n  - Work: iCarly\n  - Result: Won\n\n  This counts as one \"won\" under the category \"lol award\".\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Year: 2011\n  - Award: 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards\n  - Category: Nick UK's Funniest Person\n  - Work: iCarly\n  - Result: Won\n\n  This counts as one \"won\" under the category \"nick uk 's funniest person\".\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Year: 2011\n  - Award: Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brasil\n  - Category: Funniest Character\n  - Work: iCarly\n  - Result: Nominated\n\n  This does not count as a win.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Year: 2012\n  - Award: 2012 Kids' Choice Awards\n  - Category: Favorite TV Sidekick\n  - Work: iCarly\n  - Result: Nominated\n\n  This does not count as a win.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Award: 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards\n  - Category: Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program\n  - Work: Tuff Puppy\n  - Result: Nominated\n\n  Although this involves \"Tuff Puppy\", it is still a nomination, not a win.\n\n**Summary of Wins**:\n- 1 win for LOL Award (shared with ensemble) from Row 2.\n- 1 win for Nick UK's Funniest Person from Row 3.\n\nTotal wins counted: 2.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Jerry Trainor being nominated for the 2008 Australian Kids' Choice Award in two different categories, we need to analyze the provided table and verify each component of the claim:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim mentions \"in 2008.\" We should check if there are any entries related to the year 2008 in the table.\n\n2. **Person**: The claim states that Jerry Trainor was nominated. The table, however, does not list individuals but rather works (e.g., iCarly, Tuff Puppy).\n\n3. **Award Name**: It specifies the \"2008 Australian Kids' Choice Award.\" We should verify if this award is mentioned in any row of the table for the year 2008.\n\n4. **Nominations and Categories**: The claim mentions two different categories. We need to check if there are two entries with nominations under this specific award.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- **Year Column**: There is no entry for the year 2008 in the table.\n- **Award Name**: The closest match is \"2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards,\" but it does not relate to 2008.\n- **Results and Categories**: Even if we consider the award mentioned, there are only two entries for the 2010 awards (both related to iCarly), and neither relates to Jerry Trainor directly or mentions two different categories in 2008.\n\nGiven these observations, none of the table's rows support the claim about 2008, the Australian Kids' Choice Award, or any nominations involving Jerry Trainor.
