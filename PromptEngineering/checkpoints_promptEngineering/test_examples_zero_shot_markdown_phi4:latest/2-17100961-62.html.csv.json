All picks listed are 17, 21, and 20.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no player with a pick number of 2 in the table, it follows that there cannot be a player with such a pick who also has a position of \"db\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - No cells are relevant because no row satisfies the condition of having `pick` equal to 2.\n\nThe JSON response reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
