    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following conditions from the table:\n\n1. The date must be February 24.\n2. The visitor on this date must be \"ny rangers\".\n\nLet's examine these conditions against the relevant row in the table.\n\n- **Row Index**: We look for the row where the `date` is \"february 24\".\n- **Date Verification**: In the table, the row with \"february 24\" as the date corresponds to Row Index 9.\n- **Visitor Verification**: In this row, the `visitor` column should contain \"ny rangers\".\n\nNow, let's check these conditions:\n\n- At Row Index 9, the `date` is indeed \"february 24\".\n- The `visitor` for this row is \"ny rangers\", which matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is true. Here are the relevant cells that support this conclusion:\n\n1. The cell at Row Index 9 in the `date` column (\"february 24\").\n2. The cell at Row Index 9 in the `visitor` column (\"ny rangers\").\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
