    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"more than 33 medals were given during the 1952 Summer Olympics for the swimming event\" is true based on the provided table, we need to examine the total number of medals awarded across all nations listed.\n\nThe relevant data in this context are the numbers in the \"total\" column of each row because they represent the sum of gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each nation. The claim concerns the overall count of medals awarded in swimming events at the 1952 Olympics.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how we verify the claim:\n\n1. **Extract Total Medals**: Sum up all the values in the \"total\" column from the table to find out the total number of medals awarded.\n   \n   - USA: 9 medals\n   - Hungary: 7 medals\n   - France: 3 medals\n   - Australia: 1 medal\n   - South Africa: 1 medal\n   - Japan: 3 medals\n   - Netherlands: 3 medals\n   - Sweden: 2 medals\n   - Brazil: 1 medal\n   - Great Britain: 1 medal\n   - New Zealand: 1 medal\n   - Germany: 1 medal\n\n2. **Calculate Total Medals Awarded**: Add up all these values:\n   \\[\n   9 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33\n   \\]\n\nThe total number of medals is exactly 33. The claim states \"more than 33 medals,\" so we need more than this amount for the claim to be true.\n\nSince the calculated total is exactly 33, not more than 33, the claim is false.\n\nNext, identify the relevant cells in the table used for verification:\n\n- All rows have been considered under the \"total\" column because it summarizes all medals (gold, silver, and bronze) awarded to each nation.\n\nThe JSON response should include these findings as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
