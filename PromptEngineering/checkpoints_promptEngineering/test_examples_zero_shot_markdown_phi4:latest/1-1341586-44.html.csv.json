Identify the row corresponding to the district with Albert Bustamante:\n   - Look at each row in the table and find where \"Albert Bustamante\" is listed under the \"incumbent\" column.\n   - This corresponds to row index 22 (starting from 0).\n\n2. Examine the \"candidates\" column for this specific row:\n   - Row index 22, column \"candidates\", states: \"albert bustamante (d) 90.7% ken hendrix ( l ) 9.3%\"\n   - This indicates that Albert Bustamante was re-elected with Ken Hendrix as the opposing candidate.\n\n3. Verify if there are other candidates mentioned for this district:\n   - The format of the \"candidates\" column suggests that only one opponent, Ken Hendrix, is listed along with his vote percentage.\n   - There are no additional names or parties besides Albert Bustamante and Ken Hendrix in this entry.\n\n4. Conclusion based on verification:\n   - Since there is only one other candidate, Ken Hendrix, mentioned for district 23 where Albert Bustamante was re-elected, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response indicates that the claim is true and identifies the relevant cells used to verify this conclusion.",
