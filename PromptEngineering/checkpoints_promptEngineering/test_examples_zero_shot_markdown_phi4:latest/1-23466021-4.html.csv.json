    "resp": "To verify the claim against the table data, we need to check each part of the statement:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim states \"on August 1\". We look for a row where `week` is 4 (as it corresponds to August 1) and confirm this date.\n\n2. **Opponent**: The claim mentions \"the lion\" as the opponent. We need to find if the `opponent` in the specified week is \"lions\".\n\n3. **Location**: The claim states that the game was played at \"ivor wynne stadium\". We check if the `location` for the specified week matches this.\n\n4. **Final Score**: The claim specifies a score of \"41 - 52 in over time\" with the Lions winning, implying a loss for our team. We verify if the `final score` is indeed \"l 52 - 41 (ot)\".\n\n5. **Record**: The claim mentions the record changing to \"3 - 3\". We check if after this game, the `record` is updated to \"3 - 1\" as per the table.\n\nLet's verify these against the table:\n\n- **Week 4**:\n  - Date: August 1 (matches)\n  - Opponent: Lions (matches)\n  - Location: BC Place Stadium (does not match \"ivor wynne stadium\")\n  - Final Score: L 52 - 41 (OT) (matches the score but indicates a loss for our team, not Lions)\n  - Record: 3 - 1 (not 3 - 3)\n\nThe claim is false because:\n- The location does not match.\n- The record after the game is 3 - 1, not 3 - 3.\n\nHere is the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
