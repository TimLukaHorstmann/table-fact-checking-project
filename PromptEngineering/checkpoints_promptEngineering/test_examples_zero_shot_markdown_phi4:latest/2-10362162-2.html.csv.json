The attendance number given (67,329) is indeed for the November 14, 1993 game.\n2. There are no other games in the table with a lower attendance than 67,329.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Verify Attendance on November 14, 1993:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to week 11, which has the date \"November 14, 1993.\"\n   - Check the attendance for this game.\n   - The table shows that the attendance is indeed 67,329.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Games' Attendance:**\n   - We must inspect every other game's attendance in the table to ensure there is no lower figure than 67,329.\n   - Here are the attendances from each row:\n     - Week 1: 44,120\n     - Week 2: 57,921\n     - Week 4: 61,746\n     - Week 5: 63,071\n     - Week 6: 54,215\n     - Week 8: 64,677\n     - Week 9: 53,428\n     - Week 10: 55,527\n     - Week 12: 40,848\n     - Week 13: 53,030\n     - Week 14: 63,216\n     - Week 15: 63,321\n     - Week 16: 54,773\n     - Week 17: 59,236\n     - Week 18: 42,836\n\n   - Clearly, there are several games with attendance figures lower than 67,329.\n\nFrom this comparison, it's evident that the game on November 14, 1993 does not have the lowest attendance; several other games have lower attendances.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each game in which the Minnesota Vikings played based on the provided table data. The claim states: \"there be no week in which the minnesota vikings hold their opponent to more than zero point.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure**:\n   - Each row corresponds to a specific game.\n   - Relevant columns for this analysis are:\n     - `opponent`: To ensure the team playing against is relevant (Minnesota Vikings).\n     - `result`: To check if the opposing team scored 0 points.\n\n2. **Verification Process**:\n   - We will go through each row and verify that in all instances where Minnesota Vikings played, their opponent did not score more than zero points.\n   \n3. **Analysis of Each Relevant Game**:\n   - **Week 1**: Opponent is Los Angeles Raiders; result is L 24-7 (Raiders scored 24).\n   - **Week 2**: Opponent is Chicago Bears; result is W 10-7 (Bears scored 7).\n   - **Week 4**: Opponent is Green Bay Packers; result is W 15-13 (Packers scored 13).\n   - **Week 5**: Opponent is San Francisco 49ers; result is L 38-19 (49ers scored 38).\n   - **Week 6**: Opponent is Tampa Bay Buccaneers; result is W 15-0 (Buccaneers scored 0). This satisfies the condition.\n   - **Week 8**: Opponent is Chicago Bears; result is W 19-12 (Bears scored 12).\n   - **Week 9**: Opponent is Detroit Lions; result is L 30-27 (Lions scored 30).\n   - **Week 10**: Opponent is San Diego Chargers; result is L 30-17 (Chargers scored 30).\n   - **Week 11**: Opponent is Denver Broncos; result is W 26-23 (Broncos scored 23).\n   - **Week 12**: Opponent is Tampa Bay Buccaneers; result is L 23-10 (Buccaneers scored 23).\n   - **Week 13**: Opponent is New Orleans Saints; result is L 17-14 (Saints scored 14).\n   - **Week 14**: Opponent is Detroit Lions; result is W 13-0 (Lions scored 0). This satisfies the condition.\n   - **Week 15**: Opponent is Dallas Cowboys; result is L 37-20 (Cowboys scored 37).\n   - **Week 16**: Opponent is Green Bay Packers (Milw); result is W 21-17 (Packers scored 17).\n   - **Week 17**: Opponent is Kansas City Chiefs; result is W 30-10 (Chiefs scored 10).\n   - **Week 18**: Opponent is Washington Redskins; result is W 14-9 (Redskins scored 9).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states \"no week in which the minnesota vikings hold their opponent to more than zero point.\" \n   - Weeks 6 and 14 meet this criterion, but for all other weeks, opponents scored points greater than zero.\n   - Thus, the claim is false because there are multiple instances where the Vikings' opponents scored more than zero.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - All rows (1 to 18) are relevant as they all involve games played by the Minnesota Vikings, and we need to verify the opponent's score in each game.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
