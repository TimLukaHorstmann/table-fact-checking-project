Matches Involving Yugoslavia and Italy:**\n- We will look at the \"opponent\" column to find any entries with \"italy\".\n- According to the table, there is one entry:\n  - Date: November 15\n  - City: Torino, Italy\n  - Opponent: Italy\n  - Result: 0:2\n  - Type of Game: 1982 WCQ (World Cup Qualifier)\n\nThis indicates that Yugoslavia lost to Italy with a score of 0:2 in this specific match.\n\n**2. Matches Involving Yugoslavia and Romania:**\n- We will check the \"opponent\" column for entries with \"romania\".\n- According to the table, there are two relevant entries:\n  - Date: March 30\n    - City: Belgrade\n    - Opponent: Romania\n    - Result: 2:0\n    - Type of Game: Balkan Cup\n  - Date: August 27\n    - City: Bucharest, Romania\n    - Opponent: Romania\n    - Result: 1:4\n    - Type of Game: Balkan Cup\n\nTo find the aggregate score:\n- First Match (Yugoslavia vs. Romania): 2:0 in favor of Yugoslavia.\n- Second Match (Romania vs. Yugoslavia): 4:1 in favor of Romania.\n\nAggregate Score Calculation:\n- Total goals by Yugoslavia against Romania: 2 + 1 = 3\n- Total goals by Romania against Yugoslavia: 0 + 4 = 4\n\nThe aggregate score is indeed 3:4 in favor of Romania.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim states that \"the yugoslavian national team lose the italy against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4.\" \n\n- The part about losing to Italy (0:2) is true based on the table.\n- The aggregate score against Romania being 3:4 is also true.\n\nHowever, the claim incorrectly links these two separate events. The statement implies that the loss to Italy is somehow connected with the aggregate score against Romania, which it is not. Therefore, while each individual component of the claim is accurate when considered separately, the way they are combined in the claim is misleading and incorrect.\n\nThus, the claim as a whole is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we must carefully analyze each part:\n\n1. **\"The Yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time\":** \n   - We need to identify all games where the \"results\" column shows that Yugoslavia did not score any goals (i.e., a result where the first number is 0).\n   - From the table:\n     - March 22: Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n     - March 30: Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n     - April 26: Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n     - August 27: Yugoslavia scored 1 goal.\n     - September 10: Yugoslavia scored 5 goals.\n     - September 27: Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n     - November 15: Yugoslavia scored 0 goals.\n\n   Only in the match on November 15 against Italy did they fail to score.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Yugoslavian national team is true or false, we need to focus on the relevant part of the table concerning the 1982 World Cup Qualifiers (WCQ).\n\nThe claim states: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goals and allow 3 against in the two 1982 world cup qualify score.\"\n\nLet's break down what needs to be verified:\n1. Identify games labeled as \"1982 wcq\" from the table.\n2. Count the total number of goals scored by Yugoslavia in these games.\n3. Count the total number of goals conceded (allowed) by Yugoslavia in these games.\n\n**Step 1: Identify relevant rows**\n\nFrom the table, we identify the following entries as 1982 WCQ games:\n\n- September 10: against Luxembourg, result 5:0\n- September 27: against Denmark, result 2:1\n- November 15: against Italy, result 0:2\n\nThese correspond to row indices 4, 5, and 6.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate goals scored**\n\nFor these games:\n- Against Luxembourg: Yugoslavia scored 5 goals.\n- Against Denmark: Yugoslavia scored 2 goals.\n- Against Italy: Yugoslavia scored 0 goals.\n\nTotal goals scored = 5 + 2 + 0 = 7\n\n**Step 3: Calculate goals allowed**\n\nFor these games:\n- Against Luxembourg: Yugoslavia allowed 0 goals.\n- Against Denmark: Yugoslavia allowed 1 goal.\n- Against Italy: Yugoslavia allowed 2 goals.\n\nTotal goals allowed = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe claim states that the team scored 7 goals and allowed 3, which matches our calculations.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.
