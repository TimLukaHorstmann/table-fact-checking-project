    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro be the branding for the call sign dxyr,\" we need to verify if these two conditions match in the table:\n\n1. The branding \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\" corresponds to the row where the callsign is \"dxyr.\"\n2. In that same row, both the frequency and location should also match as additional verification.\n\nWe'll break down the steps:\n\n- **Check for Callsign:** Locate the row where the callsign column has the value \"dxyr.\" This will directly verify if the branding matches.\n- **Verify Branding:** Ensure the branding in that same row is \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\"\n- **Cross-verify Frequency and Location:** Confirm that the frequency is \"104.7 mhz\" and location is \"cagayan de oro,\" providing additional assurance.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n1. Row 0: Callsign \"dwys\" does not match.\n2. Row 1: Callsign \"dzvm\" does not match.\n3. Row 2: Callsign \"dyyr\" does not match.\n4. Row 3: Callsign \"dyyd\" does not match.\n5. **Row 4:** Callsign is \"dxyr,\" which matches the condition we are checking.\n\n   - In Row 4, check:\n     - Branding is indeed \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\"\n     - Frequency is \"104.7 mhz.\"\n     - Location is \"cagayan de oro.\"\n\nSince all conditions for row 4 match perfectly with the claim, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 4:\n  - Column \"branding\": \"yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro\"\n  - Column \"callsign\": \"dxyr\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"callsign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim specifically mentions a frequency, so we should focus on the `frequency` column to verify if \"yes! fm\" broadcasts at 101.1 MHz.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - Look through each row in the table under the `branding` and `frequency` columns.\n   - We need to find a row where the `branding` includes \"yes! fm\" and the `frequency` is 101.1 MHz.\n\n2. **Check Each Row:**\n\n   - **Row 0:**\n     - Branding: \"yes! fm 101.1\"\n     - Frequency: \"101.1 mhz\"\n     - This row matches both conditions: it includes \"yes! fm\" in the branding and has a frequency of 101.1 MHz.\n\n   - Other rows do not need to be checked further for this claim since we have already found a match.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 0, where \"yes! fm 101.1\" broadcasts at 101.1 MHz.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row Index:** 0\n- **Column Names:** `branding` and `frequency`\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"branding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
