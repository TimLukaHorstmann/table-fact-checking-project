The date of birth.\n\nThe claim states: \"Danny Cipriani, born November 2, 1987, be a fly half.\"\n\nFrom examining the table:\n- We need to find the row corresponding to \"danny cipriani.\"\n- Verify if the \"position\" column for this player is \"fly - half.\"\n- Check the \"date of birth (age)\" column to ensure it matches \"2 november 1987.\"\n\nUpon inspection, we see that:\n- The row with \"danny cipriani\" shows a position of \"fly - half,\" which matches the claim.\n- The date of birth listed is \"2 november 1987,\" also matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, the table supports both conditions of the claim. \n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 31, column \"player\": Contains \"danny cipriani.\"\n- Row index 31, column \"position\": Contains \"fly - half.\"\n- Row index 31, column \"date of birth (age)\": Contains \"2 november 1987.\"\n\nThese confirm the claim is fully supported by the table.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"date of birth (age)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of the statement:\n\n1. **Steve Borthwick's Position**: The claim states that Steve Borthwick is a prop. In the table, Steve Borthwick is listed as playing in the position \"lock.\" Therefore, this immediately makes the claim incorrect since he is not a prop.\n\n2. **Association with Leicester**: Even if we were to check further for association with Leicester and his status as a notable player at that club, the first condition already invalidates the claim.\n\n3. **Relevance of Other Players in Position**:\n   - If Steve Borthwick had been listed as a prop, we would need to compare him with other players listed under \"prop\" to determine if he could be considered Leicester's best-known player in that position. However, this comparison is irrelevant because Borthwick is not a prop.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the claim fails at the first point of verification since Steve Borthwick is not listed as a prop. Therefore, the claim is false. The relevant cells to verify are those pertaining to Steve Borthwick's position and club association.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"club / province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Danny Cipriani and his association with a club or province, we must carefully examine the table entries:\n\n1. The claim mentions \"the player bear 2 november 1987,\" which refers to Danny Cipriani as per the date of birth provided in the table.\n   \n2. Next, it states that the position is \"fly - half.\" Checking the row corresponding to Danny Cipriani (row index 38), we see that his position is indeed listed as \"fly - half.\"\n\n3. The claim further specifies that this should be \"the only one for a sale player,\" suggesting that there should not be any other players associated with Sale who play as fly-half.\n\n4. We must check all the rows in the table to ensure no other player from Sale holds the position of fly-half:\n   - Row 6: Andrew Sheridan, Position: prop, Club/Province: Sale\n   - Row 27: Charlie Hodgson, Position: fly-half, Club/Province: Sale\n\nFrom this examination, we see that Charlie Hodgson is also listed as a \"fly-half\" and associated with Sale. Therefore, Danny Cipriani is not the only player from Sale who plays in this position.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 38 (Danny Cipriani), Column: date of birth\n- Row index 38, Column: position\n- Row index 27 (Charlie Hodgson), Column: position and club/province\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"date of birth (age)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"club / province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
