    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"when manu gin\u00f3bili (44) be the leading scorer and the visitor be the maverick , the date be february 28 , 2008,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Leading Scorer**: The player named Manu Gin\u00f3bili with a score of 44.\n2. **Visitor**: The team \"Mavericks.\"\n3. **Date Check**: Whether this corresponds to February 28, 2008.\n\nLet's check each condition against the table entries:\n\n- Look for rows where the leading scorer is \"Manu gin\u00f3bili (44)\":\n  - This occurs on February 21, 2008 (\"spurs\" vs. \"timberwolves\"), not matching the visitor or date in the claim.\n  \n- Check if there's an entry with the visitor as \"Mavericks\":\n  - On February 28, 2008, the visitor is indeed \"mavericks.\" \n\nNow, confirm if both conditions match for any row:\n\n1. On **February 21, 2008**, Manu Gin\u00f3bili scores 44 points and the Spurs are visitors against the Timberwolves.\n2. On **February 28, 2008**, Mavericks are the visitor, but Tim Duncan is the leading scorer with 31 points.\n\nSince there's no row where both conditions (Manu Gin\u00f3bili as the leading scorer scoring 44 and the visitor being \"Mavericks\") occur simultaneously, the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those in the rows related to the specific conditions:\n\n- For Manu Gin\u00f3bili scoring 44: Row index 8, columns `score` and `leading scorer`.\n- For Mavericks as visitors: Row index 10, column `visitor`.\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
