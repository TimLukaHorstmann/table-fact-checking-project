Identify the players with titles in the \"league\" column:\n   - mbark boussoufa: 11 league titles\n   - tom de sutter: 9 league titles\n   - guillaume gillet: 8 league titles\n   - marcin wasilewski: 8 league titles\n   - jonathan legear: 5 league titles\n   - nicol\u00e1s frutos: 6 league titles\n   - thomas chatelle: 4 league titles\n   - roland juh\u00e1sz: 4 league titles\n   - stanislav vl\u010dek: 4 league titles\n   - lucas biglia: 2 league titles\n   - dmitri bulykin: 3 league titles\n   - jan pol\u00e1k: 2 league titles\n   - mat\u00edas su\u00e1rez: 1 league title\n   - jelle van damme: 3 league titles\n   - oleksandr iakovenko: 2 league titles\n   - hern\u00e1n losada: 1 league title\n\nFrom this, the players with at least one league title (indicating participation in the Belgian Cup) are:\n- mbark boussoufa\n- tom de sutter\n- guillaume gillet\n- marcin wasilewski\n- jonathan legear\n- nicol\u00e1s frutos\n- thomas chatelle\n- roland juh\u00e1sz\n- stanislav vl\u010dek\n- lucas biglia\n- dmitri bulykin\n- jan pol\u00e1k\n- mat\u00edas su\u00e1rez\n- jelle van damme\n- oleksandr iakovenko\n- hern\u00e1n losada\n\nHowever, the claim specifies \"4 players,\" implying we need to focus on a subset of these.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jelle van Damme is true or false, we must analyze the relevant information provided in the table.\n\n### Understanding the Claim:\n\nThe claim states: \"Jelle van Damme scored 3 times as much as each of the other two players in the UEFA Champions League tournament.\"\n\nFrom this statement:\n- We understand that Jelle van Damme's performance is being compared to \"each of the other two players\" in a specific context, which is implied to be related to his participation or scoring in the UEFA Champions League.\n- The phrase \"scored 3 times as much\" indicates a direct comparison of some quantitative measure (likely goals) among Jelle van Damme and these two other players.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n\nThe table provided includes columns for:\n1. `player`\n2. `league` \n3. `title playoff`\n4. `super cup`\n5. `total`\n\nThe column names suggest that \"league\" could refer to league titles or goals in domestic leagues, but it does not specifically mention anything about the UEFA Champions League.\n\n### Relevant Columns for Verification:\n\n1. **UEFA Champions League Data**: The table doesn't explicitly provide data related to the UEFA Champions League.\n2. **Columns Available**: We have columns indicating performance in `league`, `title playoff`, `super cup`, and a cumulative total of some kind, but none explicitly states \"Champions League goals.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since there is no specific column or indication for UEFA Champions League participation or scoring within the table, we cannot verify the claim based on the provided data.\n- The claim involves a comparison that isn't supported by any visible information in this table regarding UEFA Champions League performance.\n\nThus, given the lack of relevant data specifically about the UEFA Champions League, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis conclusion is drawn because there are no cells directly relevant to verifying Jelle van Damme's specific achievements in the UEFA Champions League tournament as stated.",
