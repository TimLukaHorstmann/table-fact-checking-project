The value is \"q2\".\n   - For 2007, check the cell under \"french open\" and column \"2007\". The value is also \"q2\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the French Open had a result of \"q2\" in both 2006 and 2007.\n   - From our examination, this is supported by the data: \n     - In 2006, the result for the French Open was indeed \"q2\".\n     - In 2007, the result for the French Open was also \"q2\".\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are verified with the data from the table, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this conclusion are:\n- Row index 3 (french open) and column name \"2006\"\n- Row index 3 (french open) and column name \"2007\"\n\nThus, the JSON output should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2006\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2007\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
