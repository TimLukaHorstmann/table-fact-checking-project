This corresponds to row index 5 in the table (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Examine the 'year(s) won' Column for Tom Watson:**\n   - The relevant cell is under \"year (s) won\" for \"tom watson\", which shows \"1977 , 1981\".\n   - This indicates that Tom Watson indeed won in both 1977 and 1981.\n\n3. **Verification of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Tom Watson won in 1977 and in 1981, which matches exactly with what is shown in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is true.

The corresponding \"total\" value for Tom Watson is indeed 154.\n\nWe will look at each relevant row in the table and identify which cells are necessary to validate this claim.\n\n- First, locate the row where the player's name matches \"Tom Watson.\"\n- Next, check the \"total\" column in that same row to confirm if it shows a value of 154.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n1. In the provided markdown table, find Tom Watson:\n   - The row with the player \"Tom Watson\" is at `row_index` 6 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2.
