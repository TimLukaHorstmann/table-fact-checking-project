    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, let's break down the statement:\n\n**Claim:** \"Collingwood score half as many points as St Kilda and Melbourne combine.\"\n\n1. **Identify Scores:**\n   - Collingwood's score is 28.16 (184).\n   - St Kilda's score is 9.19 (73).\n   - Melbourne's score is 5.6 (36).\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Score for St Kilda and Melbourne:**\n   - Convert the scores from VFL/AFL format (e.g., X.YZ) to total points:\n     - St Kilda: 9 goals (9 * 6 = 54) + 19 behinds (19 * 1 = 19) = 73 points.\n     - Melbourne: 5 goals (5 * 6 = 30) + 6 behinds (6 * 1 = 6) = 36 points.\n   - Combined score of St Kilda and Melbourne = 73 + 36 = 109 points.\n\n3. **Check Half of the Combined Score:**\n   - Half of 109 points = 109 / 2 = 54.5 points.\n\n4. **Compare Collingwood's Score:**\n   - Collingwood scored 184 points.\n   - Check if 184 is equal to half of the combined score (54.5).\n\nSince 184 is not equal to 54.5, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Collingwood's score: row index 3, \"home team score\"\n- St Kilda's score: row index 4, \"home team score\"\n- Melbourne's score: row index 4, \"away team score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This means only one team (Collingwood) scored more than Geelong, not two teams as the claim suggests.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states Geelong \"scored more points than all but 2 other teams,\" which implies that they should have the third-highest score.\n   - However, Geelong is tied for second with Carlton in terms of points scored (109), meaning only one team scored more.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row 3: \"away team score\" and \"home team score\"\n- All rows for \"home team score\" and \"away team score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
