The date of the seventh game should be October 8.\n2. The time of the seventh game should be 1:47.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Seventh Game**:\n   - From the table, we see that each row corresponds to a game with its respective order in the \"game\" column.\n   - We need to locate the row where `game = 7` (seventh game).\n\n2. **Check Date for the Seventh Game**:\n   - Look at the \"date\" column in the row where `game = 7`.\n   - In row index 6, we find `date: october 8`, which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Check Time for the Seventh Game**:\n   - Now, check the \"time\" column in the same row (`game = 7`).\n   - In row index 6, we see `time: 1:47`, which also matches the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the data in the table.
