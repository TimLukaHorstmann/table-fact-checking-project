    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if there is a game with tie number \"17\" where the home team is \"huddersfield town\". We will systematically check each row in the table for relevant information:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Tie Numbers:**\n   - The table includes rows labeled as \"tie no\" from 1 to 16, and two replays. None of these rows have a tie number of 17.\n\n2. **Check for Huddersfield Town as Home Team:**\n   - Row 15 shows that \"huddersfield town\" played as the home team in an initial match on 26 January 1982 against \"orient\".\n   - There is no row with \"tie no\" of 17, nor any indication that a game involving \"huddersfield town\" as the home team has such a tie number.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no tie number 17 in the table and \"huddersfield town\" only appears as the home team with tie numbers 15 (initial) and not associated with any other tie number, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We need to check the \"tie no\" and \"home team\" columns for all rows to confirm that there is no row with tie number 17 where \"huddersfield town\" is the home team.\n   - Specifically, we check:\n     - Row 15 for \"tie no\" (value: 15) and \"home team\" (value: huddersfield town).\n     - All other rows to ensure no tie number 17 exists.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 15, \"tie no\": 15\n- Row 15, \"home team\": huddersfield town\n- Rows with tie numbers from 1 to 16 and replays for absence of tie number 17\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
