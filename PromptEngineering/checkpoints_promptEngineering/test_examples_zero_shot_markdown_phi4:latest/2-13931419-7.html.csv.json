    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding the game between the Blues and the Penguins on March 20th, we need to focus on several pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The date of the game must be March 20.\n2. The home team for that date should be the Penguins.\n3. The score recorded for that game should match \"Blues - 2, Penguins - 4.\"\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the table to verify these conditions.\n\n- **Date**: We need a row where the date is March 20.\n- **Home Team**: On this date, the home team must be listed as \"penguins.\"\n- **Score**: The score for the game should match exactly \"2 - 4.\"\n\nNow, let's locate the relevant information in the table:\n\n1. Locate the row with the date \"march 20\":\n   - Row index: 8\n\n2. Check the home team for this date:\n   - Column: `home`\n   - Value in the row: \"penguins\"\n\n3. Verify the score for the game:\n   - Column: `score`\n   - Value in the row: \"2 - 4\"\n\nUpon checking these conditions, we find that all criteria are met:\n\n- The date is indeed March 20.\n- The home team listed is the Penguins.\n- The recorded score is \"Blues - 2, Penguins - 4.\"\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells used to verify this claim are:\n- Row index: 8\n- Columns: `date`, `home`, and `score`\n\nTherefore, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Instead, the entry for March 20 involves the Blues and Penguins with a score of \"2 - 4.\"\n\n2. **Verify Teams and Score for March 9**:\n   - The game between the Kings and Penguins occurs on March 9.\n   - The score for this game is \"1 - 3,\" not \"2 - 4\" as claimed.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is incorrect because:\n\n- There is no game on March 20 involving the Kings and Penguins with a score of \"2 - 4.\"\n- The actual game between the Kings and Penguins occurred on March 9 with a different score.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.
