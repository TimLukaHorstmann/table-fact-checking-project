    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the gold medalists listed in the table for each year and determine if they are different across all years except 1994 and 1998.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games have been different every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\"\n\nThis implies that:\n1. For most years, a unique individual should be listed as the gold medalist.\n2. In 1994 and 1998, the same individual could potentially hold the gold medal.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n|   Year | Gold Medalist               |\n|-------:|-----------------------------|\n|  1982  | nadia al - moutawaa         |\n|  1986  | takashi tomura              |\n|  1994  | konoshin kuwahara           |\n|  1998  | jin kanno                   |\n|  2002  | mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski     |\n|  2006  | ali yousuf al - rumaihi     |\n|  2010  | ramzy al duhami             |\n\n### Verification Steps:\n1. **1982 vs. Other Years**: nadia al - moutawaa (1982) should not appear in any other row.\n2. **1986 vs. Other Years**: takashi tomura (1986) should not appear in any other row.\n3. **1994 and 1998**: Check if konoshin kuwahara (1994) is the same as jin kanno (1998).\n4. **2002 vs. Other Years**: mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski (2002) should not appear in any other row.\n5. **2006 vs. Other Years**: ali yousuf al - rumaihi (2006) should not appear in any other row.\n6. **2010 vs. Other Years**: ramzy al duhami (2010) should not appear in any other row.\n\n### Detailed Check:\n- 1982: nadia al - moutawaa is unique to 1982.\n- 1986: takashi tomura is unique to 1986.\n- **1994 and 1998**: konoshin kuwahara (1994) is different from jin kanno (1998).\n- 2002: mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski is unique to 2002.\n- 2006: ali yousuf al - rumaihi is unique to 2006.\n- 2010: ramzy al duhami is unique to 2010.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the gold medalists are different for every year except no repetition occurs between 1994 and 1998, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
