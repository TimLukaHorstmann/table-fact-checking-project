Looking at the table, we find:\n     - The movie \"rpg : metanoia\" has an earning of \"p5.1 million\" on December 25.\n   \n   - Next, check if this same movie (\"rpg : metanoia\") has a total earning from December 25 to December 28 of \"p15.3 million\". According to the table:\n     - The total for \"rpg : metanoia\" from December 25 to December 28 is indeed \"p15.3 million\".\n\n3. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - From the above steps, we identify the relevant cells in the table that support or refute the claim:\n     - The cell at row index 4 (0-based index for \"rpg : metanoia\") and column name \"december 25\" contains \"p5.1 million\".\n     - The cell at row index 4 and column name \"december 25 - 28 total\" contains \"p15.3 million\".\n\nThese cells confirm that both conditions of the claim are true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.
