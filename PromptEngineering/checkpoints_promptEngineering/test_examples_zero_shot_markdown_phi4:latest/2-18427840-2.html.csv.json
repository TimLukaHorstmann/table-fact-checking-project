We need to check if the \"time\" column for this match equals 1:25.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- Locate the row where the \"opponent\" is \"takaichi hirayama\":\n  - Row index 14 has \"takaichi hirayama\" as the opponent.\n\n- Check the corresponding \"time\" value in that row:\n  - In row 14, the \"time\" column shows \"1:25.\"\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied: Takaichi Hirayama is listed as the opponent and the event finished in 1 minute and 25 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This indicates that the fighter did not lose to Gabriel Veiga.\n\n3. **Round of this Fight:**\n   - The round is listed as \"3\" in this row, so the fight was indeed held in the third round.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim specifies that Gabriel Veiga caused a loss in the third round.
