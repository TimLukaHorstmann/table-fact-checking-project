    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ken irvin be drag in the fourth round\" is true or false, we need to interpret and verify it against the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Interpretation of the Claim:**\n   - The phrase \"be drag in the fourth round\" suggests that Ken Irvin was selected during the fourth round of the draft.\n   - We should check if Ken Irvin is listed with a pick number corresponding to the fourth round.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information from the Table:**\n   - Check each row for the player's name \"Ken Irvin.\"\n   - Confirm the `round` value for this player.\n   - Verify that the `pick` corresponds to a number typically associated with the fourth round, which follows the picks of the third round and starts after pick 96 (the last pick from the third round).\n\n3. **Verification Against the Table:**\n   - Locate Ken Irvin in the table:\n     - The row containing Ken Irvin is identified by checking the \"player\" column.\n     - Row index for Ken Irvin: `5` (since markdown tables are 1-indexed).\n     - Check the `round` and `pick` columns:\n       - `round`: The value is `4`, indicating that he was indeed selected in the fourth round.\n       - `pick`: The number is `109`, which falls within the expected range for the fourth round, given the last third-round pick was 96.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Ken Irvin has a `round` value of `4`, it confirms he was picked during the fourth round.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this are from row index 5 for columns \"round\" and \"pick\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to analyze the information provided in the table and compare it with the statement:\n\n#### Claim Analysis:\n- The claim states: \"in 1st round , ken irvin be draft\"\n\nThis implies two conditions that must both be true for the claim to be correct:\n1. Ken Irvin was drafted in the first round.\n2. We need to verify Ken Irvin's round number and his presence (or absence) in the first round of the table.\n\n#### Verification Process:\n\n1. **Identify the row with \"Ken Irvin\":**\n   - Scan through the rows for any mention of \"Ken Irvin\" in the \"player\" column.\n   \n2. **Check the \"round\" value for Ken Irvin:**\n   - Once identified, check the \"round\" column to see which round Ken Irvin was actually drafted.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim's Round Requirement:**\n   - Check if this round is indeed the first round as claimed in the statement.\n\n#### Table Analysis:\n\n- Looking at each row:\n  - Row 4 mentions \"Ken Irvin\" under the player column.\n  - The corresponding \"round\" value for Ken Irvin (row 4) is 4.\n\nThis indicates that Ken Irvin was drafted in the fourth round, not the first round. Therefore, the claim is false because Ken Irvin was not drafted in the first round as stated.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell to verify the \"round\" for Ken Irvin is at row index 3 (considering zero-based indexing from markdown table) and column name \"round\".\n- Another relevant cell checks the player name: row index 3, column name \"player\".\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
