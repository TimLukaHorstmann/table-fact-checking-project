Identify all Canadian players in the \"position\" column:**\n\n- **Row 1:** Terry Ryan is a Canadian player with the position \"left wing.\" This does not match the \"center\" position.\n- **Row 4:** Jonathan Delisle is a Canadian player with the position \"right wing.\" This does not match the \"center\" position.\n- **Row 6:** Boyd Olson is a Canadian player with the position \"center.\" This matches the criteria.\n- **Row 7:** Stephane Robidas is a Canadian player with the position \"defense.\" This does not match the \"center\" position.\n- **Row 8:** Greg Hart is a Canadian player with the position \"right wing.\" This does not match the \"center\" position.\n- **Row 9:** Eric Houde is a Canadian player with the position \"center.\" This matches the criteria.\n\nFrom this analysis, we have identified two Canadian players in the \"center\" position: Boyd Olson and Eric Houde.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about players who played center for the 1995-96 Canadiens team, we need to verify two main points from the given table:\n\n1. **Miloslav Guren's Position**: The claim states \"miloslav guren\" as one of the centers, but according to the table:\n   - Row index 2 (third row): Miloslav Guren is listed with the position \"defence\".\n\n2. **Stephane Robidas's Position**: The claim also mentions \"stephane robidas\" as a center, but according to the table:\n   - Row index 6 (seventh row): Stephane Robidas is listed with the position \"defence\".\n\n3. **Identify Actual Centers**: We need to check if there are any players listed in the table who actually played center for the Canadiens.\n   - Row index 5: Boyd Olson, position \"center\".\n   - Row index 8: Eric Houde, position \"center\".\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- Miloslav Guren and Stephane Robidas do not play center; they are both listed as defensemen. \n- There are two players (Boyd Olson and Eric Houde) who actually played center.\n\nThe claim that \"Miloslav Guren and Stephane Robidas be the only player that play center on the 1995 - 96 canadiens team\" is therefore FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this claim include:\n- Miloslav Guren's position (row index 2, column \"position\").\n- Stephane Robidas's position (row index 6, column \"position\").\n- Boyd Olson's position (row index 5, column \"position\").\n- Eric Houde's position (row index 8, column \"position\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
