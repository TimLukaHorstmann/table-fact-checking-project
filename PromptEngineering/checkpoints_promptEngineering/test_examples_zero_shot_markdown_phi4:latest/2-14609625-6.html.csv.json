Therefore, the claim is trivially true because there are no counterexamples (no players with average < 2.6 and touchdowns \u2260 1).\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\". There are no relevant cells since no rows meet the initial condition of having an \"average\" less than 2.6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
