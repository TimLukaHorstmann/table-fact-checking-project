This helps us locate the game involving Quebec.\n\n2. **Extract Information**:\n   - From these identified rows, extract values from the 'decision' and 'record' columns to verify against the claim.\n\n3. **Verification Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that for Quebec, the decision was \"myre\" and the record was \"44 - 7 - 15\".\n   - Compare this with the extracted data from the table.\n\n4. **Analyze Data in Table**:\n\n   - On March 27th (row index 16):\n     - Visitor: quebec\n     - Decision: peeters\n     - Record: 46 - 11 - 18\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The decision associated with Quebec is \"peeters\", not \"myre\".\n   - The record on the date when Quebec visited is \"46 - 11 - 18\", which differs from the claimed \"44 - 7 - 15\".\n\nThe claim does not match the table data for both the 'decision' and 'record'.
