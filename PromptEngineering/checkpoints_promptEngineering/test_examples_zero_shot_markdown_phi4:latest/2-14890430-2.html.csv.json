    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"11 of the 19 countries compete get gold medal\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to evaluate two main aspects:\n\n1. **Total Number of Countries:** The claim mentions \"19 countries,\" so we must first confirm that there are indeed 19 distinct countries listed in the table.\n\n2. **Countries with Gold Medals:** We then need to count how many of these 19 countries have won at least one gold medal.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Count the Total Number of Countries\n\nThe table lists countries along with their rankings and medals won. Here is the list of countries by rank as per the markdown table:\n- Australia\n- Russia\n- Italy\n- United States\n- Germany\n- Netherlands\n- Belgium\n- Spain\n- Lithuania\n- Norway\n- Slovenia\n- France\n- Denmark\n- Portugal\n- Hungary\n- Switzerland\n- Ukraine\n- New Zealand\n- South Africa\n\nCounting these, we have a total of 19 countries listed.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Countries with Gold Medals\n\nNext, we need to identify which of these countries have won at least one gold medal. We look at the \"gold\" column for each country:\n\n1. Australia: 3 gold medals\n2. Russia: 3 gold medals\n3. Italy: 3 gold medals\n4. United States: 2 gold medals\n5. Germany: 1 gold medal\n6. Netherlands: 1 gold medal\n7. Belgium: 1 gold medal\n8. Spain: 1 gold medal\n9. Lithuania: 1 gold medal\n10. Norway: 1 gold medal\n11. Slovenia: 1 gold medal\n\nCounting these, we find that 11 countries have won at least one gold medal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states \"11 of the 19 country compete get gold medal.\" We verified:\n- There are indeed 19 countries listed.\n- Exactly 11 of those countries have won gold medals.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
