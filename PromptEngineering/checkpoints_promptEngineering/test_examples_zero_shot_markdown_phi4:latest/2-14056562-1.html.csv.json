    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the marathon took place in the year 2000,\" we need to examine the table for entries related to marathons and their respective years.\n\nLet's analyze each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: The event is a \"10000 m\" race, not a marathon. Therefore, this row is irrelevant.\n  \n- **Row 2**: This entry is for a marathon in Athens, Greece, but it occurred in 1997. Additionally, the result was \"dnf\" (did not finish), indicating that while an attempt at a marathon was made, it did not complete. Still, it confirms a marathon took place in 1997.\n\n- **Row 3**: This entry is for a marathon in Budapest, Hungary, which occurred in 1998. The position is noted as \"3rd\" with a time of \"2:12:53.\" This indicates that a marathon did take place in 1998.\n\n- **Row 4**: This entry refers to a marathon in Seville, Spain, occurring in 1999. The result was a 2nd-place finish with a time of \"2:14:03.\" Thus, a marathon took place in 1999.\n\n- **Row 5**: This entry is for the year 2000, specifically during the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. It mentions a marathon attempt that resulted in \"dnf\" (did not finish). While no complete finish was recorded, this still indicates that a marathon event occurred in 2000.\n\nBased on the examination of relevant rows:\n\n- Row 5 is crucial as it directly involves the year 2000 and confirms a marathon took place during the Olympic Games, even though there wasn't a finish (\"dnf\").\n\nThus, the claim \"the marathon took place in the year 2000\" is supported by the table.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The year is 1999.\n2.
