Specifically, we are looking for:\n- The points after game 61 should be part of a sequence where the total is 86.\n- We need to check if there are two other games before or after game 61 that also contribute to this total.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Points After Each Game:**\n   - Extract the \"points\" column values from the table for each game.\n\n2. **Check Combinations:**\n   - We need to find combinations of three games where the sum of their points is 86.\n   - Specifically, we are interested in combinations that include game 61 (row index 10).\n\n3. **Calculate and Compare:**\n   - Check all possible sets of three consecutive games or any combination that includes game 61.\n\n### Points from Table:\n- Game 52: 72 points\n- Game 53: 74 points\n- Game 54: 75 points\n- Game 55: 76 points\n- Game 56: 78 points\n- Game 57: 80 points\n- Game 58: 80 points\n- Game 59: 82 points\n- Game 60: 84 points\n- Game 61: 86 points\n- Game 62: 86 points\n- Game 63: 86 points\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Game 61 (86 points):**\n  - Check combinations including game 61:\n    - Games 59, 60, and 61: \\(82 + 84 + 86 = 252\\)\n    - Games 60, 61, and 62: \\(84 + 86 + 86 = 256\\)\n    - Games 61, 62, and 63: \\(86 + 86 + 86 = 258\\)\n\n- **Other Combinations:**\n  - Check if any other set of three games sums to 86:\n    - None of the combinations of three consecutive games before or after game 61 sum to 86.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because there are no three games that sum up to 86 points, including game 61.

Our task is to identify how many unique teams reach this score.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with 80 Points**:\n   - Look at each row and check if the value in the \"points\" column is 80.\n   \n2. **Rows Identified**:\n   - Row 57: `score` is 6 - 3, resulting in a total of `80 points`.\n   - Row 58: `score` is 3 - 5, maintaining a total of `80 points`.\n\n3. **Determine the Unique Teams Involved**:\n   - In row 57, the game was against the `new york islanders`, leading to 80 points.\n   - In row 58, the game was against the `montreal canadiens`, and the points remain at 80.\n\n4. **Check if These Are Distinct Games**:\n   - The teams involved in these games are different (`new york islanders` vs `montreal canadiens`).
