    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table concerning the Cincinnati Bengals' losses during the 1994 season.\n\nThe claim states: \"in the 1994 season, the cincinnati bengals have less than 12 losses.\"\n\n1. **Understand the Table Content**: \n   - The table lists each game's week, date, opponent, result (win or loss), and attendance.\n   - We are interested in the results of these games to assess how many times the Bengals lost.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to focus on the \"result\" column as it specifies whether each game was a win ('w') or a loss ('l').\n   - Each row represents one game, and we can count the number of 'l' entries in this column to determine total losses.\n\n3. **Count the Losses**:\n   - Go through each row in the \"result\" column and count the occurrences of 'l':\n     - Row 1: l\n     - Row 2: l\n     - Row 3: l\n     - Row 4: l\n     - Row 5: l\n     - Row 7: l\n     - Row 8: l\n     - Row 9: l\n     - Row 12: l\n     - Row 13: l\n     - Row 14: l\n     - Row 15: l\n     - Row 16: l\n\n   - The total number of 'l' entries is 13.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that there are fewer than 12 losses.\n   - We counted 13 losses, which means the Bengals had more than 12 losses.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since 13 losses is not less than 12, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are all those in the \"result\" column that contain 'l', corresponding to the losses:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
