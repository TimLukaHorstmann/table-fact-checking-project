    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"charvez davis' jersey number be 24,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Charvez Davis**: We look for the row where the name is \"charvez davis.\" According to the table, this corresponds to the row with index 23 (since markdown tables are typically 0-indexed when translated into a zero-based system).\n\n2. **Check Jersey Number**: The claim involves verifying the jersey number of Charvez Davis. In the context of the provided table, there is no explicit column for \"jersey number.\" Therefore, we must determine if the row index itself (23) can be interpreted as the jersey number.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The row index for Charvez Davis is 23.\n   - The claim states that his jersey number is 24, which does not match the row index of 23.\n\nThus, based on the information provided in the table and the absence of a specific column for jersey numbers, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Unnamed: 0\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of relevant cells:\n- The first cell checks for the presence and correctness of Charvez Davis's name.\n- The second cell verifies that his row index is indeed 24 (since markdown tables are usually displayed with 1-based indexing in documents, but internally they can be considered 0-indexed). However, in this context, it confirms that the row number does not match the claimed jersey number.",

Identifying players who are associated with \"florida air academy\".\n2. Checking if their row numbers (in the first column labeled \"Unnamed: 0\") are greater than 15.\n\n### Relevant Rows and Columns:\n- We need to check the \"last school\" column for entries that match \"florida air academy\".\n- For each matching entry, we will then verify the number in the \"Unnamed: 0\" column to see if it is higher than 15.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify players from \"florida air academy\":**\n   - Look at the \"last school\" column for entries that say \"florida air academy\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row index 10 has \"ben eblen\" with \"florida air academy\".\n\n2. **Check if their number is higher than 15:**\n   - For row index 10, check the value in the \"Unnamed: 0\" column.\n   - The value at row index 10 is 10.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The player from \"florida air academy\" has a number of 10, which is not higher than 15.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index 10, \"last school\": \"florida air academy\"\n- Row index 10, \"Unnamed: 0\": 10\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is false because the player from \"florida air academy\" does not have a number higher than 15.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"last school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Unnamed: 0\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
