    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell\" is true or false, we need to focus on the \"size\" column for both Orleans and Mitchell schools as indicated in the table.\n\n1. **Extract relevant data:**\n   - For Orleans (3rd row), the size is 258.\n   - For Mitchell (2nd row), the size is 620.\n\n2. **Calculate half of Mitchell's size:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of Mitchell's size} = \\frac{620}{2} = 310\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare Orleans' size to half of Mitchell's size:**\n   - Orleans has a size of 258.\n   - Check if 258 is less than 310.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Since 258 is indeed less than 310, the claim \"orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell\" holds true.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells for verification:**\n   - Orleans (3rd row): The cell in the \"size\" column.\n   - Mitchell (2nd row): The cell in the \"size\" column.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the answer is TRUE and the relevant cells are identified by their row index and column name.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
