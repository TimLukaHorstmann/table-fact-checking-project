    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"43243 live births have a migration of -14873,\" we need to identify if there is an entry in the table where both the live births and migration match these values.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The column for \"live births\" is relevant.\n   - The column for \"migration\" is also relevant.\n\n2. **Search for Matching Row**:\n   - We need to find a row where the value in the \"live births\" column is 43243 and the value in the \"migration\" column is -14873.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Go through each row in the table and check these two columns.\n   - The row with an average population of 2,657,760 has:\n     - Live births: 43,243\n     - Migration: -14,873\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - This matches exactly with the claim provided.\n\n5. **Determine Relevance**:\n   - The relevant cells are in the row where the average population is 2,657,760.\n   - Row index for this entry is 5 (considering a zero-based index).\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"live births\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"migration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
