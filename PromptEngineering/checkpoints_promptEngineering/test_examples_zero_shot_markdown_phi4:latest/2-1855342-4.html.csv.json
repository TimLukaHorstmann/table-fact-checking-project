The final row labeled \"no opinion\" corresponds to percentages of respondents who had no opinion about each president listed in the columns.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"George Bush.\" In the context of the table, this likely refers to George H.W.

Bush. The values in each cell represent the percentage of respondents who hold that particular opinion about the respective president.\n\n#### Key Information:\n\n- **Column for George H.W. Bush**: This is what we need to focus on.\n- **Row \"4. below average\"**: This row indicates the percentage of respondents with a \"below average\" opinion.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim\n\n1. Locate the column for George H.W. Bush in the table.\n2. Find the cell corresponding to the \"below average\" rating within that column.\n3. Check if this value is 1%.\n\n#### Relevant Cell:\n\n- **Row Index**: The row \"4. below average\" corresponds to index 3 (considering zero-based indexing).\n- **Column Name**: \"george h w bush\".\n\nFrom the table, in the cell at row 3 (\"below average\") and column \"george h w bush\", the value is 11%.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that 1% of respondents have a below-average opinion about George H.W. Bush, but according to the table, it is actually 11%.
