This will help us evaluate if these players indeed have a 'free' transfer fee.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Scan through the 'nat' column to find rows with the value 'por'.\n\n2. **Check Transfer Fee:**\n   - For each row identified in step 1, check the 'transfer fee' column to see if it contains the word \"free\".\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim:**\n   - If all entries for players with 'nat' as 'por' have a 'transfer fee' of \"free\", then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n### Detailed Evaluation:\n\n- **Row 11**:\n  - 'nat': por\n  - 'transfer fee': free\n\nSince there is only one row with 'nat' as 'por', and its 'transfer fee' is indeed \"free\", the claim holds true for all cases involving players from Portugal ('por').\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"por have a free transfer fee\" is TRUE, based on the data provided in the table.
