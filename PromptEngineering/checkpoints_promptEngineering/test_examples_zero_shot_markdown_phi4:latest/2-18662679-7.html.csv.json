    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine Poland's rank relative to all participating countries listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to examine each row to gather information about ranks and countries.\n\n2. **Extract Information from Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** Country is \"poland\" with rank 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Country is \"australia\" with rank 2.\n   - **Row 3:** Country is \"germany\" with rank 3.\n   - **Row 4:** Country is \"czech republic\" with rank 4.\n   - **Row 5:** Country is \"russia\" with rank 5.\n   - **Row 6:** Country is \"belarus\" with rank 6.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Poland ranks third among all competing countries.\n   - From our extraction, Poland actually has rank 1, not 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because Poland's actual rank is first, not third.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - To verify the rank of each country, we need to consider the \"rank\" and \"country\" columns for all rows.\n   - These are the relevant cells:\n     - Row 1: (\"rank\", \"country\")\n     - Row 2: (\"rank\", \"country\")\n     - Row 3: (\"rank\", \"country\")\n     - Row 4: (\"rank\", \"country\")\n     - Row 5: (\"rank\", \"country\")\n     - Row 6: (\"rank\", \"country\")\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
