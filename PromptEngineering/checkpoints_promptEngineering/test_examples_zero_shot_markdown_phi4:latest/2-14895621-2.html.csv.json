Therefore, we need to focus on entries where \"Kang Haeng\" appears in the 'partner' column.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Check each row for the 'partner' column.\n   - Count how many times \"Kang Haeng\" is listed as a partner.\n\n3. **Relevant Columns and Rows**:\n   - The relevant column to check is 'partner'.\n   - We need to identify all rows where the value in this column is \"Kang Haeng\".\n\n4. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Row 1: Partner is \"Kang Haeng\".\n   - Row 2: Partner is \"Kang Haeng\".\n   - Row 3: Partner is \"Kang Haeng\".\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - \"Kang Haeng\" appears as a partner in rows 1, 2, and 3.\n   - This totals three occurrences.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng three times at tournaments is supported by the data.\n\nNow, let's construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of the claim in relation to the table:\n\n1. **Claim about Hwang Sun partnering with Kang Haeng**: The claim involves a partnership between two individuals: \"hwang sun\" and \"kang haeng.\" The table lists partnerships under the \"partner\" column.\n\n2. **First time partnering**: The claim specifies that this is their first time partnering, which implies we need to find the earliest event in the table where they are listed as partners.\n\n3. **1985 World Championship in Calgary, Canada**: We must verify if there is an entry for a 1985 world championship in Calgary, Canada, and whether Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng during this event.\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- The \"partner\" column indicates \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner. Since no other names are listed, it can be assumed that Hwang Sun is implied to be part of the partnership (likely as \"hwang sun\").\n\n- We need to find entries where the year is 1985 and the event or venue is related to the world championships in Calgary, Canada.\n\nReviewing the table:\n\n1. **Row 2**: \n   - Year: 1985\n   - Venue: Calgary, Canada\n   - Partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nThis row matches the conditions of being a 1985 event in Calgary, Canada, and lists \"kang haeng - suk\" as the partner.\n\nNow, let's check for earlier partnerships:\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Year: 1982\n  - Partner: kang haeng - suk\n\nThis row shows an earlier partnership with Kang Haeng Suk in 1982. Since this occurs before 1985, it indicates that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng partnered before the 1985 event.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that Hwang Sun first partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 world championship is false because they had already partnered in 1982.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each part of it using the data from the table:\n\n1. **Partner Verification**: The claim states \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1982 new delhi , india\". In the table:\n   - For the event in New Delhi, India, in 1982, the partner listed is \"kang haeng - suk\".\n\n2. **Event and Outcome Verification**: The claim mentions that they finished \"first\" at this event.\n   - The outcome for the 1982 event in New Delhi is \"1\", but it is followed by \"wd\". In badminton scoring, \"1\" can indicate a win, but \"wd\" stands for \"walkover\", which does not count as an actual match win.\n\n3. **Time Frame Verification**: The claim mentions this happened \"2 year after win the world championship\".\n   - For World Championships in 1985 (as per the table), the event partner is again \"kang haeng - suk\". However, there's no record of a world championship win by Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk prior to 1982.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The claim about partnering with \"kang haeng\" in New Delhi, India, in 1982 is correct.\n- The claim that they finished first is incorrect due to the outcome being a walkover (\"wd\").\n- The claim of it occurring two years after winning a world championship is not supported by any data.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down each condition in the claim and verify it against the table:\n\n1. **Partner: \"kang haeng\"**  \n   - The relevant column is \"partner\". We need to check if \"kang haeng - suk\" appears as a partner for any of Hwang Sun's events.\n\n2. **Finish first (\"finish first at 3 different venue\")**  \n   - The relevant column is \"outcome\". We should look for outcomes that indicate finishing first (e.g., a number indicating the position, but not \"wd\").\n\n3. **Different venues**  \n   - The relevant column is \"venue\". If Hwang Sun finished first at any events, we need to count how many unique venues are listed where she did so.\n\n4. **Timeframe: from 1982 to 1985**  \n   - The relevant column is \"year\". We should ensure that the years for these events fall between 1982 and 1985 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- Row 1:\n  - Outcome: \"3\" (indicates finishing first)\n  - Year: \"1985\"\n  - Venue: \"calgary , canada\"\n  - Partner: \"kang haeng - suk\"\n\n- Row 2:\n  - Outcome: \"wd\" (does not indicate finishing first)\n\n- Row 3:\n  - Outcome: \"1\" (indicates finishing first)\n  - Year: \"1982\"\n  - Venue: \"new delhi , india\"\n  - Partner: \"kang haeng - suk\"\n\n- Row 4:\n  - No relevant data for finishing first\n\n- Row 5:\n  - Outcome: \"wd\" (does not indicate finishing first)\n\nFrom the table, Hwang Sun finished first at two different venues with her partner kang haeng - suk:\n1.
