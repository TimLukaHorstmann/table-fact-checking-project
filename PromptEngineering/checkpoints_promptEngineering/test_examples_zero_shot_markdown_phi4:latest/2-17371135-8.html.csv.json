    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the table and check whether Detroit Red Wings lost a game on February 5th during the 2008-09 season.\n\n1. **Identify the Date of Interest:** The claim mentions \"February 5th.\" We need to find this date in the table.\n2. **Check if Any Game is Recorded for February 5th:** We scan through the table to see if there's a row with \"february 5\" under the \"date\" column.\n\nAfter reviewing each row:\n\n- February 2: Detroit vs St Louis\n- February 4: Detroit vs Phoenix\n- February 7: Detroit vs Edmonton\n- February 8: Detroit at Pittsburgh\n- February 10: Detroit at Nashville\n- February 12: Minnesota at Detroit\n- February 13: Columbus at Detroit\n- February 15: Colorado at Detroit\n- February 18: Nashville at Detroit\n- February 20: Anaheim at Detroit\n- February 21: Detroit at Minnesota\n- February 25: San Jose at Detroit\n- February 27: Los Angeles at Detroit\n- February 28: Detroit at Nashville\n\nThere is no entry for \"February 5\" in the table. Therefore, no game involving Detroit Red Wings on that date is recorded.\n\n3. **Determine if the Claim is True:** Since there is no record of a game on February 5th, it cannot be considered a loss (or any other result) for Detroit Red Wings.\n\nThe claim \"the lost 5 game of the 2008 - 09 season be victory for the detroit red wing\" is false because:\n- There is no entry for February 5th.\n- Consequently, there can't be a transformation from loss to victory on that date.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant check involves the entire \"date\" column because we need to confirm the absence of any entry for February 5th.
