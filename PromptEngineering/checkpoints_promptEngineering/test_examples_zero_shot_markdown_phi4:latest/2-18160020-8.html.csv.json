The team \"atl\u00e9tico ciudad\" should have played 28 matches.\n2. The average goals per match for \"atl\u00e9tico ciudad\" should be less than 0.61.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row Index and Team Identification**: We are looking at the row where the \"team\" column is \"atl\u00e9tico ciudad\".
