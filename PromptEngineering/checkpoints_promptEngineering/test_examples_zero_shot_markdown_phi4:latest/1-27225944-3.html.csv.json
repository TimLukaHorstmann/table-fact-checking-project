    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim and compare it against the table data:\n\n**Claim:** \"Ivan Pudar from team Hrvatski Dragovoljac be the outgoing manager for mutual consent.\"\n\nThe conditions to verify are:\n1. The name of the outgoing manager should be Ivan Pudar.\n2. The team should be Hrvatski Dragovoljac.\n3. The manner of departure should be \"mutual consent\".\n\nNow, let's look at the table and identify relevant rows:\n\n- We need to locate any row where the \"team\" is \"hrvatski dragovoljac\".\n  \n  There are two such entries:\n  - Row index 4: Ivan Pudar is listed as an outgoing manager for Hrvatski Dragovoljac with a departure date of 3 2010, and the manner of departure is \"mutual consent\".\n  - Row index 5: Davor Mladina replaces Ivan Pudar in July 2010, but this row concerns his replacement, not him being outgoing.\n\nNow, check each condition:\n\n1. **Outgoing Manager**: In Row 4, \"ivan pudar\" matches the name in the claim.\n2. **Team**: In Row 4, \"hrvatski dragovoljac\" is correctly identified as the team.\n3. **Manner of Departure**: In Row 4, \"mutual consent\" matches the manner specified in the claim.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied by the data in row index 4 of the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- From Row 4:\n  - \"team\": Hrvatski Dragovoljac\n  - \"outgoing manager\": Ivan Pudar\n  - \"manner of departure\": mutual consent\n\nHere is the JSON response with the answer and the indices of the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
