    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the cumulative points scored by the Miami Dolphins and their opponents over the six games listed in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the 1972 Miami Dolphin score less cumulative point than their opponent in the 6 game between August 5 and September 10.\"\n\nWe'll calculate the total points for both the Miami Dolphins and their opponents:\n\n1. **Game 1 (August 5, 1972)**\n   - Dolphins: 23\n   - Opponent (Detroit Lions): 31\n\n2. **Game 2 (August 12, 1972)**\n   - Dolphins: 13\n   - Opponent (Green Bay Packers): 14\n\n3. **Game 3 (August 19, 1972)**\n   - Dolphins: 35\n   - Opponent (Cincinnati Bengals): 17\n\n4. **Game 4 (August 25, 1972)**\n   - Dolphins: 24\n   - Opponent (Atlanta Falcons): 10\n\n5. **Game 5 (August 31, 1972)**\n   - Dolphins: 24\n   - Opponent (Washington Redskins): 27\n\n6. **Game 6 (September 10, 1972)**\n   - Dolphins: 21\n   - Opponent (Minnesota Vikings): 19\n\nNow, let's sum up the points:\n\n- **Total points for Miami Dolphins**: \n  \\(23 + 13 + 35 + 24 + 24 + 21 = 140\\)\n\n- **Total points for opponents**:\n  \\(31 + 14 + 17 + 10 + 27 + 19 = 118\\)\n\nThe Dolphins scored a total of 140 points, while their opponents scored 118 points. Therefore, the claim that the Dolphins scored less cumulative points than their opponents is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing the scores for each game:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the record of wins at home and on the road for the Miami Dolphins from the given table.\n\n1. **Home vs. Road Games Identification**:\n   - Typically, a football team plays one home game and one away game each week, but the table does not specify which games are home or away.\n   - Without explicit information about home and road games in the table, we cannot directly identify the location of each game.\n\n2. **Record Analysis**:\n   - The record column shows the cumulative wins and losses after each game.\n   - We need to determine if there's an equal number of wins at home as on the road.\n\n3. **Game Results**:\n   - Week 1: Loss (L)\n   - Week 2: Loss (L)\n   - Week 3: Win (W)\n   - Week 4: Win (W)\n   - Week 5: Loss (L)\n   - Week 6: Win (W)\n\n4. **Cumulative Record**:\n   - After week 1: 0-1\n   - After week 2: 0-2\n   - After week 3: 1-2\n   - After week 4: 2-2\n   - After week 5: 2-3\n   - After week 6: 3-3\n\n5. **Win Record**:\n   - Total wins = 3 (Weeks 3, 4, and 6)\n   - To have the same win record at home as on the road, they must have won either 1 or 2 games at home and the same number on the road.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without knowing which games are home or away, we cannot determine if the win records are equal for home and road.\n   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the table alone, we cannot verify the claim.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data about home and road games, the claim cannot be verified as true. Thus, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
