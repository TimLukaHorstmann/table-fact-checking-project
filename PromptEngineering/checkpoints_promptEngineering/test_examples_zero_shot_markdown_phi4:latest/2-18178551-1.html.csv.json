The game where \"England\" played against \"Argentina.\"\n2. Verifying if it was a match where England scored the \"most points.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### 1. Find the Match Between England and Argentina\nWe need to identify the row in the table where the \"opposing teams\" is \"argentina.\" \n\nFrom the table:\n- The relevant row for this part of the claim is row index 8 (0-based index), which has:\n  - Opposing team: argentina\n  - Against: 0\n\n#### 2. Verify If It Was the Match with Most Points Scored\nThe next step is to determine if England scored the most points against Argentina in this particular match compared to other matches listed.\n\n- In row 8, \"against\" (points scored by England) is 0.\n- To verify if it's the highest, compare it with all the values in the \"against\" column:\n  - Ireland: 18\n  - France: 9\n  - Wales: 12\n  - Italy: 12\n  - Scotland: 19\n  - South Africa (first test): 18\n  - South Africa (second test): 22\n  - Australia: 19\n  - Argentina: 0\n  - South Africa (test match): 17\n\nThe highest number of points scored by England in any listed match is 22, which was against South Africa during the second test.\n\nSince the points scored against Argentina (0) are not the most compared to other matches, the claim that \"england cone time the most point against argentina\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- Row index 8 (opposing team: argentina, against: 0)\n- The entire \"against\" column for comparison purposes.\n\nHere is the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate it against the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **\"In the six nation tournament...\"**\n   - The relevant column here is \"status,\" which indicates if a match was part of the Six Nations.\n   \n2. **\"...England's away match be against Argentina and South Africa.\"**\n   - We need to check for matches where England played against Argentina or South Africa during the Six Nations.\n\n### Evaluating Conditions:\n\n1. **Matches in the Six Nations:**\n   - From the table, we identify rows where \"status\" is \"six nations\":\n     - Row 0: Ireland\n     - Row 1: France\n     - Row 2: Wales\n     - Row 3: Italy\n     - Row 4: Scotland\n\n2. **Teams in the Six Nations (from historical context):**\n   - The Six Nations teams are: England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France, and Italy.\n\n3. **Check for Argentina or South Africa as opponents in the Six Nations:**\n   - None of the rows with \"six nations\" status lists either Argentina or South Africa as opposing teams.\n   - Additionally, Argentina (Row 8) and South Africa (Rows 5, 6, 7) are not part of the Six Nations tournament.\n\n4. **England's Matches in the Table:**\n   - The table does not list any specific matches for England directly. However, by process of elimination:\n     - Since none of the \"six nations\" rows involve Argentina or South Africa, and these teams are not part of the Six Nations at all, it implies England did not have an away match against them in this tournament.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that England had an away match against Argentina and South Africa in the Six Nations. Based on the table, there is no evidence to support this; both teams are not involved in the Six Nations matches listed.\n  \nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
