    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down and verify each part of it against the table:\n\n1. **Players' Names**: The claim mentions \"camilo villegas\" from Columbia and \"david tom\" from the United States.\n\n   - Checking the table:\n     - Camilo Villegas is listed in row 12.\n     - David Toms (note the spelling difference) is listed in row 11.\n\n2. **Place**: The claim states they are tied for eighth place.\n\n   - In the table, positions \"t7\" and \"t9\" are shown, but no position is marked as \"t8\". This suggests there's no eighth place tie.\n\n3. **Score to Par**: According to the claim, both players are at +4 to par.\n\n   - Checking the scores:\n     - Camilo Villegas (row 12) has a score of +3 to par.\n     - David Toms (row 11) also has a score of +3 to par.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- There is no eighth place in the table, only seventh and ninth places are noted.\n- Both players have scores of +3 to par, not +4 as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is false. Let's identify the relevant cells needed to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row 11**: For David Toms\n  - Column \"player\" shows \"david toms\"\n  - Column \"country\" shows \"united states\"\n  - Column \"to par\" shows \"+ 3\"\n\n- **Row 12**: For Camilo Villegas\n  - Column \"place\" shows \"t9\"\n  - Column \"country\" shows \"colombia\"\n  - Column \"to par\" shows \"+ 3\"\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
