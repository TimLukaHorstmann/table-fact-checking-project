    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to carefully analyze each part of it in relation to the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \n1. \"when the outcome be runner - up on 24 september 2007\"\n2. \"the surface be carpet with opponent be mardy fish who beat olivier rochus every time they play on every date.\"\n\nLet's examine these conditions:\n\n### Condition 1:\n- **Date:** The claim specifies September 24, 2007.\n- **Outcome:** The outcome should be \"runner - up\" on this date.\n\n**Table Analysis:**\n- Row corresponding to September 24, 2007:\n  - Outcome is \"runner - up\".\n  - Date is indeed 24 September 2007.\n\nThis part of the claim is supported by the table data.\n\n### Condition 2:\n- **Surface:** The surface should be \"carpet.\"\n\n**Table Analysis:**\n- Row corresponding to September 24, 2007:\n  - Surface listed is \"hard,\" not \"carpet.\"\n\nThus, this condition is false according to the table.\n\n### Additional Conditions in the Claim:\nThe claim also mentions:\n3. **Opponent:** The opponent should be Mardy Fish.\n4. **Mardy Fish's record against Olivier Rochus:** It claims that Mardy Fish beat Olivier Rochus every time they played on any date, which is irrelevant to verifying this specific row but adds complexity to the claim.\n\n**Table Analysis:**\n- Row corresponding to September 24, 2007:\n  - Opponent listed is Richard Gasquet, not Mardy Fish.\n\nThis part of the claim is also false according to the table data. Additionally, there's no information in the table about matches between Mardy Fish and Olivier Rochus or their outcomes, making it impossible to verify this part of the claim with the given table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe conditions related to date, outcome, surface type, and opponent are not all met by the table data for September 24, 2007. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Date (column) at row index 6: \"24 september 2007\"\n- Outcome (column) at row index 6: \"runner - up\"\n- Surface (column) at row index 6: \"hard\"\n- Opponent (column) at row index 6: \"richard gasquet\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine each part of it against the data in the table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. **David Ferrer as Opponent When Olivier Rochus Loses on Hard Surface:**\n   - We need to identify rows where Olivier Rochus is the loser and the surface is hard.\n   - Check if David Ferrer is indeed the opponent for each such instance.\n\n2. **John Isner as Opponent When Olivier Rochus Loses on Carpeted Surface:**\n   - We need to identify rows where Olivier Rochus loses on a \"carpet\" surface.\n   - Check if John Isner is the opponent in those instances.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Check for Hard Surfaces\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Outcome: Runner-up (indicating loss)\n  - Surface: Hard\n  - Opponent: Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez\n  - This does not match the claim as the opponent is not David Ferrer.\n  \n- **Row 6:**\n  - Outcome: Runner-up (indicating loss)\n  - Surface: Hard\n  - Opponent: Richard Gasquet\n  - This does not match the claim as the opponent is not David Ferrer.\n\n- **Row 8:**\n  - Outcome: Runner-up (indicating loss)\n  - Surface: Grass\n  - Not relevant for hard surface condition.\n\n- **Row 9:**\n  - Outcome: Runner-up (indicating loss)\n  - Surface: Grass\n  - Not relevant for hard surface condition.\n\n- **Row 10:**\n  - Outcome: Runner-up (indicating loss)\n  - Surface: Hard\n  - Opponent: David Ferrer\n  - This matches the claim where David Ferrer is the opponent on a hard surface when Olivier Rochus loses.\n\n#### Step 2: Check for Carpeted Surfaces\n- The table does not list any match played on a \"carpet\" surface. Therefore, there are no instances to verify if John Isner was the opponent under these conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim about David Ferrer being the opponent each time Olivier Rochus loses on a hard surface is **partially true** (only one instance matches).\n- There are no matches on a carpeted surface, so we cannot confirm or deny the part of the claim regarding John Isner.\n  \nGiven that not all conditions in the claim are met (specifically, there are no carpeted surface matches), the overall claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for verification are those where Olivier Rochus lost on a hard surface and when David Ferrer was the opponent:\n\n- Row 4: Surface and Opponent\n- Row 6: Surface and Opponent\n- Row 10: Outcome, Surface, and Opponent\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
