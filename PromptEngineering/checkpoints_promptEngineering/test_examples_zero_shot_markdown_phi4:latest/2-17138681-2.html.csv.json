    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be more than 12.42 million viewer for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8,\" we need to identify relevant entries from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Entries with Rating/Share \"3.2 / 8\":**\n   - We look at the column `rating / share (18 - 49)` and find the row where this value is \"3.2 / 8.\"\n\n2. **Check Viewers for the Identified Entry:**\n   - Once we identify the row with \"3.2 / 8\" in the rating/share column, we need to check the `viewers (millions)` column to see if there are more than 12.42 million viewers.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n- **Row Identification:**\n  - The entry with `rating / share` of \"3.2 / 8\" is in row index 6.\n\n- **Check Viewers for This Entry:**\n  - In row 6, the value under `viewers (millions)` is 12.42.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states there should be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating/share \"3.2 / 8.\" However, the entry with \"3.2 / 8\" has exactly 12.42 million viewers, not more.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells are:\n  - Row index 6, column `rating / share (18 - 49)` for identifying the rating/share.\n  - Row index 6, column `viewers (millions)` for checking the number of viewers.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rating / share (18 - 49)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
