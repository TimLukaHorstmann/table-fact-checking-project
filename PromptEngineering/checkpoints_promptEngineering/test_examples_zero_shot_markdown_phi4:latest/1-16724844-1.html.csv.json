However, in these specific cases, the \"Men Open\" column is marked as N/A, meaning there's no available data to verify if Gold Coast Sharks defeat Northern Eagles. Therefore, we cannot confirm that whenever Brisbane City Cobras beat Sydney Mets in \"Men U20,\" Gold Coast Sharks beat Northern Eagles in \"Men Open.\"\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Men U20\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Men U20\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Men U20\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
