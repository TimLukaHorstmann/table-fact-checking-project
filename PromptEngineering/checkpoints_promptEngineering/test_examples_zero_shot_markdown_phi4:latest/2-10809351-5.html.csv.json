The number before the period is the number of goals (each worth 6 points), and the number after the period is the number of behinds (each worth 1 point). Therefore, Carlton's score in points is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Carlton's score} = (16 \\times 6) + 8 = 96 + 8 = 104\n     \\]\n\n2. **Hawthorn's Home Team Score:**\n   - From the table, Hawthorn's home team score is \"9.13 (67)\".\n   - Similarly, this score in points is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Hawthorn's score} = (9 \\times 6) + 13 = 54 + 13 = 67\n     \\]\n\n3. **Score Difference:**\n   - The difference between Carlton's and Hawthorn's scores is:\n     \\[\n     104 - 67 = 37\n     \\]\n   - In terms of goals (6 points each) and behinds (1 point each), we need to express this difference as \"11.18\" which means 11 goals and 18 behinds.\n   - Calculating the equivalent in points for \"11.18\":\n     \\[\n     (11 \\times 6) + 18 = 66 + 18 = 84\n     \\]\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\n- The calculated difference of 37 points does not match the 84 points represented by a score difference of \"11.18\".

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate whether three away teams had scores less than 10.00.\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - The table consists of columns representing \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\"\n   - Each row corresponds to a match with its relevant data.\n   \n2. **Interpreting the Score Format:**\n   - Scores are given in the format of \"goals.minutes (total_points)\" where:\n     - Goals = whole number before the period\n     - Minutes = numbers after the period (each equivalent to 1 point)\n     - Total points = the number in parentheses\n\n3. **Claim Evaluation:**\n   - The claim states that a total of 3 away teams have an \"away team score\" less than 10.00.\n\n4. **Checking Each Row's Away Team Score:**\n\n   - **Row Index 0:** \n     - Away team: north melbourne\n     - Away team score: 6.12 (48)\n     - Convert to decimal: 6 + 12/100 = 6.12\n     - 6.12 < 10.00, so this count as one.\n\n   - **Row Index 1:** \n     - Away team: st kilda\n     - Away team score: 10.11 (71)\n     - Convert to decimal: 10 + 11/100 = 10.11\n     - 10.11 > 10.00, so this does not count.\n\n   - **Row Index 2:** \n     - Away team: richmond\n     - Away team score: 9.15 (69)\n     - Convert to decimal: 9 + 15/100 = 9.15\n     - 9.15 < 10.00, so this counts as two.\n\n   - **Row Index 3:** \n     - Away team: collingwood\n     - Away team score: 10.14 (74)\n     - Convert to decimal: 10 + 14/100 = 10.14\n     - 10.14 > 10.00, so this does not count.\n\n   - **Row Index 4:** \n     - Away team: footscray\n     - Away team score: 6.14 (50)\n     - Convert to decimal: 6 + 14/100 = 6.14\n     - 6.14 < 10.00, so this counts as three.\n\n   - **Row Index 5:** \n     - Away team: fitzroy\n     - Away team score: 14.21 (105)\n     - Convert to decimal: 14 + 21/100 = 14.21\n     - 14.21 > 10.00, so this does not count.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have found exactly three away teams with scores less than 10.00.\n   - The claim is TRUE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
