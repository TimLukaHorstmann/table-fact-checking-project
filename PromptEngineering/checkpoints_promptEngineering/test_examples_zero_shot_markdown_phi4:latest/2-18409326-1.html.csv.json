Each row corresponds to a different station.\n\n2. **Counting the Stations**:\n   - We count the number of non-empty rows that represent distinct radio stations.\n   - There are 10 rows in total, each containing information about a unique radio station (assuming no missing or duplicate entries).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Claim**: \n   - The claim asserts that there is more than one station.\n   - Since we have identified 10 different stations from the table, it is clear that there are indeed more than one station.\n\n4. **Identifying Relevant Cells**:\n   - To verify this claim, each row in the \"frequency\" column is relevant because they uniquely identify a station.\n   - We will list these rows with their indices for clarity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim is supported by the data as there are 10 stations listed.\n\nNow, let's construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
