    "resp": "To verify the claim \"6 week's game be attend by 33007 crowd,\" we need to check the relevant row in the table and examine the attendance for Week 6.\n\n1.

Compare this value with the claim's stated attendance of 30,007.\n\nThe provided attendance (33,057) does not match the claimed attendance (30,007).
