This verifies he isn't associated with Zimbabwe at all.\n\n- Row 11 contains Nick Price, who is listed as being from Zimbabwe.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that Frank Nobilo would be the only player from Zimbabwe, but from our table analysis, Nick Price is actually listed as being from Zimbabwe. Thus, Frank Nobilo is not the only player associated with Zimbabwe in this context.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row 11**: Nick Price's entry indicates he is from Zimbabwe.\n  - Column \"player\": \"nick price\"\n  - Column \"country\": \"zimbabwe\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because we found another player (Nick Price) who is actually from Zimbabwe.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
