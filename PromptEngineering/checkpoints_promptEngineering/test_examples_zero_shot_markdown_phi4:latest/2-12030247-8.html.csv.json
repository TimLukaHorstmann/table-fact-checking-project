They have the least total receipts.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Least Money Spent, 2Q\n\n- **John Edwards**: 6,485,422\n- **Barack Obama**: 16,042,388\n\nWe need to compare these amounts with all candidates in the \"money spent, 2q\" column:\n\n| Candidate         | Money Spent, 2Q |\n|-------------------|----------------:|\n| Hillary Clinton   |       12,769,306 |\n| Barack Obama      |       16,042,388 |\n| John Edwards      |        6,485,422 |\n| Bill Richardson   |        4,983,067 |\n| Christopher Dodd  |        4,384,580 |\n| Joe Biden         |        2,517,654 |\n| Dennis Kucinich   |          707,653 |\n| Mike Gravel       |          99,866 |\n\nFrom this data, Dennis Kucinich spent the least at 707,653. Therefore, neither John Edwards nor Barack Obama has the least money spent in 2Q.\n\n### Condition 2: Least Total Receipts\n\n- **John Edwards**: 23,129,158\n- **Barack Obama**: 58,912,520\n\nWe need to compare these amounts with all candidates in the \"total receipts\" column:\n\n| Candidate         | Total Receipts |\n|-------------------|---------------:|\n| Hillary Clinton   |     63,075,927 |\n| Barack Obama      |     58,912,520 |\n| John Edwards      |     23,129,158 |\n| Bill Richardson   |     13,339,633 |\n| Christopher Dodd  |     12,076,091 |\n| Joe Biden         |       6,461,745 |\n| Dennis Kucinich   |       1,117,566 |\n| Mike Gravel       |        238,745 |\n\nFrom this data, Mike Gravel has the least total receipts at 238,745.
