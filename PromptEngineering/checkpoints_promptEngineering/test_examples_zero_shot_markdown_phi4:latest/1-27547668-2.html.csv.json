Identify episodes that aired in March.\n2. Check if there are exactly 5 such episodes.\n\n### Relevant Columns and Rows\n\nTo evaluate these conditions, the relevant columns from the table are:\n- **original airdate**: This column contains the date when each episode was first aired, which will help identify the month.\n- We do not need to consider other columns like title, directed by, etc., for this specific claim.\n\n### Steps to Verify\n\n1. **Extract Episodes Aired in March**:\n   - Look at the `original airdate` column and filter out the rows where the date falls in March 2010.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Episodes Aired in March**:\n   - Count these filtered episodes to see if there are exactly 5.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Row 7: \"March 3, 2010\" \u2192 This is in March.\n- Row 8: \"March 10, 2010\" \u2192 This is in March.\n- Row 9: \"March 17, 2010\" \u2192 This is in March.\n- Row 10: \"March 24, 2010\" \u2192 This is in March.\n- Row 11: \"March 31, 2010\" \u2192 This is in March.\n\nThere are exactly 5 episodes that aired in March. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there are exactly 5 episodes aired in March, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim are those under the `original airdate` column for rows with indices 7 through 11.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
