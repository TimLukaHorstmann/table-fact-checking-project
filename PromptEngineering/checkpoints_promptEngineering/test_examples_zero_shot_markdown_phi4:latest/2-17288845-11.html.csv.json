Here is the JSON object with the relevant cell:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"game 4.0 , series 1 - 4 be on april 25\", we need to verify the relevant details from the table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n\n1. **Game Number**: The claim states game 4.0, which implies Game 4.\n2. **Series Score**: It claims a series score of 1 - 4.\n3. **Date**: The date mentioned is April 25.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n- **Row for Game 4**:\n  - Check the row where `game` is 4.\n  - Relevant data: \n    - Date should be April 25.\n    - Series score should be 1 - 3 (as it's after Game 4, the series score would have been updated to 1 - 4 only if the opponent team won another game).\n\n- **Date Verification**:\n  - The date in the row for Game 4 is indeed April 25.\n\n- **Series Score Verification**:\n  - In the table, after Game 4, the series score is listed as 1 - 3.\n  - A series score of 1 - 4 would only be correct if there were a fifth game played and lost by Dallas. Since we are only checking Game 4, the series score should still be 1 - 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the series score as 1 - 4 for Game 4 on April 25. The correct series score after Game 4 is 1 - 3.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding game 4 in the provided table, we need to verify two specific conditions mentioned in the claim: \n\n1. The location attendance for game 4 is \"at&t center 20491\".\n2. The series score for game 4 is \"1 - 1\".\n\nLet's check these conditions against the relevant entries in the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the row corresponding to game 4.\n\n- According to the table, game 4 corresponds to the fourth row.\n\n**Step 2:** Verify the location attendance for game 4.\n\n- From the table, for game 4:\n  - The \"location attendance\" is listed as \"american airlines center 20829\".\n- The claim states that the location attendance should be \"at&t center 20491\".\n- Clearly, these two values do not match.\n\n**Step 3:** Verify the series score for game 4.\n\n- From the table, for game 4:\n  - The \"series\" is listed as \"1 - 3\".\n- The claim states that the series should be \"1 - 1\".\n- Again, these two values do not match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are false when compared with the data from the table. Therefore, the overall claim about game 4 is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nTo support this conclusion, we identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For location attendance of game 4:\n  - Row index: 3 (game 4)\n  - Column name: \"location attendance\"\n  \n- For series score of game 4:\n  - Row index: 3 (game 4)\n  - Column name: \"series\"\n\nHere is the JSON response with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
