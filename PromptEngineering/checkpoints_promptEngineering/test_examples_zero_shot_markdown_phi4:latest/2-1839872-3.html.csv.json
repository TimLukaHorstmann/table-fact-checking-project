    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two main components: the name and the employment years for Clive Thomas.\n\n1. **Verify Name**: The claim mentions \"woosman , clive thomas\", but in the table, it is listed as \"woosnam , clive thomas\". This discrepancy means that the name does not match exactly.\n\n2. **Employment Years Verification**: We need to verify if Clive Thomas was employed from 1970 to 1996.\n   - According to the table under column \"employed\", for Clive Thomas, it states: \"1970 - 2005\". \n   - The claim says he was employed from 1970 to 1996. While these years overlap and include the range claimed (1970-1996), they are not exactly the same.\n\nSince the name does not match exactly and the employment years do not fully correspond, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE based on both discrepancies.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n1. **Row Index 4**: This row contains information about Clive Thomas.\n   - Column \"name\" to verify the name discrepancy.\n   - Column \"employed\" to check employment years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"employed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
