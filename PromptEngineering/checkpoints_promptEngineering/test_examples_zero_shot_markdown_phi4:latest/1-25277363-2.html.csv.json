    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"bob sand write episode 149,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The episode number (both series and season) should be 149.\n2. Bob Sand is listed as the writer for that episode.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions against the given table:\n\n1. **Episode Number Check:**\n   - From the \"no in series\" column, we see that the entry with a value of 149 corresponds to the row where:\n     - The title is \"fast friends.\"\n     - Directed by John Tracy.\n     - Original air date is October 12, 1993.\n\n2. **Writer Check:**\n   - From the \"written by\" column for the same row (no in series = 149), it lists \"bob sand.\"\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied\u2014episode number 149 corresponds to an entry where Bob Sand is listed as a writer\u2014the claim is verified as true.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells:\n\n- Row index: The table starts from index 0. For episode number 149, the row index is 4.\n- Relevant columns:\n  - \"no in series\" should be checked to ensure it matches 149 (row index 4).\n  - \"written by\" should confirm that Bob Sand is listed as a writer for this row (row index 4).\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row index 4, column name \"no in series\"\n2. Row index 4, column name \"written by\"\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The episode number within the series.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Episode Title:**\n   - The column containing the titles is labeled \"title\".\n\n2. **Identify the Row for the Given Series Number:**\n   - We are looking for the row where \"no in series\" is 148, as per the claim.\n\n3. **Check if the Title Matches:**\n   - Once we locate the row with \"no in series\" as 148, we need to check if the title in that row matches \"tough love\".\n\n### Verification:\n\n- Locate the row where \"no in series\" is 148.\n- Check the value in the \"title\" column for this row.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The row with \"no in series\" = 148 has the following values:\n  - \"title\": tough love\n  - This matches the claim exactly.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
