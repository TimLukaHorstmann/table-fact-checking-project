The goal differences associated with these draws.\n\nThe claim specifies that there should be only two instances where a team drew and had specific goal differences: \"34 - 25\" and \"36 - 29\".\n\nLet's break down the steps to verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Draws**: We need to find all rows in the table where the 'drawn' column has a value greater than zero, indicating that there was at least one draw.\n\n2. **Check Goal Differences for These Rows**: For each row identified in step 1, we must check if the goal difference matches either \"34 - 25\" or \"36 - 29\".\n\n3. **Count Matching Occurrences**: Count how many of these rows have the specified goal differences.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - 'drawn' = 1\n  - 'goal difference' = \"34 - 25\"\n  \n- **Row 4**:\n  - 'drawn' = 1\n  - 'goal difference' = \"36 - 29\"\n\nBoth Row 3 and Row 4 satisfy the conditions of having a draw and matching one of the specified goal differences. There are no other rows with draws that match either \"34 - 25\" or \"36 - 29\".\n\nThus, there are exactly two occasions where a team drew and had these specific goal differences.\n\nThe claim is therefore TRUE.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
