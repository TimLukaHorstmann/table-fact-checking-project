    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"all but 2 incumbent house representatives for Pennsylvania be re-elected in 2012,\" we need to verify how many incumbents lost their elections and whether this number is indeed two.\n\nThe relevant column for our evaluation is the \"result\" column, which shows whether an incumbent was re-elected or not. Additionally, since the claim pertains to the year 2012, we should focus on rows where incumbents were first elected before or during that period (i.e., they could be running in 2012).\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Incumbent: Bob Brady; Result: Re-elected\n2. **Row 1**: Incumbent: Glenn Thompson; Result: Re-elected\n3. **Row 2**: Incumbent: Jim Gerlach; Result: Re-elected\n4. **Row 3**: Incumbent: Pat Meehan; Result: Re-elected\n5. **Row 4**: Incumbent: Bill Shuster; Result: Re-elected\n6. **Row 5**: Incumbent: Tom Marino; Result: Re-elected\n7. **Row 6**: Incumbent: Lou Barletta; Result: Re-elected\n8. **Row 7**: Incumbent: Mark Critz; Result: Lost re-election\n9. **Row 8**: Jason Altmire, a different incumbent from the same district (Pennsylvania 12), is listed as having lost renomination.\n10. **Row 9**: Incumbent: Allyson Schwartz; Result: Re-elected\n11. **Row 10**: Incumbent: Mike Doyle; Result: Re-elected\n12. **Row 11**: Incumbent: Charlie Dent; Result: Re-elected\n\nFrom the table, we identify two instances where incumbents were not re-elected or lost renomination:\n- Row 7 (Mark Critz) indicates a Republican gain.\n- Row 8 (Jason Altmire) shows he did not retain his seat through renomination.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two cases where incumbents did not get re-elected.
