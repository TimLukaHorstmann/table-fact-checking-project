    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Utah Jazz play 15 games during March 2009 and finish at the end with a 46 - 28 record,\" we need to verify two conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. The number of games played by Utah Jazz in March 2009.\n2. Their final record at the end of those games.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Number of Games Played\n- The games are listed with sequential game numbers (60 to 74) and corresponding dates for March 2009.\n- We need to count how many games are recorded from March 1, 2009, to March 31, 2009.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Game numbers range from 60 to 74, inclusive.\n- Dates cover all days in March 2009: March 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, 24, 25, 28, 30, and 31.\n\nCounting these dates, we find there are indeed 15 games played by Utah Jazz in March 2009.\n\n### Condition 2: Final Record\n- The record column shows the cumulative wins and losses after each game.\n- We need to check the final entry for the month of March to see if it matches a 46 - 28 record.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The last entry (row 74) has the date \"march 31\" with a record of \"46 - 28\".\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied based on the table data.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the Utah Jazz's performance during March 2009, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Number of Games Played**: The claim states that the Utah Jazz played 14 games in March 2009.\n2. **Record at Month End**: The record should be 45 wins and 27 losses by the end of March.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the table to verify these conditions:\n\n### Number of Games\n- We need to count the number of games listed from March 1 to March 31.\n- From the table, we see there are 14 game entries within this date range (from Game 60 on March 1 to Game 73 on March 30).\n\n### Record at Month End\n- The record column shows the cumulative wins and losses after each game.\n- After Game 73 on March 30, the record is listed as \"46 - 27\".\n- This indicates 46 wins and 27 losses by the end of March.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The Utah Jazz played 14 games in March, matching the claim.\n- Their record at the end of March was 46 - 27, not 45 - 27. Therefore, the second condition does not match the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the record is incorrect according to the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo support this evaluation, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n- All rows (game entries) for March are relevant to count the games.\n- The \"record\" column on March 30th (Game 73) is specifically checked to verify the end-of-month record.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 59, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 72, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 73, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
