    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify all titles written by Gerald Sanford.\n2. Among those titles, find the one with the earliest original air date.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Titles Written by Gerald Sanford:**\n   - Scan through the \"written by\" column and list entries that include Gerald Sanford's name:\n     - Row 47: \"Knight of the drones (part 1)\" - written by Robert Foster & Gerald Sanford\n     - Row 48: \"Knight of the drones (part 2)\" - written by Robert Foster & Gerald Sanford\n     - Row 49: \"The ice bandits\" - written by Gerald Sanford\n     - Row 53: \"The rotten apples\" - written by Gerald Sanford & Peter L. Dixon\n     - Row 63: \"The nineteenth hole\" - written by Gerald Sanford & Robert Foster\n\n2. **Determine the Earliest Release Date Among These Titles:**\n   - Extract and compare the \"original air date\" for these titles:\n     - Row 47: September 30, 1984 (\"Knight of the drones (part 1)\")\n     - Row 48: September 30, 1984 (\"Knight of the drones (part 2)\")\n     - **Row 49: October 7, 1984 (\"The ice bandits\")**\n     - Row 53: November 11, 1984 (\"The rotten apples\")\n     - Row 63: March 10, 1985 (\"The nineteenth hole\")\n\n3. **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n   - The earliest date among the titles written by Gerald Sanford is September 30, 1984.\n   - \"Knight of the drones (part 1)\" and \"Knight of the drones (part 2)\" both have this date, which precedes October 7, 1984 for \"The ice bandits.\"\n   - Therefore, \"The ice bandits\" does not have the earliest release date among titles written by Gerald Sanford.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is **FALSE**.

Determine which title has the second-highest \"no in series.\"\n\nLet's examine these steps using the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step 1: Locate \"knight in retreat\"\n\n- Look through the \"title\" column to find the row where the title is \"knight in retreat.\"\n- The relevant entry for this title is:\n\n  | no in series | no in season | title              | directed by    | written by | original air date | production code |\n  |--------------|--------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n  | 66           | 20           | knight in retreat  | roy campanella ii | gerald sanford | march 29, 1985   | 58642          |\n\nFrom this row, we see that \"knight in retreat\" has a \"no in series\" of 66.\n\n### Step 2: Find the second-highest \"no in series\"\n\n- List all unique \"no in series\" values to determine their order.\n- From the table, these are:\n\n  - 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, **66**, 67\n\n- Sorting these values in descending order gives:\n\n  - 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47\n\n- The second-highest value in this sorted list is 66.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe title \"knight in retreat\" does indeed have the second-highest \"no in series\" at 66.
