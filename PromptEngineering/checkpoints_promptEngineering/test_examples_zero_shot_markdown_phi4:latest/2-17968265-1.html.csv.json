This is the second row in the table (row index 1).\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - The claim pertains to the season \"1987 - 88\".\n   - Find the column labeled \"1987 - 88\" which corresponds to this season.\n\n4. **Verify the Claimed Value:**\n   - Check the cell at the intersection of row index 1 and the column \"1987 - 88\".\n   - The value in this cell is \"55\".\n\nSince the value in the relevant cell matches the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to verify each condition against the table data:\n\n1. **Condition: \"114 be play when point be 107\"**\n   - We need to find a team that played 114 matches and scored 107 points.\n   - Check the \"points\" column for the value 107:\n     - No entry in the \"points\" column has a value of 107. All values are either higher or lower.\n\n2. **Condition: \"when 1987 - 88 be 31\"**\n   - We need to find a team that played 114 matches and scored exactly 31 points in the 1987-88 season.\n   - Check the \"1987 - 88\" column for the value 31:\n     - Racing de C\u00f3rdoba has 31 points in the 1987-88 season (row index 12).\n     - Ferro Carril Oeste also has 31 points in the 1987-88 season (row index 13).\n\n3. **Verify \"114 be play\" for these teams:**\n   - Racing de C\u00f3rdoba (row index 12) played 114 matches.\n   - Ferro Carril Oeste (row index 13) also played 114 matches.\n\nHowever, neither of these teams has 107 points overall, so the first condition is not met by any team.
