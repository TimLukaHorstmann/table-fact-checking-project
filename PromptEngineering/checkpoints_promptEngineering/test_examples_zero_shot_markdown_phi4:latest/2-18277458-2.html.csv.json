    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the lowest ticket price be 17.50,\" we need to examine the column related to ticket prices in the provided table. The relevant data is found under the \"Ticket Price\" column, which lists multiple prices for each event.\n\nHere's how to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify All Ticket Prices**: Extract all the ticket prices from the table.\n   - Dates with single price entries: 17.50, 15, 13, 20, 18.5, etc.\n   - Dates with multiple price entries: 75/25/19.50/15.50, 20/18/15, 18.50/16.50, etc.\n\n2. **Find the Minimum Price**: From these prices, identify the lowest one.\n   - Prices from single-entry rows: The smallest is 13 (Syracuse, NY on September 3, 1987).\n   - Prices from multi-entry rows:\n     - For \"75/25/19.50/15.50\" (Irvine, CA), the lowest price is 15.50.\n     - For \"20/18/15\" (Albuquerque, NM), the lowest price is 15.\n     - For \"18.50/16.50\" (Mountain View, CA and Inglewood, CA), the lowest price is 16.50.\n\n3. **Determine the Overall Minimum**: Compare all the minimum prices from both single and multi-entry rows to find the absolute smallest ticket price in the table.\n   - The overall minimum price is 13, which occurs on September 3, 1987, in Syracuse, NY.\n\nSince 17.50 is not the lowest price (the lowest being 13), the claim is false.\n\nNow, list the relevant cells to verify this conclusion:\n\n- \"Syracuse, New York\" with a ticket price of 15/13.\n- The multi-price entry \"75/25/19.50/15.50\" from Irvine, CA (relevant because it includes 15.50).\n- The multi-price entry \"20/18/15\" from Albuquerque, NM (relevant because it includes 15).\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
