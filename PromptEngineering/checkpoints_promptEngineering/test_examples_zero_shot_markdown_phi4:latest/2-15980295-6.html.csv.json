    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table according to the claim: \n\nThe claim states: \"the singular if the plural be xweer (a) du be tlanka.\"\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n1. Identify when the plural form is \"xweer (a) du\".\n2. Check what the corresponding singular form for this plural form is.\n3. Verify whether that singular form corresponds to \"tlanka\".\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- **Row 7** contains the entry with the plural form \"xweer (a) du\". The corresponding singular form listed in column \"singular\" for this row is \"xweera\".\n\nNow, we compare this information against what the claim states:\n- According to the table, when the plural is \"xweer (a) du\", the singular is \"xweera\".\n- The claim asserts that the singular should be \"tlanka\". However, based on our examination of the table, it is actually \"xweera\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the singular corresponding to the plural \"xweer (a) du\" is not \"tlanka\", but \"xweera\".\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Row 7: Plural form (\"plural\") column contains \"xweer (a) du\".\n- Row 7: Singular form (\"singular\") column contains \"xweera\".\n\nNow, let's format this into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"plural\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"singular\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of row indices:\n- Row 7 in the table corresponds to index 6 because indexing typically starts from zero.",
