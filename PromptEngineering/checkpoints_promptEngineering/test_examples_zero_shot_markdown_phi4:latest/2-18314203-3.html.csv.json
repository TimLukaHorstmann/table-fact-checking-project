    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Germany have 0 golds, but 5 silvers,\" we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table: the number of gold and silver medals for Germany.\n\n1. **Gold Medals for Germany**:\n   - We locate Germany in the table, which is at row index 7.\n   - Check the \"gold\" column for this row. The value is `0`.\n   \n2. **Silver Medals for Germany**:\n   - Using the same row (index 7), we check the \"silver\" column.\n   - The value here is `5`.\n\nThe claim states that Germany has `0` gold medals and `5` silver medals, which matches exactly with what we have found in the table. Therefore, both conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row index 7, column \"gold\"\n- Row index 7, column \"silver\"\n\nGiven that all parts of the claim align perfectly with the data from these cells, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
