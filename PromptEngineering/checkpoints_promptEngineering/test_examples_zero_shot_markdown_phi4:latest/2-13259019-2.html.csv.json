Identify the row(s) where the \"game site\" is \"Soldier Field.\"\n2. Verify that in those rows, the \"result\" column reads \"w 31 - 29.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row Index 10**: \n  - The \"date\" is November 5, 1978.\n  - The \"opponent\" is Chicago Bears.\n  - The \"game site\" is listed as Soldier Field.\n  - The \"result\" shows a win (w) with a score of 31 - 29.\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions of the claim. Therefore, the result at Soldier Field was indeed 31 - 29.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
