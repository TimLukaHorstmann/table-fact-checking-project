    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, we need to check whether Kardinia Park was one of three venues where the home team's score was higher than the away team's score.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The first step is to look at each row in the table and compare the home team scores with the away team scores.\n\n2. **Compare Scores for Each Row:**\n   - Row 0: Home Team Score (Geelong) = 13.12 (90), Away Team Score (Hawthorn) = 7.6 (48)\n     - 90 > 48, so Kardinia Park qualifies as a venue where the home team scored higher.\n   - Row 1: Home Team Score (Collingwood) = 12.16 (88), Away Team Score (South Melbourne) = 13.12 (90)\n     - 88 < 90, does not qualify.\n   - Row 2: Home Team Score (Carlton) = 10.16 (76), Away Team Score (Essendon) = 11.14 (80)\n     - 76 < 80, does not qualify.\n   - Row 3: Home Team Score (Richmond) = 10.18 (78), Away Team Score (Melbourne) = 15.4 (94)\n     - 78 < 94, does not qualify.\n   - Row 4: Home Team Score (North Melbourne) = 9.14 (68), Away Team Score (Footscray) = 9.14 (68)\n     - 68 = 68, does not qualify.\n   - Row 5: Home Team Score (St Kilda) = 13.14 (92), Away Team Score (Fitzroy) = 9.15 (69)\n     - 92 > 69, qualifies as a venue where the home team scored higher.\n\n3. **Count Venues Where Home Team Scored Higher:**\n   - From the above comparisons, Kardinia Park (Row 0) and Junction Oval (Row 5) are venues where the home team's score was higher than the away team\u2019s score.\n   - We need three such venues to satisfy the claim.\n\n4. **Determine If Claim Is True or False:**\n   - Only two venues (Kardinia Park and Junction Oval) meet the criteria, not three as required by the claim.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells are where we compared scores:\n     - Row 0: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n     - Row 1: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n     - Row 2: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n     - Row 3: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n     - Row 4: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n     - Row 5: \"home team score\", \"away team score\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. Here is the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
