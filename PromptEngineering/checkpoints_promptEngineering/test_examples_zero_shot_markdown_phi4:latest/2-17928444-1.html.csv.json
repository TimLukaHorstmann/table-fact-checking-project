These weeks should have the lowest attendance among all games listed.\n\nLet's examine the relevant columns: \"week\", \"game site\", and \"attendance\".\n\n### Step 1: Check Game Sites\n- **Week 1**: Opponent - San Diego Chargers, Game Site - Mile High Stadium (Relevant Cell: Row 0, Column \"game site\")\n- **Week 2**: Opponent - San Francisco 49ers, Game Site - Mile High Stadium (Relevant Cell: Row 1, Column \"game site\")\n- **Week 10**: Opponent - Seattle Seahawks, Game Site - Mile High Stadium (Relevant Cell: Row 2, Column \"game site\")\n\nAll specified weeks are indeed played at Mile High Stadium.\n\n### Step 2: Check Attendance\nWe need to compare the attendance figures for all games and identify the lowest attendances:\n\n- **Week 1**: Attendance - 73,564 (Relevant Cell: Row 0, Column \"attendance\")\n- **Week 2**: Attendance - 73,899 (Relevant Cell: Row 1, Column \"attendance\")\n- **Week 10**: Attendance - 73,996 (Relevant Cell: Row 2, Column \"attendance\")\n\nNow, compare these attendances with all other games:\n\n- **Week 3**: Not listed\n- **Week 4**: Not listed\n- **Week 5**: Not listed\n- **Week 6**: Not listed\n- **Week 7**: Not listed\n- **Week 8**: Not listed\n- **Week 9**: Not listed\n- **Week 11**: Attendance - 47,629 (Relevant Cell: Row 3, Column \"attendance\")\n- **Week 12**: Attendance - 73,984 (Relevant Cell: Row 4, Column \"attendance\")\n- **Week 13**: Game not at Mile High Stadium\n- **Week 14**: Attendance - 74,192 (Relevant Cell: Row 5, Column \"attendance\")\n- **Week 15**: Game not at Mile High Stadium\n- **Week 16**: Game not at Mile High Stadium\n\nThe lowest attendance is for Week 11 with 47,629 attendees. Weeks 1, 2, and 10 do not have the lowest attendances.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim that Weeks 1, 2, and 10 had the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding attendance in the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant data from each game listed:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column \"attendance\" is crucial as it contains the figures for the number of people attending each game.\n\n2. **Check Week 16 Attendance**: According to the claim, week 16 has an attendance of 74192. Let's verify this:\n   - Row for week 16: | 16 | january 2 | seattle seahawks    | l 11 - 13 | kingdome                      | 2 - 7    |        43145 |\n   - The attendance listed is 43145, not 74192.\n\n3. **Determine the Least Attendance**: To verify if week 16 had the least attendance:\n   - List of attendances from each row: \n     - Week 1: 73564\n     - Week 2: 73899\n     - Week 10: 73996\n     - Week 11: 47629\n     - Week 12: 73984\n     - Week 13: 48112\n     - Week 14: 74192\n     - Week 15: 44160\n     - Week 16: 43145\n\n   - The smallest attendance is in week 16 with 43145.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The claim incorrectly states the attendance for week 16 as 74192, whereas it's actually 43145.\n   - Despite this incorrect figure, week 16 does indeed have the lowest attendance of all listed games.\n\nThus, while the specific number in the claim is incorrect, the conclusion that week 16 had the least attendance is correct. The overall claim is therefore misleading due to the wrong figure given for week 16's attendance but ends up being factually true regarding the comparison.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Attendance figures from all weeks (rows 1 through 9) in the \"attendance\" column.\n- Specifically, row 8 (\"week 15\") and row 9 (\"week 16\") for verifying which is the lowest attendance.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
