    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Olimpia is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table and verify each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Team Name**: The claim states \"olimpia\" in position 10.\n   - According to the table, row with `position` 10 corresponds to the team \"olimpia\". This part of the claim is consistent.\n\n2. **Position**: The claim mentions Olimpia being in position 10.\n   - From the table, Olimpia is indeed listed in `position` 10. This confirms the positional aspect of the claim.\n\n3. **Number of Wins**: The claim asserts that Olimpia has 2 wins.\n   - In the same row (row with `position` 10), the `wins` column indicates a value of 2, which matches the claim about the number of wins.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the table:\n\n- Olimpia is in position 10.\n- Olimpia has 2 wins.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table that support this verification include:\n- The row with `position` 10 for team name, position, and number of wins.\n- Specifically, these cells are: \n  - Team name (`team`) at `row_index` 9\n  - Position (`position`) at `row_index` 9\n  - Wins (`wins`) at `row_index` 9\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table with respect to the statement provided: \"the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - We are asked about teams that have a \"position higher than 10,\" which refers to those ranked above 10th place in the standings.\n   - The term \"total number score\" is ambiguous, but it likely means the sum of their goals scored (\"scored\" column) and possibly conceded (\"conceded\" column). However, without explicit mention, we will assume it primarily refers to the \"scored\" column unless otherwise indicated.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Teams**:\n   - Teams with a position higher than 10 are those ranked in positions 1 through 9.\n\n3. **Extracting Necessary Data**:\n   - We need to look at the \"scored\" column for teams ranked from 1 to 9 and check if their total is zero.\n\n4. **Summing Up Scores**:\n   - For position 1 (Cerro Porte\u00f1o): Scored = 30\n   - For position 2 (Guaran\u00ed): Scored = 21\n   - For position 3 (Nacional): Scored = 25\n   - For position 4 (3 de Febrero): Scored = 24\n   - For position 5 (12 de Octubre): Scored = 22\n   - For position 6 (Tacuary): Scored = 24\n   - For position 7 (Libertad): Scored = 21\n   - For position 8 (Sportivo Luque\u00f1o): Scored = 20\n   - For position 9 (General Caballero ZC): Scored = 16\n\n5. **Calculating the Total**:\n   - Adding these values: 30 + 21 + 25 + 24 + 22 + 24 + 21 + 20 + 16 = 203\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total number score (based on goals scored) of teams with a position higher than 10 is 203, which is not zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - We need to consider all the \"scored\" column values from rows 0 to 8 to verify this calculation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"scored\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
