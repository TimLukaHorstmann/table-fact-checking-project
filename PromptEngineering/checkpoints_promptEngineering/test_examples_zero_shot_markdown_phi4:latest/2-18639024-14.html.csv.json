A player is considered no longer active if their \"years\" do not extend to the present.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant entries:\n\n1. **Enza Barilla:**\n   - Row Index: 2\n   - Column Name: \"years\"\n   - Value in Cell: \"2008 - present\"\n   This indicates that Enza Barilla is still active, as her activity extends to the present time.\n\n2. **Snez Veljanovska:**\n   - Row Index: 39\n   - Column Name: \"years\"\n   - Value in Cell: \"2010 - present\"\n   This indicates that Snez Veljanovska is also still active, as her activity extends to the present time.\n\nBoth players are listed with activity extending to \"present,\" which means they are currently active. Therefore, the claim that Enza Barilla and Snez Veljanovska are no longer active is FALSE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
