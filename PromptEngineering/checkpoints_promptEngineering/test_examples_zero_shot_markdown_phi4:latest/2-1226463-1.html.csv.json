Jackie Oliver did not compete with this team, so these do not count.\n\n- **Row for 1970**:\n  - Two rows: One is \"owen racing organisation\" and the other is \"yardley team brm\", neither of which had Jackie Oliver as a driver.\n\n- **Rows for 1971**:\n  - Both entries are under \"bruce mclaren motor racing\". Jackie Oliver was not associated with McLaren during this time.\n\n- **Row for 1972**:\n  - The entry is \"marlboro brm\", and Jackie Oliver did not race with Brabham in the Formula 1 championship during 1972, as he retired from F1 at the end of 1973 after participating only in a few races that year.\n\n- **Rows for 1973**:\n  - The entry is \"uop shadow racing team\". Jackie Oliver raced with Shadow in 1973.\n  \n- **Row for 1977**:\n  - The entry is \"shadow racing team\", which suggests the same team as in 1973. However, by this time, Jackie Oliver had long retired from Formula 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on historical data and the table entries:\n\n- Jackie Oliver raced with Lotus (1967-1968) and Shadow (1973).\n- He did not compete consistently through all years mentioned or with any other teams listed in the table.\n\nGiven that he participated only during specific periods, primarily with two different teams, it is unlikely he competed in 13 races from 1967 to 1977 based solely on this data. Historical records indicate his active participation was limited and ended by 1973.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Jackie Oliver competed in 13 races from 1967 - 1977\" cannot be verified as true with the given table information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to find if Jackie Oliver is associated with driving any vehicle in the table.\n2. **Vehicle**: It specifies a \"brm p153\" chassis, which we will look for in the table under the \"chassis\" column.\n3. **Engine**: The claim also mentions a \"brm v12 engine\", which corresponds to an entry in the \"engine\" column of the table.\n4. **Frequency**: The driver must have driven this specific combination (\"brm p153\" with \"brm v12\") two times, as stated in the claim.\n\n### Verification Process\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**:\n   - We need to check entries with \"chassis\" = \"brm p153\" and \"engine\" = \"brm v12\".\n   \n2. **Examine Each Entry for Additional Details**:\n   - Look at all rows where both the chassis is \"brm p153\" and engine is \"brm v12\".\n\n3. **Check Associated Driver**:\n   - Verify if Jackie Oliver is mentioned in any capacity (like in the entrant) for these entries.\n   \n4. **Frequency Check**:\n   - Ensure this combination occurs exactly twice.\n\n### Table Analysis\n\n- Relevant rows based on \"chassis\" and \"engine\":\n  - Row index 7: chassis = \"brm p153\", engine = \"brm v12\"\n  - Row index 8: chassis = \"brm p153\", engine = \"brm v12\"\n\n- Check the entrant for these rows:\n  - Row index 7: Entrant is \"owen racing organisation\".\n  - Row index 8: Entrant is \"yardley team brm\".\n\nIn neither of these entries is Jackie Oliver mentioned as a driver. The table does not specify drivers, only teams (entrants) and vehicle specifications.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that Jackie Oliver drove a BRM P153 with a BRM V12 engine two times cannot be substantiated by the data in the table since there's no mention of Jackie Oliver being associated with either entry for those specific conditions.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Jackie Oliver's last race was with Lotus Components Ltd,\" we need to consider the information available in the table and general knowledge about Jackie Oliver's career.\n\n1. **Table Analysis**:\n   - The table lists various racing teams, chassis, engines, and points for specific years.\n   - For 1967, \"Lotus Components Ltd\" is listed as an entrant with a Lotus 48 (F2) chassis and a Cosworth straight-4 engine.\n\n2. **Jackie Oliver's Career**:\n   - Jackie Oliver was a British racing driver known for his participation in Formula One during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n   - His last race as a Formula One driver is historically recorded as being with Shadow Racing Team at the Italian Grand Prix in 1977.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The table does not provide any direct information about Jackie Oliver or his specific races.\n   - There is no entry for Jackie Oliver racing with Lotus Components Ltd, and his last known race was with Shadow Racing Team in 1977.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim that \"Jackie Oliver's last race was with Lotus Components Ltd\" is not supported by the table data or historical records.
