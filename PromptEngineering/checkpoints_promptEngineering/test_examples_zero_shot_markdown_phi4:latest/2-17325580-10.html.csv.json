Game 81: Win (117 - 109)\n\nNow, check the winning team's score for each of these games:\n\n- Game 77: Winning team scored 101 points.\n- Game 78: Winning team scored 98 points.\n- Game 79: Winning team scored 102 points.\n- Game 80: Winning team scored 107 points.\n- Game 81: Winning team scored 117 points.\n\nCount the number of games where the winning score was under 100:\n\n- Only Game 78 has a winning score under 100 (98 points).\n\nThere are 5 wins in total, and only 1 of them has a winning score under 100.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to examine the relevant data in the table concerning assists per game.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. The highest number of assists per game is 11.\n2. The lowest number of assists per game is 4.\n3. Both extremes are scored by Darnell Jackson.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n- **Column of Interest**: We focus on \"high assists\" to identify the highest and lowest values.\n- **Identifying Extremes**:\n  - Scan through each row in the \"high assists\" column.\n  - Identify both the maximum and minimum values, as well as the players who achieved them.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\n1. **Row 1**: LeBron James (7)  \n2. **Row 2**: LeBron James (5)\n3. **Row 3**: LeBron James (6)\n4. **Row 4**: LeBron James (7)\n5. **Row 5**: LeBron James (10)\n6. **Row 6**: LeBron James (7)\n7. **Row 7**: Maurice Williams (8)\n8. **Row 8**: Wally Szczerbiak (8)\n\n- **Maximum Assists**: The highest value is 10 by LeBron James in row 5.\n- **Minimum Assists**: The lowest value is 5 by LeBron James in row 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states the maximum assists per game should be 11 and the minimum should be 4, both scored by Darnell Jackson. However, from our analysis, the actual highest number of assists recorded is 10 by LeBron James, not 11, and there is no record of a player scoring only 4 assists.\n- Additionally, Darnell Jackson does not appear in the \"high assists\" column at all.\n\nThe claim is therefore **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n1. Row 2: Minimum assists (5) by LeBron James.\n2. Row 5: Maximum assists (10) by LeBron James.\n3. Row 8: Assists of 8, showing that Wally Szczerbiak has recorded a high value but not the extremes mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
