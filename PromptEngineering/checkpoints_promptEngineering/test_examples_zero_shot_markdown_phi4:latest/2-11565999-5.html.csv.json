The relevant cells to verify this are those containing the row index corresponding to track 9 and the columns \"track\" and \"song title.\"\n\nThe following JSON object represents the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that the claim is true and specifies which cells were checked to verify it.",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"track 23 have a title: just a little bit\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Track Number in Question**: The claim refers to \"track 23.\" In the context of this table, it means looking at row index 22 (since tables are typically zero-indexed for such operations) to get information about track number 23.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Information**:\n   - We focus on two columns: \"track\" and \"song title.\"\n   - The \"track\" column will help us confirm that we are examining the correct track.\n   - The \"song title\" column is crucial because it provides the information needed to verify or refute the claim.\n\n3. **Examine Row Index 22**:\n   - At row index 22, check the value in the \"track\" column: It should be 23 to confirm we're looking at track 23.\n   - Check the value in the \"song title\" column for track 23: The song title listed here is the information needed to verify the claim.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - According to the table, row index 22 corresponds to track 23 with a \"song title\" of \"he'll have to go.\"\n   - The claim states that the song title for track 23 should be \"just a little bit.\"\n\n5. **Determine the Truth Value**:\n   - Since the actual song title for track 23 is \"he'll have to go,\" which does not match the claimed title of \"just a little bit,\" the statement in the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**: For verification, the relevant cells are at row index 22 (corresponding to track 23) and involve checking both the \"track\" and \"song title\" columns.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON output reflecting this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
