To verify this, we will:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to the year 2008.\n2. Check if the competition mentioned is \"summer olympics\".\n3. Verify that the venue matches as expected (though not directly needed for verification since it's implicit from other fields).\n4. Confirm that the position stated in the table is indeed \"7th (heats)\".\n\nNow, let's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the row with year 2008:**\n   - Row 7 has the year as 2008.\n\n2. **Check competition for this row:**\n   - The competition listed is \"summer olympics\", which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Verify position in this row:**\n   - The position mentioned is indeed \"7th (heats)\", which aligns with what's stated in the claim.\n\n4. **Confirm any additional relevant information:**\n   - While not necessary for verifying the specific claim, it is worth noting that the notes column indicates a 5000 m event.\n\nSince all components of the claim are satisfied by examining row 7 of the table, the claim can be determined as TRUE.\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this conclusion and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
