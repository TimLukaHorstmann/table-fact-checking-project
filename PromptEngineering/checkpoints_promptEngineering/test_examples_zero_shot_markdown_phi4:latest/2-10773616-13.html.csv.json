The condition \"when south melbourne be the away team\" is already false, making the entire claim FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nTo determine this, we only needed to check the \"away team\" column for South Melbourne:\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Column \"away team\": Essendon (South Melbourne is home team)\n  \nThus, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 4, Column name \"away team\"\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
