    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions: \n1. The rider ranked 12th on June 3rd.\n2. That this rider has a time of \"18'19.47\" and a speed of \"123.539 mph\".\n\nFirstly, we'll identify the row corresponding to rank 12 in the table. This is straightforward because the \"rank\" column indicates that row index 11 (considering zero-based indexing) represents rank 12.\n\nNext, we focus on verifying the details for June 3rd for this rider:\n- The \"wed 3 june\" column contains both time and speed data.\n  \nLooking at the table for row with `row_index` 11 under the column \"wed 3 june\":\n- We find the entry as \"18'19.47 123.539 mph\".\n\nThis matches the claim regarding both the time (\"18'19.47\") and speed (\"123.539 mph\").\n\nTherefore, all conditions in the claim are verified and supported by the data.\n\nHere is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"wed 3 june\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
