    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, let's break down the relevant components of the claim:\n\nThe claim states: \"the first place tie be between Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman and Frank Nobilo.\"\n\nWe need to verify if these players (Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, Frank Nobilo) are indeed tied for first place according to the table.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The column \"place\" indicates the ranking or placement of each player.\n- For a tie in first place, the \"place\" value should be \"t1\".\n\nLet's check the rows where Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo appear:\n\n1. **Duffy Waldorf** is at row index 11:\n   - Column \"place\": \"t9\"\n   \n2. **Jeff Sluman** is at row index 10:\n   - Column \"place\": \"t9\"\n\n3. **Frank Nobilo** is at row index 9:\n   - Column \"place\": \"t9\"\n\nFor all three players, the \"place\" value is \"t9\", not \"t1\". This indicates they are tied for ninth place, not first place.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include the \"place\" column for each of the mentioned players (Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, Frank Nobilo).\n\nThe JSON output will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
