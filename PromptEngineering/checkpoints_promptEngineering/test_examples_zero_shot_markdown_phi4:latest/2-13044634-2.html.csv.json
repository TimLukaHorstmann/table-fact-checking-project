    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute and 1 of 2 that take place in the united state.\"\n\nWe break down this claim into two conditions:\n\n1. **Condition 1:** \"The game against LC Davis is one of two games lasting 5 minutes.\"\n   - Check the `time` column for entries equal to \"5:00\".\n   - Identify how many such entries exist.\n\n2. **Condition 2:** \"The game against LC Davis is one of two that take place in the United States.\"\n   - Check the `location` column to find games with locations mentioning the \"united states\".\n   - Identify how many such entries exist.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n| res   | record   | opponent       | method                         | round | time   | location                                   |\n|:------|:---------|:---------------|:-------------------------------|--------:|:-------|:-------------------------------------------|\n| win   | 5 - 0    | cliff wright   | technical decision (unanimous) |      3 | 2:26   | hammond , indiana , united states          |\n| **win**   | **4 - 0**    | **lc davis**       | decision (split)               |      3 | **5:00**   | valparaiso , united states                 |\n| win   | 3 - 0    | jonatas novaes | decision (unanimous)           |      3 | **5:00**   | hoffman estates , illinois , united states |\n| win   | 2 - 0    | mark sinclair  | submission (rear naked choke)  |      1 | 1:22   | hammond , indiana , united states          |\n| win   | 1 - 0    | kori trussell  | submission (rear naked choke)  |      1 | 2:20   | hammond , indiana , united states          |\n\n#### Condition 1 Check:\n- LC Davis's game time is \"5:00\".\n- Other games with time \"5:00\": Jonatas Novaes.\n\nSo, there are exactly two games lasting 5 minutes (LC Davis and Jonatas Novaes).\n\n#### Condition 2 Check:\n- LC Davis's game location mentions the United States.\n- Other locations mentioning the United States: Cliff Wright, Jonatas Novaes, Mark Sinclair, Kori Trussell.\n\nSo, five games take place in the United States (Cliff Wright, LC Davis, Jonatas Novaes, Mark Sinclair, and Kori Trussell).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is partially true. The first condition holds true, but the second does not because there are more than two games that took place in the United States.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Condition 1:\n  - LC Davis's time: Row 2, Column `time`\n  - Jonatas Novaes's time: Row 3, Column `time`\n\n- For Condition 2:\n  - LC Davis's location: Row 2, Column `location`\n  - All locations mentioning the United States: Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Column `location`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the game against kori trussel be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission in 3 round,\" we need to check the following conditions based on the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a match against an opponent named \"kori trussell.\"\n2. Confirm that this match ended with a \"submission (rear naked choke).\"\n3. Check if the round for this match was indeed 3.\n4. Determine if there are exactly two matches in the table ending by a \"submission (rear naked choke)\" and verify their rounds.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row:\n\n- **Row Index 0:**\n  - Opponent: cliff wright\n  - Method: technical decision (unanimous)\n  - Round: 3\n\n- **Row Index 1:**\n  - Opponent: lc davis\n  - Method: decision (split)\n  - Round: 3\n\n- **Row Index 2:**\n  - Opponent: jonatas novaes\n  - Method: decision (unanimous)\n  - Round: 3\n\n- **Row Index 3:**\n  - Opponent: mark sinclair\n  - Method: submission (rear naked choke)\n  - Round: 1\n\n- **Row Index 4:**\n  - Opponent: kori trussell\n  - Method: submission (rear naked choke)\n  - Round: 1\n\n**Verification of the Claim:**\n\n1. The game against \"kori trussell\" is identified at row index 4.\n2. This match did end with a \"submission (rear naked choke)\" as shown in the method column for row index 4.\n3. However, this match took place in round 1, not 3, contradicting part of the claim.\n4. There are only two matches that ended by \"submission (rear naked choke)\": one against mark sinclair (round 1) and another against kori trussell (round 1).\n\nThe conditions for the claim to be true are not fully met as the game against \"kori trussell\" did not end in round 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim is FALSE.\n- Relevant cells for verification include those that specify opponent, method, and round details for each match:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
