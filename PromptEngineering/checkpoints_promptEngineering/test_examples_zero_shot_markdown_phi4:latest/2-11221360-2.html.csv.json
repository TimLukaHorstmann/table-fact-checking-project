    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"Hayate Usui be only 1 time defeat in round 3,\" we must analyze the table provided and focus on two aspects: \n\n1. Identifying whether Hayate Usui is mentioned as a participant, which is necessary for associating him with any recorded result.\n2. Checking if there is exactly one entry where Hayate Usui lost a fight that occurred in round 3.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identification of Participant:**\n   - The table provides results without explicitly naming the participants as \"Hayate Usui\" or otherwise; it only mentions opponents (e.g., Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura). Therefore, to determine if these rows are relevant, we need additional information that associates Hayate Usui with any of the opponent names.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Defeats in Round 3:**\n   - We look through the \"round\" column to find entries where the round is 3.\n   - Then, check those entries under the \"res\" (result) column to see if they are marked as a loss.\n\n### Reviewing Relevant Rows:\n\n- The table has two entries with fights in round 3:\n  - Row 2: Hayate Usui loses against Hiroshi Nakamura by unanimous decision.\n  - No other rows have round equal to 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there is only one instance where the result was a loss in round 3, if we assume that all these entries represent fights involving Hayate Usui:\n\n- The claim is consistent with this finding, as it states that Hayate Usui has been defeated only once in round 3.\n\nGiven our analysis of the table and assuming that the opponent names imply Hayate Usui was involved in every fight (as no explicit mention of his involvement exists), we can conclude that the statement is true based on available data. \n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere, Row Index 1 is the only row relevant to verifying this claim about round 3 defeats.",

We should focus on this column and identify which fights ended before 5:00 minutes (i.e., any duration less than 5:00).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1. Review each row in the \"time\" column to check if it is less than 5:00:\n   - The first few rows have times equal to 5:00, so they do not meet the condition.\n   - At row index 12 (Naosuke Mizoguchi fight), the time is 2:38. This fight ended before 5 minutes.\n   - At row index 13 (Takeshi Inoue fight), the time is 4:58. This fight ended before 5 minutes.\n   - At row index 15 (Seigi Fujioka fight), the time is 5:00, so it does not meet the condition.\n   - At row index 16 (Takeshi Matsushita fight), the time is 5:00, so it does not meet the condition.\n   - At row index 18 (Hiroyuki Takaya fight), the time is 2:06. This fight ended before 5 minutes.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- There are three fights that ended before 5 minutes: rows 12, 13, and 18.\n\nSince we need exactly four such instances to satisfy the claim but only found three, the claim is false.\n\nNow let's compile the relevant cells into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
