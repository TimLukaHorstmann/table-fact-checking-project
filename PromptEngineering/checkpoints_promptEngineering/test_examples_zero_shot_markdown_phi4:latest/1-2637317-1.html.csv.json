    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that the \"lambayeque\" region has a 0.0 change in the percentage of the country's population since 1993, we must locate and examine the relevant data from the provided table.\n\nFirst, identify the row corresponding to the \"lambayeque\" region:\n\n- The \"lambayeque\" row is the 14th entry (index 13 if starting with index 0) in the table.\n  \nNext, find the column that corresponds to the change in percentage of the country's population since 1993. According to the table headers:\n- The relevant column is \"% of countrys population\".\n- Within this column, we look at the \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\".\n\nFinally, verify if the entry for the lambayeque region under this specific sub-column matches the claim:\n\n- For \"lambayeque\", the value under the \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\" column is indeed 0.0.\n\nSince the provided data confirms that the change in percentage of the country's population for the lambayeque region since 1993 is 0.0, the claim holds true.\n\nThus, our JSON response should indicate this conclusion and specify the relevant cell checked to validate the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
