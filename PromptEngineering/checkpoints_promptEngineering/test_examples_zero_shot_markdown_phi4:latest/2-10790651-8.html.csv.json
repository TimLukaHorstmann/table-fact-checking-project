Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cell for verifying the claim is found in Row 3. We check both the \"home team\" and \"venue\" columns for this row:\n\n- **Row Index**: 3\n  - Column: home team (Value: collingwood)\n  - Column: venue (Value: victoria park)\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check several components of the table against the details provided in the claim:\n\n1. **Home Team**: The claim involves Collingwood as part of a match, so we first locate Collingwood in the \"home team\" column.\n2. **Away Team**: We then verify that North Melbourne is listed as the \"away team\" in the same row where Collingwood is the home team.\n3. **Venue**: The claim specifies the venue as Victoria Park, which should match with the corresponding row for this game.\n4. **Date and Other Information**: While not directly related to verifying the claim, these can be used to cross-check if needed.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part:\n\n- **Row with Collingwood as Home Team**:\n  - In row index 3, \"home team\" is indeed \"collingwood\".\n  - The corresponding \"away team\" in this row is \"north melbourne\", matching the claim.\n  - The \"venue\" for this game is listed as \"victoria park\", which also matches the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim match the details in row index 3, we can conclude that the claim is true.
