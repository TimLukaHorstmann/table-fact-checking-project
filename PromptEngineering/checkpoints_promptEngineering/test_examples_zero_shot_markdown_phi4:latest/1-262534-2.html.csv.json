The year of founding (`founded`) for each institution.\n2. The type of institution (`type`), specifically checking if it's listed as \"private.\"\n\nThe goal is to find the institution with the most recent founding year and verify that it is private.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Identify the most recently founded institution:\n   - Look at the `founded` column in each row to determine which institution was established last.\n   \n2. Verify if this institution is private:\n   - Check the `type` column for the same row identified in step 1, ensuring it contains \"private.\"\n\n**Table Analysis:**\n\n- **Row Index 0**: Founded in 1922, type is \"private / baptist general association of virginia\" (private).\n- **Row Index 1**: Founded in 1906, type is \"private / sbc\" (private).\n- **Row Index 2**: Founded in 1842, type is \"private / no affiliation\" (private).\n- **Row Index 3**: Founded in 1887, type is \"private / sbc\" (private).\n- **Row Index 4**: Founded in 1829, type is \"private / sbc\" (private).\n- **Row Index 5**: Founded in 1903, type is \"private / methodist\" (private).\n- **Row Index 6**: Founded in 1889, type is \"private / presbyterian\" (private).\n- **Row Index 7**: Founded in 1876, type is \"private / no affiliation\" (private).\n- **Row Index 8**: Founded in 1986, type is \"public\" (not private).\n- **Row Index 9**: Founded in 1873, type is \"private / catholic\" (private).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The most recently founded institution is at Row Index 0, Bluefield College, established in 1922.\n- This institution's `type` indicates it is private.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the most recently founded institution be a private one\" is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Founded column for Row Index 0 to identify the most recent founding year.\n- Type column for Row Index 0 to confirm it is private.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
