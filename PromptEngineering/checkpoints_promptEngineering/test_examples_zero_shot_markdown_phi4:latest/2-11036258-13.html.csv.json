    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 10 athlete that win 2 silver medal\" is true, we need to examine the table for entries where an athlete has won exactly 2 silver medals.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column to check for silver medals is the \"silver\" column.\n\n2. **Check Each Row:**\n   - We need to find rows where the value in the \"silver\" column is 2.\n   \n3. **Count Rows with 2 Silver Medals:**\n   - Row index 7: `johan olsson (swe)` has 1 gold, 2 silver, 0 bronze.\n   - Row index 8: `gregor schlierenzauer (aut)` has 1 gold, 2 silver, 0 bronze.\n   - Row index 17: `ida ingemarsdotter (swe)` has 0 gold, 3 silver, 0 bronze.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Alexey Poltoranin (KAZ) won more medals than anyone else\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the total number of medals each individual has won according to the table.\n\nThe relevant column for determining the total number of medals won by an individual is the \"total\" column. We need to examine this column across all rows and identify the maximum value, then check if Alexey Poltoranin's row matches that maximum.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Identify Total Medals:** Look at each entry in the \"total\" column to determine the number of medals won by each athlete.\n2. **Find Maximum Medals:** Determine the highest number of total medals achieved by any individual in the table.\n3. **Verify Alexey Poltoranin's Record:** Check if Alexey Poltoranin has this maximum medal count.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Extracting Total Medals:**\n\n   - Row 0 (Marit Bj\u00f8rgen): 5 medals\n   - Row 1 (Jason Lamy-Chappuis): 4 medals\n   - Row 2 (Therese Johaug): 4 medals\n   - Row 3 (Petter Northug): 3 medals\n   - Row 4 (Nikita Kriukov): 2 medals\n   - Row 5 (S\u00e9bastien Lacroix): 2 medals\n   - Row 6-7 (Johan Olsson and Gregor Schlierenzauer): 3 medals each\n   - Row 8-10 (Dario Cologna, Thomas Morgenstern, Sara Takanashi): 2 medals each\n   - Row 11-15 (Eric Frenzel, Tord Asle Gjerdalen, Sjur R\u00f8the, Kamil Stoch, Heidi Weng): 2 medals each\n   - Row 16 (Ida Ingemarsdotter): 3 medals\n   - Row 17-19 (Bernhard Gruber, Marcus Hellner, Charlotte Kalla): 2 medals each\n   - Row 20-23 (Richard Freitag, Severin Freund, Peter Prevc, Jacqueline Seifriedsberger): 2 medals each\n   - Row 24-25 (Yuliya Chekaleva and Alexey Poltoranin): 2 medals each\n\n2. **Maximum Medal Count:**\n\n   The maximum number of medals won by any athlete in the table is 5, achieved by Marit Bj\u00f8rgen.\n\n3. **Alexey Poltoranin's Record:**\n\n   - Row 25 (Alexey Poltoranin): 2 medals\n\nSince Alexey Poltoranin has only 2 total medals, and not the maximum of 5, he did not win more medals than anyone else in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
