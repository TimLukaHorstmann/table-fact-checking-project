However:\n- \"don't stop the train\" missed the US Hot 100 but made it to the US Dance chart.\n- \"i like you\" hit both the US Hot 100 and the US Dance chart.\n\nSince \"i like you\" appeared on both charts, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nFor \"don't stop the train\":\n- Row index 0, Column name \"us hot 100\"\n- Row index 0, Column name \"us dance\"\n\nFor \"i like you\":\n- Row index 3, Column name \"us hot 100\"\n- Row index 3, Column name \"us dance\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
