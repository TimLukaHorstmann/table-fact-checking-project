    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"2 ITTF Pro Tour events were hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012,\" we need to analyze the provided table for relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify the column for locations:** The first step is to look at the \"year location\" column, as it specifies where each event was held.\n\n2. **Extract rows corresponding to Yokohama:**\n   - Check each row in the \"year location\" column to see if it mentions \"yokohama.\"\n   - Extract the years associated with these locations.\n\n3. **Count events at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012:**\n   - Filter the extracted rows to include only those within the specified range (1997-2012).\n   - Count the number of occurrences.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- 2008 yokohama\n- 2006 yokohama\n- 2005 yokohama\n- 2001 yokohama\n\nThese are the rows where \"yokohama\" appears in the \"year location\" column, and they fall within the range of 1997 to 2012.\n\nThus, there are 4 events hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012.\n\nThe claim states that there were only 2 such events. Since we found 4, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row indices corresponding to \"yokohama\" within the range: 5, 6, 7, 9.\n- Column name: \"year location.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
