This score of 4 should appear only thrice in the entire table.\n3. It should only be obtained by the home teams.\n\nLet's analyze each condition with respect to the table data:\n\n### Condition 1: Highest Score is 4\n- We need to identify all instances where a team scored 4 goals in any match, whether as home or away.\n- From the table:\n  - Row 4: Brighton & Hove Albion (home) scored 4 against Barnet.\n  - Row 18: Ipswich Town (home) scored 4 against Leyton Orient.\n\nThese are two instances where a team has scored 4. No other row in the table shows a score of 4 for any team.\n\n### Condition 2: Score of 4 Appears Thrice\n- The claim states that this score should appear thrice.\n- From our analysis, we found only two occurrences of a team scoring 4:\n  - Row 4 (Brighton & Hove Albion)\n  - Row 18 (Ipswich Town)\n\nThus, the score of 4 appears only twice, not thrice.\n\n### Condition 3: Scored by Home Teams Only\n- Both instances where a team scored 4 were by home teams:\n  - Brighton & Hove Albion in row 4.\n  - Ipswich Town in row 18.\n\nThis condition is satisfied as both instances are from home teams, but it doesn't matter since the second condition already fails.\n\nSince the second condition (score of 4 appearing thrice) is not met, the claim is FALSE. We need to identify relevant rows and columns for verification:\n\n- Row 4: Check \"home team\" (Brighton & Hove Albion), \"score 1\" (4 - 0).\n- Row 18: Check \"home team\" (Ipswich Town), \"score 1\" (4 - 1).\n\nThese cells are relevant to verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
