    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"bud foster have the second long tenure as coach\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and focus on the relevant column for each coach's years of service. Specifically, we will look at the 'years' column to calculate the duration of each coach\u2019s tenure.\n\n1. **James C Elsom** (1898 - 1904): Tenure = 1904 - 1898 = 6 years\n2. **Emmett Angell** (1904 - 1908): Tenure = 1908 - 1904 = 4 years\n3. **Haskell Noyes** (1908 - 1911): Tenure = 1911 - 1908 = 3 years\n4. **Walter Meanwell** (1911 - 1917 and 1920 - 1934):\n   - First tenure: 1917 - 1911 = 6 years\n   - Second tenure: 1934 - 1920 = 14 years\n5. **Guy Lowman** (1917 - 1920): Tenure = 1920 - 1917 = 3 years\n6. **Bud Foster** (1934 - 1959): Tenure = 1959 - 1934 = 25 years\n7. **John E Erickson** (1959 - 1968): Tenure = 1968 - 1959 = 9 years\n8. **John Powless** (1968 - 1976): Tenure = 1976 - 1968 = 8 years\n9. **Bill Cofield** (1976 - 1982): Tenure = 1982 - 1976 = 6 years\n10. **Steve Yoder** (1982 - 1992): Tenure = 1992 - 1982 = 10 years\n11. **Stu Jackson** (1992 - 1994): Tenure = 1994 - 1992 = 2 years\n12. **Stan Van Gundy** (1994 - 1995): Tenure = 1995 - 1994 = 1 year\n13. **Dick Bennett** (1995 - 2000): Tenure = 2000 - 1995 = 5 years\n14. **Brad Soderberg** (2000 - 2001): Tenure = 2001 - 2000 = 1 year\n15. **Bo Ryan** (2001 - present, assume until 2013 for calculation as table ends in 2013):\n    - Tenure: 2013 - 2001 = 12 years\n\nNext, we rank these tenures from longest to shortest:\n\n- Bud Foster: 25 years\n- Walter Meanwell's second tenure: 14 years\n- Bo Ryan (up to 2013): 12 years\n- Steve Yoder: 10 years\n- John E Erickson: 9 years\n- Waltter Meanwell's first tenure: 6 years\n- James C Elsom: 6 years\n- Bill Cofield: 6 years\n- Dick Bennett: 5 years\n- John Powless: 8 years\n- Emmett Angell: 4 years\n- Guy Lowman: 3 years\n- Haskell Noyes: 3 years\n- Stu Jackson: 2 years\n- Stan Van Gundy: 1 year\n- Brad Soderberg: 1 year\n\nFrom this ranking, Bud Foster has the longest tenure. The second-longest is Walter Meanwell's second tenure with 14 years.\n\nThus, Bud Foster does not have the second-longest tenure; he has the longest. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are the 'years' column for each coach:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
