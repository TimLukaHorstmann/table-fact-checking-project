The claim states: \"no match be lost when the number of match manage be over 2 during the period from may 2012 - 11 november 2012.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Period**: \n   - We are focusing on matches managed between May 2012 and November 11, 2012.\n\n2. **Extract Data for the Relevant Period**:\n   - The table shows two entries that fall within this time frame: Ian Crook (May 2012 - November 11, 2012) and Steve Corica as caretaker (November 12, 2012 - November 27, 2012). However, since Steve Corica's period starts after November 11, 2012, we only need to consider Ian Crook for this specific claim.\n\n3. **Check the Data for Ian Crook**:\n   - Managed: 6 matches\n   - Lost: 4 matches\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data**:\n   - The claim specifies that no match was lost when more than 2 matches were managed during the period.\n   - For Ian Crook, who managed 6 matches, he indeed lost 4 matches.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are losses recorded for a manager who managed over 2 matches in the specified period, the claim is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cell for verification is:\n\n- Row index: 5 (corresponding to Ian Crook)\n- Column names: \"managed\" and \"lost\"\n\nHere is the JSON response based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"managed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
