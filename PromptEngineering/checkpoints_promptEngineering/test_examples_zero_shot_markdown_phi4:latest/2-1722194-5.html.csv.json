    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine specific information from the table regarding the Notre Dame Basilica and the Sun Life Building.\n\nThe relevant parts of the claim are:\n- \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for the same amount of time as the notre dame basilica\"\n\nFrom this, we need to compare the duration both buildings were the tallest building in Montreal:\n\n1. **Notre Dame Basilica**:\n   - Years as Tallest: 1829 - 1928\n   - Duration: 99 years\n\n2. **Sun Life Building**:\n   - Years as Tallest: 1931 - 1962\n   - Duration: 31 years\n\nThe claim states that the Sun Life Building remained the tallest for the same amount of time as the Notre Dame Basilica, which means both should have been the tallest building for 99 years. According to the table:\n- Notre Dame Basilica was the tallest for 99 years.\n- Sun Life Building was the tallest for only 31 years.\n\nSince these durations are not equal, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion are:\n- Notre Dame Basilica's \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\"\n- Sun Life Building's \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
