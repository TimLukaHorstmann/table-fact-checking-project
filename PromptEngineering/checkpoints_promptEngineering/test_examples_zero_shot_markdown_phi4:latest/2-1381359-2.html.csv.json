Locate the row corresponding to the season \"2000 - 1\".\n2. Verify that in this row, the \"winner\" is \"kanto gakuin university.\"\n3. Confirm that the title for this row is labeled as \"37th.\"\n4. Check if the attendance value is marked as \"n / a.\"\n\n**Table Inspection:**\n\n- The row with `season` \"2000 - 1 details\" is indeed present in the table.\n- In this row, the column `winner` shows \"kanto gakuin university.\"\n- The `title` for this season is correctly noted as \"37th.\"\n- However, the attendance value given is \"n / a,\" which should have been specified as available or not. Upon inspection, it is actually \"35462.\"\n\nThe claim states that the attendance should be unavailable (\"n / a\"), but in reality, an attendance figure of 35462 is provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim does not hold true due to incorrect information about the attendance value.
