    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Cape Vincent, NY be the first among the city of license keep Webster, NY behind it,\" we need to interpret what \"first\" means in this context. It seems likely that \"first\" refers to an ordering based on some criteria. A common criterion for radio stations could be frequency or power (ERP).\n\nLet's examine each possible relevant column:\n\n1. **City of License**: This column simply identifies the city, which doesn't provide a basis for comparison.\n\n2. **Frequency**: Frequencies are typically ordered numerically to determine their position on the dial.\n\n3. **ERP / Power (w)**: Higher ERP/Power might imply stronger signal strength or priority, but it is less common to use this as an ordering criterion unless explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Facility ID**: This appears to be a unique identifier and not typically used for ordering in terms of priority or position.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical basis for determining \"first\" would be frequency, as it directly relates to the station's position on the radio dial.\n\nNow, let's check the frequencies:\n\n- **Cape Vincent, NY (WMHI)**: 94.7 FM\n- **Webster, NY (WMHN)**: 89.3 FM\n\nSince 89.3 FM is numerically less than 94.7 FM, Webster, NY would come before Cape Vincent, NY if ordered by frequency.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Cape Vincent, NY be the first among the city of license keep Webster, NY behind it\" is FALSE when considering frequency as the ordering criterion.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row 0 (Cape Vincent, NY), Column: Frequency\n- Row 1 (Webster, NY), Column: Frequency\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
