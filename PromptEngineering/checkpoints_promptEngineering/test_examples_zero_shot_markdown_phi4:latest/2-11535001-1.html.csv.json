The venue \"Estadio Monumental\" is located in Santiago, Chile, not Japan.\n2. It hosted World Cup qualification matches on both dates mentioned (October 11, 2011, and October 15, 2013).\n\nSince the first condition of the claim (\"in Japan\") is false, the entire claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify:\n- For row index 3: \n  - \"venue\" column shows \"estadio monumental , santiago , chile\"\n  - \"competition\" column shows \"2014 fifa world cup qualification\"\n\n- For row index 4: \n  - \"venue\" column shows \"estadio monumental , santiago , chile\"\n  - \"competition\" column shows \"2014 fifa world cup qualification\"\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
