    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on the specific period mentioned in the claim and compare it with the data provided in the table.\n\n**Claim:** \"there be 3,624,000 live birth per year in the period from 1975 to 1980\"\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row for the period 1975 - 1980:**\n   - The table lists periods as ranges (e.g., 1950-1955), so we look for the row corresponding to \"1975 - 1980\".\n\n2. **Check the \"live births per year\" column for this row:**\n   - According to the table, in the period from 1975 to 1980, the \"live births per year\" is 3,741,000.\n\n3. **Compare with the claim:**\n   - The claim states there are 3,624,000 live births per year for this period.\n   - The actual value from the table is 3,741,000.\n\nSince the numbers do not match, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cell to verify the claim:**\n- Row index for \"1975 - 1980\" is 5 (assuming zero-based indexing).\n- Column name is \"live births per year\".\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"live births per year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
