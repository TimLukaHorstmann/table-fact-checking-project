A player whose first name is 'Macrae'.\n\nLet's analyze the table based on these criteria.\n\n### Analyzing Condition 1: Last Name 'Macrae'\n- Look at the \"player\" column for any player with a last name of 'Macrae'.\n- In row 3, we have \"Jim Macrae (F)\", where \"Macrae\" is indeed the last name. This supports the first condition.\n\n### Analyzing Condition 2: First Name 'Macrae'\n- Check if there is any player with the first name of 'Macrae'.\n- In row 3, \"Jim Macrae (F)\" has 'Jim' as the first name, not 'Macrae'. There are no other entries with a first name of 'Macrae'.\n\nSince only the first condition is satisfied and the second one is not met in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 3, column \"player\" (for last name 'Macrae').\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Row index is considered as zero-based in this context.\n- Only one cell was relevant to confirm both conditions of the claim. The row corresponding to 'Jim Macrae' is indexed at 2 (third row).",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table, we need to focus on two main parts of it:\n\n1. **Draft Pick Numbers**: We are looking at the first three draft picks, which correspond to rows with \"round\" values 1, 2, and 3.\n\n2. **Player's Club Team**: The claim specifically mentions that these players come from the \"cornwall royals.\"\n\nWe will assess each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Round: 1\n  - Pick: 11\n  - Player: Brad Marsh (D)\n  - College/Junior/Club Team: London Knights (OHA)\n\nThis player does not come from the Cornwall Royals.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Note: There is no entry for round 2 in the table. This means there are only two picks listed among rounds 1 to 3, so it's impossible for \"2 of the first 3 draft picks\" to be from Cornwall Royals as the condition specifies.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Round: 3\n  - Pick: 47\n  - Player: Tim Bernhardt (G)\n  - College/Junior/Club Team: Cornwall Royals (OHA)\n\nThis player does come from the Cornwall Royals.\n\nFrom this analysis, only one of the first three picks comes from the Cornwall Royals (Tim Bernhardt in round 3). Since there is no entry for round 2 and we cannot fulfill the condition of having \"2\" players from Cornwall Royals among these rounds, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells that confirm this conclusion:\n\n- Row 1: Columns for \"round\", \"pick\", and \"college / junior / club team\"\n- Row 3: Columns for \"round\", \"pick\", and \"college / junior / club team\"\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
