    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the table data, let's break down the elements of the statement:\n\n- **Date**: The claim mentions \"on October 25, 2009.\" We need to locate this date in the 'date' column.\n  \n- **Score**: The claim specifies the score as \"1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6.\"\n\nWe will analyze these aspects against the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Locate the Date**:\n   - We need to find an entry with the date \"25 October 2009\" in the 'date' column.\n\n2. **Verify the Score**:\n   - Once we locate the correct row based on the date, we will check if the score matches \"1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6.\"\n\n### Table Examination\n\n- In the table, there is a row with the date \"25 October 2009.\"\n- This corresponds to row index 11 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\nNow let's verify:\n\n- **Row Index**: 11\n- **Column: 'date'**: The entry is \"25 October 2009,\" which matches our requirement.\n  \n- **Column: 'score'**: The score listed is \"1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6.\"\n\nBoth conditions (date and score) are satisfied for this row.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim about the event on October 25, 2009, with the specified score is TRUE. Therefore, the relevant cells from the table include the 'date' and 'score' columns at row index 11.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"an easy person to beat would be chen yanchong\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant data concerning matches involving Chen Yanchong.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**:\n   - The relevant information from the table involves finding entries where the opponent was \"chen yanchong.\"\n   - In this case, row index 0 shows a match against Chen Yanchong on March 3, 2004, in Mumbai.\n   - Outcome of this match: winner (score: 6 - 4 6 - 4).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Match**:\n   - The outcome is \"winner,\" and the score indicates that the player won both sets with a clear margin (6-4, 6-4).\n   - This implies that Chen Yanchong was defeated in this match without losing any set.\n\n3. **Assessing the Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests that Chen Yanchong would be \"an easy person to beat.\"\n   - From the available data, we have only one match result involving Chen Yanchong.\n   - Since there is a single instance of winning against him without losing any set, it does suggest he might not pose much resistance in this particular instance. However, with only one match as evidence, it's insufficient to definitively conclude that Chen Yanchong is generally easy to beat.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The data shows one victory over Chen Yanchong, but without additional matches or context, we cannot conclusively determine if he is universally an \"easy person to beat.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim lacks sufficient evidence to be deemed true across multiple scenarios.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
