    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 3 be january 20 2001,\" we need to analyze the table and verify whether there is a match where exactly three goals were scored, specifically on January 20, 2001.\n\nHere's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant columns for this claim are \"goal\", \"date\", and \"score\" since they contain information about the number of goals, dates of games, and scores.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - goal: 1\n     - date: 17 January 2001\n     - score: 2 - 0\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - goal: 2\n     - date: 20 January 2001\n     - score: 1 - 0\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - goal: 3\n     - date: 20 January 2001\n     - score: 2 - 0\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - goal: 4\n     - date: 15 March 2001\n     - score: 3 - 1\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - goal: 5\n     - date: 14 July 2004\n     - score: 0 - 1\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - goal: 6\n     - date: 17 November 2004\n     - score: 2 - 1\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - We need to find a game with exactly three goals (goal = 3) on January 20, 2001.\n   - In Row 2, we have:\n     - goal: 3\n     - date: 20 January 2001\n     - score: 2 - 0 (Total goals in the match = 2)\n   - The claim specifies that there should be a game with exactly three goals on this date. However, Row 2 shows only two total goals (2 - 0), not three.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since no row matches the condition of having exactly three goals on January 20, 2001, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are from Row 2, specifically \"goal\", \"date\", and \"score\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"the date of the game that have a goal of 4 be march 15, 2001,\" we need to determine if there is an entry in the table with a \"goal\" value of 4 and check its corresponding \"date.\"\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Conditions:**\n   - The claim involves two conditions:\n     - A goal number (specifically, the fourth goal).\n     - The date associated with this goal.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with Goal 4:**\n   - We need to find the row where the \"goal\" column is equal to 4.\n\n3. **Check the Date for Goal 4:**\n   - Once we identify the correct row, verify if the \"date\" matches \"15 march 2001.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - If both conditions are met (i.e., goal number 4 corresponds to the date \"15 march 2001\"), the claim is TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the table:\n\n- The row with `goal` = 4 is:\n  |   goal | date             | score   | result   | competition       |\n  |-------:|:-----------------|:--------|:---------|:------------------|\n  |      4 | 15 march 2001    | 3 - 1   | 3 - 1    | friendly          |\n\n- The \"date\" for goal number 4 is indeed \"15 march 2001.\"\n\nSince the conditions of the claim are satisfied, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cells to verify this claim are from the row where `goal` = 4:\n  - Row index 3, column \"goal\"\n  - Row index 3, column \"date\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
