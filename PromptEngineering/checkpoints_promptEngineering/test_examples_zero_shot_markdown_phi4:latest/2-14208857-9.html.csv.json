    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the specific conditions stated in it against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"game 6 be hold on april 11.\"\n\nThis implies two main conditions that need to be verified:\n\n1. **Game Number**: The event referred to as \"game\" must be game number 6.\n2. **Date**: This game must have occurred on April 11.\n\n### Verification Against the Table:\n\n#### Condition 1: Game Number\n- We look for the row where the \"game\" column is equal to 6.\n- From the table, we find:\n  - Row with `game` = 6 has date \"april 16\".\n\n#### Condition 2: Date\n- We need to check if there is a game held on April 11.\n- From the table, we find:\n  - Row with `date` = \"april 11\" has `game` = 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The row corresponding to game number 6 does not have the date \"april 11\"; instead, it is on \"april 16\".\n- Conversely, the game held on April 11 is game number 3.\n\nSince neither of these conditions are met simultaneously, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells that need to be checked in the table for this verification include:\n- The cell containing `game` = 6 and its corresponding date.\n- The cell containing `date` = \"april 11\" and its corresponding game number.\n\nIn terms of row indices and column names, these are:\n1. Row index 5 (game = 6), column \"date\".\n2.
