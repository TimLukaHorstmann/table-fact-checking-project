    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the given table, let's break down the statement and identify the relevant components:\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n1. **\"just keep walking\"** - This suggests a specific title of a single by INXS.\n2. **\"the single inxs release ahead of the album in 1980\"** - The claim implies that this single was released before an album in 1980.\n3. **\"become their first australian top 40 hit\"** - This indicates that the single achieved notable success by entering the Australian Top 40.\n\nNow, let's analyze each component with respect to the table:\n\n1. **Single Title (\"just keep walking\")**: The table does not list any titles for releases; it only includes format, country, label, catalogue number, and date.\n   \n2. **Release Year (1980)**: We need entries in 1980:\n   - Row 0: LP, Australia, Deluxe Records, VPL1 6529, 30 October 1980\n   - Row 1: LP, Europe, Mercury Records, 838 925 - 1, 1980\n\n3. **Australian Release**: We need to find entries specifically for Australia in 1980:\n   - Row 0 matches the criteria (Australia, 1980).\n\n4. **Top 40 Hit Status**: The table does not provide any information about chart positions or whether a release became a Top 40 hit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- While we have identified an Australian LP release in 1980, there is no mention of the title \"just keep walking\" or its success as a top 40 hit in the table. Thus, we cannot confirm any part of the claim using the provided data alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the lack of necessary information to fully verify the claim, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ATCO record label release all their album in Australia\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to evaluate the relevant information regarding ATCO records' releases and their associated countries.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with ATCO Records:**\n   - Look for entries where the 'label' column contains \"atco records.\"\n\n2. **Check the Country Column for These Entries:**\n   - Examine the 'country' values in rows identified above to see if all instances are labeled as \"aus\" (Australia).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Label: atco records\n  - Country: usa\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Label: atco records\n  - Country: usa\n\n- **Row 7:**\n  - Label: atco records\n  - Country: usa\n\nIn all rows where the label is \"atco records,\" the country listed is \"usa,\" not \"aus.\" This directly contradicts the claim that ATCO releases their albums only in Australia.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince none of the ATCO record entries are associated with Australia, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for verifying this are from rows 3, 5, and 7 under both 'label' and 'country' columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
