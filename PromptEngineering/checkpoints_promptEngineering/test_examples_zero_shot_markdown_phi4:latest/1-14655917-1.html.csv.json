Identify the row with \"September 26\":\n   - In Row 2, we find the date as \"September 26.\"\n\n2. Verify the opponent in this row:\n   - In Row 2, under the \"opponent\" column, it shows \"Denver Broncos,\" which matches the claim.\n\n3. Check the final score for correctness:\n   - In Row 2, under the \"final score\" column, it is listed as \"W 34 - 13.\"\n   - The claim states the final score should be \"W 13 - 24.\" This does not match the table's data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe opponent and date are correct according to the table.
