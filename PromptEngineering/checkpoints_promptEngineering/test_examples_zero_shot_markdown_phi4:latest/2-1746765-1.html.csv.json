This indicates that in 2010, someone was a test driver for the Force India F1 team.

However, it does show the team's performance in 2011.\n\nTo verify if Paul Di Resta joined as a test driver in 2010, we need to check external information since the table does not specify individual names. According to historical records, Paul Di Resta did indeed join Force India as a reserve and test driver in 2009 and made his Formula One debut with them in 2011.\n\nGiven this context, while the table indicates someone was a test driver for Force India F1 Team in 2010, it does not explicitly mention Paul Di Resta.
