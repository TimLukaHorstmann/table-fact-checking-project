There are three translators on frequency MHz values in the \"90's\".\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"frequency mhz\". We'll examine each row of this column and count how many frequencies fall within the specified ranges.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Frequencies in the 100's:**\n   - w264bf: 100.7 MHz (falls within the 100's)\n   - w276bm: 103.1 MHz (falls within the 100's)\n   - w293al: 106.5 MHz (falls within the 100's)\n\n   There are exactly three frequencies in the \"100's\".\n\n2. **Identify Frequencies in the 90's:**\n   - w221by: 92.1 MHz (falls within the 90's)\n   - w223au: 92.5 MHz (falls within the 90's)\n\n   There are only two frequencies in the \"90's\", not three.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is partially correct; while there are indeed three translators with frequencies in the \"100's\", there are only two in the \"90's\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the relevant information provided in the table. The claim states: \"englewood, illinois have 2 translator.\"\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how to verify this claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are interested in the entries related to \"Englewood, Illinois\" because that is the city mentioned in the claim.\n   - Specifically, we need to look at the \"city of license\" column to find rows associated with \"englewood, illinois.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - The table includes various columns: call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, and fcc info.\n   - We focus on the \"city of license\" column to see if there are multiple entries for \"englewood, illinois.\"\n\n3. **Locate Relevant Entries**:\n   - In the table, we find one row where the \"city of license\" is \"Englewood, Illinois\":\n     - Row Index: 1\n     - Call Sign: w264bf\n     - Frequency MHz: 100.7\n     - City of License: englewood , illinois\n     - ERP W: 2\n     - Class: d\n     - FCC Info: fcc\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim mentions \"2 translator,\" implying there should be two entries for translators in Englewood, Illinois.\n   - However, we only find one entry related to Englewood, Illinois in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is only one entry for \"englewood, illinois\" and not two as claimed, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell that supports this conclusion is from Row Index 1, Column \"city of license.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
