We must find this exact date in the table.\n\n2. **Check the Attendance for the Identified Date:**  \n   Once we locate the row with the specified date, we need to check if the attendance matches the claimed value of 57895.\n\n3. **Locate and Verify Relevant Data:**\n\n   - The first column is \"week\", which helps us navigate through each game.\n   - The second column is \"date\", where we look for \"september 26 , 1971\".\n   - The fifth column is \"attendance\", where we check the value.\n\n4. **Verification Process:**\n   - In row 2, the date is listed as \"september 26 , 1971\".\n   - In the same row (row 2), the attendance is recorded as 57895.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in row 2, the claim is TRUE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The date cell at row index 2.\n   - The attendance cell at row index 2.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from row index 2 for both the \"date\" and \"attendance\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two conditions stated in the claim against the table data:\n\n1. The claim mentions that \"week 14 be on september 26 , 1971\". We should check which row corresponds to week 14 and verify its date.\n2. It also claims an attendance of \"57895\" for this week. We need to confirm if this matches the attendance figure listed for week 14.\n\nLet's analyze these points using the table:\n\n- **Week Number**: \n  - From the table, we see that each row corresponds to a specific week, and row 13 (zero-based index) is labeled \"week 14\" in the first column. We need to check this row specifically for its date.\n\n- **Date Verification**:\n  - For row 13, the date listed is \"december 19 , 1971\". This does not match \"september 26 , 1971\".\n\n- **Attendance Verification**:\n  - In the same row (week 14), the attendance figure is \"75954\", which again does not match the claimed \"57895\".\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are incorrect based on the table data, thus making the entire claim false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from row index 1 (\"week 2\") for comparison and row index 13 (\"week 14\") for verification. Here they are:\n\n- Row index 1: \"date\" column for checking where September 26, 1971 is actually recorded.\n- Row index 13: Both the \"date\" and \"attendance\" columns to verify week 14's actual values.\n\nThus, the JSON response reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
