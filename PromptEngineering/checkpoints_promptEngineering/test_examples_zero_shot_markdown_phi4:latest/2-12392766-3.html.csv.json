    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Japan has 5 more bronze medals than the United States\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant cells in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify the rows for Japan and the United States:**\n   - The row corresponding to \"japan\" (rank 3) provides information about Japan.\n   - The row corresponding to \"united states\" (rank 1) provides information about the United States.\n\n2. **Locate the 'bronze' column in these rows:**\n   - For \"japan,\" we look at the cell in the 'bronze' column, which has a value of 1.\n   - For \"united states,\" we look at the cell in the 'bronze' column, which has a value of 12.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - The claim suggests that Japan has 5 more bronze medals than the United States.\n   - We compute the difference as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Bronze medals for Japan} - \\text{Bronze medals for United States} = 1 - 12 = -11\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The result of -11 indicates that Japan has 11 fewer bronze medals than the United States, not 5 more.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. We will identify the relevant cells in the table to support our conclusion:\n\n- For Japan (row index 2), the 'bronze' column value is 1.\n- For the United States (row index 0), the 'bronze' column value is 12.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and the list of relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
