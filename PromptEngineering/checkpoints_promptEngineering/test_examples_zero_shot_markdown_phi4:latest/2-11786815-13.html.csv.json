    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a match with a score of \"0 - 4\".\n2. Check if the attendance for this specific match is indeed the highest and equals 20,066.\n\nLet's examine the relevant columns in the table: \"score\" and \"attendance\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Locate the Match with Score \"0 - 4\":**\n   - Look through each row of the \"score\" column to find where it matches \"0 - 4\".\n   - In Row 0, we have:\n     - Date: May 24\n     - Visitor: Pittsburgh\n     - Score: 0 - 4\n     - Home: Detroit\n     - Decision: Osgood\n     - Attendance: 20,066\n     - Series: 1 - 0\n\n   The score \"0 - 4\" appears in the first row (index 0).\n\n2. **Check the Attendance for this Match:**\n   - In Row 0, the attendance is recorded as 20,066.\n   - We must ensure that no other match has a higher attendance than this value.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Matches' Attendances:**\n   - Row 1 (Score: 0 - 3): Attendance is 20,066\n   - Row 2 (Score: 2 - 3): Attendance is 17,132\n   - Row 3 (Score: 2 - 1): Attendance is 17,132\n   - Row 4 (Score: 4 - 3): Attendance is 20,066\n   - Row 5 (Score: 3 - 2): Attendance is 17,132\n\nThe highest attendance in the table is indeed 20,066, which occurs for both the scores \"0 - 4\" and other scores. Therefore, the match with a score of \"0 - 4\" has an attendance that matches the highest recorded value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states: \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20,066.\" This is true as the only match with this score has an attendance of exactly 20,066, which is also the maximum attendance in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
