    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Collingwood v Richmond have the largest crowd\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant data in the table concerning match attendance (crowd size). Specifically, we must look at the \"crowd\" column for each row and identify which match has the highest recorded attendance.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** \n   - The claim is about crowd sizes, so the relevant column in the table is \"crowd.\"\n\n2. **Extract Crowd Sizes from Each Row:**\n   - For each match listed in the table, extract the attendance figures:\n     - Melbourne v South Melbourne: 23,025\n     - Essendon v Fitzroy: 17,500\n     - Collingwood v Richmond: 34,000\n     - Carlton v Geelong: 31,000\n     - St Kilda v North Melbourne: 20,500\n     - Hawthorn v Footscray: 26,000\n\n3. **Determine the Largest Crowd:**\n   - Compare all extracted crowd sizes to identify the largest one.\n   - The highest attendance is 34,000 for Collingwood v Richmond.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - According to the claim, Collingwood vs Richmond has the largest crowd size.\n   - Our analysis confirms that this match indeed has the largest recorded attendance of 34,000 in the table.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells Identification:**\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing crowd sizes for all matches:\n     - Row index 0 (Melbourne v South Melbourne): crowd = 23,025\n     - Row index 1 (Essendon v Fitzroy): crowd = 17,500\n     - Row index 2 (Collingwood v Richmond): crowd = 34,000\n     - Row index 3 (Carlton v Geelong): crowd = 31,000\n     - Row index 4 (St Kilda v North Melbourne): crowd = 20,500\n     - Row index 5 (Hawthorn v Footscray): crowd = 26,000\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two statements from the table:\n\n1. \"Richmond lose to Collingwood\"\n2. \"Footscray beat Hawthorn\"\n\nLet's check each statement against the data in the table.\n\n### Step 1: Verify \"Richmond lose to Collingwood\"\n- Locate the row where the home team is \"collingwood\" and the away team is \"richmond\".\n- This corresponds to the third row of the table:\n  - Home Team Score (Collingwood): 11.8 (74)\n  - Away Team Score (Richmond): 14.13 (97)\n\nSince Richmond's score (97) is higher than Collingwood's score (74), Richmond wins, not loses. Therefore, the statement \"Richmond lose to Collingwood\" is FALSE.\n\n### Step 2: Verify \"Footscray beat Hawthorn\"\n- Locate the row where the home team is \"hawthorn\" and the away team is \"footscray\".\n- This corresponds to the sixth row of the table:\n  - Home Team Score (Hawthorn): 10.9 (69)\n  - Away Team Score (Footscray): 11.12 (78)\n\nSince Footscray's score (78) is higher than Hawthorn's score (69), Footscray wins, meaning they beat Hawthorn. Therefore, the statement \"Footscray beat Hawthorn\" is TRUE.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim \"richmond lose to collingwood and footscray beat hawthorn\" has one false part (\"Richmond lose to Collingwood\") and one true part (\"Footscray beat Hawthorn\"). Since both parts of the conjunction must be true for the entire statement to be true, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- For \"Richmond lose to Collingwood\": \n  - Row index 2 (third row in table), columns: \"home team score\" and \"away team score\"\n- For \"Footscray beat Hawthorn\":\n  - Row index 5 (sixth row in table), columns: \"home team score\" and \"away team score\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
