    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Lessburg High School,\" we need to find relevant information in the table.\n\n1. **Position Check**: We look for players who play as a linebacker.\n2. **School Check**: Among these linebackers, identify those whose high school is Lessburg High School.\n3. **College Check**: Ensure that the player with the above characteristics attends Stanford University.\n\nLet's break down each step using the table:\n\n1. The relevant column to find position is \"position.\"\n   - Noor Davis and Scott Starr are listed as linebackers in rows 7 and 8, respectively.\n\n2. We now look at their respective high schools:\n   - Noor Davis attended Lessburg High School (row 7).\n   - Scott Starr attended Norco High School (row 8).\n\n3. Finally, we check the college column for Stanford University:\n   - Noor Davis attends Stanford University (column \"college\" in row 7).\n   - Scott Starr does not attend Stanford; he goes to Southern California (column \"college\" in row 8).\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - Row index 7, column \"position\": Confirms that Noor Davis is a linebacker.\n  - Row index 7, column \"school\": Shows his high school as Lessburg High School.\n  - Row index 7, column \"college\": Indicates he attends Stanford.\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the information in row 7. Therefore, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco high school,\" we need to identify if there is an entry in the table where:\n\n1. The position is \"linebacker.\"\n2. The hometown or high school corresponds to \"Norco, California.\"\n3. The college is \"Stanford.\"\n\nFirst, let's examine each row of the table relevant to these conditions:\n\n- Row 6: Scott Starr\n  - Position: Linebacker (matches condition)\n  - Hometown: Norco, California (matches condition for hometown being Norco)\n  - College: Southern California (does not match Stanford)\n\nThere is no entry in the table that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. The player from Norco High School who plays as a linebacker attended Southern California, not Stanford.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells we need to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 6, column \"position\"\n- Row index 6, column \"hometown\"\n- Row index 6, column \"college\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
