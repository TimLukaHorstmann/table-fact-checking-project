If so, it counts as a win for the home team.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Games and Wins**: Determine the total number of games (excluding replays) and count how many times the home team won.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: Check if the number of home team wins is exactly half of the total games played.\n\n**Relevant Rows from the Table:**\n\n- Rows 1 to 17 are relevant, excluding rows labeled \"replay\".\n\n**Analysis of Each Game:**\n\n- Row 1: Nelson (home) vs. York City; Score 1 - 1 (draw)\n- Row 2: Watford (home) vs. Luton Town; Score 3 - 1 (Watford wins)\n- Row 3: Walsall (home) vs. Newport County; Score 4 - 0 (Walsall wins)\n- Row 4: Gillingham (home) vs. Aldershot; Score 1 - 3 (Aldershot wins)\n- Row 5: Crewe Alexandra (home) vs. Queens Park Rangers; Score 2 - 4 (Queens Park Rangers win)\n- Row 6: Gainsborough Trinity (home) vs. Southport; Score 0 - 4 (Southport wins)\n- Row 7: Scarborough (home) vs. Lincoln City; Score 6 - 4 (Scarborough wins)\n- Row 8: Doncaster Rovers (home) vs. Notts County; Score 0 - 1 (Notts County wins)\n- Row 9: Wellington Town (home) vs. Wrexham; Score 2 - 4 (Wrexham wins)\n- Row 10: Fulham (home) vs. Halifax Town; Score 4 - 0 (Fulham wins)\n- Row 11: Accrington Stanley (home) vs. Torquay United; Score 0 - 1 (Torquay United wins)\n- Row 12: Brentford (home) vs. Norwich City; Score 1 - 0 (Brentford wins)\n- Row 13: Bristol Rovers (home) vs. Stockport County; Score 4 - 2 (Bristol Rovers win)\n- Row 14: Carlisle United (home) vs. Tunbridge Wells Rangers; Score 4 - 2 (Carlisle United wins)\n- Row 15: Crystal Palace (home) vs. Newark Town; Score 6 - 0 (Crystal Palace wins)\n- Row 16: Exeter City (home) vs. Coventry City; Score 1 - 1 (draw)\n- Row 17: Gateshead (home) vs. Folkestone; Score 3 - 2 (Gateshead wins)\n\n**Count of Home Team Wins:**\n\n- Home team wins in rows: 2, 3, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17.\n- Total home team wins = 9\n\n**Total Games Played (excluding replays):** 17\n\n**Evaluation of the Claim:**\n\nThe claim states that the home team wins exactly half of the games.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table and verify each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Identify matches requiring a replay due to a tie**:\n   - According to the table, there are two instances where a match was tied and required a replay: \n     - \"exeter city\" vs \"coventry city\" on 13 December 1930 with a score of 1-1.\n     - \"nelson\" vs \"york city\" on 13 December 1930 with a score of 1-1.\n\n2. **Check if replays were played in the same city as the first game**:\n   - The table does not explicitly mention the location or city for either the original matches or their replays.\n   - Without this information, we cannot confirm whether the replays occurred in the same city as the initial games.\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"in the only match that have to be replay due to a tie, it be play in the same city as the first game.\"\n   - Since there are two matches requiring replays and no information on their locations, we cannot verify if either or both were played in the same city.\n\nGiven these points, the claim is not fully supported by the table data because of insufficient location details.
