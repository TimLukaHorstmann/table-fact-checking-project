He appears in row 10.\n   - The column for \"Points\" is not explicitly named, but from the context of typical basketball statistics tables and the data structure here, it seems that the last column contains the points scored by each player.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Players' Scores:**\n   - Check all entries in the last column (assumed to be the points scored) for any value greater than 81.\n   - The relevant scores from other players are:\n     - Row 21, Column \"Points\": 53\n     - Row 22, Column \"Points\": 61\n     - Row 23, Column \"Points\": 53\n     - Row 24, Column \"Points\": 61\n     - Row 25, Column \"Points\": 50\n     - Row 26, Column \"Points\": 52\n     - Row 27, Column \"Points\": 42\n     - Row 28 (first entry), Column \"Points\": 46\n     - Row 29 (second entry, LeBron James), Column \"Points\": 51\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the other players listed have a points total greater than 81.\n   - Therefore, Kobe Bryant's score is indeed the highest among those recorded in this table.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Whether David Robinson indeed has a record of playing 48 minutes against Phoenix Suns.\n2. Whether this is the highest recorded playing time in the entire dataset.\n\nLet's break down these checks:\n\n### Step 1: Verify David Robinson's Record\n- We locate the row where the player is \"David Robinson\".\n- Check if his opponent is \"Phoenix Suns\" and the minutes played are 48.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 20 corresponds to David Robinson against Phoenix Suns with 47.9 minutes, not 48 minutes. Therefore, this condition is not fully satisfied for him playing exactly 48 minutes.\n\n### Step 2: Check for Highest Minutes Played\n- We compare all recorded minutes from each row to find the maximum.\n  \nFrom the table:\n- The highest value in the \"Minutes Played\" column is 61, which appears multiple times (rows 3, 4, 6, 22, and 24), not 48.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is incorrect on both counts: David Robinson did not play 48 minutes against Phoenix Suns, and even if he had, it wouldn't be the highest in the dataset.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"on 1 - 15 - 1989 , lebron james score 50 point against the boston celtic,\" we need to check for the following conditions in the table:\n\n1. The date should be \"1 - 15 - 1989\".\n2. The player should be LeBron James.\n3. The opponent team should be Boston Celtics.\n4. The points scored by the player should be 50.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions against the data:\n\n- **Date**: We need to find a row with the date \"1 - 15 - 1989\". There is indeed a row with this date:\n  ```\n  | 27 |    46.7 | 1 - 15 - 1989  | michael jordan    | boston celtics         |        41 | 13 - 23     | 0 - 3        | 16 - 17     |         1 |         8 |        11 |        8 |        0 |           2 |       2 |\n  ```\n\n- **Player**: The player in this row is Michael Jordan, not LeBron James.\n\n- **Opponent Team**: The opponent team is Boston Celtics, which matches the claim.\n\n- **Points Scored**: The table does not directly list points scored, but it seems to use a metric (perhaps efficiency or some other statistic) instead. However, since LeBron James is not mentioned in any row for that date, the specific points score of 50 cannot be verified from this data.\n\nSince LeBron James did not play against the Boston Celtics on January 15, 1989, according to the table, and the player listed is Michael Jordan, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this information is:\n\n- Row index: 27\n- Column name: Date\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
