Count how many games were won by the Philadelphia Barrage within this period.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n- **Time Frame:** According to the dates provided in the table, all games are indeed played between May 20 and August 12.\n\n- **Counting Wins:**\n  - May 20 vs. rattlers (home): Win\n  - May 27 vs. riptide (home): Win\n  - June 3 vs. pride (home): Win\n  - June 10 vs. machine (away): Win\n  - June 17 vs. lizards (away): Win\n  - June 24 vs. cannons (away): Loss\n  - June 29 vs. cannons (home): Loss\n  - July 8 vs. pride (away): Win\n  - July 20 vs. lizards (home): Win\n  - July 27 vs. bayhawks (home): Win\n  - August 5 vs. rattlers (away): Win\n  - August 12 vs. bayhawks (away): Win\n\nAdding up the wins, we have:\n- Wins: May 20, May 27, June 3, June 10, June 17, July 8, July 20, July 27, August 5, August 12.\n- Total number of wins = 10.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"the Philadelphia Barrage win 10 games\" between the given dates.
