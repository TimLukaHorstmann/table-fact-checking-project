Check all other players for any non-zero entries in the \"drop\" column:\n   - Vaea Anitoni: 0 drops\n   - Paul Emerick: 0 drops\n   - Todd Clever: 0 drops\n   - Philip Eloff: 0 drops\n   - Takudzwa Ngwenya: 0 drops\n   - David Fee: 0 drops\n   - Mike Hercus: 4 drops\n   - Riaan van Zyl: 0 drops\n\nFrom this examination, we see that Chris Wyles and Mike Hercus both have non-zero entries in the \"drop\" column.

    "claim": "riann van zyl have the longest time span on the united state national rugby union team and tie with only 1 other player for the greatest number of tries",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Riaan van Zyl is true or false, we need to evaluate two parts of the statement:\n\n1. **Longest Time Span**: The claim states that Riaan van Zyl has the longest time span on the team. To verify this, we need to compare the \"span\" column for all players.\n\n2. **Tied for Greatest Number of Tries**: The claim also states that Riaan van Zyl is tied with only one other player for the greatest number of tries. We'll examine the \"tries\" column to see how many tries each player scored and identify if there's a tie for the highest number.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n#### Longest Time Span:\n- **Riaan van Zyl**: 2003 - 2004\n  - Duration: 1 year\n- **Vaea Anitoni**: 1992 - 2000\n  - Duration: 8 years\n- **Paul Emerick**: 2003 - 2012\n  - Duration: 9 years\n- **Todd Clever**: 2003 - Present (assumed ongoing)\n  - Duration: More than the others listed (at least until 2023, making it 20+ years)\n- **Philip Eloff**: 2000 - 2007\n  - Duration: 7 years\n- **Takudzwa Ngwenya**: 2007 - Present (assumed ongoing)\n  - Duration: More than Riaan van Zyl (at least until 2023, making it 16+ years)\n- **Chris Wyles**: 2007 - Present (assumed ongoing)\n  - Duration: More than Riaan van Zyl (at least until 2023, making it 16+ years)\n- **David Fee**: 2002 - 2005\n  - Duration: 3 years\n- **Mike Hercus**: 2002 - 2009\n  - Duration: 7 years\n\nFrom this analysis, Riaan van Zyl does not have the longest time span.\n\n#### Greatest Number of Tries:\n- **Riaan van Zyl**: 9 tries\n- Other players with 9 or more tries:\n  - Vaea Anitoni: 26 tries\n  - Paul Emerick: 17 tries\n  - Chris Wyles: 10 tries\n  - Mike Hercus: 9 tries\n\nThere are two players tied for the greatest number of tries at 9: Riaan van Zyl and Mike Hercus.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim that Riaan van Zyl has the longest time span is false.\n- The claim that he ties with only one other player for the greatest number of tries is also false, as there are two players tied for 9 tries.\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
