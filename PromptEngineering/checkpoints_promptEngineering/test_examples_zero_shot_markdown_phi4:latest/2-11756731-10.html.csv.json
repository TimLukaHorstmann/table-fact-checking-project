    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided, let's break down the claim into its components and check each one against the relevant data in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"the series go to 2 - 0\"**  \n   - This suggests that after a game on April 16, the series score should be \"2 - 0\".\n   \n2. **\"on april 16\"**  \n   - The date of the event in question is April 16.\n\n3. **\"when the attendance 17113\"**  \n   - The attendance for the game on this date should be 17,113.\n\n4. **\"and detroit be the visiting team\"**  \n   - Detroit must be the visitor (home column should be Nashville).\n\n### Verification:\nNow let's verify each part of the claim using the table:\n\n- **Row Corresponding to April 16:**\n  - The row for April 16 is as follows:\n    | date     | visitor   | score   | home      | decision   |   attendance | series   |\n    |----------|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|----------|\n    | april 16 | detroit   | 2 - 3   | nashville | ellis      |        17113 | 2 - 2    |\n\n- **Verification of Claim Components:**\n  1. **Series Score:** The series score is \"2 - 2\", not \"2 - 0\".\n  2. **Date:** The date matches April 16.\n  3. **Attendance:** The attendance is indeed 17,113.\n  4. **Visiting Team:** Detroit is listed as the visitor.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that after the game on April 16, the series score should be \"2 - 0\". However, the actual series score for this date is \"2 - 2\". Therefore, the claim is false because the series did not go to \"2 - 0\" on April 16.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells in the table that were used to verify the claim are:\n\n- Row index: 3\n  - Column name: \"date\"\n  - Column name: \"attendance\"\n  - Column name: \"visitor\"\n  - Column name: \"series\"\n\nHere is the JSON response with the evaluation and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
