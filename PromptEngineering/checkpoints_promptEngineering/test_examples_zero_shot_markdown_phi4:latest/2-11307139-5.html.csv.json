    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada,\" we need to determine two things from the table:\n\n1. How many times is there a \"winner\" outcome?\n2. Of those \"winner\" outcomes, are any of them associated with Canada?\n\nLet's go through the table and check each relevant cell:\n\n- **Row 0:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"june 30 , 2002\", Tournament is \"lachine , canada\". This confirms a win in Canada.\n- **Row 1:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"july 17 , 2005\", Tournament is \"hamilton , canada\". Another win in Canada.\n- **Row 3:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"october 16 , 2005\", Tournament is \"victoria , mexico\".\n- **Row 4:** Outcome is \"runner - up\", so it doesn't count towards wins.\n- **Row 5:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"november 13 , 2005\", Tournament is \"toronto , canada\". Yet another win in Canada.\n- **Row 6:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"july 23 , 2006\", Tournament is \"hamilton , canada\".\n- **Row 7:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"october 1 , 2006\", Tournament is \"ashland , united states\".\n- **Row 8:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"november 12 , 2006\", Tournament is \"pittsburgh , united states\".\n- **Row 10:** Outcome is \"runner - up\", so it doesn't count towards wins.\n- **Row 11:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"august 7 , 2011\", Tournament is \"vancouver , canada\".\n- **Row 12:** Outcome is \"winner\", Date is \"march 17 , 2012\", Tournament is \"nassau , bahamas\".\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see:\n- Wozniak has won a total of 7 times (rows 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12).\n- Wozniak has won in Canada 4 times (rows 0, 1, 5, and 11).\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak is a winner 3 times but never in Canada. The table shows that Wozniak has more than 3 wins and some of those are in Canada.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- \"winner\" outcomes: rows 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12.\n- Canadian locations among winners: rows 0, 1, 5, 11.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
