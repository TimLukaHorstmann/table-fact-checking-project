    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for the relevant information about Tarso Marques.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim pertains specifically to Tarso Marques.\n   - We are interested in the number of laps he completed and any indication that he did not complete any lap.\n\n2. **Locate Tarso Marques in the Table:**\n   - By scanning through the \"driver\" column, we find Tarso Marques listed as the driver on the last row (row index 23).\n\n3. **Check Laps Completed:**\n   - In the \"laps\" column for Tarso Marques (row index 23), it is indicated that he completed 0 laps.\n\n4. **Check Additional Conditions:**\n   - The \"time / retired\" column provides additional context, showing \"spun off,\" which supports that he did not finish any lap but doesn't directly contradict the laps being zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Tarso Marques has a recorded 0 laps in the table, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nThus, the claim is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Tarso Marques' performance in the race, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. **Grid Position**: The claim states that Tarso Marques started from grid position 13.\n2. **Laps Completed**: The claim also asserts that he did not complete any laps.\n\nLet's examine these conditions against the relevant cells in the table:\n\n### Grid Position\n- Locate Tarso Marques' row: It is the last row of the table, which contains his information:\n  - **Driver**: tarso marques\n  - **Grid**: 21\n\nThe grid position for Tarso Marques according to the table is 21. The claim states that he started in grid 13, which does not match the data in the table.\n\n### Laps Completed\n- Again, look at Tarso Marques' row:\n  - **Laps**: 0\n\nThis part of the claim is true as per the table, indicating that he did not complete any laps.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The grid position stated in the claim (13) does not match the actual data from the table (21).\n- However, the statement regarding laps completed is accurate according to the table.\n\nSince one condition of the claim is false while the other is true, the entire claim cannot be considered true. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo support this conclusion, we identify the relevant cells:\n1. The grid position for Tarso Marques: \"Grid\" column in his row.\n2. The number of laps completed by Tarso Marques: \"Laps\" column in his row.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n- **Row Index**: 22 (since it is a zero-indexed list, and he is the last entry)\n- **Columns**: \"grid\" and \"laps\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
