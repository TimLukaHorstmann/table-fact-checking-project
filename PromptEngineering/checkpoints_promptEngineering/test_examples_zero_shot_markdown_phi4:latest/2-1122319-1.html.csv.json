    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"1 grid have 105 lap and a time / retire of + 6.18\", we need to examine the relevant columns in the table: `laps`, `time / retired`, and `grid`.\n\nThe claim implies that a single driver, positioned at one specific starting grid (position), completed 105 laps and has a retirement time advantage/disadvantage of \"+ 6.18\". \n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n1. **Laps Column**: We look for drivers who have completed exactly 105 laps.\n   - Lorenzo Bandini: 105 laps\n   - Richie Ginther: 105 laps\n\n2. **Time / Retired Column**: Among those who completed 105 laps, we need to check if any driver has a retirement time of \"+ 6.18\".\n   - Lorenzo Bandini's time is listed as \"2:06:18.23\", which does not match \"+ 6.18\".\n   - Richie Ginther\u2019s time is \"+ 6.18\".\n\n3. **Grid Column**: We then check if the driver with 105 laps and a retirement time of \"+ 6.18\" (Richie Ginther) started from one specific grid.\n   - Richie Ginther started at grid position 5.\n\nThe claim specifies \"1 grid have 105 lap and a time / retire of + 6.18\". The only driver fitting the criteria of completing 105 laps with a retirement time of \"+ 6.18\" is Richie Ginther, who started from grid 5. Therefore, the statement holds true for exactly one grid.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells are:\n- Richie Ginther's `laps` (row index 1)\n- Richie Ginther's `time / retired` (row index 1)\n- Richie Ginther's `grid` (row index 1)\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE and the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
