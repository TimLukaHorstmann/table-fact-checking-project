    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of the claim against the table:\n\n1. The team \"the wednesday\" appears as an opponent only once.\n2. This appearance happens during the first game of the FC season.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table to find instances where \"the wednesday\" is listed as an opponent:\n\n- Row 0: Opponents are \"small heath\".\n- Row 1: Opponents are \"small heath\".\n- Row 2: Opponents are \"small heath\".\n- Row 3: Opponents are \"small heath\".\n- Row 4: Opponents are \"notts county\".\n- Row 5: Opponents are \"notts county\".\n- Row 6: Opponents are \"the wednesday\".\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that \"the wednesday\" appears as an opponent only in row 6. This confirms the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, we need to verify if this appearance is during the first game of the FC season:\n\n- The table lists matches by date.\n- The earliest date in the table is \"12 december 1903\".\n- The match against \"the wednesday\" occurred on \"20 february 1904\".\n\nSince \"20 february 1904\" is not the earliest date, this match is not the first game of the FC season. Thus, the second part of the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim are those in row 6 under the \"opponents\" and \"date\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
