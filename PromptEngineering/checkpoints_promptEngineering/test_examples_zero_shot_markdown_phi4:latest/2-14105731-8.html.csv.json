Identify the row where the `season` column has a value of 6.\n2. Check the `format` column in that same row to see if it is 'q145'.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n- Look for the row with `season = 6`.\n- According to the table, row 222 corresponds to `episode 222`, `season 6`, and has a `format` of `q145`.\n\nNow we verify:\n\n- The format for episode 222 in season 6 is indeed 'q145', which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are:\n- Row index 22 (because it's zero-indexed), column name \"season\".\n- Row index 22, column name \"format\".\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The JSON object representing this conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row indices are zero-based as per typical programming and data representation conventions.",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to check whether there is an entry in season 6 with a format of `q245`. \n\nThe claim specifies two conditions:\n1. The season should be 6.\n2. The format should be `q245`.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rows Corresponding to Season 6:**\n   - From the table, we need to locate rows where the \"season\" column value is 6. This corresponds to episode numbers 222 and 223.\n\n2. **Check Format for These Episodes:**\n   - For Episode 222 (row index 6), the format listed in the table is `q145`.\n   - For Episode 223 (row index 7), the format listed in the table is `q146`.\n\nNeither of these formats matches `q245`, which is required by the claim.\n\nTherefore, there is no entry in season 6 with a format of `q245`. \n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 6, column \"season\" (since it confirms the season number).\n- Row index 6, column \"format\" (to check the format for episode in season 6).\n- Row index 7, column \"season\" (to confirm another entry is indeed part of season 6).\n- Row index 7, column \"format\" (to check this format for completeness).\n\nHere's the JSON object with these details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
