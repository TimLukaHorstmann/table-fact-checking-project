According to the table:\n   - Column \"pitcher\": Lists \"Jim Maloney (2) Marshall Bridges.\"\n   - Column \"inn\": States \"7th.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The information in the row matches the claim: Jim Maloney and Marshall Bridges are listed as pitchers, and it specifies that this occurred in the 7th inning.\n\nThus, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"inn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to break it down and verify each part against the table:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: The claim mentions a record set in the 7th inning. Therefore, we should look for the row where the \"inn\" column is \"7th\".\n\n2. **Verify the team and pitchers**:\n   - From the table, the only entry with \"inn\" as \"7th\" is in row 0.\n   - The \"team\" in this row is \"milwaukee braves\".\n   - The \"pitcher\" in this row is \"jim maloney (2) marshall bridges\".\n\n3. **Compare with the claim**:\n   - The claim states that the pitchers who set a record in the 7th inning are \"joel peralta robinson tejeda\".\n   - However, from the table, the pitchers for the 7th inning game are \"jim maloney (2) marshall bridges\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is incorrect because it names the wrong pitchers for the 7th inning record.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE\".
