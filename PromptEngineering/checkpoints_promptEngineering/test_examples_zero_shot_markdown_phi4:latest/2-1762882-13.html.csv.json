The calculation based on the table is:\n\n- Difference in matches: \\(1 - 4 = -3\\)\n\nSince the difference is not +5, the claim is false.\n\nNow, we provide the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
