However, there are no episodes directed by Chip Hurdt in 2009 according to this table.\n\nGiven that neither Kim Fields nor Chip Hurdt directed any episodes in 2009 based on the provided data:\n\n- Number of episodes directed by Kim Fields in 2009: 0\n- Number of episodes directed by Chip Hurdt in 2009: 0\n\nThus, the claim is false because both directors have zero episodes directed in 2009.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThese rows were specifically checked to confirm the absence of episodes directed by Kim Fields in 2009.

We need to check this column.\n\n2. **Check Rows Up to Index 139:**\n   - Row 0 (index 139 in zero-based indexing): Director is Kim Field.\n   - All other rows up to index 138 also list various directors, including Kim Field appearing in the initial rows, but we specifically care about entries beyond this row.\n\n3. **Check Rows Beyond Index 139:**\n   - Starting from row 140 (index 140), check if \"Kim Field\" appears in any of these entries under the \"Director(s)\" column.\n   - Row 140 and subsequent rows list other directors, such as Chip Hurd, Don Woodard, Adam Szymkowicz, etc., but not Kim Field.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter examining all relevant cells beyond row index 139 for the presence of \"Kim Field\" in the \"Director(s)\" column, we confirm that she does not appear as a director.
