    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Detroit have the highest visitor score, with 5 point,\" we need to inspect the table's data focusing on games where Detroit was the visiting team. We should check the 'score' column for these specific entries and determine if Detroit has a record of achieving the highest possible points (i.e., a win).\n\nIn hockey, the game results are presented in the format \"visitors - home.\" For example, a score of \"5 - 4\" means the visitors scored 5 goals, and the home team scored 4. A visitor's win is indicated by having more goals than the home team.\n\nLet's identify all instances where Detroit was the visitor:\n\n1. **January 10:** Detriot vs. Boston: Score is 1 - 2 (Detroit lost).\n2. **January 21:** Detroit vs. Anaheim: Score is 2 - 2 (Tie).\n3. **January 26:** Detroit vs. Dallas: Score is 2 - 2 (Tie).\n\nNow, let's check if there are any instances where Detroit scored more than 5 goals as visitors:\n\n- No game entry shows Detroit scoring more than 4 points in any visitor role within the table.\n\nHence, no evidence supports that Detroit achieved a score of 5 points as visitors. Therefore, the claim is false because they did not achieve the highest visitor score with 5 points.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those where Detroit was listed as the visitor and the 'score' column for these entries:\n\n- Row index 4: Score \"1 - 2\"\n- Row index 9: Score \"2 - 2\"\n- Row index 10: Score \"2 - 2\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
