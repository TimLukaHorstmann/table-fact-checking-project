We review each row individually, looking at the 'year', 'result', and 'work' columns since these indicate the time frame (2013), whether it was a nomination ('nominated'), and who or what is being nominated, respectively.\n\nNow let's check each row:\n- The first row shows \"avn award\" in 2013 with a result of \"nominated\" for the \"milf / cougar performer of the year,\" but no work (N/A) is listed. This does not confirm Brandi Love as the nominee.\n- The second row also records an \"avn award\" nomination in 2013, this time for \"most outrageous sex scene\" with Kelly Madison from \"big titty milfs.\" Again, there's no explicit mention of Brandi Love being nominated.\n- In the third and fourth rows, \"nightmoves award\" nominations are listed. The third row notes a win for \"best cougar / milf performer,\" not a nomination, hence it is irrelevant to our count. The fourth row shows a nomination for \"best ass.\" As before, no direct mention of Brandi Love.\n- The fifth row lists an \"xbiz award\" nomination in 2013 for \"web star of the year,\" with no work specified.\n\nNone of these rows explicitly state that Brandi Love was nominated; they only show general nominations without specifying her as the nominee.
