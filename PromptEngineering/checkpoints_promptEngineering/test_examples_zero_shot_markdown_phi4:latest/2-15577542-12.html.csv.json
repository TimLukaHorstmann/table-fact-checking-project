According to Row 3, this is indeed true:\n\n- The `unit` column specifies \"jiufotang formation.\"\n- The `location` column confirms it is \"china.\"\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the information in Row 3.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"unit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
