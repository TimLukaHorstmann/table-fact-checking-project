    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine specific cells in the table related to the positions and points of the song entries.\n\n### Analyzing the Claim:\nThe claim states: \"there be only a small point difference between the first place winner of the 1961 Eurovision Song Contest and the runner up.\"\n\nTo verify this, we need to identify:\n- The number of points for the first-place entry.\n- The number of points for the second-place (runner-up) entry.\n- Calculate the point difference between these two entries.\n\n### Relevant Data from the Table:\n- **First Place**: Row 14\n  - Column \"place\": 1\n  - Column \"points\": 31\n\n- **Second Place**: Row 15\n  - Column \"place\": 2\n  - Column \"points\": 24\n\n### Calculation of Point Difference:\nThe point difference between the first place and second place is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Point Difference} = 31 - 24 = 7 \\]\n\nGiven that a \"small point difference\" can be subjectively interpreted, in this context, a difference of 7 points may reasonably be considered small.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the data from the table, the claim about there being only a small point difference between the first place winner and the runner up is supported by the point difference of 7.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
