    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the date list for the item that be undergo overhaul, restoration or repair be 1956\", we need to focus on the row where the description is \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\" and check the corresponding date.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n1. Look for the row with the description \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\".\n2. Check the date in that specific row.\n3. Verify if the date matches 1956 as stated in the claim.\n\nHere is the relevant information from the table:\n\n- The row where the description is \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\" has the following entries:\n  - Date: undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\n\nThe date for this item is not specified as a year but rather described with the same phrase. Therefore, it does not match 1956.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because the date for the item undergoing overhaul, restoration, or repairs is not 1956; instead, it is described textually and matches none of the specific years given in other rows.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"description\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
