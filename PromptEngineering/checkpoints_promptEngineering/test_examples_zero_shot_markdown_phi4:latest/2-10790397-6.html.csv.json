Identify the match details for each venue from the table:\n   - **Brunswick Street Oval** is associated with the row where \"fitzroy\" played against \"essendon\". The crowd number provided is 14,000.\n   - **Arden Street Oval** is associated with the row where \"north melbourne\" played against \"collingwood\". The crowd number provided is 18,000.\n\n2. Compare the crowd sizes:\n   - Crowd at Brunswick Street Oval: 14,000\n   - Crowd at Arden Street Oval: 18,000\n\n3. Evaluate the claim:\n   - The claim states that the crowd in Arden Street Oval was 4,000 less than the crowd who watched at Brunswick Street Oval.\n   - If this were true, then the difference should be such that \\( \\text{Crowd at Brunswicks} = \\text{Crowd at Arden} + 4000 \\).\n   - However, we find \\( 18,000 - 14,000 = 4,000 \\), meaning the crowd in Arden Street Oval was actually 4,000 more than that in Brunswick Street Oval, not less.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n- Row index 2 (fitzroy vs essendon) for Brunswicks Street Oval's crowd size.\n- Row index 5 (north melbourne vs collingwood) for Arden Street Oval's crowd size.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
