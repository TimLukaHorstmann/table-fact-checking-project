The years Gordan Giri\u010dek was in Orlando.\n2. The years Drew Gooden was in Orlando.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Gordan Giri\u010dek's Years in Orlando:**\n   - From the table, locate \"gordon giri\u010dek\" and check his \"years in orlando.\"\n   - According to the table:\n     ```\n     | player          | nationality   | position         | years in orlando   | school / club team     |\n     |:----------------|:--------------|:-----------------|:-------------------|:-----------------------|\n     | gordan giri\u010dek  | croatia       | guard            | 2003 - 2004        | cska moscow ( russia ) |\n     ```\n   - Gordan Giri\u010dek was in Orlando from 2003 to 2004.\n\n2. **Drew Gooden's Years in Orlando:**\n   - From the table, locate \"drew gooden\" and check his \"years in orlando.\"\n   - According to the table:\n     ```\n     | player          | nationality   | position         | years in orlando   | school / club team     |\n     |:----------------|:--------------|:-----------------|:-------------------|:-----------------------|\n     | drew gooden     | united states | forward          | 2003 - 2004        | kansas                 |\n     ```\n   - Drew Gooden was in Orlando from 2003 to 2004.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Gordan Giri\u010dek was in Orlando from 2003 to 2004.\n- Drew Gooden was in Orlando from 2003 to 2004.\n\nThe claim states that both were in Orlando from 2001 to 2003. However, according to the table, neither player was in Orlando during this entire period (2001 to 2003). They both started their time with Orlando only in 2003 and continued until 2004.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Gordan Giri\u010dek: \"years in orlando\" column at row index 5.\n- For Drew Gooden: \"years in orlando\" column at row index 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
