Rows 0 through 28 all have a \"status\" of \"running.\" These rows are relevant because they support the part of the claim stating that all district representatives except one have a running status.\n2. Row 29 (Amo Houghton) has a \"status\" of \"retiring,\" which supports the exception mentioned in the claim.\n\nBased on this examination, the claim is fully supported by the data provided:\n\n- All other representatives are marked as \"running.\"\n- Amo Houghton is not running; he is retiring.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE.
