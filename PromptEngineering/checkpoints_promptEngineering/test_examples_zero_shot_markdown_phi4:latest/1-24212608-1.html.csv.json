We need to find the row corresponding to this year.\n   \n2. **Viewership Verification**: Once we identify the correct row for the year 2010, we must check if the \"viewers (millions)\" value is indeed 9.37.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Row Index 5 corresponds to the year 2009 with viewers at 7.65 million.\n- **Row Index 6** corresponds to the year 2010 with viewers at 9.37 million.\n- Row Index 7 corresponds to the year 2011 with viewers at 10.67 million.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that:\n- The row for the year 2010 (Row Index 6) shows that there were indeed 9.37 million viewers.\n\nThus, both components of the claim are verified against the table data:\n\n- **Year**: 2010 matches with Row Index 6.\n- **Viewership**: 9.37 million is correctly listed for this year in the relevant cell.\n\nSince the conditions in the claim match perfectly with the data from the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify:\n- Row Index 6, \"broadcast date\": Confirms the year as 2010.\n- Row Index 6, \"viewers (millions)\": Verifies that viewers are indeed 9.37 million.\n\nThe JSON object with the result and relevant cell information is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
