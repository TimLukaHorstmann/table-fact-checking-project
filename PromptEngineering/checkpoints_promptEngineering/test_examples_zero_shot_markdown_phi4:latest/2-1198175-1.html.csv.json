We need to compare his weight to all other players' weights given in the table.\n\nLet's examine each condition:\n\n1. **Joseph Barksdale's high school**:\n   - The table does not provide information about the high schools attended by any of the players, including Joseph Barksdale. Therefore, we cannot verify this part of the claim with the data provided.\n\n2. **Heaviest player**:\n   - We must identify Joseph Barksdale\u2019s weight and compare it to other players' weights.\n   - According to the table, Joseph Barksdale's weight is 325 lbs (in the \"weight (lbs)\" column for his row).\n   - Now, we need to check if there are any other players with a greater weight:\n     - Tom Seabron: 215 lbs\n     - Harlan Huckleby: 200 lbs\n     - Guy Frazier: 217 lbs\n     - Thomas Sidney Sims: 288 lbs\n     - Pat Ivey: 255 lbs\n     - AJ Ofodile: 260 lbs\n     - Clarence Williams: 193 lbs\n     - Vernon Gholston: 264 lbs\n     - Will Campbell: 311 lbs\n\n   Upon examining the weights, we see that Thomas Sidney Sims has a weight of 288 lbs and Will Campbell has a weight of 311 lbs. Both are less than Joseph Barksdale's 325 lbs.\n\nSince no player in the table weighs more than Joseph Barksdale, he is indeed the heaviest player according to the data provided.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- We cannot verify the high school information from the table.\n- The weight comparison supports that Joseph Barksdale is the heaviest player.\n\nGiven that one part of the claim (high school) cannot be verified and thus remains unconfirmed, the overall claim must be considered false due to incomplete verification.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"weight (lbs)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Only Joseph Barksdale's weight row index and column name are relevant for verifying the heaviest player claim.
