Noticeably absent is \"David 'Dave' Seville\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The role of David 'Dave' Seville in 1987 indicates that there was an actor playing this character.\n   - In the 2011 production, the role of David 'Dave' Seville is not listed among the actors.\n\nSince \"David 'Dave' Seville\" is explicitly mentioned for the 1987 film but absent for the 2011 film, it implies different casting or absence of that specific role in 2011.

The producer value here is also \"yes\". This contradicts part of the claim, as it states this year should have a different producer.\n   - For **2011 (\"alvin and the chipwrecked\")**, the producer value is \"yes\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table shows that all movies, including 2009, had the same producer (\"yes\").\n   - Thus, the claim that the 2009 movie does not have the same producer as the others is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to focus on each row's \"producer\" column since it is directly related to the claim.\n   - The relevant cells include every row in the table under the \"producer\" column, which are all marked \"yes\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the final determination and relevant cells for verification are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"producer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"producer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"producer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"producer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"producer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"producer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"producer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"there be 3 actor that play alvin seville between 1987 and 2011\", we need to examine the table for entries where actors played roles associated with Alvin Seville.\n\nLet's break down what needs to be checked:\n\n1. The column \"actor\" should have a value of \"yes\", indicating involvement of an actor.\n2. The role must include \"alvin seville\".\n\nNow, let's inspect each row from the table for these conditions:\n\n- **1987**: \n  - Actor: Yes\n  - Role includes Alvin Seville (Alvin Seville Simon Seville David 'Dave' Seville)\n  \n- **1999**:\n  - Actor: Yes\n  - Role includes Alvin Seville (Alvin Seville Simon Seville David 'Dave' Seville)\n\n- **2000**:\n  - Actor: Yes\n  - Role includes Alvin Seville (Alvin Seville Simon Seville David 'Dave' Seville)\n\n- **2005**:\n  - Actor: Yes\n  - Role includes Alvin Seville (Alvin Seville Simon Seville David 'Dave' Seville)\n\n- **2007**:\n  - Actor: Yes\n  - Role includes Alvin Seville (Alvin Seville Simon Seville)\n  \n- **2009**:\n  - Actor: Yes\n  - Role includes Alvin Seville (Alvin Seville Simon Seville)\n\n- **2011**:\n  - Actor: Yes\n  - Role includes Alvin Seville (Alvin Seville Simon Seville)\n\nNow, let's count how many distinct actors played the role of \"alvin seville\". \n\nThe table does not specify individual actor names but implies that there are a set number of roles being portrayed. Since each entry where the role includes \"Alvin Seville\" has an actor involved, we need to determine if different people played these roles across the films.\n\nFrom typical knowledge about \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\", Alvin was consistently voiced by Jason Lee starting with \"The Chipmunk Adventure\" (1987) until at least \"Chipwrecked\" (2011). Therefore, there is only one distinct actor playing Alvin Seville over this period in these movies.\n\nThus, the claim that there were three different actors who played Alvin Seville between 1987 and 2011 is false.\n\nThe relevant rows for verifying the roles are all those where \"actor\" is \"yes\" and the role includes \"alvin seville\". These are rows 0 through 6 (inclusive).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"role\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
