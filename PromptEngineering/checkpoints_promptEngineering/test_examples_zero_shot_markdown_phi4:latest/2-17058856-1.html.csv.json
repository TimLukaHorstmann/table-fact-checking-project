This event is attributed to the team \"met\".\n\nLet's examine each condition using the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Time Check**: The claim states that this occurs at \"18:27\". We need to find a row in the table where the time column matches \"18:27\".\n  \n  By looking at the \"time\" column:\n  - Row 2 has the value \"18:27\".\n\n- **Score Check**: For the time \"18:27\", we check if the score is listed as \"0 - 2 met\".\n\n  In row 2, the \"score\" column has the value \"0 - 2 met\", which matches the claim.\n\n- **Team Check**: We need to ensure that this goal was scored by the team \"met\".\n  \n  In row 2, the \"team\" column is \"met\", confirming it aligns with the claim.\n\nSince both conditions match the details in row 2 of the table:\n\n1.
