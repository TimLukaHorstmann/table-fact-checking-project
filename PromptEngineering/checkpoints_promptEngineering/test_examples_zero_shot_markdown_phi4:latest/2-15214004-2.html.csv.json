Verify who is actually associated with pick number 24.\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step using the data provided in the markdown table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Joe Germanese's Pick Number\nFrom the table, we need to locate the row where the player \"joe germanese\" appears:\n- The relevant row for \"Joe Germanese\" is found at `row_index` 13 (zero-indexed).\n- In this row, under the column named \"pick\", the value is 27.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Player with Pick Number 24\nNext, we need to find out which player has pick number 24:\n- The relevant row for `pick = 24` is found at `row_index` 11 (zero-indexed).\n- In this row, under the column named \"player\", the value is \"andrew jacobson\".\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom these findings:\n- Joe Germanese's pick number is 27, not 24.\n- The player with pick number 24 is Andrew Jacobson.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"joe germanese be the player with the number of 24 pick\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n1. Row index 13, column \"pick\" (to find Joe Germanese's pick number).\n2. Row index 11, column \"player\" (to confirm who has pick number 24).\n\nNow we can present the result in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
