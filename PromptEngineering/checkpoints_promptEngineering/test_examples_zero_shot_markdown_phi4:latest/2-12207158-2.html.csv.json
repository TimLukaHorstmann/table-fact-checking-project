Let's examine each relevant column in the table.\n\n1. **Record Column:** We are looking for a row where the record is \"4 - 5\".\n2. **Opponent Column:** For that particular row, we need to check if the opponent is \"yankees\".\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **April 3:** Record is \"1 - 0\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 5:** Record is \"1 - 1\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 6:** Record is \"1 - 2\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 7:** Record is \"2 - 2\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 8:** Record is \"2 - 3\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 9:** Record is \"2 - 4\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 10:** Record is \"3 - 4\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 11:** Record is \"4 - 4\" (Not relevant)\n- **April 12:** **Record is \"4 - 5\"**, Opponent is \"yankees\" (Relevant row found)\n- April 14: Record is \"5 - 5\" (Not relevant)\n- April 15: Record is \"5 - 6\" (Not relevant)\n- April 16: Record is \"6 - 6\" (Not relevant)\n- April 17: Record is \"6 - 7\" (Not relevant)\n- April 18: Record is \"6 - 8\" (Not relevant)\n- April 19: Record is \"6 - 9\" (Not relevant)\n\nFrom the above examination, we found that on April 12, when the record was \"4 - 5\", the opponent was indeed \"yankees\". Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 10 for the \"record\" column.\n- Row index 10 for the \"opponent\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if the conditions specified in it hold true based on the data provided in the table.\n\n**Claim**: \"when the record be 4 - 5, the opponent be yankee on april 11\"\n\n1. **Check for Record \"4 - 5\"**:\n   - We first need to locate any row in the table where the \"record\" is \"4 - 5\".\n   - By examining the table:\n     - Row 8 has a record of \"2 - 3\".\n     - Row 9 has a record of \"2 - 4\".\n     - Row 10 has a record of \"3 - 4\".\n     - **Row 11** has a record of **\"4 - 4\"**.\n     - Row 12 has a record of \"4 - 5\". This is the row that matches our condition.\n\n2. **Check Opponent and Date for Record \"4 - 5\"**:\n   - On Row 12, where we found the record \"4 - 5\":\n     - The opponent listed is \"yankees\".\n     - The date listed is April 12.\n   \n3. **Verify Conditions of the Claim Against Date April 11**:\n   - According to the claim, when the record is \"4 - 5\", it should occur on April 11 against the Yankees.\n   - However, as we found in step 2, the record of \"4 - 5\" occurs on April 12, not April 11.\n\nSince the date mentioned in the claim does not match with the actual data from the table for when the record is \"4 - 5\", the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells to verify this claim are:**\n- Row 12 for the fields \"record\" and \"opponent\".\n- Row 11 for the field \"date\" to confirm that it is April 12, not April 11.\n- Row 10 for the date verification prior to record \"4 - 5\".\n\nTherefore, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
