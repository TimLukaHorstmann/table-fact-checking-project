Identify the episode titled \"gary and allison brooks\" within the table.\n2. Check if this episode has the highest number of viewers in comparison to other episodes listed.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant condition step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Episode Title\nThe claim states that the most viewed episode is titled \"gary and allison brook.\" The table entry for the episode is actually titled \"gary and allison brooks\" (note the extra 's'), but this seems to be a minor typographical discrepancy in the claim. For our purposes, we'll consider them as referring to the same episode.\n\n- **Row 10** of the table contains:\n  - Episode: \"gary and allison brooks\"\n  \n### Step 2: Compare Viewership\nWe need to verify that this particular episode has more viewers than any other episodes in the season. According to the table, viewership data is provided under the column labeled \"viewers.\"\n\n- **Row 10** has:\n  - Viewers: 8.14 million\n\nNow we must compare this number against all other viewer counts:\n\n| Episode                                           | Viewers |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| pilot                                             | 6.84    |\n| gary gets boundaries                              | 6.97    |\n| gary marries off his ex                           | 7.43    |\n| gary gets his stuff back                          | 7.71    |\n| gary breaks up his ex - wife and girlfriend       | 7.85    |\n| gary meets the gang                               | 6.44    |\n| gary and allison 's restaurant                    | 6.71    |\n| **gary and allison brooks**                       | **8.14**|\n| gary gives thanks                                 | 7.72    |\n| gary goes first                                   | 8.03    |\n| gary toughens up tom                              | 7.55    |\n| gary dates louise 's teacher                      | 7.07    |\n| gary moves back in                                | 7.07    |\n| gary and dennis' sister                           | 6.86    |\n| gary 's ex - brother - in - law                   | 7.26    |\n| gary uses his veto                                 | 7.71    |\n| gary hooks up allison                              | 7.57    |\n| gary and the trophy                                | 7.3     |\n| gary and his half brother                          | 6.66    |\n| gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal             | 5.55    |\n\nUpon inspection, \"gary and allison brooks\" with 8.14 million viewers is indeed the episode with the highest viewership.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim that \"in season 1 of gary unmarried, the most viewed episode of the season be title gary and allison brook\" holds true given the information in the table.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells include the episode title and viewership count of \"gary and allison brooks\" along with a few other episodes' viewership counts to confirm it has the highest number.",

The episode airing on May 20, 2009, should be identified as an episode in Season 1 of \"Gary Unmarried.\"\n2. This episode should have the lowest viewership compared to all other episodes listed.\n\nLet's examine these conditions one by one using relevant data from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Identify if May 20, 2009, is a Season 1 Episode\n\n- The table lists episodes with air dates ranging from September 24, 2008, to May 20, 2009.\n- All these episodes are listed under the same \"timeslot\" of Wednesday at 8:30 PM, suggesting they belong to the same season.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to assume that all episodes listed in this table are part of Season 1, including the episode airing on May 20, 2009. \n\n### Condition 2: Check Viewership for Lowest Numbers\n\n- We need to compare the viewership numbers (in millions) across all episodes.\n- The relevant column is \"viewers.\"\n\nLet's list the viewership numbers from each row:\n\n1. September 24, 2008: 6.84 million\n2. October 1, 2008: 6.97 million\n3. October 8, 2008: 7.43 million\n4. October 15, 2008: 7.71 million\n5. October 22, 2008: 7.85 million\n6.

May 6, 2009: 6.66 million\n20. **May 20, 2009: 5.55 million**\n\nThe episode on May 20, 2009, has the lowest viewership of 5.55 million, which is indeed lower than any other episode's viewership in this table.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n- The episode from May 20, 2009, is part of Season 1.\n- It has the lowest viewership of all episodes listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all new episode of gary unmarried season 1 air on wednesday at 8:30 pm\" is true or false, we need to verify two aspects for each episode in the table:\n\n1. **All episodes are from Season 1**.\n2. **All episodes aired on a Wednesday at 8:30 PM**.\n\nThe relevant columns from the table are \"episode\" and \"air date\". \n\nLet's examine each row to see if it meets these criteria:\n\n- The column \"episode\" provides titles of episodes, which indirectly suggests they belong to Season 1 due to context.\n- The column \"timeslot\" specifies the air day and time.\n\nThe claim does not explicitly mention checking for the season number in a separate column but infers that all listed episodes are from Season 1. Therefore, we will assume this is correct unless contradicted by any explicit data in the table.\n\nFor each episode:\n\n- **Timeslot Check**: We need to verify that every entry in the \"timeslot\" column reads \"wednesday 8:30 pm\". \n- If all entries satisfy this condition, then the claim holds true.\n\nHere's a row-by-row verification of the \"timeslot\":\n\n1. Row 0: \"timeslot\" is \"wednesday 8:30 pm\".\n2. Row 1: \"timeslot\" is \"wednesday 8:30 pm\".\n3. Row 2: \"timeslot\" is \"wednesday 8:30 pm\".\n4. Row 3: \"timeslot\" is \"wednesday 8:30 pm\".\n5.
