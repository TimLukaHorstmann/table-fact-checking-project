We will search for the row where the title matches \"Remember Me\", checking if its corresponding \"no in series\" value is indeed 20.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n- The episode titled \"remember me\" appears at `row_index` 10 (using zero-based indexing).\n- In this row, under the column \"title\", the content is \"remember me\".\n- Under the column \"no in series\" for the same row, the value is 20.\n\nBoth conditions match the claim.
