The lowest difference is held by position 6, not position 5.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- All entries in the \"difference\" column are relevant to determine which has the lowest value.\n  \n  | Position | Difference |\n  |----------|------------|\n  | 1        | 17         |\n  | 2        | 14         |\n  | 3        | -4         |\n  | 4        | -10        |\n  | 5        | 0          |\n  | 6        | -17        |\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
