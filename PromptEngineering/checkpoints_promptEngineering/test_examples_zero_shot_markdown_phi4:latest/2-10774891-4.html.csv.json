    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to carefully examine the relevant details in the table concerning the specified date and venue.\n\nThe claim states: \"the VFL played at Victoria Park on 11 May 1957.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- We are looking for a match that took place on **\"11 May 1957\"**.\n- We also need to identify matches that were held at the venue **\"Victoria Park.\"**\n\nLet's evaluate each row in the table against these criteria:\n\n1. Row Index 0:\n   - Date: \"11 May 1957\"\n   - Venue: \"glenferrie oval\"\n   - This match does not satisfy the venue condition.\n\n2. Row Index 1:\n   - Date: \"11 May 1957\"\n   - Venue: \"windy hill\"\n   - This match does not satisfy the venue condition.\n\n3. Row Index 2:\n   - Date: \"11 May 1957\"\n   - Venue: \"Victoria Park\"\n   - This match satisfies both conditions (date and venue).\n\n4. Row Index 3:\n   - Date: \"11 May 1957\"\n   - Venue: \"princes park\"\n   - This match does not satisfy the venue condition.\n\n5. Row Index 4:\n   - Date: \"11 May 1957\"\n   - Venue: \"junction oval\"\n   - This match does not satisfy the venue condition.\n\n6. Row Index 5:\n   - Date: \"11 May 1957\"\n   - Venue: \"punt road oval\"\n   - This match does not satisfy the venue condition.\n\nThe only relevant row that satisfies both conditions (the date and the venue) is Row Index 2, which matches the claim about a VFL game at Victoria Park on 11 May 1957. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE,\" with relevant cells corresponding to Row Index 2 for both the date and venue columns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify rows associated with Collingwood.\n2. Check if Collingwood is listed under the \"away team\" column for those entries.\n\nHere's a step-by-step evaluation based on the provided table:\n\n- The table has several columns: \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" \"crowd,\" and \"date.\"\n- We are particularly interested in the \"away team\" column to verify if Collingwood is listed there, as well as the \"date\" column to ensure it matches 11 May 1957.\n\nNow, let's check each row:\n\n1. Row 0:\n   - Home Team: Hawthorn\n   - Away Team: Melbourne\n   - Date: 11 May 1957\n\n2. Row 1:\n   - Home Team: Essendon\n   - Away Team: Footscray\n   - Date: 11 May 1957\n\n3. **Row 2** (relevant row for Collingwood):\n   - Home Team: Collingwood\n   - Away Team: South Melbourne\n   - Date: 11 May 1957\n\n4. Row 3:\n   - Home Team: Carlton\n   - Away Team: Geelong\n   - Date: 11 May 1957\n\n5. Row 4:\n   - Home Team: St Kilda\n   - Away Team: North Melbourne\n   - Date: 11 May 1957\n\n6. Row 5:\n   - Home Team: Richmond\n   - Away Team: Fitzroy\n   - Date: 11 May 1957\n\nFrom this examination, we see that Collingwood is listed as the home team in row 2, not the away team.\n\nThus, the claim \"Collingwood play as the away team on 11 May 1957\" is FALSE.
