    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim that \"the blue jays play a total of 28 games in July,\" we need to examine the table provided for each entry under the date column corresponding to the month of July and count the number of rows. Each row represents one game played.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant information:\n\n1. The dates range from July 1 to July 31, indicating that all entries are within the month of July.\n2. Each row in the table corresponds to a separate game played by the Blue Jays on a specific date.\n\nNow, let's count the number of rows (games) listed under these dates:\n- Rows for each day from July 1 to July 31 are present, with the exception of July 26, which is missing. \n- Counting all the rows listed, we have entries for the following days in July: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 (two games), 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31.\n\nThis results in a total of 28 distinct rows or game entries for July.

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about the table, we need to evaluate whether the team identified as playing against the Angels six times in a row during July is valid based on the data provided.\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"in the month of july, the blue play against the angle 6 time in a row.\"\n   - Here, \"the blue\" refers to the team whose game records are given.\n   - \"Against the angle\" means playing games against the Angels.\n\n2. **Analyze the Table:**\n   - We need to find consecutive entries (i.e., rows) where the opponent is \"angels\".\n   - We will check for sequences of six or more games in a row against the Angels during July.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant column for opponents is the \"opponent\" column.\n   - Only the dates within July are relevant to this analysis.\n\n4. **Examine Each Row in July:**\n   - **July 1**: Opponent is Athletics\n   - **July 2**: Opponent is Angels (start of a sequence)\n   - **July 3**: Opponent is Angels (continuation of the sequence)\n   - **July 4**: Opponent is Angels (continuation of the sequence)\n   - **July 5**: Opponent is Mariners (end of the sequence)\n   - **July 12-15**: Opponent is Athletics\n   - **July 16**: Opponent is Angels (start of a new sequence)\n   - **July 17**: Opponent is Angels (continuation of the sequence)\n   - **July 18**: Opponent is Angels (continuation of the sequence)\n\n5. **Count Consecutive Games Against the Angels:**\n   - The first sequence against the Angels occurs on July 2, 3, and 4, which consists of three consecutive games.\n   - The second sequence starts on July 16 and continues through July 18, consisting of three consecutive games.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no period in July where there are six or more consecutive games against the Angels.\n\n7. **Result:**\n   - Since we did not find any six-game streak against the Angels, the claim is false.\n\n8. **List Relevant Cells:**\n   - Rows relevant to checking this claim are those with \"angels\" listed as opponents.\n   - These rows have indices 1 through 4 and 15 through 18.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
