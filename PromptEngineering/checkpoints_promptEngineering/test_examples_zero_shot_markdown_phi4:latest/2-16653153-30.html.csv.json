    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"south dragons win the most games in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to analyze which columns and data points are relevant:\n\n1. **Understanding the Columns**:\n   - The `lost` column indicates how many games each team has lost.\n   - There's no direct column for the total number of games played or won by each team in this table.\n   - However, teams' performance can be indirectly inferred through other metrics like `last 5`, `streak`, and percentage values.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Games**:\n   - We need to calculate the total number of games played by each team. Since there is no direct column for wins or losses against all opponents, we infer it from the win-loss record and other statistics.\n   - The table has columns `% pts` (percentage points) and `% won` (win percentage), which can help us estimate how many games were potentially played.\n\n3. **Using Win Percentage**:\n   - To find out if \"south dragons\" won the most games, we use the `% won` column:\n     - A higher win percentage suggests a higher number of wins relative to total games.\n   - The table shows `south dragons` with a 73.33% win rate.\n\n4. **Comparing Win Percentages**:\n   - Compare this percentage with other teams' percentages to see if it is the highest:\n     - Melbourne Tigers: 66.67%\n     - New Zealand Breakers: 60%\n     - Perth Wildcats: 56.67%\n     - Townsville Crocodiles: 56.67%\n     - Adelaide 36ers: 50%\n     - Wollongong Hawks: 36.67%\n     - Sydney Spirit: 36.67%\n     - Cairns Taipans: 36.67%\n     - Gold Coast Blaze: 26.67%\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - \"South dragons\" have the highest win percentage among all teams listed in this table.\n   - Therefore, based on available data and assuming a consistent number of games played by each team relative to their win-loss records, it can be concluded that they won the most games.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The relevant cells are those with the `lost` and `% won` values for \"south dragons\" as well as all teams to confirm which has the highest win percentage.\n   \nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"% won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gold coast blaze have the best record in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to evaluate which metrics indicate a team's performance record.\n\nIn sports statistics, common indicators of a team\u2019s overall performance include:\n- The number of games lost (\"lost\").\n- Percentage points (\"% pts\").\n- Percentage won (\"% won\").\n\nLet's analyze these columns for each team:\n\n1. **\"Lost\" Column**: This shows the number of games lost by each team. A lower number indicates better performance.\n2. **\"% Pts\" Column**: Higher percentage points suggest a stronger record in terms of scoring and performance overall.\n3. **\"% Won\" Column**: Higher percentage won directly indicates more games won relative to total games played, reflecting an overall better season record.\n\nFor the claim \"gold coast blaze have the best record,\" we need to verify if the Gold Coast Blaze has the lowest number of losses and/or the highest \"% pts\" and \"% won.\"\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Gold Coast Blaze**:\n  - Lost: 22\n  - % Pts: 93.45\n  - % Won: 26.67\n\nComparing these values with other teams:\n\n1. **Lost**: \n   - The Gold Coast Blaze has the highest number of losses (22), worse than all other teams.\n   \n2. **% Pts**:\n   - The Gold Coast Blaze is second to last in percentage points (93.45).\n   \n3. **% Won**:\n   - The Gold Coast Blaze has one of the lowest percentages won (26.67).\n\nNo team has more losses, lower % pts, or a smaller % won than the Gold Coast Blaze. Therefore, they do not have the best record in any performance metric listed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"gold coast blaze have the best record in the season\" is FALSE because they are at the bottom for losses and percentages indicating their overall poor performance compared to other teams. \n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- The number of losses (column: \"lost\") for each team.\n- The percentage points (column: \"% pts\").\n- The percentage won (column: \"% won\").\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
