The number of matches Vasselin played.\n2. Whether he won all these matches (since it mentions winning).\n3. An implication that \"fought hard\" is related to the score or difficulty in winning each match.\n\nLet's break down the relevant information from the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Score: 6 - 4, 6 - 4\n  - This suggests a straightforward win with no tiebreaks or close sets.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Score: 6 - 7 (5 - 7), 6 - 3, 1 - 0, ret.\n  - Retired indicates the opponent could not continue; this suggests Vasselin won but doesn't necessarily imply a hard-fought match.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Outcome: Runner-up\n  - Score: 6 - 3, 6 - 7 (8 - 10), 6 - 7 (6 - 8)\n  - This was not a win for Vasselin, so it contradicts the claim of winning all games.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Score: 7 - 6 (11 - 9), 4 - 6, 6 - 1\n  - The first set had a tiebreak won by Vasselin, indicating a closely contested set.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Outcome: Winner\n  - Score: 6 - 4, 6 - 3\n  - Similar to Row 0, this was a straightforward win without tight sets or tiebreaks.\n\nFrom the table, we see that Vasselin did not win all his matches (he lost in Row 2). Additionally, only two matches involved closely contested sets that could be interpreted as \"fought hard\" (Rows 1 and 3).\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that Vasselin won all 5 games is FALSE because he was a runner-up in one of the matches.\n- The notion of fighting hard applies only partially to some matches, not all.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
