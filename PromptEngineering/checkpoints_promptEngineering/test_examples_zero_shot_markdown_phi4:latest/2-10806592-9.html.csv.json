This means they scored 11 goals plus an additional fraction of a goal.\n   - For Fitzroy: The score is 16.12 (108), indicating 16 goals.\n   - For St Kilda: The score is 14.12 (96), indicating 14 goals.\n   - For Richmond: The score is 15.14 (104), indicating 15 goals.\n   - For Footscray: The score is 13.9 (87), indicating 13 goals.\n   - For North Melbourne: The score is 11.5 (71), indicating 11 goals plus an additional fraction of a goal.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Fitzroy, St Kilda, Richmond, and Footscray all have scores greater than 11 goals.
