The table provides information about different seasons and their respective classes.\n\nLet's examine the row corresponding to the year 2009:\n\n- **Row for 2009:**\n  - Season: 2009\n  - Class: 125cc\n  - Team, Motorcycle, Type, Races, Wins, Podiums, Poles, Fastest Laps, Points, and Position are provided as additional details.\n\nThe class for the year 2009 is \"125cc\", not \"moto2\". Therefore, the claim that \"the season of 2009 have a moto2 class\" is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this:\n- The cell in row index 8 (since it starts from 0) under the column \"class\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
