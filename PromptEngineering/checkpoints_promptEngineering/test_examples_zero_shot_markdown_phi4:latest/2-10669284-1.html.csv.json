    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the data in the table and focus specifically on the column titled \"score in the final\" for each match result.\n\nThe claim states:\n- There are 5 matches that go 3 sets.\n- There are 10 matches that last just 2 sets.\n\nWe'll analyze each row's \"score in the final\" to verify these conditions:\n\n1. **Matches Going 3 Sets:**\n   - A match goes 3 sets if there are three scores listed, regardless of what those scores are. Let\u2019s identify all such instances from the table:\n     - 1970 South Orange, US: `3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 7 - 6` (winner)\n     - 1971 Bournemouth, England: `6 - 8 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6` (runner-up) \u2013 this match goes more than 3 sets.\n     - 1972 Caracas, Venezuela: `6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6` (winner)\n     - 1975 Charlotte, US: `6 - 3 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 4` (winner)\n     - 1977 Indianapolis, US: `6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3` (winner)\n     - 1977 Santiago, Chile: `5 - 7 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 1` (winner)\n\n   We've identified six matches that go to three sets. This is more than the five mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Matches Lasting Just 2 Sets:**\n   - A match lasts just 2 sets if there are only two scores listed:\n     - 1969 Buenos Aires, Argentina: `w / o` (winner) \u2013 this doesn't count as a set-based match.\n     - 1972 Brussels, Belgium: `7 - 9 , 3 - 6` (runner-up)\n     - 1972 French Open, Paris: `3 - 6 , 6 - 8 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6` \u2013 this goes more than 2 sets.\n     - 1972 Indianapolis, US: `2 - 6 , 3 - 6` (runner-up)\n     - 1973 Buenos Aires, Argentina: `6 - 7 , 3 - 6` (runner-up)\n     - 1974 Washington DC, US: `5 - 7 , 1 - 6` (runner-up)\n     - 1974 US Open, New York: `3 - 6 , 3 - 6` (runner-up)\n     - 1974 Buenos Aires, Argentina: `4 - 6 , 3 - 6` (runner-up)\n     - 1976 Berlin, Germany: `7 - 5 , 6 - 1` (winner)\n     - 1976 Santiago, Chile: `6 - 3 , 7 - 6` (winner)\n\n   We've identified ten matches that last just two sets. This part of the claim is correct.\n\nAfter examining all rows for these conditions:\n- The number of three-set matches is six, not five as claimed.\n- The number of two-set matches is ten, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSince one condition (three-set matches) does not match the claim, we conclude that the claim is false.

We must check if there's a tournament entry for this location in 1977.\n\n3. **Outcome:** The claim states that there should be two wins (\"match play for a winner\") in Murcia, Spain, in 1977.
