    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and identify which teams won their matches without going to a penalty shootout.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - Each row represents a match between two teams.\n   - The columns provide details about the aggregate score (`agg`), results of each leg (`1st leg`, `2nd leg`), and any additional notes like penalties or extra time.\n\n2. **Identify Matches with Penalties:**\n   - Look for matches where the result includes \"( p )\" indicating a penalty shootout.\n   - The row with \"manchester city\" shows \"2 - 2 (4 - 3 p)\", indicating they won via penalties.\n\n3. **Check Each Row for Penalty Shootouts:**\n   - **Row 0:** werder bremen vs saint-\u00e9tienne\n     - Aggregate: 3 - 2\n     - No mention of penalties.\n   - **Row 1:** cska moscow vs shakhtar donetsk\n     - Aggregate: 1 - 2\n     - No mention of penalties.\n   - **Row 2:** udinese vs zenit st petersburg\n     - Aggregate: 2 - 1\n     - No mention of penalties.\n   - **Row 3:** paris saint-germain vs braga\n     - Aggregate: 1 - 0\n     - No mention of penalties.\n   - **Row 4:** dynamo kyiv vs metalist kharkiv\n     - Aggregate: 3 - 3 (a)\n     - \"a\" indicates away goals, not penalties.\n   - **Row 5:** manchester city vs aalborg bk\n     - Aggregate: 2 - 2 (4 - 3 p)\n     - Includes penalties \"( p )\".\n   - **Row 6:** marseille vs ajax\n     - Aggregate: 4 - 3\n     - No mention of penalties.\n   - **Row 7:** hamburg vs galatasaray\n     - Aggregate: 4 - 3\n     - No mention of penalties.\n\n4. **Identify Teams Winning Without Penalties:**\n   - From the analysis, teams that won without going to penalties are:\n     - werder bremen (row 0)\n     - shakhtar donetsk (row 1)\n     - udinese (row 2)\n     - paris saint-germain (row 3)\n     - marseille (row 6)\n     - hamburg (row 7)\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"manchester city and aalborg bk be the only team to win without go to penalty.\"\n   - Manchester City won via penalties, so this part of the claim is false.\n   - Aalborg BK did not win; they lost on aggregate after penalties.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because there are multiple teams that won without penalties, and neither Manchester City nor Aalborg BK fits the criteria stated in the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5 (manchester city vs aalborg bk) for the penalty shootout.\n- Rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 for identifying teams that won without penalties.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
