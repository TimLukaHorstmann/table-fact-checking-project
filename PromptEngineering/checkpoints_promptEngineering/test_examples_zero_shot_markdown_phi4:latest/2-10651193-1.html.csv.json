    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261,\" we need to check each entry in the table for players who attended Tennessee State and examine their overall draft ranks.\n\n1. **Identify Players from Tennessee State:**\n   - We will look at the column \"school / club team\" to find entries that mention \"tennessee state.\"\n\n2. **Check Draft Rank for These Players:**\n   - For each player identified, we need to check their corresponding value in the \"overall\" column.\n   - According to the claim, no player from Tennessee State should have a draft rank lower than 261.\n\n3. **Examine Relevant Data in the Table:**\n\n   |   round |   overall | player           | position         | school / club team   |\n   |--------:|----------:|:-----------------|:-----------------|:---------------------|\n   |       1 |        20 | willis adams     | wide receiver    | houston              |\n   |       2 |        40 | lawrence johnson | defensive back   | wisconsin            |\n   |       2 |        47 | sam claphan      | offensive tackle | oklahoma             |\n   |       3 |        70 | jim ramey        | defensive end    | kentucky             |\n   |       4 |        95 | matt miller      | offensive tackle | colorado             |\n   |       5 |       124 | rich dimler      | defensive tackle | usc                  |\n   |       6 |       151 | clinton burrell  | defensive back   | lsu                  |\n   |       6 |       163 | jim ronan        | defensive tackle | minnesota            |\n   |       7 |       183 | cody risien      | offensive tackle | texas a&m            |\n   |       8 |       204 | kent perkov      | defensive end    | san diego state      |\n   |       9 |       234 | carl mcgee       | linebacker       | duke                 |\n   |       9 |       241 | curtis weathers  | linebacker       | mississippi          |\n   | **10** | **261**   | **john henry smith** | **wide receiver**    | **tennessee state**      |\n   |      11 |       287 | randy poeschl    | defensive end    | nebraska             |\n   |      12 |       315 | dee methvin      | center           | tulane               |\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - The only player from Tennessee State in the table is \"john henry smith\" with an overall draft rank of 261.\n   - There are no other players from Tennessee State listed, and therefore no ranks lower than 261.\n\nSince there are no players from Tennessee State with a draft rank below 261, the claim holds true based on the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
