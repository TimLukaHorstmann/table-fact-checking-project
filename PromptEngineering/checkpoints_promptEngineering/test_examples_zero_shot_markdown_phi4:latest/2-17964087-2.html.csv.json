    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Victor Lo Yik-Kee be the youngest when he be appoint\" is true or false, we need to examine the ages at appointment for all individuals listed in the table and compare them to Victor Lo Yik-Kee's age.\n\n1. **Identify Victor Lo Yik-Kee\u2019s Age**: \n   - Find the row corresponding to \"Lo Yik-Kee, Victor\".\n   - The age at appointment for Victor is 55 years old.\n\n2. **Compare Ages**:\n   - We need to check if there is any individual younger than 55 when appointed.\n   - Review each entry in the column \"age at appointment\".\n\n3. **List of Ages**:\n   - Chan Chi-Yuen, Paul: 28\n   - Cheung, Raymond Man-To: 46\n   - Choy Siu-Min, Linda: 37\n   - Lo Yik-Kee, Victor: 55\n   - Mok Yee-Tuen, Zandra: 35\n   - Ng Kit-Shuen, Katherine: 34\n   - Tsui Ying-Wai, Caspar: 31\n   - Yip Kan-Chuen, Frankie: 38\n   - Young Chit-On, Jeremy: 32\n\n4. **Determine the Youngest**:\n   - The youngest age listed is 28 (Chan Chi-Yuen, Paul).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Victor Lo Yik-Kee was appointed at 55 and there are individuals who were appointed younger than him, the claim that he was the youngest is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this are those under the column \"age at appointment\" for all rows.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
