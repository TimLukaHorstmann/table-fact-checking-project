    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Viswanathan Anand's rating and related attributes from the given table, we need to verify each condition in the claim against the data provided.\n\nThe claim is: \"viswanathan anand have a rating greater than 2753 , with a prev less than 4 , and + 4 as the chng.\"\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. **Rating greater than 2753**:\n   - We need to check Viswanathan Anand's rating from the table.\n   - In the table, his rating is 2803 (found in the \"rating\" column, row index 0).\n\n2. **Previous rank less than 4**:\n   - We need to verify if his previous rank was less than 4.\n   - His previous rank (\"prev\") is 2 (found in the \"prev\" column, row index 0).\n\n3. **Change of +4**:\n   - We need to confirm that his rating change (\"chng\") is +4.\n   - The change is indeed +4 (found in the \"change\" column, row index 0).\n\nAll conditions are met based on the data from the table:\n\n- Rating: 2803 (greater than 2753)\n- Previous rank: 2 (less than 4)\n- Change: +4\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the table data, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 0, column name \"rating\"\n- Row index 0, column name \"prev\"\n- Row index 0, column name \"change\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prev\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"change\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
