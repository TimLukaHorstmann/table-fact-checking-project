Thus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\".\n\nFinally, identify the relevant cells used to verify this claim:\n- The 'week' column at row index 0 (to confirm it's week 1).\n- The 'attendance' column at row index 0 (to check the attendance number).\n\nHere is the JSON response with the required format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

To evaluate this, we will examine each row under the \"attendance\" column and compare their values.\n\nThe relevant cells from the \"attendance\" column are as follows:\n\n- Row 1: Attendance = 62936\n- Row 2: Attendance = 57236\n- Row 3: Attendance = 69126\n- Row 4: Attendance = 62820\n- Row 5: Attendance = 39091\n- Row 6: Attendance = 62984\n- Row 7: Attendance = 63903\n- Row 8: Attendance = 62938\n- Row 9: Attendance = 62915\n- Row 10: Attendance = 59117\n- Row 11: Attendance = 50415\n- Row 12: Attendance = 62870\n- Row 13: Attendance = 50845\n- Row 14: Attendance = 62870\n\nUpon comparing these values, we find that the highest attendance is actually 69126, which occurs in row 3.
