Note that there is a minor difference in spelling: \"las vega\" vs. \"las vegas,\" but this appears to be a typographical error in the claim rather than an actual mismatch with the table's data.\n\nGiven these checks, both conditions are satisfied based on the table's information.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells in the markdown table:\n\n- **Row Index**: Shabazz Muhammad is located at row index 3 (considering zero-based indexing).\n  \n- **Column Names**:\n  - \"college\" for verifying attendance at UCLA.\n  - \"hometown\" for checking his hometown.\n\nHere are the relevant cell details:\n\n- College: Row index 3, column name \"college\"\n- Hometown: Row index 3, column name \"hometown\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the table data.
