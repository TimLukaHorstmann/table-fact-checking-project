    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the indianapolis circuit happen on the 30th of august\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on two specific columns: \"date\" and \"grand prix\". The goal is to find a row where both conditions in the claim are met:\n\n1. The \"date\" column should show \"30 - 31 august\".\n2. The \"grand prix\" column should contain \"indianapolis grand prix\".\n\nLet's examine each relevant cell:\n\n- **Row Index 11:**\n  - Column \"date\": The value is \"16 august\", which does not match the condition.\n  - Column \"grand prix\": The value is \"czech republic grand prix\", which does not match the condition.\n\n- **Row Index 12:**\n  - Column \"date\": The value is \"30 august\", which matches the first part of the condition.\n  - Column \"grand prix\": The value is \"indianapolis grand prix\", which matches the second part of the condition.\n\nSince Row Index 12 meets both conditions in the claim, it fully supports the statement that the Indianapolis circuit happened on the 30th of August. Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cell information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grand prix\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
