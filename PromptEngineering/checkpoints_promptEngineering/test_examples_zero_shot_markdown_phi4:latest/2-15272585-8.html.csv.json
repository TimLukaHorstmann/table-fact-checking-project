    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"galina voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than 1 time except in 6 june 2006,\" we need to examine the 'opponent' column of each row in the table and check for repetitions, with an exception on the date \"6 June 2006.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Opponents:**\n   - Row 0 (Date: 28 January 2003): Opponent is Matea Mezak.\n   - Row 1 (Date: 29 June 2003): Opponent is Oleksandra Kravets.\n   - Row 2 (Date: 3 October 2003): Opponent is Roberta Vinci.\n   - Row 3 (Date: 8 November 2005): Opponent is Lilia Osterloh.\n   - Row 4 (Date: 6 June 2006): Opponent is Alice Canepa.\n\n2. **Check for Repeated Opponents:**\n   - None of the opponents from rows 0, 1, 2, and 3 appear more than once in the table, except potentially on 6 June 2006.\n   \n3. **Exception Date (6 June 2006):**\n   - On this date, Galina Voskoboeva played against Alice Canepa.\n\n4. **Verify if Alice Canepa Appears Elsewhere:**\n   - Checking the entire table, Alice Canepa only appears on 6 June 2006 and not in any other row.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since no opponent appears more than once except for an allowance on 6 June 2006, and Alice Canepa does not appear elsewhere, the condition of playing the same opponent more than one time (except on 6 June 2006) is satisfied. \n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- All rows are relevant to verify that no other opponent was repeated except for the allowed exception date.\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Galina Voskoboeva is true or false, we need to analyze the information provided in the table and compare it with each part of the claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Win Rate on Clay vs. Hard Court:**\n   - The claim states that she has an equal win rate between both clay and hard courts.\n   \n2. **Never Win:**\n   - The claim also suggests that she never wins, which contradicts the previous statement about having a win rate.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- The table lists outcomes (winner or runner-up), dates, tournaments, surfaces, opponents, and scores for Galina Voskoboeva's matches.\n  \n#### Relevant Data from the Table:\n1. **Clay Court Matches:**\n   - **Row 3:** Runner-up on clay against Roberta Vinci (score: 3-6, 4-6).\n   - **Row 5:** Winner on clay in Cuneo, Italy against Alice Canepa (score: 6-1, 6-2).\n\n2. **Hard Court Matches:**\n   - **Row 1:** Runner-up on hard (i) at Tipton against Matea Mezak (score: 6-4, 4-6, 4-6).\n   - **Row 2:** Winner on hard (i) in Mont-de-Marsan against Oleksandra Kravets (score: 6-4, 6-2).\n   - **Row 4:** Runner-up on hard at Pittsburgh against Lilia Osterloh (score: 6-7, 4-6).\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Win Rate Comparison:**\n   - On clay courts, she has 1 win and 1 loss.\n   - On hard courts, she has 1 win and 2 losses.\n   - Therefore, her win rate is not equal between the two surfaces.\n\n2. **Never Win Statement:**\n   - The table shows that she has won matches on both clay (Row 5) and hard (Row 2) courts.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim is false because Galina Voskoboeva does have wins, and her win rate is not equal between clay and hard courts.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Clay court results: Rows 3 and 5.\n- Hard court results: Rows 1, 2, and 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

She lost 4 points in total.\n- Against Alice Canepa (Row Index 4), Galina also won. She lost 3 points in total.\n\nSince Galina did not lose these matches, the claim about losing \"on average\" with only 4 points is incorrect based on this data. \n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are those containing match outcomes and scores against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa:\n\n- Row Index 1: Columns \"outcome\", \"opponent\", and \"score\".\n- Row Index 4: Columns \"outcome\", \"opponent\", and \"score\".\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
