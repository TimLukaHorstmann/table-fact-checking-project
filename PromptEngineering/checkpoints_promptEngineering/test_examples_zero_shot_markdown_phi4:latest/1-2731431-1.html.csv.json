    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the alpine peak Finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2 be mont blanc's parent while mont blanc be the parent peak of arcalod,\" we must verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2 is a parent peak of Mont Blanc**.\n2. **Mont Blanc is a parent peak of Arcalod**.\n\nWe will use the \"Parent Peak\" column to check these relationships, as it indicates which peaks are considered parents of others listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Check if Finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2 is Mont Blanc's parent:**\n\n   - Locate Finsteraarhorn in the table:\n     - Row Index: 9\n     - Column \"Parent Peak\": finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2\n\n   - Locate Mont Blanc in the table:\n     - Row Index: 3\n     - Column \"Parent Peak\": monte rosa\n\n   From this, it is clear that Mont Blanc's parent peak is listed as \"monte rosa,\" not Finsteraarhorn. Therefore, Finsteraarhorn is not the parent of Mont Blanc.\n\n2. **Check if Mont Blanc is Arcalod's parent:**\n\n   - Locate Arcalod in the table:\n     - Row Index: 31\n     - Column \"Parent Peak\": mont blanc\n\n   - We have already identified that Mont Blanc has its own parent peak as \"monte rosa\" (from Step 1).\n\nFrom these checks, only the second condition is satisfied: Mont Blanc is indeed listed as Arcalod's parent. However, since the first condition is not met (Finsteraarhorn is not listed as a parent of Mont Blanc), the entire claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim does not fully hold true based on the information provided in the table. Therefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Parent Peak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Parent Peak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Parent Peak\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
