    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the shortest game of the 1977 World Series being played on October 13th, let's analyze the table provided and compare it against the claim:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**: The claim states that \"the shortest game of the 1977 world series be play on october 13th.\"\n\n2. **Table Details**:\n   - The table lists games with their respective dates, locations, times, and attendance.\n   - We are interested in verifying whether there is a game listed for October 13th and if it indeed was the shortest one.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - Rows of interest based on date are as follows:\n     - Row 1: October 11\n     - Row 2: October 12\n     - Row 3: October 14 (after October 13)\n     - Row 4: October 15\n     - Row 5: October 16\n     - Row 6: October 18\n\n   None of the rows indicate a game on October 13th.\n\n4. **Comparing Game Times**:\n   - The relevant column for verifying the claim about the shortest game time is \"time\".\n   - Shortest time from available data:\n     - October 12, 1977: 2 hours and 27 minutes (Row 2)\n     - Other times are longer than this.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no row corresponding to a game on October 13th.\n   - Therefore, there can be no claim that the shortest game was played on that date based on the given data.\n   - The claim is FALSE because it assumes a game occurred on a date not represented in the table.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this are those containing the dates and times of each game, particularly focusing on October 12th for comparison since it's the closest date with the shortest game time.\n   - Rows with relevant columns for evaluating the claim: \n     - Row 2 (October 12) for \"date\" and \"time\"\n     - All other rows need checking against this time to ensure no shorter time exists.\n\nBased on this evaluation, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
