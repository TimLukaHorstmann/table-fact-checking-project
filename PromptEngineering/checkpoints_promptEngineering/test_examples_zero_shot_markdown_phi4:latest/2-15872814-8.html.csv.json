    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"April 18 have the score higher than W 109 - 101 (ot),\" we need to evaluate whether there is a game on April 18 with a higher score in terms of points scored by the team compared to the specific game mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the target game:** The game referenced for comparison has the following score: \"W 109 - 101 (OT)\". This corresponds to Game 75 against Atlanta, where the Toronto Raptors won with a score of 109-101 in overtime.\n\n2. **Check all games on April 18:** We need to determine if there was any game played on April 18 and then compare its score to see if it is higher than 109 points scored by the team mentioned.\n\n3. **Reviewing the table for April 18:**\n   - The table includes games from April 1 to April 20.\n   - There are no entries in the table for a game on April 18, meaning no game was played on that date by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since there is no game recorded on April 18, it cannot have a score higher than any other game's score, including \"W 109 - 101 (OT)\" from Game 75 against Atlanta.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there was no game played on April 18 to compare scores with. \n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those corresponding to the dates and scores of games listed in the table.
