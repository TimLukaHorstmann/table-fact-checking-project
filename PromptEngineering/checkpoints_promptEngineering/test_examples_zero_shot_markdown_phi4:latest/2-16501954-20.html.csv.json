This indicates that the first position is taken by whatever entry appears at this row.\n\n2. **Name Column**:\n   - Row 0 of the `name` column contains \"ec amberg\", which matches the name mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince \"ec amberg\" is listed in the first row under both the `position` column (with a value of 1) and the `name` column, the claim that \"ec amberg have the first position\" is verified as TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- Row index 0, Column: `position`\n- Row index 0, Column: `name`\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
