Determine the highest position:\n   - The best position among all teams is 3rd, achieved by \"epsilon euskadi\" in Row 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true since \"epsilon euskadi\" indeed holds the highest position out of all the teams listed.\n\nRelevant cells for this verification include those from rows where team names and positions are mentioned:\n\n- Rows related to \"epsilon euskadi\": \n  - Row 3: Position 6th\n  - Row 4: Position 3rd\n\n- Other rows to confirm no better position exists:\n  - Rows 0, 1 (Boutsen energy racing)\n  - Row 5 (International dracoracing), position 7th\n  - Row 6 (Art grand prix), not classified\n  - Row 7 (ISR Racing), position 13th\n  - Rows 8, 9, 10 (Racing Engineering), positions 23rd, 11th, 12th\n  - Row 11 (M2 Competition), position 7th\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
