    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze it step by step using the provided table.\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states: \n\"national university of ireland be the only group of origin make up mostly of member from 2 party\"\n\n#### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: We need to focus on the \"national university of ireland\" column, as it pertains to the group of origin mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Check the number of members for each party in this column**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il: 1 member\n   - Fine Gael: 1 member\n   - Labour Party: 0 members\n   - Clann na Talmhan: 0 members\n   - Independent: 1 member\n\n3. **Determine if these members are from mostly two parties**:\n   - There are three parties (Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, and Independent) that have members in the \"national university of ireland\" column.\n   - Since there are more than two parties represented, it cannot be said that this group is made up mostly of members from only two parties.\n\n4. **Check if any other groups could potentially meet this condition**:\n   - We need to verify for all columns whether any other group is predominantly made up of members from exactly two parties.\n   - For each column, check the distribution of members across different parties.\n\n#### Verification for Other Columns:\n\n- **Administrative Panel**: Members are spread across Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, and Independent (3 parties).\n- **Agricultural Panel**: Members are spread across Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, and Independent (4 parties).\n- **Cultural and Educational Panel**: Members are spread across Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael (2 parties).\n- **Industrial and Commercial Panel**: Members are spread across Fianna F\u00e1il, Labour Party, and Independent (3 parties).\n- **Labour Panel**: All members are from the Labour Party (1 party).\n- **University of Dublin**: All members are from Independent (1 party).\n- **Nominated by the Taoiseach**: Members are spread across Fianna F\u00e1il, Labour Party, and Independent (3 parties).\n\nFrom this analysis, only the \"cultural and educational panel\" column is made up mostly of members from exactly two parties (Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"national university of ireland be the only group of origin make up mostly of member from 2 party\" is false because:\n\n- The national university of ireland has members from three different parties.\n- Another column, \"cultural and educational panel,\" also consists mostly of members from exactly two parties.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those in the \"national university of ireland\" column for each party, as well as checking other columns to ensure no other group meets the condition:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"national university of ireland\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national university of ireland\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"national university of ireland\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"national university of ireland\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national university of ireland\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
