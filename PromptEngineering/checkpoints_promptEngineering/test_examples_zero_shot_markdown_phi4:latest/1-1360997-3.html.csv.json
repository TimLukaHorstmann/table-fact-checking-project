    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Whether D. Beadman was the jockey at Warwick Farm.\n2. Whether the weight was 57.8 kg.\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the relevant data in the table:\n\n- **Jockey Verification:**\n  - The column \"venue\" tells us where each race took place. We need to check for races held at \"Warwick Farm.\"\n  - On reviewing the table, we find two entries with \"Warwick Farm\" as the venue:\n    - Row 1 (Index 1): Warwick Stakes on 24 Aug 2002 with D. Beadman as the jockey.\n    - Row 9 (Index 8): Chipping Norton Stakes on 15 Mar 2003 with D. Beadman as the jockey.\n\n  From these entries, it's confirmed that D. Beadman was indeed the jockey at Warwick Farm for races held there.\n\n- **Weight Verification:**\n  - The column \"weight (kg)\" provides the weight for each race.\n  - We need to check if any of these weights are recorded as 57.8 kg.\n  - Reviewing the table, the weights listed are consistently either 57.5 kg or 58 kg, with no entry showing a weight of 57.8 kg.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The first part of the claim is TRUE because D. Beadman was indeed the jockey at Warwick Farm.\n- The second part of the claim is FALSE because there is no race listed with a weight of 57.8 kg.\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the entire claim to be true, and one condition (weight) is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table are:\n\n1. Row index 1, column \"venue\" (for Warwick Farm verification).\n2. Row index 1, column \"jockey\" (confirming D. Beadman as jockey at Warwick Farm).\n3.
