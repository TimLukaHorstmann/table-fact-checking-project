Its location is \"hickory, north carolina.\"\n\nLet's examine the relevant columns for these conditions: `type`, `founded`, `left`, and `location`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Type (Private):**\n   - We look for rows where the type column is \"private\".\n\n2. **Founded Year (1839):**\n   - Among those identified as private, we check if any were founded in 1839.\n\n3. **Left Year (1975):**\n   - From these, further refine to find if they left their conference in 1975.\n\n4. **Location (Hickory, North Carolina):**\n   - Finally, ensure that the location is \"hickory, north carolina.\"\n\n### Checking Each Row:\n\n- **Row Index 0: anderson university** \n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1911 (Not 1839)\n  \n- **Row Index 2: catawba college**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1851 (Not 1839)\n\n- **Row Index 3: coker college**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1908 (Not 1839)\n\n- **Row Index 4: east carolina university**\n  - Type: public\n\n- **Row Index 5: elon university**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1889 (Not 1839)\n\n- **Row Index 6: guilford college**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1837 (Not 1839)\n  \n- **Row Index 7: high point university**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1924 (Not 1839)\n  \n- **Row Index 8: lenoirrhyne university**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1891 (Not 1839)\n  - Left: 1975 (Matches, but not founded in 1839)\n\n- **Row Index 10: mars hill college**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1856 (Not 1839)\n\n- **Row Index 11: newberry college**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1856 (Not 1839)\n\n- **Row Index 13: presbyterian college**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1880 (Not 1839)\n  \n- **Row Index 14: queens university of charlotte**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1857 (Not 1839)\n\n- **Row Index 15: st andrews university**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1958 (Not 1839)\n  \n- **Row Index 17: wingate university**\n  - Type: private\n  - Founded: 1896 (Not 1839)\n\n**Specific Row Check for Hickory, North Carolina with Matching Criteria:**\n\n- **Row Index 8: lenoirrhyne university**\n  - Location: hickory, north carolina\n  - Left Year: 1975 (Matches)\n  - Founded Year: 1891 (Does not match 1839)\n\nNo row matches all conditions simultaneously.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is no institution that was private, founded in 1839, left its conference in 1975, and located in Hickory, North Carolina. \n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
