    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether each player listed in the table comes from either a college program or a junior/club team.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that every player must come from either \"college\" or \"junior / club team\". This implies the cell under the column \"college / junior / club team (league)\" should contain one of these terms for each player.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each row in the table, look at the entry in the \"college / junior / club team (league)\" column.\n   - Check if this entry contains either \"college\" or any indication of a \"junior/club team\".\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - Row 1: \"new england jr coyotes ( ejhl )\" - Contains \"jr\", indicating a junior team.\n   - Row 2: \"centennial high school (minn)\" - Does not explicitly mention \"college\" or \"junior/club\".\n   - Row 3: \"prince edward island rocket ( qmjhl )\" - Contains \"qmjhl\", indicating a junior league.\n   - Row 4: \"tri - city storm ( ushl )\" - Contains \"ushl\", indicating a junior league.\n   - Row 5: \"plymouth whalers ( ohl )\" - Contains \"ohl\", indicating a junior league.\n   - Row 6: \"spi\u0161sk\u00e1 nov\u00e1 ves (slovakia)\" - Does not explicitly mention \"college\" or \"junior/club\".\n   - Row 7: \"halifax mooseheads (qmjhl)\" - Contains \"qmjhl\", indicating a junior league.\n   - Row 8: \"cape breton screaming eagles (qmjhl)\" - Contains \"qmjhl\", indicating a junior league.\n   - Row 9: \"trail smoke eaters ( bchl )\" - Contains \"bchl\", indicating a junior league.\n   - Row 10: \"vancouver giants ( whl )\" - Contains \"whl\", indicating a junior league.\n   - Row 11: \"brewster bulldogs (emjhl)\" - Contains \"emjhl\", indicating a junior league.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Rows 2 and 6 do not explicitly mention either \"college\" or any form of \"junior/club team\".\n- Therefore, the claim is **FALSE** because not every player comes from either a college program or a junior/club team.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are those in the column \"college / junior / club team (league)\" for rows 2 and 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team (league)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team (league)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
