    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant information in the table concerning Charles Hooks and Weldon N Edwards. The claim states that they were the last incumbents elected in the 1822 North Carolina US House of Representatives election.\n\n1. **Identify Rows for Charles Hooks and Weldon N Edwards:**\n   - **Charles Hooks**: Found in row 4.\n     - Relevant information:\n       - \"first elected\" column: 1816 (special) 1819\n       - \"result\" column: re-elected\n   - **Weldon N Edwards**: Found in row 5.\n     - Relevant information:\n       - \"first elected\" column: 1816 (special)\n       - \"result\" column: re-elected\n\n2. **Verify Election Year and Status as Incumbents:**\n   - Both Charles Hooks and Weldon N Edwards were re-elected, meaning they were incumbents in the election mentioned.\n   - The election year is not explicitly stated in each row, but we can infer it from their \"result\" status (re-elected), indicating participation in a specific election cycle.\n\n3. **Assess if They Were the Last Incumbents Elected:**\n   - The claim suggests that no other incumbent was re-elected after them in this particular election.\n   - We must check other rows to ensure no other incumbents were listed as re-elected in this same context (1822 election).\n\n4. **Examine Other Rows for Re-elections:**\n   - Row 1, 3, 6, and 9 also show incumbents being re-elected:\n     - Hutchins G Burton (Row 1)\n     - Romulus M Saunders (Row 9)\n     - John Long (Row 10)\n   - Since other incumbents were also re-elected, Charles Hooks and Weldon N Edwards cannot be the last ones elected.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because there are other incumbents listed as re-elected in the same election cycle.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be only woman candidate in the 1822 North Carolina U.S. House of Representatives election\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\nThe relevant parts of the claim pertain to:\n1. The year of the election (1822).\n2. The presence of any female candidates.\n3. Whether there are any male candidates.\n\nLet's break down each part of the table:\n\n- **Year**: The table includes data from 1821 and possibly results reflecting elections up until 1822, but it doesn't specify which rows directly relate to the 1822 election date specifically. However, all given entries reflect incumbents elected in or before 1821.\n  \n- **Candidates**: We need to inspect the \"candidates\" column for any mention of female candidates. The names listed do not indicate gender. Since there is no explicit mention of a woman candidate and historical context suggests male-dominated elections, we must assume no female candidates unless specified.\n\nNow, let's verify each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: No indication of female candidates; both Hutchins G Burton (re-elected) and Jesse A Dawson are likely male.\n2. **Row 1**: Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr is noted, suggesting a male candidate following the retirement of William S Blackledge.\n3. **Row 2**: Charles Hooks and John D Jones are likely male candidates.\n4. **Row 3**: Weldon N Edwards's re-election indicates no other candidates.\n5. **Row 4**: Candidates mentioned (John Culpepper and Alexander McNeill) suggest males, given the historical context.\n6. **Row 5**: Romulus M Saunders is noted as having a 100% vote, implying no other candidates.\n7. **Row 6**: John Long and John MacClelland are likely male candidates.\n\nSince there are no indications of any female candidates in this table, and all listed candidates are historically presumed to be male:\n\n- The claim that \"there be only woman candidate\" is not supported by the table as it shows male candidates.\n  \nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response based on our analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
