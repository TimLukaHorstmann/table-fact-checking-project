The table includes several bouts with different results:\n- KO/TKO indicates a decisive victory, so no scoring point difference is applicable.\n- SD (split decision) means that the final scores were close enough to result in a split decision.\n\nThe relevant bout according to the claim is against Ricky Hatton on 2009-05-02, which ended in a \"sd 12 / 12.\" This indicates a split decision with potentially significant scoring differences between judges' scorecards. \n\nTo verify if this bout had the biggest difference in final scoring points, we would need to compare it with other bouts that went to a decision. In the table:\n- The bout against Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez on 2008-03-15 also ended in \"sd 12 / 12.\"\n\nThe table does not provide explicit scorecards for each judge, only indicating that these fights were decided by split decisions.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"from 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao fought in the same weight category,\" we need to examine the relevant cells in the table that specify the weight categories for each fight within this time period. Specifically, we should look at the \"titles\" column since it indicates the weight division under which each fight was held.\n\nLet's analyze the entries:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Date: 1998-12-04\n   - Titles: WBC Flyweight (112 lbs)\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Date: 1998-12-04\n   - Titles: Lineal Flyweight (112 lbs)\n\n3. **Row 2**: \n   - Date: 2001-06-23\n   - Titles: IBF Super Bantamweight (122 lbs)\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Date: 2003-11-15\n   - Titles: The Ring Featherweight (126 lbs)\n\n5. **Row 4**: \n   - Date: 2008-03-15\n   - Titles: WBC Super Featherweight (130 lbs)\n   \n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Date: 2008-03-15\n   - Titles: The Ring Junior Lightweight (130 lbs)\n\n7. **Row 6**: \n   - Date: 2008-06-28\n   - Titles: WBC Lightweight (135 lbs)\n\n8. **Row 7**: \n   - Date: 2009-05-02\n   - Titles: The Ring Junior Welterweight (140 lbs)\n\nFrom the analysis above, it's clear that Manny Pacquiao fought in different weight categories from 1998 to 2009. These include Flyweight, Super Bantamweight, Featherweight, Super Featherweight, Lightweight, and Junior Welterweight.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data in the table regarding Manny Pacquiao's bouts and their score points.\n\nThe claim states: \"Manny Pacquiao have the biggest difference in score point during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We are interested in rows where the opponent is Marco Antonio Barrera.\n   - From the table, we find that Manny Pacquiao fought Marco Antonio Barrera on 2003-11-15 (Row 3).\n\n2. **Understand \"Score Point Difference\"**:\n   - The score point difference refers to the margin by which a decision was made in favor of one boxer over another.\n   - In boxing, a score can be \"KO\" (Knockout), \"TKO\" (Technical Knockout), or \"SD\" (Split Decision). \n     - \"KO\" means the opponent was knocked out, and there's no score point difference because it wasn't decided by judges' scores.\n     - \"TKO\" also does not provide a direct score point difference unless specified.\n     - \"SD\" indicates a split decision where judges' scores differ. The specific score points for each judge are needed to determine the margin.\n\n3. **Examine Row 3 (Marco Antonio Barrera Bout)**:\n   - Result: \"tko 11 / 12\"\n   - This means Manny Pacquiao won by technical knockout in the 11th round of a scheduled 12-round fight.\n   - A \"TKO\" result does not provide score point differences because it's not decided by judges' scores.\n\n4. **Compare with Other Bouts**:\n   - We need to identify any other bouts where the result was a decision (e.g., \"SD\") and calculate the score point difference if available.\n   - Row 5: Result is \"sd 12 / 12\" against Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez.\n     - This indicates a split decision. However, specific judges' scores are not provided in the table to calculate the exact score point difference.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the bout with Marco Antonio Barrera was a \"TKO,\" there is no score point difference to compare.\n   - Without specific judges' scores for other bouts, we cannot definitively say that any bout had a larger score point difference than the one against Marco Antonio Barrera.\n\nBased on the information provided in the table, the claim is not supported because the result of the bout with Marco Antonio Barrera was a \"TKO,\" which does not involve a score point difference. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
