    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts of it:\n\n1. There is a three-player tie at 2nd place.\n2. These players have scores even to par.\n\nLet's break down these steps based on the table data provided in markdown format:\n\n- **Checking for a three-player tie at 2nd place:**\n  - The label \"place\" indicates the position of the player(s).\n  - We need to check if there are three players listed under \"t1\", which stands for tied first place.\n  - In the table, players \"david graham\" and \"sandy lyle\" both have a \"place\" of \"t1\".\n\n- **Checking for an even to par score:**\n  - The column \"to par\" indicates whether scores are under (-), over (+), or even (e) in relation to par.\n  - Players at the tied positions should be checked to see if they are \"even to par\".\n  - For players \"david graham\" and \"sandy lyle\", both have a \"to par\" value of \"-1\".\n\nSince only two players are listed as tied for first place (t1), not three, the claim is false. Furthermore, even though these two players share the same score, it is not even to par; they are at \"-1\". \n\nTherefore, the claim that there is a three-player tie at 2nd place and they are even to par is incorrect.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- The row indices for \"david graham\" and \"sandy lyle\" (0 and 1 respectively) are relevant as they confirm the number of players tied for first place.\n- Their respective \"to par\" column values are also checked, confirming that neither is even to par.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the table provided in markdown format, we must carefully examine the information relevant to it:\n\n**Claim:** \"There be 2 players tied for the lead, with a score of 2 under par.\"\n\n1. **Identify Players Tied for the Lead:**\n   - The claim mentions there are two players tied for the lead.\n   - In golf tournament standings, ties at the top positions typically share the same \"place\" value and have scores better than others.\n\n2. **Examine the \"place\", \"score\", and \"to par\" Columns:**\n   - Look at the rows with `place = t1` since this signifies a tie for first place.\n   - Check their respective \"score\" and \"to par\" values to confirm if they meet the criteria of being 2 under par.\n\n3. **Verify Conditions in the Claim:**\n   - The players in `t1` position are David Graham and Sandy Lyle.\n   - Both have a score listed as `68 + 71 = 139`.\n   - Their \"to par\" value is `- 1`.\n\n4. **Analyze the Specifics of the Claim:**\n   - Being \"2 under par\" implies that their score should be two strokes less than the par for the course.\n   - In golf terminology, \"under par\" means the number of strokes taken was fewer than the standard par; thus, `- 1` indicates they are one stroke below par, not two.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- The claim is incorrect because both players tied for first place have a score of `-1` to par (one under), not `2` under par as stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nTo verify the claim, these cells are pertinent:\n- The rows where `place = t1`.\n- Columns `\"player\"`, `\"score\"`, and `\"to par\"` for those rows to confirm who is tied and their score details.\n\nHere's how they map:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
