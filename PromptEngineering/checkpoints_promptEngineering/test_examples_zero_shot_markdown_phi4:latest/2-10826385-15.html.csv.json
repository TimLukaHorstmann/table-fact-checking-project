    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table regarding the away team scores.\n\n**Claim:** \"More than half of the away teams have a score greater than 10.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Away Teams and Their Scores:**\n   - We look at the columns \"away team\" and \"away team score.\"\n   - Extract away team scores:\n     - Row 0: St Kilda, Score = 9.11 (65)\n     - Row 1: North Melbourne, Score = 9.12 (66)\n     - Row 2: Richmond, Score = 17.9 (111)\n     - Row 3: South Melbourne, Score = 8.15 (63)\n     - Row 4: Geelong, Score = 15.8 (98)\n     - Row 5: Melbourne, Score = 8.10 (58)\n\n2. **Convert Scores to Determine if Greater than 10 Goals:**\n   - A score in the format \"X.Y\" means X goals and Y behinds. To determine if a team scored more than 10 goals, we only need to check the whole number part of their score:\n     - Row 0: St Kilda, Score = 9 goals (9.11), not greater than 10\n     - Row 1: North Melbourne, Score = 9 goals (9.12), not greater than 10\n     - Row 2: Richmond, Score = 17 goals (17.9), greater than 10\n     - Row 3: South Melbourne, Score = 8 goals (8.15), not greater than 10\n     - Row 4: Geelong, Score = 15 goals (15.8), greater than 10\n     - Row 5: Melbourne, Score = 8 goals (8.10), not greater than 10\n\n3. **Count Teams with Scores Greater Than 10 Goals:**\n   - From the above conversions:\n     - Richmond and Geelong have scores greater than 10 goals.\n     - Total teams meeting this condition: 2 out of 6.\n\n4. **Determine if More Than Half Meet the Condition:**\n   - There are 6 away team games in total.\n   - \"More than half\" would require at least 4 teams to have a score greater than 10 goals.\n   - Only 2 teams meet this condition, which is not more than half.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"more than half of the away teams have a score greater than 10\" is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- Row indices and column names where scores were checked:\n  - Row 0, Column \"away team score\"\n  - Row 1, Column \"away team score\"\n  - Row 2, Column \"away team score\"\n  - Row 3, Column \"away team score\"\n  - Row 4, Column \"away team score\"\n  - Row 5, Column \"away team score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
