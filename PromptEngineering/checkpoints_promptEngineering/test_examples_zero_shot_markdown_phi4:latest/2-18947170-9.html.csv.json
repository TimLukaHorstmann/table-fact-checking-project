    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. **Does Mozambique have more than one peak listed in the table?**\n2. **Is Mount Namuli the tallest peak in Mozambique with a prominence of 1757 meters?**\n\nLet's analyze each part using the relevant data from the markdown table.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Peaks in Mozambique\n\nWe need to find rows where the \"country\" column is \"mozambique\". From the table:\n\n- **Row 13**: \n  - Peak: Mount Namuli\n  - Country: Mozambique\n  - Elevation: 2419 m\n  - Prominence: 1757 m\n  - Col: 662 m\n\nThere is only one row for Mozambique. Therefore, the claim that \"Mozambique have more than 1 peak list\" is false.\n\n### Step 2: Check Tallest Peak in Mozambique\n\nSince there's only one peak from Mozambique (Mount Namuli), it is by default the tallest with an elevation of 2419 meters and a prominence of 1757 meters. This part of the claim is true, but it doesn't affect the overall conclusion since the first part is already false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe entire claim is false because Mozambique does not have more than one peak listed in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nFor verification:\n- We need to check the \"country\" column for all rows to determine the number of peaks from Mozambique.\n- We also need to verify the details of Mount Namuli in row 13.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"elevation (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"prominence (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Uganda has more than 3 peaks listed and the highest prominence is 2458,\" we need to examine the table for relevant data related to Uganda.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Uganda:**\n   - Check each row in the table for entries where the `country` column is \"uganda.\"\n\n2. **Count Peaks in Uganda:**\n   - Count how many peaks are listed under the country \"uganda.\"\n\n3. **Determine Highest Prominence in Uganda:**\n   - Among these rows, identify the highest value in the `prominence (m)` column.\n\n### Relevant Rows from the Table:\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Peak: mount elgon\n  - Country: uganda\n  - Elevation (m): 4321\n  - Prominence (m): 2458\n  - Col (m): 1863\n\n- **Row 11:** \n  - Peak: mount moroto\n  - Country: uganda\n  - Elevation (m): 3083\n  - Prominence (m): 1818\n  - Col (m): 1265\n\n- **Row 17:** \n  - Peak: mount kadam\n  - Country: uganda\n  - Elevation (m): 3063\n  - Prominence (m): 1690\n  - Col (m): 1373\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Count of Peaks in Uganda:**\n   - There are 3 peaks listed for Uganda.\n\n2. **Highest Prominence in Uganda:**\n   - The highest prominence value is 2458, which corresponds to mount elgon.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states \"Uganda has more than 3 peaks listed,\" but there are only 3.\n- The part of the claim about the highest prominence being 2458 is correct.\n\nSince one condition (more than 3 peaks) is not met, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- Row 4: `country`, `prominence (m)`\n- Row 11: `country`\n- Row 17: `country`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prominence (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
