    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rank 3 have 6 total medal\" is true or false, we need to verify it against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant part of the table for this claim is as follows:\n\n|   rank | gold | silver | bronze | total |\n|-------:|-----:|-------:|-------:|------:|\n|      3 |    1 |      3 |     12 |    16 |\n\nWe need to check two conditions:\n1. The row corresponding to \"rank 3\".\n2. The value in the \"total\" column for this rank.\n\nSteps:\n- Locate the row where \"rank\" is 3, which is row index 2 (considering 0-based indexing).\n- Check the value in the \"total\" column for this row.\n\nFrom the table, the total number of medals for rank 3 is 16. The claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals. Therefore, the claim is false because the actual total is 16, not 6.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 2, \"total\" column.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
