    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"series 32 originally air on december 21 , 2006,\" we need to verify two key conditions from the table:\n\n1. The episode with `no in series` equal to 32.\n2. The corresponding `original air date` for this episode.\n\nLet's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n- **Identify Row**: We need to find the row where `no in series` is 32. By inspecting the table, we can see that the entry with `no in series = 32` corresponds to `row_index` 10 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n- **Verify Air Date**: Once we've located the correct row, we need to check the value of `original air date`. In this case, for `row_index` 10:\n  - The `title` is \"love is blind.\"\n  - The `original air date` is listed as December 21, 2006.\n\nBoth conditions align with the claim:\n\n- **Condition 1**: The series number (32) matches.\n- **Condition 2**: The original air date (December 21, 2006) also matches.\n\nBased on this verification, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, we conclude that the answer to whether the claim is true is \"TRUE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- `row_index` 10, `column_name` \"no in series\" (to identify the correct episode).\n- `row_index` 10, `column_name` \"original air date\" (to verify the air date).\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table provided, we need to verify the following components of the claim:\n\n1. The title \"a bitter pill to swallow\" should exist in the table.\n2. It should be directed by \"andy cadiff.\"\n3. Its original air date should be November 19, 2006.\n\nLet's verify each component step-by-step:\n\n1. **Title Verification:**\n   - From the table, we find that there is an entry with the title \"a bitter pill to swallow\" in row 43.\n\n2. **Director Verification:**\n   - In row 43, under the column \"directed by,\" it lists \"andy cadiff.\"\n\n3. **Original Air Date Verification:**\n   - In row 43, under the column \"original air date,\" it lists \"april 1 , 2007.\"\n   - The claim states the original air date as November 19, 2006.\n\nThe first two components of the claim are verified correctly by row 43. However, the third component regarding the original air date is incorrect because the table shows April 1, 2007, and not November 19, 2006.\n\nBased on this analysis, the entire claim cannot be considered true due to the mismatch in the original air date.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Title \"a bitter pill to swallow\" found in row 43.\n- Director \"andy cadiff\" found in row 43.\n- Original air date (April 1, 2007) found in row 43.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
