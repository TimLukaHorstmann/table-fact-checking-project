The \"nhl team\" column for each player to check if they were picked by the Philadelphia Flyers.\n2. The \"pick\" column to ensure that the selection is within the range of 43 to 50, inclusive.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Pick: 43\n  - NHL Team: Philadelphia Flyers\n\nThis player meets both criteria (nhl team and pick number).\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Pick: 44\n  - NHL Team: New Jersey Devils\n\nThis player does not meet the nhl team criterion.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Pick: 45\n  - NHL Team: Chicago Black Hawks\n\nThis player does not meet the nhl team criterion.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Pick: 46\n  - NHL Team: Minnesota North Stars\n\nThis player does not meet the nhl team criterion.\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Pick: 47\n  - NHL Team: Philadelphia Flyers\n\nThis player meets both criteria (nhl team and pick number).\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Pick: 48\n  - NHL Team: Los Angeles Kings\n\nThis player does not meet the nhl team criterion.\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - Pick: 49\n  - NHL Team: Detroit Red Wings\n\nThis player does not meet the nhl team criterion.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Pick: 50\n  - NHL Team: St. Louis Blues\n\nThis player does not meet the nhl team criterion.\n\nUpon reviewing each row, we find that only two players (rows 0 and 4) were selected by the Philadelphia Flyers within the specified pick range. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
