    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the Golden State game in the provided table, we need to verify two main conditions stated in the claim:\n\n1. The location of the game should be \"at&t center.\"\n2. The attendance for this game should be 18,581 people.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps and information needed from the table:\n\n- **Row Identification:** The claim mentions \"the golden state game,\" which corresponds to row 67 in the table (since it is the entry involving Golden State).\n\n- **Check Location:**\n  - From the table, under column \"location attendance\" for row 67, we have \"at&t center 18581.\"\n  - We need to confirm if the location part of this string matches \"at&t center.\"\n\n- **Check Attendance:**\n  - Continuing with the same entry in column \"location attendance\" for row 67, the number following \"at&t center\" is 18,581.\n  - We need to verify if the attendance number is indeed 18,581.\n\nUpon evaluating these conditions:\n\n- The location is accurately specified as \"at&t center.\"\n- The attendance figure matches the claim of 18,581 people.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are fully supported by the data in row 67. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON output detailing the relevant cells used to verify this claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `row_index` starts from 0, so for row 67 in the markdown table, it is indexed as 66.",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the game number for Cleveland is 71,\" we need to identify all games played against Cleveland and check their corresponding game numbers from the table.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - We look for the rows where the team column contains \"cleveland.\"\n\n2. **Check game numbers in those rows:**\n\n   - In row with `game` number 61, `team` is listed as \"cleveland\" and the result is `l 95 - 97 (ot)`.\n   - In row with `game` number 71, `team` is again listed as \"cleveland\" and the result is `w 102 - 97 (ot)`.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim specifies that game number 71 is for Cleveland.\n   - From the table, we see there are two games involving Cleveland, with game numbers 61 and 71.\n\nThus, one of these game numbers is indeed 71 for a game against Cleveland, making the claim TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
