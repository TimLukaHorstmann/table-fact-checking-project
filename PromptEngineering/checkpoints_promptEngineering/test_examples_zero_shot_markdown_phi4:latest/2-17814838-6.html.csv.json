The attendance for the match between Kettering Town and Fulham is 5406.\n2. This attendance figure is indeed the lowest when compared with all other matches listed in the table.\n\nFirstly, let's identify where Kettering Town faced Fulham in the table:\n- In row 13 of the table, we have \"Kettering town\" as the home team and \"fulham\" as the away team. The attendance for this match is recorded as 5406.\n\nNext, we need to check if there are any other matches with a lower or equal attendance in the table:\n- By inspecting each row's attendance value, no other match has an attendance less than 5406. \n- Some matches have attendance values equal to 5406 (like the same match), but none are lower.\n\nHaving verified that Kettering Town vs Fulham with an attendance of 5406 is indeed the lowest in the table, we can confidently state that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification include:\n- The \"attendance\" column for row 13, where the match between Kettering Town and Fulham is listed.\n- Additionally, all other rows under the \"attendance\" column are checked to confirm no lower value exists.\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the given table for matches between West Bromwich Albion and Burnley. The claim states:\n\n\"The highest goal score by both teams in a tie was 8 when West Bromwich Albion tied Burnley 7 - 7.\"\n\nLet's break down the steps needed to verify this claim:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving West Bromwich Albion and Burnley**:\n   - We need to locate any rows where either \"home team\" or \"away team\" is West Bromwich Albion or Burnley.\n\n2. **Check Scores for Total Goals**:\n   - For each identified match, calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams combined.\n   - Verify if there's a match with a combined score of 8 where one of the scores is 7 (indicating a 7-1 result).\n\n3. **Replays and Final Outcomes**:\n   - Consider replays as well because they may affect the outcome or total goals scored in the tie.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 11**: \n  - Home Team: West Bromwich Albion\n  - Away Team: Burnley\n  - Score: 2 - 2\n  - Total Goals: 4\n\n- **Replay (Row 16)**:\n  - Home Team: Burnley\n  - Away Team: West Bromwich Albion\n  - Score: 3 - 1\n  - Total Goals: 4\n\nIn both the initial match and the replay, the total number of goals scored by both teams is 4. There is no instance where the total score is 8 or any match with a score of 7-1.\n\nThe claim about a tie resulting in a combined goal count of 8 (with scores 7-1) between West Bromwich Albion and Burnley does not hold true based on the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\nRelevant cells for verification are those related to the matches involving West Bromwich Albion and Burnley:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
