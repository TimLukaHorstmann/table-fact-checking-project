The time period \"1972 - 1976.\"\n2. A rank of \"1.\"\n\nWe will verify these components by checking the appropriate cells in the table:\n\n1. **Identify the player associated with the years 1972 - 1976:**\n   - Look at the column labeled \"years\" to find the row(s) that list \"1972 - 1976.\"\n   - The first row (row index 0) has \"1972 - 1976\" in the \"years\" column.\n\n2. **Check the rank for this player:**\n   - In the same row where \"1972 - 1976\" is listed, examine the \"rank\" column.\n   - Row index 0 has a \"rank\" of 1 in the table.\n\nThe claim states that the years 1972 - 1976 correspond to a rank of 1. From our examination:\n- The player \"jim nowers\" played from 1972 - 1976 and is ranked 1st.\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are satisfied by examining these relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Cell at row index 0 in the \"years\" column contains \"1972 - 1976.\"\n- Cell at row index 0 in the \"rank\" column contains a value of 1.\n\nThe claim is therefore TRUE.
