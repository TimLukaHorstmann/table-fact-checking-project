    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"all of d1, d2 and d3 be represent by at least 2 team,\" we need to check each division's representation in both teams across all rounds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Division d1**: \n  - Team Names: toulouse fc, ogc nice, lille osc, aj auxerre, le havre ac, rc lens, fc metz\n  - Count: 7 teams\n\n- **Division d2**:\n  - Team Names: fc sochaux - montb\u00e9liard, stade de reims, fc mulhouse, fc s\u00e8te, aep bourg sous la roche, stade quimp\u00e9rois, so chtellerault\n  - Count: 7 teams\n\n- **Division d3**:\n  - Team Names: us cr\u00e9teil\n  - Count: 1 team\n  \n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that each division (d1, d2, and d3) must be represented by at least two teams.
