    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Peter Leko's performance in Jermuk and Nalchik is true, we need to verify two specific entries from the table corresponding to this player:\n\n1. **Peter Leko's score in Jermuk** should be 100.\n2. **Peter Leko's score in Nalchik** should be 140.\n\nLet's locate Peter Leko's row and check these values:\n\n- The player \"peter leko\" is found at row index 7 (keeping in mind that markdown tables typically start counting from 0).\n  \n- For the column related to Jermuk, we find:\n  - Row index 7, Column \"jermuk\": 100\n\n- For the column related to Nalchik, we find:\n  - Row index 7, Column \"nalchik\": 140\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied as per the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nalchik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the nalchik with 4 played, a rl qual, and 100 jermuk be less than 140,\" we need to verify each condition in this statement against the provided table:\n\n1. **\"nalchik with 4 played\":** We need to find players who have \"played\" value of 4 and participated in Nalchik.\n\n2. **\"a rl qual\":** Among those players, they should be qualified as \"rl.\"\n\n3. **\"and 100 jermuk\":** In the Jermuk column for these players, their score should be exactly 100.\n\n4. **\"be less than 140\":** We need to ensure that this player's Nalchik score is less than 140.\n\nNow let's evaluate step-by-step:\n\n- First, we identify all players with \"played\" = 4:\n  - Teimour Radjabov\n  - Alexander Grischuk\n  - Dmitry Jakovenko\n  - Wang Yue\n  - Vugar Gashimov\n  - Peter Leko\n  - Shakhriyar Mamedyarov\n  - Evgeny Alekseev\n  - Pavel Eljanov\n  - Boris Gelfand\n  - Vassily Ivanchuk\n  - \u00c9tienne Bacrot\n  - Gata Kamsky\n  - Sergey Karjakin\n  - Peter Svidler\n  - Vladimir Akopian\n  - Ivan Cheparinov\n  - Ernesto Inarkiev\n\n- Next, from these players, identify those with \"qual\" = rl:\n  - Levon Aronian (although his played value is 3)\n  - Teimour Radjabov\n  - Peter Leko\n  - Shakhriyar Mamedyarov\n  - Boris Gelfand\n\n- From the above list, find players with a Jermuk score of exactly 100:\n  - Peter Leko (Jermuk = 100)\n  - Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (does not have Jermuk score)\n\n- Lastly, check if these identified players have Nalchik score less than 140:\n  - **Peter Leko:**\n    - Nalchik Score: (55) [This is indeed less than 140]\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by Peter Leko's data. Now let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- For **Levon Aronian**, played value does not match our needed condition.\n- For **Teimour Radjabov**, he doesn't have a Jermuk score of 100.\n- For **Peter Leko**:\n  - Played: Row 7, Column \"played\"\n  - Qual: Row 7, Column \"qual\"\n  - Nalchik: Row 7, Column \"nalchik\"\n  - Jermuk: Row 7, Column \"jermuk\"\n\n- For **Shakhriyar Mamedyarov**, he doesn't have a Jermuk score of 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE based on Peter Leko's data. The relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"qual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nalchik\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
