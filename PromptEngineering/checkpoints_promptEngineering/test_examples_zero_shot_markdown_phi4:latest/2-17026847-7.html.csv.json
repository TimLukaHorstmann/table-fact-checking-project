According to the table:\n     - On row index 2, \"vida\" is listed as the home team.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data for These Games:**\n   - For each relevant row identified above, extract the attendance value from the \"attendance\" column.\n   - Row index 2 has an attendance of 2709.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Attendance:**\n   - Since there is only one game with \"vida\" as the home team, the average attendance for these games is simply the attendance number from that row, which is 2709.\n\n4. **Compare With Claimed Average:**\n   - The claim states that on average, the crowd attendance when the home team is \"vida\" is 2709.\n   - The calculated average attendance is indeed 2709.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those containing information about \"vida\" as the home team and the corresponding attendance:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
