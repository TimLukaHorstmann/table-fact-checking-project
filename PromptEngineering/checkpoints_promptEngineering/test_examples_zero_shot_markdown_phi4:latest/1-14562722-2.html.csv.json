Therefore, the relevant column for this analysis is \"discs.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row in the Discs Column**:\n   - For Volume 1 (Row 0), the value in the \"discs\" column is 1.\n   - For Volume 2 (Row 1), the value in the \"discs\" column is 1.\n   - For Volume 3 (Row 2), the value in the \"discs\" column is 1.\n   - For Volume 4 (Row 3), the value in the \"discs\" column is 1.\n   - For Volume 5 (Row 4), the value in the \"discs\" column is 1.\n\n3. **Assess the Claim**: The claim states that the highest number of disc release for any volume should be only 1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be more than 1 disc\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant column in the table. The column of interest is the \"discs\" column since it directly addresses the number of discs per volume.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We focus on the \"discs\" column because it contains the data needed to verify if there are more than one disc for any entry.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row in the 'Discs' Column:**\n   - Check each row's value under the \"discs\" column:\n     - Row 1 (Volume 1): 1 disc\n     - Row 2 (Volume 2): 1 disc\n     - Row 3 (Volume 3): 1 disc\n     - Row 4 (Volume 4): 1 disc\n     - Row 5 (Volume 5): 1 disc\n\n3. **Determine if the Claim is Supported:**\n   - The claim states there are more than 1 disc. However, every entry in the \"discs\" column is exactly 1.\n   - Therefore, no row supports having more than one disc.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since all entries show exactly 1 disc, the claim that there are more than 1 disc is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - All rows in the \"discs\" column need to be considered to confirm the claim.\n   - The relevant cells include:\n     - Row 0, Column \"discs\"\n     - Row 1, Column \"discs\"\n     - Row 2, Column \"discs\"\n     - Row 3, Column \"discs\"\n     - Row 4, Column \"discs\"\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"discs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"discs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"discs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"discs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"discs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
