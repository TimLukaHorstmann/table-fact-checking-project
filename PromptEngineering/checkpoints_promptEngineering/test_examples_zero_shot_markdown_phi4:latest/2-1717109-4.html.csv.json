    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"John McEnroe be the opponent in the final on 7 April 1987,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The date should be 7 April 1987.\n2. The opponent in the final should be John McEnroe.\n\nLet's check these conditions against the relevant data in the table:\n\n- **Date Check**: We look at the \"date\" column for an entry that matches \"7 april 1987.\" This is found in row index 6 of the table.\n\n- **Opponent Check**: For the same date, we need to verify the opponent listed in the \"opponent in final\" column. In row index 6, the opponent listed is \"john mcenroe.\"\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (the date matches and John McEnroe is indeed listed as the opponent), the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells that confirm this are:\n- The cell at row index 6 in the \"date\" column.\n- The cell at row index 6 in the \"opponent in final\" column.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.
