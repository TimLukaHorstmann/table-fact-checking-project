    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"for the 2018 season, the air force - navy score be yet tbd,\" we must carefully examine the table provided and identify the relevant cells for verification.\n\n1. **Identifying Relevant Season**: \n   The claim specifically mentions the \"2018 season.\" Therefore, our focus should be on the row corresponding to the year 2018 within the table.\n\n2. **Locating Row for Year 2018**:\n   By examining the first column labeled as 'season', we find that there is an entry for the year 2018 in the last row of the table.\n\n3. **Finding the Relevant Column**:\n   The claim mentions \"the air force - navy score.\" Therefore, we need to identify the column that lists scores between Air Force and Navy, which is labeled as 'air force - navy score'.\n\n4. **Checking the Value for 2018**:\n   In the row corresponding to the year 2018, under the column 'air force - navy score', there is a value listed as \"tbd.\"\n\nGiven this evaluation, we conclude that the claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells confirm that for the 2018 season, the air force - navy score indeed has not been determined yet (indicated as \"tbd\").\n\nThus, our final answer and identification of the relevant cell are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere, `row_index` is calculated based on a zero-based index starting from the first row as 0.
