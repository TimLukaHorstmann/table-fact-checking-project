    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"2 be the fewest point that roger dutton / tony wright receive,\" we need to verify two main parts of this statement from the table:\n\n1. Identify how many points Roger Dutton and Tony Wright received.\n2. Confirm if 2 is indeed the smallest number of points any rider(s) received according to the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n- **Step 1:** Locate Roger Dutton / Tony Wright in the table to determine their point allocation.\n  - From the table, we find:\n    - Row 8: \"roger dutton / tony wright\" received 3 points.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Check if there are any other entries with fewer points than Roger Dutton / Tony Wright.\n  - Examine all rows for the column \"points\":\n    - Row 9: george o'dell / bill boldison received 2 points.\n    - Row 10: jbarker / amacfadzean received 1 point.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Roger Dutton / Tony Wright received 2 points, but according to the table, they actually received 3 points.\n- Furthermore, there are entries (Row 9 and Row 10) with fewer points than what Roger Dutton / Tony Wright received. Hence, Roger Dutton / Tony Wright did not receive the fewest points.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells that confirm or disprove this claim include:\n  - Row 8 (\"roger dutton / tony wright\" with 3 points).\n  - Rows 9 and 10 for comparison of fewer points (2 and 1 respectively).\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
