This episode originally aired on March 2, 1998.\n\nLet's break down each part of the claim against the table data:\n\n- **Title and Director**: We need to find the row where the title matches \"forbidden fruits\" and check if it lists Jeremy Kagan as the director.\n- **Original Air Date**: Once we have identified the correct episode, we must verify that its original air date is March 2, 1998.\n\nBy examining the table:\n\n1. The row with `series` number 16 shows:\n   - Title: \"forbidden fruits\"\n   - Directed by: jeremy kagan\n   - Original air date: march 2 , 1998\n\nThe claim states that the episode directed by Jeremy Kagan titled \"forbidden fruit\" (note the singular form in the claim) first aired on March 2, 1998.
