When the club is \"slavia prague\", check if the season is \"1995 - 96\".\n\nLet's examine each part using the table provided:\n\n### Part 1: St Gallen and Season 2013-14\n- Locate the row(s) where \"club\" is \"st gallen\".\n  - From the table, we find:\n    - Row index 2: club = \"st gallen\", season = \"2001 - 02\"\n- The season for \"st gallen\" is \"2001 - 02\", not \"2013 - 14\".\n\n### Part 2: Slavia Prague and Season 1995-96\n- Locate the row(s) where \"club\" is \"slavia prague\".\n  - From the table, we find:\n    - Row index 0: club = \"slavia prague\", season = \"1995 - 96\"\n- The season for \"slavia prague\" is indeed \"1995 - 96\".\n\nNow let's determine the truthfulness of the claim based on these findings:\n\n1. For \"st gallen\" and \"2013 - 14\": This condition is FALSE.\n2. For \"slavia prague\" and \"1995 - 96\": This condition is TRUE.\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the entire claim to be true, but one part (the first) is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nWe need to identify the cells that are relevant to verifying this claim:\n\n- For \"st gallen\" and season \"2013 - 14\":\n  - Row index 2: Season = \"2001 - 02\"\n  - Row index 2: Club = \"st gallen\"\n\n- For \"slavia prague\" and season \"1995 - 96\":\n  - Row index 0: Season = \"1995 - 96\"\n  - Row index 0: Club = \"slavia prague\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
