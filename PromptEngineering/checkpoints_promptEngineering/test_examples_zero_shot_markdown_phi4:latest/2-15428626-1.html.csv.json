These columns will help us verify whether the specified date corresponds to a game against the specified opponent.\n\nNow, we'll go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 7**: \n   - Date: October 27, 1963\n   - Opponent: Oakland Raiders\n\nThis is the only row where the date matches \"October 27, 1963.\" The opponent for this date is \"Oakland Raiders,\" not \"Houston Oilers.\"\n\nSince there is no match in the table for \"October 27, 1963\" being a game against the \"Houston Oilers,\" we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 7, Column: date\n- Row 7, Column: opponent\n\nHere is the JSON object with the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
