    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"at edison international field of anaheim, october 20, the 2002 world series have its second long game,\" we need to analyze relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Location Check**: We must verify that the specified date and location match a row in the table.\n   - The claim mentions \"edison international field of anaheim\" for October 20.\n\n2. **Date Verification**: Confirm if there is a game on October 20 at Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n   - From the table, game number 2 (row index 1) matches this date and location.\n\n3. **Time Check**: Verify if this game was long in duration compared to others.\n   - Game 2 has a time of \"3:57\".\n\n4. **Determine Longest Games**: Compare times of all games to identify the longest ones.\n   - Times from the table:\n     - Game 1 (row index 0): 3:44\n     - Game 2 (row index 1): 3:57\n     - Game 3 (row index 2): 3:37\n     - Game 4 (row index 3): 3:02\n     - Game 5 (row index 4): 3:53\n     - Game 6 (row index 5): 3:48\n     - Game 7 (row index 6): 3:16\n\n5. **Rank Games by Duration**:\n   - Longest: Game 2 (3:57)\n   - Second longest: Game 5 (3:53)\n\n6. **Location of the Second Longest Game**: Check if the second longest game was at Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n   - The second longest game is Game 5, which took place at Pacific Bell Park.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - October 20 game (Game 2) was indeed a long game but not the second longest.\n   - Therefore, the claim that it was the \"second long game\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this determination are those pertaining to games on October 20 and all games' durations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
