This implies that either all tournaments must have precisely 2.5 events, which is not possible since the number of events must be an integer. Therefore, we interpret this as checking if the average across all tournaments equals 2.5.\n\n2. **Relevant Data**: We need to consider the \"events\" column for each tournament and calculate the overall average:\n   - Masters Tournament: 2 events\n   - US Open: 2 events\n   - The Open Championship: 7 events\n   - PGA Championship: 6 events\n\n3. **Calculate Total Events and Average**:\n   - Sum of all events = 2 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 17\n   - Number of tournaments = 4\n   - Average number of events per tournament = Total events / Number of tournaments = 17 / 4 = 4.25\n\n4. **Comparison with Claim**: The calculated average (4.25) does not match the claimed average (2.5).\n\nSince the calculated average number of events is 4.25 and not 2.5, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Masters Tournament: Row index 0, \"events\"\n- US Open: Row index 1, \"events\"\n- The Open Championship: Row index 2, \"events\"\n- PGA Championship: Row index 3, \"events\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
