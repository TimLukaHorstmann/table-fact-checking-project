    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze each relevant piece of information from the table and verify if it supports or contradicts the statement: \"republican be the party with first elect be 1940.\" This can be rephrased as checking if the Republican Party had a candidate who was first elected in 1940.\n\nWe'll go through the rows of the table to identify relevant data:\n\n1. **Row 1 (district: california 2):** \n   - Incumbent party: republican\n   - First elected: 1926\n\n2. **Row 2 (district: california 4):**\n   - Incumbent party: republican\n   - First elected: 1940\n\n3. **Row 3 (district: california 7):** \n   - Incumbent party: democratic \n\n4. **Row 4 (district: california 9):**\n   - Incumbent party: republican\n   - First elected: 1934\n\n5. **Row 5 (district: california 10):** \n   - Incumbent party: democratic\n\n6. **Row 6 (district: california 17):** \n   - Incumbent party: democratic \n\n7. **Row 7 (district: california 22):**\n   - This row is about a new seat; hence, it's not relevant to first elections before this creation.\n\nFrom the analysis above:\n- The earliest election year for a Republican candidate in the table is 1926 (row 1).\n- However, there is a Republican candidate with the \"first elected\" year of 1940 (row 2).\n\nThus, the claim that the Republican Party had a first elected year of 1940 is supported by row 2. Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response identifying the relevant cell:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
