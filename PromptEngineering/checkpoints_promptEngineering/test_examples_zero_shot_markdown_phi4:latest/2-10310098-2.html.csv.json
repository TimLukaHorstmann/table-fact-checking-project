The following rows have matches in locations that are inside or part of the United States:\n     - Row 5: Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (not US)\n     - Row 6: Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (not US)\n     - Row 9: Amarillo, Texas, USA\n     - Row 14: Anaheim, California, USA\n     - Row 15: Birmingham, England (already checked, not US)\n     - Row 17: Las Vegas, Nevada, USA\n     - Row 18: Las Vegas, Nevada, USA\n     - Row 19: Lemoore, California, USA\n     - Row 21: Portland, Oregon, USA\n     - Row 22: San Diego, California, USA\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The claim states that the fighter has matches in countries inside of the United States. This is a misunderstanding; the claim should be about matches taking place within the United States.\n- There are indeed matches in various parts of the United States as shown above.\n\nThus, the claim as written (\"inside of the united state\") is not accurate since it seems to mean locations literally inside the geographical boundaries of the U.S., but the intent appears to refer to locations within the country (the United States).\n\nConclusively, because matches are listed in actual U.S. states and cities, we interpret this as supporting the intended claim. Thus, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
