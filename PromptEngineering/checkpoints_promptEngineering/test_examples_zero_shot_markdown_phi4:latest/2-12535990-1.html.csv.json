    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about games against the Oakland Raiders and their average attendance, we need to examine the relevant rows in the table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look for rows where \"opponent\" is \"oakland raiders\".\n   \n2. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - For each identified row, note the \"attendance\" value.\n   \n3. **Calculate Average Attendance:**\n   - Compute the average of these attendance values.\n\n4. **Check Claim Validity:**\n   - Determine if this calculated average matches the description in the claim as an \"average number of attendees.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Relevant Rows for Oakland Raiders:**\n\n   - Week 7:\n     - Date: October 20, 1968\n     - Attendance: 50,015\n\n   - Week 9:\n     - Date: November 3, 1968\n     - Attendance: 53,357\n\n2. **Average Calculation:**\n   - Total attendance for both games = 50,015 + 53,357 = 103,372\n   - Number of games = 2\n   - Average attendance = 103,372 / 2 = 51,686\n\n3. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that the games against the Oakland Raiders have an \"average number of attendees.\"\n   - Since we calculated an average (51,686), this supports the idea of having an \"average\" as it is a defined numeric value.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table, as there are indeed games with calculated average attendance against the Oakland Raiders.
