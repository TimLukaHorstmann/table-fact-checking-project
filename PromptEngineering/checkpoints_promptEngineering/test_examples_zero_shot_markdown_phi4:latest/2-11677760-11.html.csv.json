This is found at `row_index` 3 (as indexing starts from 0).\n\n3. **Verify Height Information:**\n   - Check the \"height\" column for Raymond Felton, which is located at `column_name`: \"height\".\n   - The entry in that cell should match the height claimed in the statement.\n\n4. **Extract and Compare Data:**\n   - From the table, the height recorded for Raymond Felton is \"6 - 2\", matching exactly with what the claim states.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the information in the table confirms that Raymond Felton's height is indeed \"6 - 2\", the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
