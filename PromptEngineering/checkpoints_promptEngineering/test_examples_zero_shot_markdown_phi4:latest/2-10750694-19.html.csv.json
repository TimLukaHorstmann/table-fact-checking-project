This is false because the largest crowd was at Geelong vs Carlton with 49107 people.\n- Additionally, the third condition about having only 9000 onlookers does not match the actual crowd for the Hawthorn vs North Melbourne game (which had a crowd of 6000).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- For verifying \"North Melbourne beat Hawthorn\": Row 0, columns \"home team score\" and \"away team score\".\n- For identifying the largest crowd: All rows under the \"crowd\" column.\n- For identifying which game had a crowd of 9000: Row 4, \"crowd\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states Collingwood is the highest point scorer with a score of 15.11 (101).\n2. We also need to verify that this score is indeed 10 more than the closest team's score.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant parts of the table related to each condition in the claim:\n\n- **Collingwood's Score**:\n  - The row for Collingwood indicates a home team score of \"13.14 (92)\".\n  - This does not match the claimed score of \"15.11 (101)\".\n\n- **Highest Point Scorer**:\n  - To find the highest point scorer, we look at all the scores:\n    - Hawthorn: 8.11 (59)\n    - North Melbourne: 12.10 (82)\n    - Footscray: 13.13 (91)\n    - South Melbourne: 8.13 (61)\n    - Collingwood: 13.14 (92)\n    - Melbourne: 10.11 (71)\n    - St Kilda: 10.12 (72)\n    - Fitzroy: 8.18 (66)\n    - Richmond: 15.11 (101)\n    - Essendon: 11.10 (76)\n    - Geelong: 10.17 (77)\n    - Carlton: 3.14 (32)\n\n  - Richmond has the highest score of \"15.11 (101)\".\n\n- **Score Difference**:\n  - The closest score to Richmond's is Collingwood with \"13.14 (92)\".\n  - The difference in points between Richmond and Collingwood is \\(101 - 92 = 9\\), not 10 as claimed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is incorrect because:\n\n- Collingwood did not have a score of 15.11 (101).\n- Richmond was the highest point scorer with a different score.\n- The difference between the highest and the closest team's scores is not 10 points.\n\nThus, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.
