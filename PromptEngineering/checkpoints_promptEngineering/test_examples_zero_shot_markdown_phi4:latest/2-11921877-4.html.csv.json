Alexander Thynne, Lord: Died in 1918\n8. Valentine Fleming: Died in 1917\n9. Philip Glazebrook: Died in 1918\n10. Francis Bennett-Goldney: Died in 1918\n11. William Hoey Kearney Redmond: Died in 1917\n12. Dr. John Joseph Esmonde: Died in 1915\n13. Thomas Agar-Robartes, The Hon.: Died in 1915\n14. Harold Thomas Cawley, The Hon.: Died in 1915\n15. Oswald Cawley, The Hon.: Died in 1967 (Note that this is not relevant for the claim as he died after all MPs listed)\n16. Arthur O'Neill, The Hon.: Died in 1914\n17. Neil James Archibald Primrose, Rt. Hon.: Died in 1917\n18. Michael Hugh Hicks-Beach, Viscount Quenington: Died in 1916\n19. Francis Walter Stafford McLaren, The Hon.: Died in 1917\n20. Charles Thomas Mills, The Hon.: Died in 1915\n21. William Walrond, The Hon.: Died in 1915\n22. Thomas Michael Kettle: Died in 1916\n23. William Glynne Charles Gladstone: Died in 1915\n24.
