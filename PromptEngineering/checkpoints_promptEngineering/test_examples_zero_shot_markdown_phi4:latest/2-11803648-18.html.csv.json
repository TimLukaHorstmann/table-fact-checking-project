The table lists various players selected in different rounds of a draft. We must first identify who was drafted by the Ottawa Senators.\n2. From the given data, only Corey Cowick (round 6) is associated with \"ottawa 67's (ohl)\" but not directly stated to be drafted by the Ottawa Senators. However, it's known that players from junior teams like the 67s can be draft picks for teams like the Senators.\n3. We assume this player was indeed a pick by the Ottawa Senators, as no other team is mentioned in his row.\n\nNext, we analyze the nationality of each identified pick:\n\n- Corey Cowick (row 6): Nationality - Canada\n\nSince there's only one identifiable Ottawa Senators draft pick from this data and that player is Canadian, the majority are non-American. \n\nThus, the claim \"the majority of draft pick in 2009 for the ottawa senator be non - american\" is supported by the available information.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- Corey Cowick's nationality (United States) which confirms he is not American.\n- His association with the Ottawa 67's indicates a likely connection to the Senators' draft pick, given no other teams are listed in his row.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This information is not explicitly stated in the table. However, we can infer that players listed with \"from\" or without any mention of a transaction might have been directly picked by their respective teams unless otherwise indicated.\n\n2. **Check Positions**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions left wingers (\"lw\"). Therefore, we need to check the \"position\" column for each draft pick to see if they are listed as \"lw\".\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Jared Cowen, D (defender) \u2013 Not a winger.\n   - **Row 2**: Jakob Silfverberg, RW/LW (right wing/left wing) \u2013 Can play LW but not exclusively.\n   - **Row 3**: Robin Lehner, G (goalie) \u2013 Not a winger.\n   - **Row 4**: Chris Wideman, D \u2013 Not a winger.\n   - **Row 5**: Mike Hoffman, C/LW (center/left wing) \u2013 Can play LW but not exclusively.\n   - **Row 6**: Corey Cowick, LW \u2013 Is a left winger.\n   - **Row 7**: Brad Peltz, LW \u2013 Is a left winger.\n   - **Row 8**: Michael Sdao, D \u2013 Not a winger.\n\n4. **Determine Majority**:\n   - Total picks: 8\n   - Left wingers (LW): Corey Cowick and Brad Peltz are the only players listed exclusively as LWs.\n   - Therefore, 2 out of 8 picks are left wingers, which is not a majority.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"the majority of draft picks in 2009 for the Ottawa Senators were left wingers\" is FALSE. The relevant rows and columns to verify this are:\n\n- Row 6: Corey Cowick, position LW\n- Row 7: Brad Peltz, position LW\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and focus on the draft rounds as they pertain to the term \"senator\" in the context of the NHL Draft. The Ottawa Senators have historically held picks in various rounds during the draft process.\n\n1. **Identify Picks by Round:**\n   - We are looking for which round corresponds to a pick by the Senators, and whether these picks occur earlier or later in the draft sequence.\n   \n2. **Table Analysis:**\n   - Round 1: Jared Cowen (D) selected by Ottawa Senators. \n   - Round 4: Chris Wideman (D).\n   - Round 5: Mike Hoffman (C/LW), Jeff Costello (LW; originally from Boston via Phoenix).\n   - Round 6: Corey Cowick (LW).\n   - Round 7: Brad Peltz (LW), Michael Sdao (D; originally from Edmonton).\n\n3. **Counting Picks by Round:**\n   - Earlier Rounds: R1, R4, and R5 are considered earlier rounds.\n     - Senators' picks in these rounds: Jared Cowen (R1), Chris Wideman (R4), Mike Hoffman (R5), Jeff Costello (R5).\n     - Total = 4 picks.\n\n   - Later Rounds: R6 and R7 are considered later rounds.\n     - Senators' picks in these rounds: Corey Cowick (R6), Brad Peltz (R7), Michael Sdao (R7).\n     - Total = 3 picks.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the Senators have more draft picks in earlier rounds than in later rounds. Based on our count, this is true (4 picks in earlier rounds vs. 3 picks in later rounds).\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Round 1: \"9\" at row index 0\n   - Round 4: \"100\" at row index 3\n   - Round 5: \"130\", \"146\" at row indices 4, 5 (note Jeff Costello was a pick from Boston via Phoenix)\n   - Round 6: \"160\" at row index 6\n   - Round 7: \"190\", \"191\" at row indices 7, 8\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"more than half of Ottawa's draft picks were acquired by trade,\" we need to identify which players selected by Ottawa were obtained via trades and compare this number to the total number of players they picked.\n\n**Relevant Information:**\n- A player is considered an Ottawa pick if their club team at the time of selection was \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\".\n- We must check each row for the condition where the position is \"d\" or \"c / lw\" (as these are the positions listed for Ottawa players in this table) and verify whether they were acquired through a trade, which can be indicated by text in parentheses following their overall pick number.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Ottawa's Picks:**\n   - Row 6: Corey Cowick (lw), club team is \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\".\n     - Overall Pick: 160, No indication of trade.\n   \n2. **Check for Trades:**\n   - Row 5: Jeff Costello (lw) was selected by Ottawa via Phoenix from Boston (as indicated by the notation \"(from boston via phoenix)\"). Although Jeff Costello is not listed under \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\" as his club team, this information shows a trade involving an Ottawa pick.\n   \n3. **Count Total Picks and Trades:**\n   - Total number of picks by Ottawa: 1 (Corey Cowick from Row 6).\n   - Number of these acquired via trade: 0 direct trades for Corey Cowick. However, the notation in Row 5 implies a traded pick.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Since there is only one confirmed Ottawa pick in this table and no indication that it was directly obtained through trade (trade indicated only by way of the sequence), less than half of their picks here were acquired via trade.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
