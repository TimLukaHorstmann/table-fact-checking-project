    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"1998 be the year that louis slaughter be first elect to new york 's 28th district and he be retire democratic gain in the 2006 election,\" we need to verify two parts of this statement against the given table:\n\n1. **Louise Slaughter was first elected in 1998 for New York's 28th District:**\n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"new york 28\" where Louise Slaughter is listed.\n   - The \"first elected\" column shows that she was first elected in 1986, not 1998.\n\n2. **She retired with a Democratic gain in the 2006 election:**\n   - Check the \"results\" column for \"new york 28.\"\n   - It states \"re-elected,\" indicating she did not retire and there was no change to a different party (Democratic gain) in this context, as it was already held by Democrats.\n\nBased on these checks, the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells are those that provide information about Louise Slaughter's first election year and her results for New York's 28th district:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
