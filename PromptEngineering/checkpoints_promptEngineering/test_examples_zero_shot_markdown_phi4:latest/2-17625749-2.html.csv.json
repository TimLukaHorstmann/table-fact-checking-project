The relevant column here is \"points.\"\n\nLet's list out the points for all the clubs:\n\n1. Pontyclun RFC: 86\n2. Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n3. Barry RFC: 63\n4. St Albans RFC: 55\n5. Deri RFC: 52\n6. Hirwaun RFC: 51\n7. Penygraig RFC: 43\n8. Cowbridge RFC: 37\n9. Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n10. Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n11. Canton RFC: 10\n\nThe task is to find the club with the fourth-least points. This means we should look for the fourth-lowest value in the \"points\" column:\n\n- The least point is 10 (Canton RFC).\n- The second-least point is 19 (Dinas Powys RFC).\n- The third-least point is 33 (Old Penarthians RFC).\n- The fourth-least point is 37 (Cowbridge RFC).\n\nThe claim states that \"canton rfc gain the fourth - least point through 20 game,\" which implies Canton RFC should have the fourth-lowest number of points. However, as we can see from our analysis, it's actually Cowbridge RFC with 37 points who holds the fourth-least position, not Canton RFC.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are the \"points\" column for all clubs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
