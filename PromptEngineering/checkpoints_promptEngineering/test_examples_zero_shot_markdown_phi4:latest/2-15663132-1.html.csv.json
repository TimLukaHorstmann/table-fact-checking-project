    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"no 2 song have the same amount of week on top,\" we need to analyze the data in the \"weeks on top\" column from the table.\n\n1. Extract and list all values from the \"weeks on top\" column:\n   - 6 weeks: \"how deep is your love\"\n   - 1 week: \"you 're in my heart (the final acclaim)\"\n   - 1 week: \"baby come back\"\n   - 4 weeks: \"stayin' alive\"\n   - 1 week: \"sometimes when we touch\"\n   - 1 week: \"emotion\"\n   - 5 weeks: \"night fever\"\n   - 2 weeks: \"if i can't have you\"\n   - 1 week: \"the closer i get to you\"\n   - 3 weeks: \"with a little luck\"\n   - 3 weeks: \"shadow dancing\"\n   - 1 week: \"it 's a heartache\"\n   - 4 weeks: \"baker street\"\n   - 2 weeks: \"miss you\"\n   - 4 weeks: \"three times a lady\"\n   - 1 week: \"grease\"\n   - information missing for this week (irrelevant to the claim)\n   - 1 week: \"hopelessly devoted to you\"\n   - 2 weeks: \"hot child in the city\"\n   - 4 weeks: \"you needed me\"\n   - 2 weeks: \"macarthur park\"\n   - 3 weeks: \"you don't bring me flowers\"\n   - 2 weeks: \"i just wanna stop\"\n\n2. Check for duplicate values:\n   - The value \"1\" appears multiple times.\n   - The value \"4\" appears multiple times.\n   - The value \"2\" appears multiple times.\n   - The value \"3\" appears multiple times.\n   - The value \"5\" and \"6\" each appear only once.\n\nSince the claim states that no two songs should have the same number of weeks on top, but we found several duplicate values (1, 4, 2, and 3), the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for this verification are all entries in the \"weeks on top\" column.
