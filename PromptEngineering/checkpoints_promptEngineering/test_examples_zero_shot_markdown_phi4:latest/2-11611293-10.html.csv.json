    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following conditions based on the given table:\n\nThe claim states: \"lj burger be a player on 19 - 2 - 2003\"\n\nFrom this statement, we extract:\n1. The player name should be \"lj burger\".\n2. The date should be \"19 - 2 - 2003\".\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant columns in the table to check these conditions:\n\n- **Player Column**: This column contains the names of players.\n- **Date Column**: This column contains the dates on which matches were played.\n\nWe need to find a row where:\n- The \"player\" is \"lj burger\".\n- The \"date\" is \"19 - 2 - 2003\".\n\nLet's go through the table and identify any matching rows:\n\n1. Row 0: player = \"m kaif\", date = \"10 - 03 - 2003\"\n2. Row 1: player = \"v sehwag\", date = \"12 - 02 - 2003\"\n3. **Row 2**: player = \"lj burger\", date = \"19 - 02 - 2003\" (Matches both conditions)\n4. Row 3: player = \"jp maher\", date = \"20 - 02 - 2003\"\n5. Row 4: player = \"hh dippenaar\", date = \"22 - 02 - 2003\"\n6. Row 5: player = \"d mongia\", date = \"23 - 02 - 2003\"\n7. Row 6: player = \"v sehwag\", date = \"26 - 02 - 2003\"\n8. Row 7: player = \"af giles\", date = \"02 - 03 - 2003\"\n\nWe find that in **Row 2**, both conditions are satisfied:\n- The player is \"lj burger\".\n- The date is \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n\nSince there exists a row where both the specified player and date match, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Find the row where the player's name is \"jp maher.\"\n2. Check if the date in that row matches \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- The row with \"jp maher\" as the player (row index 3) has the date \"20 - 02 - 2003,\" not \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n  \nThus, the claim is false because the date associated with \"jp maher\" does not match the claimed date.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for this verification:\n\n- The player name (\"jp maher\") is in column \"player\" at row index 3.\n- The date (\"20 - 02 - 2003\") is in column \"date\" at row index 3.\n\nThe JSON object with our findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
