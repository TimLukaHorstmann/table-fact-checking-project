    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each condition specified in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. \"no bronze medal with more than 1 medal total\"\n2. \"fewer than 1 silver medal\"\n3. \"a rank of 8\"\n\nWe will examine these conditions one by one:\n\n#### Condition 1: \"no bronze medal with more than 1 medal total\"\n- This means we are looking for any row where the number of bronze medals is greater than 1, and also checking if the total medals (sum of gold, silver, and bronze) exceed 1.\n\n#### Condition 2: \"fewer than 1 silver medal\"\n- We need to check for rows with less than 1 silver medal. This means the silver count must be 0.\n\n#### Condition 3: \"a rank of 8\"\n- The row in question must have a rank of 8.\n\nLet's examine these conditions on each relevant row:\n\n|   rank | nation              |   gold |   silver |   bronze |   total |\n|-------:|:--------------------|-------:|---------:|---------:|--------:|\n|      8 | bermuda             |      0 |        2 |        2 |       4 |\n\n- **Row with rank 8 (Bermuda):**\n  - Bronze medals = 2 (which is more than 1)\n  - Total medals = 4 (which is more than 1)\n  - Silver medals = 2 (which is not fewer than 1)\n\nThis row satisfies the condition of having more than 1 bronze medal and more than 1 total medal, but it does not satisfy the condition of having fewer than 1 silver medal.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nSince no row with a rank of 8 meets all three conditions simultaneously, the claim is true. There are no rows where there is a rank of 8 with more than 1 bronze medal and more than 1 total medal while also having fewer than 1 silver medal.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nFor completeness, we identify the relevant cells from the row that partially satisfied the conditions:\n\n- Row index for Bermuda: 7\n- Columns to check: \"silver\" and \"bronze\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
