    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the release date average 1 every 2 months\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The column of interest for this claim is \"released,\" which contains the release dates of various series.\n\n2. **Extract Release Dates:**\n   - From the table:\n     - October 2011\n     - November 2011\n     - December 2011\n     - May 2012\n     - June 2012\n     - July 2012\n     - August 2012\n     - September 2012\n\n3. **Count Total Releases and Calculate Average Interval:**\n   - There are a total of 8 releases.\n   - The time span from the first release (October 2011) to the last release (September 2012) is 11 months.\n\n4. **Calculate Average Release Interval:**\n   - To find the average interval between releases, divide the total number of months by one less than the total number of releases (since intervals are between consecutive items).\n   - Number of intervals = Total Releases - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\n   - Average interval = Total Months / Number of Intervals = 11 months / 7 intervals \u2248 1.57 months\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that releases occur on average once every 2 months.\n   - Our calculated average release interval is approximately 1.57 months, which is less than 2 months.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual average interval (approximately 1.57 months) is less than the claimed 2 months, the claim does not hold true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The cells in the \"released\" column are relevant for this evaluation.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"released\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
