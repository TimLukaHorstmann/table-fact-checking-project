    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify whether \"7 days and 7 nights\" (the song by Brolle) received a total of 79 votes according to the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are interested in the row corresponding to Brolle's performance.\n   - The relevant columns for verifying vote totals are:\n     - \"juries\": Represents the number of votes from juries.\n     - \"viewers\": Represents the number of votes from viewers.\n     - \"total\": Represents the sum of jury and viewer votes.\n\n2. **Locate Brolle's Row**:\n   - From the table, we can see that Brolle is listed in row 4 (as rows are zero-indexed, this corresponds to index 3).\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Values**:\n   - Juries Votes for Brolle: 8\n   - Viewers Votes for Brolle: 21\n   - Total Votes for Brolle: 29\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"7 days and 7 nights\" (Brolle's song) received a total of 79 votes.\n   - According to the table, the actual total is 29.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim does not match the data in the table since the total votes for Brolle are 29, not 79.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells are those that contain the juries, viewers, and total votes for Brolle's performance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"juries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
