October 2011 is still within our period.\n\nFrom this analysis, we identify 6 tournaments from 2010 through 2011 (rows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n#### Step 2: Check if Any of These Tournaments Were Won by Peter Senior\n\n- **Rows 0 to 5:** In each row's \"runner(s) - up\" column:\n  - Row 0: Tommy Armour III\n  - Row 1: Ronnie Black\n  - Row 2: Corey Pavin\n  - Row 3: Mark Wiebe\n  - Row 4: John Cook\n  - Row 5: Mark Calcavecchia\n\nPeter Senior is not listed as a runner-up in any of these tournaments.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\n- There are indeed 6 tournaments from 2010 through 2011.\n- None of them was won by Peter Senior. Therefore, the second condition of the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}, // Just to confirm Peter Senior was not a runner-up within the date range\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing dates between February 14, 2010, and October 16, 2011, as well as the runner-up entries for these tournaments to verify that Peter Senior was not listed.",
