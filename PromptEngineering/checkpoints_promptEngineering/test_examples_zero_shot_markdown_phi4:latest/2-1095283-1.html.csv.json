    "resp": "To verify the claim about cyanogen bromide, we need to examine two specific attributes from the table: \"field stability\" and \"effectiveness as blood agent\". The relevant row for cyanogen bromide in the table is identified by the agent name.\n\n1. **Identify Cyanogen Bromide Row**:  \n   - Cyanogen bromide appears on the fourth row of the table, with an index of 3 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Check \"Field Stability\"**:\n   - According to the claim, cyanogen bromide should have a field stability of 5.\n   - In the table, under the column \"field stability\", the value for cyanogen bromide is indeed 5.\n\n3. **Check \"Effectiveness as Blood Agent\"**:\n   - The claim states that cyanogen bromide has an effectiveness as a blood agent of 9.\n   - In the table, under the column \"effectiveness as blood agent\", the value for cyanogen bromide is 9.\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"field stability\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"effectiveness as blood agent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
