We need to confirm if the opponent at the row with the minimum attendance is indeed the Athletics.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- Look through each entry in the \"attendance\" column:\n  - May 3: 20809\n  - Other values are higher than 20809.\n\n- The game on May 3 has the lowest attendance of 20,809.\n\n- Check the opponent for this date:\n  - On May 3, the opponent is \"royals.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the game with the lowest attendance was against the Athletics.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the performance of the Toronto Blue Jays in their last three games in May 1991 based on the provided table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n- The claim states that \"the Toronto Blue Jay win 2 of the last 3 game they play in may 1991.\"\n- We need to identify the team represented by this record and verify their results in the last three games listed for May 1991.\n  \n### Analysis of the Table:\n\n1. **Identifying the Team:**\n   - Since there is no direct mention of \"Toronto Blue Jays\" in the table, we must infer it from the context. The record starts with a \"12-10,\" which seems to represent the beginning of their season's win-loss record.\n   - As they play against teams like Rangers, Royals, White Sox, Athletics, and Angels in May 1991, this likely represents the Toronto Blue Jays' performance since these teams are consistent opponents for them during that era.\n\n2. **Last Three Games Analysis:**\n   - We need to look at the last three entries (rows) of the table corresponding to May 1991.\n     - **Row 29:** Athletics, Score: 8-3, Record: 26-20\n     - **Row 30:** Athletics, Score: 8-6, Record: 26-21\n     - **Row 31:** Angels, Score: 5-1, Record: 27-21\n\n3. **Game Outcomes for the Last Three Games:**\n   - **May 29 vs. Athletics (Row 29):** \n     - Toronto Blue Jays win with a score of 8-3.\n   - **May 30 vs. Athletics (Row 30):**\n     - Toronto Blue Jays lose with a score of 8-6.\n   - **May 31 vs. Angels (Row 31):**\n     - Toronto Blue Jays win with a score of 5-1.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Out of the last three games, the team won two and lost one:\n     - Wins: May 29 & May 31\n     - Loss: May 30\n\nSince the record shows that they won two out of their last three games in May 1991, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- **Row 29 (May 29):** \"score\": \"8 - 3\", \"record\": \"26 - 20\"\n- **Row 30 (May 30):** \"score\": \"8 - 6\", \"record\": \"26 - 21\"\n- **Row 31 (May 31):** \"score\": \"5 - 1\", \"record\": \"27 - 21\"\n\nThese cells provide the necessary information to verify the outcome of the last three games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Toronto Blue Jays losing one consecutive game between May 25 and May 28, 1991 is true or false, we need to examine the relevant section of the table.\n\nThe claim specifies a period between May 25 and May 28. Let's extract the data for these dates:\n\n- **May 25**: Opponent - Angels; Score - 5 - 0; Loss - Stottlemyre (5 - 1); Attendance - 36732; Record - 25 - 18\n- **May 26**: Opponent - Angels; Score - 6 - 2; Loss - Wells (5 - 4); Attendance - 45307; Record - 25 - 19\n- **May 28**: Opponent - Athletics; Score - 8 - 4; Loss - Acker (1 - 2); Attendance - 50299; Record - 25 - 20\n\nThe claim is about the Blue Jays losing one consecutive game during this period. Let's analyze:\n\n- On May 25, they lost to the Angels.\n- On May 26, they also lost to the Angels.\n- There is no game on May 27 (likely a day off or travel day).\n- On May 28, they again lost to the Athletics.\n\nThe relevant rows for this analysis are:\n- Row index 24: Date - May 25\n- Row index 25: Date - May 26\n- Row index 27: Date - May 28\n\nFrom this data, we can see that there were two consecutive losses on May 25 and May 26. The claim states \"one consecutive game,\" which is incorrect since they lost two consecutive games.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
