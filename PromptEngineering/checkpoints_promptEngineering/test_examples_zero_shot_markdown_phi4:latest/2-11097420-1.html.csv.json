    "resp": "To verify the claim \"potter co in copiah be the first project propose , but the last to be list,\" we need to examine two specific columns for all relevant rows: the \"proposed\" and \"listed\" dates.\n\n1. **Determine if \"Potter Co\" is the first proposed:**\n   - We will check the \"proposed\" column for each row.\n   - We compare all \"proposed\" dates, identifying the earliest one.\n   - The relevant cells are:\n     - Row index 2 (\"Davis Timber Company\"): Proposed on 05/11/2000\n     - Row index 3 (\"Flowood Site\"): Proposed on 09/08/1983\n     - Row index 4 (\"Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.\"): Proposed on 10/15/1984\n     - **Row index 6 (\"Potter Co\")**: Proposed on 05/10/1993\n     - Row index 7 (\"Picayune Wood Treating\"): Proposed on 03/08/2004\n     - Row index 8 (\"Sonford Products\"): Proposed on 09/27/2006\n     - Row index 9 (\"Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses\"): Cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL\n\n   The earliest \"proposed\" date is for the \"Flowood Site\" at 09/08/1983. Thus, \"Potter Co\" is not the first proposed.\n\n2. **Determine if \"Potter Co\" is the last listed:**\n   - We will check the \"listed\" column for each row that has a listed date.\n   - We compare all \"listed\" dates, identifying the latest one.\n   - The relevant cells are:\n     - Row index 1 (\"Chemfax, Inc.\"): Listed date is missing\n     - **Row index 2 (\"Davis Timber Company\")**: Listed on 07/27/2000\n     - Row index 3 (\"Flowood Site\"): Listed on 09/21/1984\n     - Row index 4 (\"Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.\"): Listed on 06/10/1986\n     - **Row index 5 (\"Picayune Wood Treating\")**: Listed on 07/22/2004\n     - Row index 7 (\"Sonford Products\"): Listed on 03/07/2007\n\n   The latest \"listed\" date is for \"Sonford Products\" at 03/07/2007. Thus, \"Potter Co\" is not the last listed.\n\nGiven that both conditions are not satisfied (i.e., \"Potter Co\" is neither the first proposed nor the last listed), the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this conclusion are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
