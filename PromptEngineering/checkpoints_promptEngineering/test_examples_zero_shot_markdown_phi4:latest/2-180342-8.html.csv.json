Identify the relevant column:\n   - The \"years as tallest\" column provides information about how long each building remained the tallest.\n\n2. Extract and calculate the duration each building was the tallest:\n   - **White Tower**: 1310 - 1098 = 212 years\n   - **Old St Paul's Cathedral**: 1666 - 1310 = 356 years\n   - **Southwark Cathedral**: 1677 - 1666 = 11 years\n   - **Monument to the Great Fire of London**: 1683 - 1677 = 6 years\n   - **St Mary-le-Bow**: 1710 - 1683 = 27 years\n   - **St Paul's Cathedral**: 1939 - 1710 = 229 years\n   - **Battersea Power Station**: 1950 - 1939 = 11 years\n   - **Crystal Palace Transmitting Station**: 1991 - 1950 = 41 years\n   - **One Canada Square**: 2010 - 1991 = 19 years\n   - **Shard London Bridge**: from 2010 to present (assuming current year is 2023 for calculation): 13 years\n\n3. Determine the order of duration:\n   - Old St Paul's Cathedral: 356 years\n   - St Paul's Cathedral: 229 years\n   - White Tower: 212 years\n   - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station: 41 years\n   - One Canada Square: 19 years\n   - Southwark Cathedral: 11 years (tied)\n   - Battersea Power Station: 11 years (tied)\n   - St Mary-le-Bow: 27 years\n   - Shard London Bridge: 13 years\n   - Monument to the Great Fire of London: 6 years\n\n4. Verify if Old St Paul's Cathedral was the second longest:\n   - The first-longest period is held by Old St Paul's Cathedral at 356 years.\n   - The second-longest period is held by St Paul's Cathedral at 229 years.\n\nThe claim that \"Old St Paul's Cathedral\" was the tallest for the second-longest period of time is FALSE. Therefore, we will mark this conclusion and identify relevant cells in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"just under 3 century pass before Southwark have the tallest building or structure,\" we need to analyze the timeline given in the table for when structures located in Southwark were the tallest.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The rows that mention Southwark as a location are relevant:\n     - Row 3: \"Southwark Cathedral\"\n     - Row 10: \"Shard London Bridge\"\n\n2. **Check Timeframes for Tallest Structure in Southwark:**\n   - For \"Southwark Cathedral\" (Row 3), the years it was tallest are 1666 to 1677.\n   - For \"Shard London Bridge\" (Row 10), the timeframe starts from 2010 and continues onwards.\n\n3. **Calculate Time Between Structures in Southwark:**\n   - The period between when Southwark Cathedral was the tallest (ending in 1677) and when Shard London Bridge became the tallest (starting in 2010) needs to be calculated.\n   - From 1677 to 2010 is a span of \\(2010 - 1677 = 333\\) years.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"just under 3 century pass before Southwark have the tallest building or structure.\"\n   - Three centuries equal 300 years.\n   - Since 333 years is more than 300 years, the statement that \"just under 3 century\" passes does not hold true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells for verifying the claim are those indicating the timeframes for Southwark structures being the tallest:\n\n- **Row 3:** \"years as tallest\" (1666 - 1677)\n- **Row 10:** \"years as tallest\" (2010-)\n\nThus, the final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
