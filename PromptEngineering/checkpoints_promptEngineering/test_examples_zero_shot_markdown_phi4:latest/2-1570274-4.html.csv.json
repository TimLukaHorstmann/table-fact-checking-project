Check if Tony Lema made it to the top 10 in the PGA Championship:**\n\n- Look at the \"PGA Championship\" row under the \"top - 10\" column:\n  - The value is `1`, indicating that there was one instance of reaching the top 10.\n\nThis satisfies part of the claim that he made it into the top 10 during the PGA Championship.\n\n**2. Check if Tony Lema continued on in the PGA Championship:**\n\n- Look at the \"PGA Championship\" row under the \"cuts made\" column:\n  - The value is `4`, indicating that cuts were made in 4 instances.\n  \nTo determine whether he completed the tournament, we need to check the \"events\" count against how many times he continued past the cut:\n\n- Look at the \"PGA Championship\" row under the \"events\" column:\n  - The value is `5`.\n\nSince Tony Lema participated in 5 events but made cuts only 4 times, this suggests there was one instance where he did not continue after reaching the top 10.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that he reached the top 10 in the PGA Championship and then did not continue on. The data shows:\n\n- He made it to the top 10 once (`top - 10` = 1).\n- He did not complete all events, as there is one event where cuts were not made (participation = 5, cuts made = 4).\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- \"PGA Championship\" row under \"top - 10\"\n- \"PGA Championship\" row under \"events\"\n- \"PGA Championship\" row under \"cuts made\"\n\nHere's the JSON response with the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
