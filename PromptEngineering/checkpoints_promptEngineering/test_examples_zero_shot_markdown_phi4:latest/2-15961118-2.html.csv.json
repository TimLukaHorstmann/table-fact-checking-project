    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of it against the table:\n\n1. **\"cup noodle honda be the only team with nsr250\"**: This means that among all entries in the table, \"cup noodle - honda\" should be the sole team using an \"nsr250\".\n\n2. **\"have less than 8 point\"**: This means that for any team using \"nsr250\", their points should be less than 8.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 1 (1993, 250cc)**: \n  - Team: cup noodle - honda\n  - Machine: nsr250\n  - Points: 8\n\n- **Row 2 (1994, 250cc)**:\n  - Team: cup noodle - honda\n  - Machine: nsr250\n  - Points: 11\n\nFrom the examination:\n\n1. The teams using \"nsr250\" are both in rows 1 and 2.\n2. Both entries have \"cup noodle - honda\" as the team, confirming it is the only team with \"nsr250\".\n3. For row 1, points = 8 (not less than 8).\n4. For row 2, points = 11 (also not less than 8).\n\nSince neither of the entries for \"cup noodle - honda\" using \"nsr250\" have points less than 8, the second part of the claim is false.\n\nThus, the overall claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row 1, columns: team, machine, points\n- Row 2, columns: team, machine, points\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
