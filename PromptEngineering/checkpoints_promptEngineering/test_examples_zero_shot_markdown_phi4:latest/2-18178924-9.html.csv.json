    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"wales be the opposing team with the against of 9\", we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The opposing team should be \"wales\".\n2. The value in the column \"against\" for this row should be 9.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows and columns from the table:\n\n- Row Index 1:\n  - Column \"opposing teams\": \"wales\"\n  - Column \"against\": 9\n\nThe conditions are satisfied by this row (Row Index 1), as both the opposing team is \"wales\" and the value in the \"against\" column is 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Twickenham, London have less than 16 against,\" we need to analyze the table and identify relevant data points. The claim is specifically about matches played at Twickenham in London where the opposing team scored fewer than 16 points.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played at Twickenham, London:**\n   - We need to check the \"venue\" column for entries that match \"twickenham , london\".\n\n2. **Check Scores Against Opposing Teams:**\n   - For these identified matches, we will look at the \"against\" column to see if the score is less than 16.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the table:\n\n- **Row 1:** Venue is \"parc des princes , paris\", so it's not relevant.\n- **Row 2:** Venue is \"twickenham , london\". The opposing team scored 9. This matches our criteria (less than 16).\n- **Row 3:** Venue is \"murrayfield , edinburgh\", so it's not relevant.\n- **Row 4:** Venue is \"twickenham , london\". The opposing team scored 9. This also matches our criteria (less than 16).\n- **Row 5:** Venue is \"twickenham , london\". The opposing team scored 16. This does not match our criteria.\n\nFrom the analysis, we find that for Twickenham, London:\n- Row 2 and Row 4 have scores less than 16 against.\n- Row 5 has a score of exactly 16, which does not satisfy \"less than 16.\"\n\nSince there are matches at Twickenham with scores both less than and equal to 16, the claim is not fully supported. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
