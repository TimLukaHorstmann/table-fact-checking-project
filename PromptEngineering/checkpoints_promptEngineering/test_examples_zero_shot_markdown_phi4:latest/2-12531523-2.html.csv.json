    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"larry mize play for the united state\" is true or false, we need to examine the table and find relevant information about Larry Mize.\n\n1. Identify the row associated with Larry Mize:\n   - The row corresponding to Larry Mize in the table can be identified by his name in the first column (\"player\"). This occurs at `row_index` 8.\n\n2. Check the \"country\" column for Larry Mize:\n   - We need to verify which country is listed under the \"country\" column for this row (i.e., `row_index` 8). According to the table, the value in the \"country\" column for Larry Mize is \"united states\".\n\n3. Determine if the claim matches the information from the table:\n   - The claim states that Larry Mize played for the United States. Since the \"country\" entry for Larry Mize in the table reads \"united states\", this supports the claim.\n\nThus, based on the table data:\n\n- The relevant cell to verify the claim is located at `row_index` 8 and column_name \"country\".\n  \nThe answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table and verify the details related to Tom Watson's performance.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n- **Claim:** \"Tom Watson's win total from 1976 be 154\"\n\n### Relevant Information in the Table:\n1. **Player Name:** We are looking for \"tom watson\".\n2. **Year(s) Won:** The claim mentions the year 1976.\n3. **Total Score:** According to the claim, Tom Watson\u2019s score should be 154 in 1976.\n4. **To Par:** This is additional information that can confirm scoring consistency.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n1. Locate \"Tom Watson\" in the table:\n   - He appears on row 4: \n     ```\n     | tom watson          | united states | 1977 , 1981        |     150 | + 6      |\n     ```\n\n2. Check if he won in 1976 according to the table:\n   - The years listed for Tom Watson are 1977 and 1981.\n\n3. Compare his score with the claim:\n   - His total score listed is 150, not 154.\n   - There's no entry for the year 1976 under \"year (s) won\" for Tom Watson.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim that Tom Watson\u2019s win total from 1976 was 154 is false because he did not win in 1976 according to the table. Additionally, his listed total score of 150 further contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.
