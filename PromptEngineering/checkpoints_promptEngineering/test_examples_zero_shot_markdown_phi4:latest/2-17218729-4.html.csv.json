    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze two conditions in the table:\n\n1. The game where Pittsburgh's points exceed 24.\n2. For this specific game, check if Pittsburgh was the visitor and if the attendance was 14,995.\n\nLet's go through the process step-by-step using the given table:\n\n- First, identify all rows where the \"points\" column is greater than 24:\n  - December 25: points = 27\n  - December 26: points = 27\n  - December 31: points = 28\n\n- Next, check if Pittsburgh was the visitor in these games:\n  - December 25: Visitor is Montreal (not Pittsburgh)\n  - December 26: Visitor is Pittsburgh\n  - December 31: Visitor is Buffalo (not Pittsburgh)\n\n- Finally, verify if the attendance for the game where Pittsburgh was the visitor and points exceeded 24 was 14,995:\n  - December 26: Attendance = 14,626 (not 14,995)\n\nFrom this analysis, there are no games where both conditions are met simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table to verify the claim:\n\n- Points greater than 24:\n  - Row index 10: points = 27\n  - Row index 11: points = 27\n  - Row index 13: points = 28\n\n- Visitor column for these rows:\n  - Row index 10: visitor is Montreal\n  - Row index 11: visitor is Pittsburgh (relevant)\n  - Row index 13: visitor is Buffalo\n\n- Attendance column for the relevant row where Pittsburgh was the visitor and points exceeded 24:\n  - Row index 11: attendance = 14,626\n\nThe relevant cells are those that help us verify both conditions of the claim.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
