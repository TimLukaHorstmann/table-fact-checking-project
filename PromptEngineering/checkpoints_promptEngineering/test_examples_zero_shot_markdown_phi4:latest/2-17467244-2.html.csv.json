    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to examine specific matches in Tisha Venturini's career for draws. The claim mentions three dates with matches ending in a draw: June 6, 1995; July 25, 1996; and July 10, 1999.\n\nLet's verify each match against the provided table:\n\n1. **June 6, 1995**:\n   - We look for the match on \"1995-06-06\" in the table.\n   - This corresponds to row index 0, where the result is listed as \"3 - 3\".\n   - The date matches and it's a draw.\n\n2. **July 25, 1996**:\n   - We look for the match on \"1996-07-25\" in the table.\n   - This corresponds to row index 8, where the result is listed as \"0 - 0\".\n   - The date matches and it's a draw.\n\n3. **July 10, 1999**:\n   - We look for the match on \"1999-07-10\" in the table.\n   - This corresponds to row index 12, where the result is listed as \"0 - 0 (Pso 5 - 4)\".\n   - The date matches and although it ended in a penalty shootout after a draw, it still counts as ending in a draw for regular time.\n\nThe claim that these three matches ended in a draw is supported by the data from the table.
