Each win by decision should last at least 3 rounds.\n\nLet's examine each condition using the relevant cells from the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Wins and Their Methods\nWe look at the rows where the result is \"win\" to identify her victories:\n\n- **Row 4**: Win by decision (against Duane Ludwig)\n- **Row 5**: Win by tko (against Rudy Vallederas) - Not relevant for decision method.\n- **Row 6**: Win by tko (strikes) (against Shad Smith) - Not relevant for decision method.\n\nFrom the above, only Row 4 shows a win by decision. There is no second win by decision, as required by the claim.\n\n### Step 2: Check Round Count for Decision Wins\nFor the single win by decision identified in Step 1:\n- **Row 4**: The round count is 3 (against Duane Ludwig).\n\nThe condition that each decision win should last at least 3 rounds holds true for this one case, but it doesn't satisfy the first requirement of having two wins by decision.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince only one win is by decision and not two, the claim does not hold.

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to examine each condition in it:\n\n1. The claim states that Kelly's third win came against Rudy Vallederas by TKO.\n2. It specifies that this win was outside of a typical round.\n\nLet's break down these conditions using the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Kelly\u2019s Wins:**\n  - First win: Against Duane Ludwig (Decision, Round 3)\n  - Second win: Against Shad Smith (TKO by strikes, Round 1)\n  - Third win: Against Rudy Vallederas (TKO)\n\n- **Third Win Details:**\n  - The third win is against Rudy Vallederas, with the method being TKO.\n  - This match does not specify a round (\"n/a\").\n\nThe claim asserts that Kelly's third win was by TKO and outside of a typical round. In martial arts competitions, rounds are usually numbered (e.g., Round 1, Round 2), so \"n/a\" for the round can be interpreted as being outside the typical round structure.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- Kelly\u2019s third win details:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Columns: `record`, `opponent`, `method`, `round`\n\nThese columns and row provide the necessary information to confirm both parts of the claim.\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data, so the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
