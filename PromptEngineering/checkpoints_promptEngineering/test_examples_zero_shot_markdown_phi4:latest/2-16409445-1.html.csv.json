Among these games, find the one with the least attendance and check if it involved the New Orleans Saints.\n\nLet's analyze the data for each week in November 1997:\n- Week 10 (November 2, 1997) against the Carolina Panthers: Attendance = 71,064\n- Week 11 (November 9, 1997) against the New Orleans Saints: Attendance = 40,091\n- Week 12 (November 16, 1997) against the San Diego Chargers: Attendance = 65,714\n- Week 13 (November 24, 1997) against the Denver Broncos: Attendance = 75,307\n\nNow let's identify the game with the least attendance in November:\n- The lowest attendance is 40,091 for Week 11 on November 9, 1997, where the opponent was indeed the New Orleans Saints.\n\nSince both conditions are met (the game occurred in November and had the lowest attendance of that month), the claim is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify this are:\n- For Week 10: Attendance = 71,064\n- For Week 11: Opponent = \"New Orleans Saints\", Attendance = 40,091\n- For Week 12: Attendance = 65,714\n- For Week 13: Attendance = 75,307\n\nTherefore, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
