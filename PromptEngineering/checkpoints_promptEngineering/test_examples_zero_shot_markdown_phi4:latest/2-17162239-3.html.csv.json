Scott Hoch has a score under 66.\n     2. If he had a score under 66, he would not be from the United States.\n\n2. **Table Evaluation**:\n   - We need to locate \"Scott Hoch\" in the table and check his \"score\" and \"country\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Scott Hoch is listed with a score of 66.\n     - His country is \"United States\".\n\n3. **Verification Against Claim**:\n   - The condition that \"Scott Hoch has a score under 66\" is not met because his score is exactly 66, not under 66.\n   - Therefore, the hypothetical scenario in the claim does not occur.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Scott Hoch's score is not under 66, the part of the claim concerning a score under 66 and nationality doesn't apply.\n   - The claim as stated can be considered TRUE because the conditions for it to be false are never met.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to identify the cells in the table that verify these points:\n     - Row index 0, \"player\" column: Scott Hoch\n     - Row index 0, \"score\" column: 66 (which is not under 66)\n     - Row index 0, \"country\" column: United States\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
