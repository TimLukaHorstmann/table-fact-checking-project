Identify the row where \"screening started\" is March 29, 2006.\n2. Check if \"screening completed\" for this row is on or before May 3, 2006.\n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- The \"screening started\" column does not contain a date exactly matching March 29, 2006. Instead, it contains March 27, 2006, as the closest date.\n- There is no exact match for a screening starting on March 29, 2006.\n\nSince there is no row with \"screening started\" on March 29, 2006, we cannot verify that such a screening was completed by May 3, 2006. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n\n- Row index 9: \"screening started\" (March 27, 2006)\n- Row index 9: \"screening completed\" (May 5, 2006)\n\nThese cells are relevant because they contain dates closest to those mentioned in the claim.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"screening started\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"screening completed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
