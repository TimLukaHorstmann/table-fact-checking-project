    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if Naomi Cavaday was one of two opponents who played on a hard surface according to the table.\n\n1. **Identify matches with \"hard\" surfaces**:\n   - Scan through the \"surface\" column in the table for entries that say \"hard\".\n\n2. **Check against opponent names**:\n   - For each entry marked as \"hard\", verify if the \"opponent\" column lists Naomi Cavaday.\n\n3. **Count total opponents on hard surface**:\n   - Count how many unique opponents played on a hard surface.\n\n4. **Verify claim condition**:\n   - If Naomi Cavaday is one of two opponents who played on a hard surface, the claim is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Scan \"surface\" column for \"hard\":**\n   - From the table, there is only one entry where the surface is listed as \"hard\".\n\n2. **Check opponent name:**\n   - The row with a \"hard\" surface lists Naomi Cavaday as the opponent.\n\n3. **Count opponents on hard surface:**\n   - Since there's only one match recorded with a \"hard\" surface, the total number of unique opponents is just Naomi Cavaday herself.\n\n4. **Verify claim:**\n   - The claim states that Naomi Cavaday should be one of two opponents playing on a hard surface, but we found only one such instance in the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells:\n\n- The row index where \"Naomi Cavaday\" plays on a \"hard\" surface (runner-up) is 6.\n- The columns involved are \"surface\" and \"opponent\".\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
