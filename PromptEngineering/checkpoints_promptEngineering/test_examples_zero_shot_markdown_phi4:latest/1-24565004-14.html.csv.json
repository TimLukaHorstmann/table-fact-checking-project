    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 is the highest scorer for the Paris Saint-Germain football club though Bernard Mendy have the most appearances,\" we need to consider two separate conditions:\n\n1. Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 must have scored more goals than any other player in the table.\n2. Bernard Mendy must have made the most appearances compared to all other players in the table.\n\nLet's examine each condition by looking at the relevant columns from the table, which are \"goals\" for the first condition and \"appearances\" for the second condition:\n\n1. **Highest Scorer**: To find the highest scorer, we look at the \"goals\" column.\n   - Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 scored 95 goals, according to his row.\n\n2. **Most Appearances**: To find who made the most appearances, we examine the \"appearances\" column.\n   - Bernard Mendy made 249 appearances, as listed in his row.\n\nNow, let's compare these numbers with those of other players in the table:\n\n- For the highest scorer:\n  - J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez scored 17 goals. This is much lower than M'Pel\u00e9's 95 goals.\n  - Florian Maurice also scored 14 goals, which again is less than M'Pel\u00e9's total.\n  - All other players have either equal or fewer goals than Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9.\n\n- For the most appearances:\n  - Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 made 118 appearances. This number is significantly lower than Mendy's 249 appearances.\n  - Blaise Matuidi has played in 87 matches, which is less than Bernard Mendy's total.\n  - All other players have either equal or fewer appearances compared to Bernard Mendy.\n\nBased on the data provided in the table, Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 does indeed have the highest number of goals scored among all listed players, making him the highest scorer. Furthermore, Bernard Mendy has made more appearances than any other player on the list, confirming he has the most appearances.\n\nSince both conditions are met according to the information given in the markdown table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification from the markdown table are as follows:\n\n- For Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9's goals: row_index 26 (Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9), column_name \"goals\"\n- For Bernard Mendy's appearances: row_index 19 (Bernard Mendy), column_name \"appearances\"\n\nHere is the requested JSON object with our conclusion and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Bernard Mendy have the most appearance and score the most goal for the Paris Saint-Germain football club,\" we need to examine two conditions within the table:\n\n1. **Most Appearances**: Check if Bernard Mendy has the highest number of appearances.\n2. **Most Goals**: Check if Bernard Mendy scores the highest number of goals.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition based on the provided data:\n\n### 1. Most Appearances\n\n- We need to find which player(s) have the maximum value in the \"appearances\" column.\n- From the table, Bernard Mendy has 249 appearances.\n- Let\u2019s compare this with other players:\n  - Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9: 118 appearances\n  - Larry Mabiala: 13 appearances\n  - Micka\u00ebl Madar: 46 appearances\n  - St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9: 33 appearances\n  - Tripy Makonda: 27 appearances\n  - Michel Marella: 60 appearances\n  - Patrice Marquet: 24 appearances\n  - Didier Martel: 5 appearances\n  - \u00c9ric Martin: 17 appearances\n  - Olivier Martinez: 3 appearances\n  - Blaise Matuidi: 87 appearances\n  - Florian Maurice: 47 appearances\n  - Jean-Eudes Maurice: 50 appearances\n  - Maxwell: 63 appearances\n  - Modeste M'Bami: 101 appearances\n  - Patrick Mboma: 24 appearances\n  - J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez: 84 appearances\n  - Franck M\u00e9relle: 1 appearance\n  - Roland Mitoraj: 68 appearances\n  - Mario Mongelli: 1 appearance\n  - Monteiro: 9 appearances\n  - Bernard Moraly: 21 appearances\n  - Fabrice Moreau: 3 appearances\n  - Thierry Morin: 174 appearances\n  - Thiago Motta: 31 appearances\n  - Jean-Michel Moutier: 38 appearances\n  - Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9: 217 appearances\n  - Youssuf Mulumbu: 22 appearances\n  - Edwin Murati: 24 appearances\n\nBernard Mendy indeed has the highest number of appearances.\n\n### 2. Most Goals\n\n- We need to find which player(s) have the maximum value in the \"goals\" column.\n- From the table, Bernard Mendy scored 11 goals.\n- Let\u2019s compare this with other players:\n  - Larry Mabiala: 1 goal\n  - Micka\u00ebl Madar: 17 goals\n  - St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9: 0 goals\n  - Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9: 1 goal\n  - Florian Makhedjouf: 0 goals\n  - Tripy Makonda: 0 goals\n  - Michel Marella: 14 goals\n  - Patrice Marquet: 2 goals\n  - Didier Martel: 0 goals\n  - \u00c9ric Martin: 1 goal\n  - Olivier Martinez: 0 goals\n  - Blaise Matuidi: 9 goals\n  - Florian Maurice: 14 goals\n  - Jean-Eudes Maurice: 3 goals\n  - Maxwell: 3 goals\n  - Modeste M'Bami: 1 goal\n  - Patrick Mboma: 6 goals\n  - J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez: 17 goals\n  - Franck M\u00e9relle: 0 goals\n  - Roland Mitoraj: 0 goals\n  - Mario Mongelli: 0 goals\n  - Monteiro: 5 goals\n  - Bernard Moraly: 0 goals\n  - Fabrice Moreau: 0 goals\n  - Thierry Morin: 1 goal\n  - Thiago Motta: 1 goal\n  - Jean-Michel Moutier: Not applicable (goalkeepers usually don't score)\n  - Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9: Not specified, but likely higher due to the number of appearances.\n  - Youssuf Mulumbu: 1 goal\n  - Edwin Murati: 1 goal\n\nBernard Mendy does not have the most goals; Micka\u00ebl Madar and J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez both scored 17 goals, which is more than Bernard Mendy's 11.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The condition for having the most appearances holds true.\n- The condition for scoring the most goals does not hold true.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
