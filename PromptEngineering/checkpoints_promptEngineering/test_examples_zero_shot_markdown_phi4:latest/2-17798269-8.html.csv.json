    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance numbers for all games played by the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009 and identify which game had the lowest attendance.\n\nThe relevant column here is \"attendance,\" as it directly relates to the number of people attending each game. We will compare the attendance figures across all rows provided in the table.\n\nHere are the attendance values extracted from the table:\n\n1. March 2, New York Islanders: 11,298\n2. March 4, Detroit Red Wings: 18,007\n3. March 8, Chicago Blackhawks: 22,121\n4. March 10, Atlanta Thrashers: 13,608\n5. March 12, Minnesota Wild: 14,213\n6. March 14, Edmonton Oilers: 16,839\n7. March 15, Vancouver Canucks: 18,630\n8. March 17, Minnesota Wild: 18,568\n9. March 19, Edmonton Oilers: 13,612\n10. March 22, San Jose Sharks: 17,496\n11. March 25, Anaheim Ducks: 16,279\n12. March 27, Vancouver Canucks: 16,177\n13. March 29, Anaheim Ducks: 17,182\n\nNext, we identify the lowest attendance from these numbers:\n\n- The lowest attendance is 11,298 for the game against the New York Islanders on March 2.\n\nSince this matches the claim that \"the lowest attended game for the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009 was against the New York Islanders,\" the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nNow we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- The cell containing the attendance figure for the game on March 2 against the New York Islanders is necessary to verify this claim. This information is found at row index 0, in the \"attendance\" column.\n- To ensure that no other game had a lower attendance, we also need to check all attendance figures from every other game, which means reviewing the \"attendance\" column across all rows.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row index 0, Column name: \"attendance\"\n2. Row indices 1 through 12, Column name: \"attendance\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the Colorado Avalanche's games in March 2009, we need to focus on identifying which games had the highest and second-highest scores for the Avalanche.\n\nThe relevant column in this table is \"score\" as it indicates the results of the matches. We'll analyze the goals scored by the opponents (since higher opponent scores indicate a higher scoring game for the opponents) and identify the two games with the highest opponent scores.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Extract Scores**: List all the scores where the opponent is mentioned along with the score.\n   - March 2: New York Islanders, Score: 4 - 2\n   - March 4: Detroit Red Wings, Score: 3 - 2\n   - March 8: Chicago Blackhawks, Score: 5 - 1\n   - March 10: Atlanta Thrashers, Score: 3 - 0\n   - March 12: Minnesota Wild, Score: 2 - 1\n   - March 14: Edmonton Oilers, Score: 3 - 2\n   - March 15: Vancouver Canucks, Score: 4 - 2\n   - March 17: Minnesota Wild, Score: 3 - 2\n   - March 19: Edmonton Oilers, Score: 8 - 1\n   - March 22: San Jose Sharks, Score: 3 - 1\n   - March 25: Anaheim Ducks, Score: 7 - 2\n   - March 27: Vancouver Canucks, Score: 4 - 1\n   - March 29: Anaheim Ducks, Score: 4 - 1\n\n2. **Identify Highest Scores**:\n   - Find the highest score given by an opponent to Colorado Avalanche.\n   - The highest score is against the Edmonton Oilers with 8 goals on March 19 (row index 9).\n   - The second-highest score is against Anaheim Ducks with 7 goals on March 25 (row index 11).\n\n3. **Verify Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the second-highest scoring game should be against the Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers.\n   - From our analysis, the second-highest scoring game was indeed against the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nTherefore, the claim is partially correct as it only correctly identifies one of the two teams (Anaheim Ducks) involved in the top two highest scoring games. The other team mentioned in the claim, \"Edmonton Oilers,\" corresponds to the highest-scoring game, not the second-highest.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because the second-highest scoring game was only against the Anaheim Ducks and not both teams mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the relevant rows for the claim:\n   - The specific mention of \"atlanta thrasher vs colorado avalanche\" suggests focusing on any row where Atlanta Thrashers are mentioned.\n   - Check if any games listed have a score indicating neither team scored, which would be represented as 0 - 0.\n\n2. Examine each row for the necessary conditions:\n   - **March 10**: The game against the Atlanta Thrashers has a score of \"3 - 0\" (Atlanta did not win this match, so it's between another opponent and Colorado Avalanche). Since the score is not \"0 - 0\", this condition fails.\n   - Search for any other rows with a score of \"0 - 0\":\n     - **March 2**: New York Islanders vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"4 - 2\".\n     - **March 4**: Detroit Red Wings vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"3 - 2\".\n     - **March 8**: Chicago Blackhawks vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"5 - 1\".\n     - **March 12**: Minnesota Wild vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"2 - 1\".\n     - **March 14**: Edmonton Oilers vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"3 - 2\".\n     - **March 15**: Vancouver Canucks vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"4 - 2\".\n     - **March 17**: Minnesota Wild vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"3 - 2\".\n     - **March 19**: Edmonton Oilers vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"8 - 1\".\n     - **March 22**: San Jose Sharks vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"3 - 1\".\n     - **March 25**: Anaheim Ducks vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"7 - 2\".\n     - **March 27**: Vancouver Canucks vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"4 - 1\".\n     - **March 29**: Anaheim Ducks vs. Colorado Avalanche, score \"4 - 1\".\n\n3. Conclusion:\n   - There are no games listed with a score of \"0 - 0\", which means there are no instances where neither team scored.\n   - The claim is false because the game against Atlanta Thrashers was not one of two such games; in fact, there were none.\n\nThe relevant cell for verifying the claim regarding this specific match (March 10) can be identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object includes:\n- The answer to the claim (\"FALSE\" because there are no games listed with a score of \"0 - 0\").\n- The relevant cell indicating the score for the game against the Atlanta Thrashers.",
