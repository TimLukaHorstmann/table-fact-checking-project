    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"melbourne play at home on june 12 1965\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine specific columns in the table: \"home team,\" \"date,\" and ensure there's a match with both \"Melbourne\" as the home team and \"June 12, 1965\" as the date.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Rows**: We will look for any row where \"melbourne\" is listed in the \"home team\" column.\n2. **Check Date**: For those rows, we need to verify if the corresponding date matches \"12 june 1965\".\n3. **Combine Conditions**: The claim is true only if both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- Row 0: \n  - Home Team: hawthorn\n  - Date: 12 june 1965\n\n- Row 1:\n  - Home Team: south melbourne\n  - Date: 12 june 1965\n\n- Row 2:\n  - Home Team: essendon\n  - Date: 12 june 1965\n\n- Row 3:\n  - Home Team: melbourne\n  - Date: 14 june 1965\n\n- Row 4:\n  - Home Team: footscray\n  - Date: 14 june 1965\n\n- Row 5:\n  - Home Team: fitzroy\n  - Date: 14 june 1965\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that \"melbourne\" is the home team in row 3. However, the date for this match is \"14 june 1965,\" not \"12 june 1965.\"\n\nSince there are no rows where both conditions (Melbourne as the home team and June 12, 1965 as the date) are met simultaneously, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to check were in row 3 for both the \"home team\" and \"date\" columns. Here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
