    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"season 13 be direct by william malone,\" we need to determine if William Malone directed any episodes in season 13 of the series based on the provided table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that season 13 is directed by William Malone. This implies all or some episodes of season 13 should have \"William Malone\" listed under the \"director(s)\" column.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Rows**:\n   - We first identify which rows correspond to season 13. In the table, each row represents an episode with its corresponding series number and season number.\n   - Season 13 corresponds to episodes with `series` numbers from 35 to 42 (inclusive).\n\n3. **Checking Director(s) for Each Episode in Season 13**:\n   - For each episode in season 13, check the \"director(s)\" column to see if William Malone is listed.\n\n4. **Relevant Rows and Columns**:\n   - The relevant rows for checking are those with `series` numbers 35 through 42.\n   - We need to examine the \"season\" and \"director (s)\" columns for these rows.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 35**: Season 13, Episode 1 (\"Easy come, easy go\") directed by William Malone.\n   - **Row 36**: Season 13, Episode 2 (\"Prime cut\") directed by David Calloway.\n   - **Row 37**: Season 13, Episode 3 (\"Interior loft\") directed by Ken Wiederhorn.\n   - **Row 38**: Season 13, Episode 4 (\"Interior loft later\") directed by Ken Wiederhorn.\n   - **Row 39**: Season 13, Episode 5 (\"Funhouse\") directed by Gilbert Adler.\n   - **Row 40**: Season 13, Episode 6 (\"A family affair\") directed by Keith Samples.\n   - **Row 41**: Season 13, Episode 7 (\"Dust to dust\") directed by Jonathan Glassner.\n   - **Row 42**: Season 13, Episode 8 (\"Prisoner of love\") directed by Richard T. Schor.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - William Malone only directed one episode in season 13 (\"Easy come, easy go\"). Therefore, the claim that \"season 13 be direct by william malone\" is not fully supported since not all episodes are directed by him.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
