Determine if these episodes were part of the 1972 season.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Identification of Episodes Directed by Gunnar Hellstrom\nFrom the \"director\" column in the provided markdown table, we observe that:\n- **Row 7**: The episode titled \"lynott\" is directed by Gunner Hellstrom. \n\nRelevant Cell:\n- Row Index: 7\n- Column Name: \"director\"\n\n#### Verification of Season for Episodes Directed by Gunnar Hellstrom\nNext, check the \"season\" and \"airdate\" columns to confirm whether these episodes aired in 1972:\n\n- **Row 7**: The episode with title \"lynott\", directed by Gunner Hellstrom, has:\n  - Season: 8 (not 1972)\n  - Airdate: November 1, 1971\n\nSince the air date is November 1, 1971, it confirms that this episode was part of the 1971 season and not the 1972 season.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- Gunner Hellstrom directed only one episode titled \"lynott\", which aired in the 1971 season (Season 8).\n- The claim states that he directed all episodes for a specific season in 1972. Since there are no episodes directed by him in 1972, this condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
