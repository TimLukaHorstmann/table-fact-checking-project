The version of `vp8 (webm)` supported by Konqueror.\n2.

This indicates that `vp9 (webm)` is not supported by Konqueror at all.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analysis confirms both parts of the claim:\n- Konqueror supports only version 4.4 of `vp8 (webm)`.\n- It does not support `vp9 (webm)`.\n\nThus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"vp8 ( webm )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"vp9 ( webm )\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
