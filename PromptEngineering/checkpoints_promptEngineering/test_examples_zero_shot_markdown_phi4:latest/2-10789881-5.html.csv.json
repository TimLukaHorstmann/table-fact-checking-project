All games in the table occurred on \"30 may 1931\", so this condition is satisfied.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**:\n   - **Hawthorn vs Richmond**: According to the claim, these two teams played against each other.\n   - Checking the table, Hawthorn played against South Melbourne and Richmond played against Essendon on that date. Therefore, Hawthorn did not play against Richmond.\n\n3. **Venue Verification**: The claim states \"at princess park\".\n   - None of the games listed in the table were played at Princes Park (note the spelling difference). \n   - Carlton vs Collingwood was played at Princes Park.\n\n4. **Attendance Verification**: The claim mentions an attendance of 9000.\n   - The game with an attendance of 9000 was Geelong vs Fitzroy, which took place at Corio Oval.\n\nGiven these verifications:\n- Hawthorn did not play against Richmond.\n- The venue \"princess park\" does not match any game in the table.\n- The claimed attendance figure of 9000 is incorrect for a Hawthorn vs Richmond game as no such game occurred.\n\nBased on the above analysis, all conditions of the claim are false.
