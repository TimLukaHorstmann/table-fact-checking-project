We need to check if there is an entry in the table where the Detroit Pistons scored 75 points.\n\n2. **Assists by B Shaw**: The claim states that B Shaw had 5 assists. We need to find the row corresponding to the game with the score of 75 - 86 and check the \"high assists\" column for B Shaw's assists.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Score: l 75 - 86 (Detroit Pistons lost, scored 75)\n  - High Assists: b shaw (5)\n\nThe conditions in the claim match exactly with Row 1 of the table. The final score is indeed 75 - 86, and B Shaw had 5 assists.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
