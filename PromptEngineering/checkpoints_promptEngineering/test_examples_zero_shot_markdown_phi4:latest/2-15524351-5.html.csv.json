Specifically, we're interested in identifying which games were wins ('w') and which were losses ('l'). \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Wins:**\n   - A win is indicated by \"w\" followed by the score.\n   - We need to count how many entries in the 'result' column have a win.\n\n2. **Identify Losses:**\n   - A loss is indicated by \"l\" followed by the score.\n   - We need to count how many entries in the 'result' column have a loss.\n\n3. **Check Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states there are 2 wins and 9 losses.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each row:\n\n- Row 0: Result is \"w 26 - 20\" (Win)\n- Row 1: Result is \"l 10 - 56\" (Loss)\n- Row 2: Result is \"l 6 - 45\" (Loss)\n- Row 3: Result is \"l 0 - 23\" (Loss)\n- Row 4: Result is \"l 13 - 42\" (Loss)\n- Row 5: Result is \"l 0 - 21\" (Loss)\n- Row 6: Result is \"l 0 - 31\" (Loss)\n- Row 7: Result is \"l 3 - 35\" (Loss)\n- Row 8: Result is \"w 9 - 7\" (Win)\n- Row 9: Result is \"l 12 - 15\" (Loss)\n- Row 10: Result is \"l 9 - 44\" (Loss)\n\nCounting the results:\n- Wins: Rows 0 and 8, total = 2\n- Losses: Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, total = 9\n\nThe count matches the claim of 2 wins and 9 losses.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the specific conditions mentioned in it regarding the team referred to as \"the deacon.\" The conditions are:\n\n1. The deacon was shutout 3 times.\n2. In each of these shutouts, they were never defeated by more than 10 points.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Shutouts**: A shutout occurs when the result's score for \"the deacon\" is 0. We need to find all such instances in the table.\n\n2. **Count Shutouts**: Verify if there are exactly three shutouts.\n\n3. **Check Score Differences**: For each shutout, ensure that the point difference (opponent's score - deacon's score) is not more than 10 points.\n\n**Analyzing the Table:**\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Result: \"l 0 - 23\" (Shutout)\n  - Point Difference: 23 - 0 = 23\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - Result: \"l 0 - 21\" (Shutout)\n  - Point Difference: 21 - 0 = 21\n\n- **Row 7**: \n  - Result: \"l 0 - 31\" (Shutout)\n  - Point Difference: 31 - 0 = 31\n\nFrom the analysis, we have identified three shutouts occurring in rows 4, 6, and 7. However, the point differences are 23, 21, and 31 respectively, which are all greater than 10 points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that \"the deacon\" was never shutout by more than 10 points, but we found instances where they were shutout by 23, 21, and 31 points. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- Row 4, Column \"result\"\n- Row 6, Column \"result\"\n- Row 7, Column \"result\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"the highest number of points anyone scored was below 50,\" we need to focus on the `result` column in the table because it contains the scores for both the team and its opponents.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The `result` column provides information about the game outcomes with two numbers: one representing the points scored by Wake Forest (the home team) and the other representing the points scored by the opponent.\n\n2. **Extract Points Scored**: We need to identify the highest score among all the games listed, which means examining both sets of scores in each result entry.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Game Result**:\n   - 09/09/1972: Wake Forest 26 - Davidson 20\n     - Highest score: 26\n   - 09/16/1972: Wake Forest 10 - SMU 56\n     - Highest score: 56\n   - 09/23/1972: Wake Forest 6 - Tennessee 45\n     - Highest score: 45\n   - 10/07/1972: Wake Forest 0 - Maryland 23\n     - Highest score: 23\n   - 10/14/1972: Wake Forest 13 - North Carolina State 42\n     - Highest score: 42\n   - 10/21/1972: Wake Forest 0 - North Carolina 21\n     - Highest score: 21\n   - 10/28/1972: Wake Forest 0 - Clemson 31\n     - Highest score: 31\n   - 11/04/1972: Wake Forest 3 - South Carolina 35\n     - Highest score: 35\n   - 11/11/1972: Wake Forest 9 - Duke 7\n     - Highest score: 9\n   - 11/18/1972: Wake Forest 12 - Virginia 15\n     - Highest score: 15\n   - 11/25/1972: Wake Forest 9 - Virginia Tech 44\n     - Highest score: 44\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Score**: The highest score found in any game is 56, which occurred when SMU played against Wake Forest.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Since the claim states that \"the highest number of points anyone scored was below 50,\" but we have identified a score of 56, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells for this analysis are in the `result` column across all rows since each row contains scores from the respective games.\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
