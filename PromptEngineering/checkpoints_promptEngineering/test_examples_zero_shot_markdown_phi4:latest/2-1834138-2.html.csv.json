    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the population when the area is 4575, we need to examine the table for an entry where the \"area\" value matches 4575 and check the corresponding \"population\" value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We are interested in the columns \"area\" and \"population\".\n\n2. **Locate Rows with Area = 4575:**\n   - Scan through the table to find any row where the \"area\" column has a value of 4575.\n\n3. **Verify Population for Identified Row(s):**\n   - Once we locate the relevant row, check if the \"population\" value matches the claim (176239).\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- In the third column from left (\"area\"), scan each row:\n  - First row: Area = 27\n  - Second row: Area = 9\n  - Third row: Area = 11\n  - Fourth row: Area = 30\n  - Fifth row: Area = 27\n  - **Sixth row:** Area = 4575 (matches the condition)\n    - Check corresponding population: Population = 175239\n  - Seventh row: Area = 6761\n  - Eighth row: Area = 3344\n\n### Comparison with Claim:\n\n- The claim states that when the area is 4575, the population should be 176239.\n- From our examination, we found that for an area of 4575, the actual population is 175239.\n\nSince the actual population (175239) does not match the claimed population (176239), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant row index where area = 4575 is row 6.\n- The relevant columns are \"area\" and \"population\".\n\nThus, our JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"population\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
