    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"3.0 be the highest number of goal score in the play-offs that have scored 2 in the FA Cup,\" we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. Identify players who have scored exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup.\n2. Among these players, determine if any have scored more than 3 goals in the Play-Offs.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n### Step 1: Find Players with 2 Goals in the FA Cup\n\n- **Gregg Blundell**: 0 (Play-offs), 0 (FA Cup), 2 (FA Trophy)\n- **Mark Stein**: 3 (Play-offs), 0 (FA Cup), 2 (FA Trophy)\n- **Christian Moore**: 0 (Play-offs), 2 (FA Cup), 0 (FA Trophy)\n- **Kayode Odejayi**: 0 (Play-offs), 1 (FA Cup), 2 (FA Trophy)\n- **Lee Elam**: 0 (Play-offs), 1 (FA Cup), 1 (FA Trophy)\n\nFrom this, only **Christian Moore** has scored exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup.\n\n### Step 2: Check Goals in Play-Offs for Players with 2 Goals in FA Cup\n\n- **Christian Moore**: 0 goals in Play-offs\n\nNo player who scored 2 goals in the FA Cup has scored more than 3 goals in the Play-Offs. The highest number of goals in the Play-Offs by such players is 0.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because no player with exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup has scored more than 3 goals in the Play-Offs.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify this, we focus on the \"FA Cup\" and \"Play-offs\" columns for the relevant rows:\n\n- **Christian Moore** (Row Index: 8)\n  - Column \"FA Cup\": 2\n  - Column \"Play-offs\": 0\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
