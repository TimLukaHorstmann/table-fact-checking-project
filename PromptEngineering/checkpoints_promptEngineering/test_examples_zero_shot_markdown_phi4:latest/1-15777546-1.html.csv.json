Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify relevant data**: We're interested in episodes with `no in series` or `tv broadcast` equal to 10.\n\n2. **Locate episode number 10**:\n   - In the table, we find that the row where `tv broadcast` is `s02e10` corresponds to episode number 10.\n   - This is found in the row with a `no in series` of 36 and a `no in season` of 10.\n\n3. **Check title for episode number 10**:\n   - The title for this row is \"reflections\".\n\n4. **Compare claim against actual data**:\n   - The claim states that episode number 10 is titled \"reflection\".\n   - However, the actual title according to the table is \"reflections\" (note the plural form).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there's a discrepancy in the exact wording (\"reflection\" vs. \"reflections\"), the claim is not fully accurate.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
