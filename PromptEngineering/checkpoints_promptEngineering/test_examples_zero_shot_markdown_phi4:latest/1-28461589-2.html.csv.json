    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim: \"1276.0 be the largest number of pass for player start 34 or less game\", we need to verify a few conditions against the provided table:\n\n1. Identify players who have started **34 games or fewer**.\n2. Among those players, find the one with the highest number of **passes**.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step based on the data in the markdown table:\n\n### Step 1: Filter Players by \"Games Played\" and \"Starting\"\nWe need to consider only those rows where the player has started 34 games or fewer. From the table, we can identify these players:\n\n- **zurutuza**: Started 30 games (37 played)\n- **aranburu**: Started 27 games (32 played)\n- **tamudo**: Started 20 games (31 played)\n- **ansotegi**: Started 32 games (32 played)\n- **rivas**: Started 31 games (32 played)\n- **mikel**: Started 30 games (32 played)\n- **sarpong**: Started 1 game (16 played)\n- **estrada**: Started 18 games (19 played)\n- **labaka**: Started 9 games (14 played)\n- **sutil**: Started 4 games (17 played)\n- **demidov**: Started 12 games (13 played)\n- **agirretxe**: Started 1 game (11 played)\n- **ifra\u00f1**: Started 3 games (10 played)\n- **viguera**: Started 0 games (5 played)\n\n### Step 2: Find the Player with Maximum Passes\nNext, we look at the \"Pass\" column for these filtered players and find the maximum value:\n\n- **zurutuza**: 1017.0 passes\n- **aranburu**: 681.0 passes\n- **tamudo**: 432.0 passes\n- **ansotegi**: 367.0 passes\n- **rivas**: 308.0 passes\n- **mikel**: 263.0 passes\n- **sarpong**: 166.0 passes\n- **estrada**: 834.0 passes\n- **labaka**: 258.0 passes\n- **sutil**: 223.0 passes\n- **demidov**: 395.0 passes\n- **agirretxe**: 53.0 passes\n- **ifra\u00f1**: 59.0 passes\n- **viguera**: 29.0 passes\n\nThe highest number of passes for players who started 34 games or fewer is **834.0** (by estrada).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Claim\nThe claim states that \"1276.0 be the largest number of pass for player start 34 or less game\". The maximum number of passes found among relevant players is 834.0, not 1276.0.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells to Support the Conclusion\n\nTo substantiate this conclusion, the following cells are relevant:\n\n- **zurutuza**: \"Pass\" (1017.0), \"Start\" (30)\n- **aranburu**: \"Pass\" (681.0), \"Start\" (27)\n- **tamudo**: \"Pass\" (432.0), \"Start\" (20)\n- **ansotegi**: \"Pass\" (367.0), \"Start\" (32)\n- **rivas**: \"Pass\" (308.0), \"Start\" (31)\n- **mikel**: \"Pass\" (263.0), \"Start\" (30)\n- **sarpong**: \"Pass\" (166.0), \"Start\" (1)\n- **estrada**: \"Pass\" (834.0), \"Start\" (18)\n- **labaka**: \"Pass\" (258.0), \"Start\" (9)\n- **sutil**: \"Pass\" (223.0), \"Start\" (4)\n- **demidov**: \"Pass\" (395.0), \"Start\" (12)\n- **agirretxe**: \"Pass\" (53.0), \"Start\" (1)\n- **ifra\u00f1**: \"Pass\" (59.0), \"Start\" (3)\n- **viguera**: \"Pass\" (29.0), \"Start\" (0)\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Pass\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
