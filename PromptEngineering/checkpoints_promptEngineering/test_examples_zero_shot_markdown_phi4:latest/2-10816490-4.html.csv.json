    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding average crowd attendance in June at the Eternal Derby (France), we need to analyze the table provided and evaluate whether it contains relevant information for this specific context.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim mentions \"the average crowd attendance in June at the eternal derby (france)\". This implies:\n   - We should look for games played specifically in June.\n   - These games should be associated with the \"Eternal Derby\" taking place in France.\n   \n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - The table contains records of various matches over several years, listing details such as date, competition, ground, score, attendance, and report source.\n   - We need to check for entries where the date falls within June.\n\n3. **Checking Dates**:\n   - Inspecting the \"date\" column in the table, we observe all dates fall between September 2000 and May 2010. There are no records for any matches held in June during these years.\n   \n4. **Identifying Relevant Competition**:\n   - Even if there were entries from June, we would need to determine whether they corresponded to \"the eternal derby\" in France. The table includes various competitions such as 1. hnl, cup, supercup but does not specify any matches related to the Eternal Derby or mention France.\n   \n5. **Conclusions**:\n   - Since there are no entries for June and none of the competitions are identified as the Eternal Derby (France), we lack data necessary to verify the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is evident that the table does not provide any relevant data to support or refute the claim about average crowd attendance in June at the Eternal Derby (France).\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about attendance at the eternal derby in Germany exceeding 42,000 is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The term \"eternal derby\" typically refers to a significant local rivalry match, often involving major football clubs.\n   - In this context, it seems to refer to matches between teams that play at \"poljud\" and \"maksimir,\" which are likely locations of stadiums in Rijeka, Croatia (not Germany).\n   - The claim specifically mentions Germany, but the table is about events in Croatia. This geographical discrepancy suggests a potential misunderstanding or misapplication of the term \"eternal derby.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - We need to look at matches played at both \"poljud\" and \"maksimir,\" as these are the grounds mentioned.\n   - The column \"attendance\" will provide the number of spectators for each match.\n\n3. **Checking Attendance Figures**:\n   - For \"poljud\":\n     - 14/04/2001: 32,000\n     - 07/04/2002: 20,000\n     - 01/09/2002: 35,000\n     - 06/12/2003: 15,000\n     - 03/04/2004: 25,000\n     - 05/12/2004: 25,000\n     - 07/10/2007: 18,000\n     - 22/02/2009: 38,000\n     - 31/10/2009: 4,000\n   - For \"maksimir\":\n     - 19/05/2007: 35,000\n     - 08/03/2008: 13,500\n     - 21/09/2008: 8,000\n     - 01/05/2010: 13,000\n\n4. **Determining the Highest Attendance**:\n   - The highest attendance at \"poljud\" is 38,000.\n   - The highest attendance at \"maksimir\" is 35,000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the matches listed in the table have an attendance exceeding 42,000.\n   - Additionally, the claim incorrectly references Germany instead of Croatia.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
