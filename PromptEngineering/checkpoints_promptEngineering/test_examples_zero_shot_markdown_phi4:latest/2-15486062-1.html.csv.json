How many times did the team play against Washington Redskins (referred to as \"redskins\" in the table)?\n2. Out of those games, how many were won?\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- The \"opponent\" column shows all the teams that played against the main team during each week.\n- The \"result\" column indicates whether a game was won (\"w\") or lost (\"l\"), along with the scores.\n\nFirstly, identify any games involving Washington Redskins:\n1. **Week 5**: The opponent is \"Washington redskins\", and the result is \"w 9 - 7\". This indicates a win.\n2. **Week 12**: Again, the opponent is \"Washington redskins\", and the result is \"w 20 - 14\". Another win.\n\nNow let's identify any games involving the Dallas Cowboys (referred to as \"cowboy\" in the claim):\n- The table does not show any game against the Dallas Cowboys. There are no entries where the opponent column has \"Dallas cowboys\" or any similar name indicating a matchup with them.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n1.
