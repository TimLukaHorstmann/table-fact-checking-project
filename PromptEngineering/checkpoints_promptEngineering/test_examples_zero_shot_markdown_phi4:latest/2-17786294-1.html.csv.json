Check if FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais have indeed tied on aggregate with a score of 4 - 4.\n2. Determine whether this tie would require a decision by the away goal rule.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant row for FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais in the table:\n- **Aggregate Score**: The total score across both rounds is given as \"4 - 4\", matching part of the claim that they tied on aggregate.\n  \n- **1st Round Score**: FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais: 0 - 0\n\n- **2nd Round Score**: FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais: 4 - 4\n\nSince the aggregate score is a tie of 4 - 4, we need to check if it would require the away goal rule:\n- In football (soccer), the away goals rule states that if the aggregate score over two legs is tied, the team with more away goals wins.\n  \n- From the table: \n  - **1st Round**: Away goals for Olympique Lyonnais = 0\n  - **2nd Round**: Away goals for FC Nantes = 4\n\nThus, FC Nantes scored 4 away goals and Olympique Lyonnais scored none. The aggregate score is tied at 4 - 4, but FC Nantes has more away goals (4) compared to Olympique Lyonnais (0).\n\nThe claim is true because the match would be decided by the away goal rule in favor of FC Nantes.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells:\n- The row index for FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais is 4.\n- Relevant column names are \"score\" for aggregate score, \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" to verify individual leg scores and determine away goals.\n\nHere's the JSON object with this information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

There is no record of a match between FC Nantes and RC Strasbourg.\n\nSince neither condition can be verified as true based on the provided data, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- For **Condition 1**, we would look at:\n  - The row for RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg to confirm it doesn't involve Olympique Lyonnais.\n    - Row index: 0, Column names: \"team 2\" and \"2nd round\"\n\n- For **Condition 2**, we would look at:\n  - The row for FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais to confirm it doesn't involve RC Strasbourg.\n    - Row index: 4, Column names: \"team 2\" and \"1st round\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \n- \"In the first leg, only 2 goals were scored by an away team.\"\n- Specifically, it mentions: \"FC Mulhouse scored 1 against Girondins de Bordeaux.\"\n\n### Table Examination:\nWe need to look at the column labeled \"1st round\" in the table to verify this claim.\n\n#### Relevant Data from \"1st Round\":\n1. RC Strasbourg (away) vs RC Lens: **RC Strasbourg 0 - RC Lens 1**\n2. Stade Lavallois (home) vs FC Rouen: **Stade Lavallois 1 - FC Rouen 0**\n3. AS Nancy (away) vs AS Monaco: **AS Nancy 0 - AS Monaco 2**\n4. **FC Mulhouse (away) vs Girondins de Bordeaux: FC Mulhouse 1 - Girondins de Bordeaux 0** (This matches the claim.)\n5. Olympique Lyonnais (away) vs FC Nantes: **Olympique Lyonnais 0 - FC Nantes 0**\n6. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (home) vs AS Cannes: **FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard 0 - AS Cannes 3**\n7. En Avant Guingamp (away) vs Sporting Toulon Var: **En Avant Guingamp 0 - Sporting Toulon Var 2**\n8. Besan\u00e7on RC (away) vs FC Metz: **Besan\u00e7on RC 0 - FC Metz 4**\n\n### Analysis:\n- Identify goals scored by away teams in the \"1st round\":\n  - FC Mulhouse scored 1 goal against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n  - No other away team scored a goal.\n\nThus, only one away team (FC Mulhouse) scored 2 goals or more is not true; only FC Mulhouse scored 1 goal. The claim says \"only 2 goals were scored by an away team\" in total, which means there should be two instances of away teams scoring 1 goal each or one instance of a team scoring 2 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement \"only 2 goals were scored by an away team\" is true because FC Mulhouse was the only away team to score (1 goal), and no other away team scored in the first leg. The claim about the specific match (FC Mulhouse vs Girondins de Bordeaux) scoring 1 goal is correct.\n\nThus, the overall claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for this verification are from the \"1st round\" column for all rows, as we need to check every first-leg game:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two parts of it:\n\n1. **Highest Scoring Leg**: A leg refers to a single match within a two-legged tie (first and second rounds). We will identify which individual game had the highest number of goals scored.\n\n2. **Highest Aggregate Score for a Match**: An aggregate score is the total number of goals scored by both teams over the two legs combined. We need to find out if any match has an aggregate goal tally of 8, as claimed with \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n\nLet's analyze each part:\n\n### Highest Scoring Leg\n\nWe will check the scores for each leg (1st and 2nd rounds) in the table:\n- **First Round**:\n  - Lens vs Strasbourg: 1 - 0\n  - Rouen vs Lavallois: 1 - 0\n  - Monaco vs Nancy: 2 - 0\n  - Bordeaux vs Mulhouse: 0 - 1\n  - Nantes vs Lyon: 0 - 0\n  - Cannes vs Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: 3 - 0 (highest so far)\n  - Toulon Var vs Guingamp: 2 - 0\n  - Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC: 4 - 0 (new highest)\n\n- **Second Round**:\n  - Strasbourg vs Lens: 0 - 0\n  - Lavallois vs Rouen: 3 - 1\n  - Nancy vs Monaco: 1 - 4\n  - Mulhouse vs Bordeaux: 2 - 2\n  - Lyon vs Nantes: 4 - 4 (tied with highest)\n  - Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard vs Cannes: 1 - 1\n  - Guingamp vs Toulon Var: 1 - 0\n  - Besan\u00e7on RC vs Metz: 1 - 1\n\nThe highest scoring leg is Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC with a score of 4 - 0 in the first round.\n\n### Highest Aggregate Score for a Match\n\nWe calculate aggregate scores for each match:\n- Lens vs Strasbourg: 1 + 0 = 1\n- Rouen vs Lavallois: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Monaco vs Nancy: 2 + 4 = 6\n- Bordeaux vs Mulhouse: 0 + 2 = 2 (plus 2 penalties, still 2 goals counted)\n- Nantes vs Lyon: 0 + 4 = 4\n- Cannes vs Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: 3 + 1 = 4\n- Toulon Var vs Guingamp: 2 + 1 = 3\n- Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC: 4 + 1 = 5\n\nNone of these matches has an aggregate score of 8. The match claimed, \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc,\" is not present in the table.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because:\n- The highest scoring leg (Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC) had 4 goals.\n- No match reached an aggregate score of 8; also, there's no match between \"fc nantes\" and \"besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n\nLet's specify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
