However, it notes a win via TKO.\n- **Row 8**: The opponent is Megumi Fujii, not Keiko Tamia. This is a loss by submission.\n- **Row 14**: The opponent is Hitomi Akano, not Keiko Tamia.

This is a decision loss.\n- **Row 4 to Row 23**: None of these rows have the opponent as Keiko Tamia.\n\nNow, let's identify if there are any instances where Keiko Tamia is mentioned as an opponent and check the method:\n\n- **Row 16**: Opponent is Yuiga Yuiga.
