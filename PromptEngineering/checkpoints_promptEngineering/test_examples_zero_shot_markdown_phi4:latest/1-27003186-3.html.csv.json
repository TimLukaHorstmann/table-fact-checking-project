The percentage of registered voters who have no party preference in San Jacinto.\n\nAccording to the table provided:\n\n- The row corresponding to San Jacinto is located at index 19 (since indexing starts from 0).\n- In this row, under the column \"other,\" we find a value of 9.3%.\n- Similarly, under the column \"no party preference,\" the value is 19.1%.\n\nThe claim states that 9.3% of registered voters in San Jacinto have a party affiliation of \"other\" and 19.1% have no party preference. Both these values match exactly with those found in the table.\n\nTherefore, both conditions specified in the claim are verified to be true based on the data from the table.\n\nNow, we'll provide the JSON response indicating that the answer is TRUE and listing the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"other\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"no party preference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, this interpretation is incorrect based on how percentages are represented in the table.\n\nIn the table:\n- The \"other\" column directly gives the percentage of registered voters who prefer other parties without needing to calculate a portion of the registered voter percentage.\n- Thus, 7.6% is already the percentage of registered voters in Palm Desert that prefer \"other\".\n\nTherefore, the claim as stated (\"7.6% of the 50.7%...\") is incorrect because it misinterprets the table data.\n\n**Conclusion**: The correct interpretation directly from the table shows that 7.6% of the total population of registered voters in Palm Desert are categorized under \"other\", not a percentage of 50.7%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"palm desert\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Registered Voters (%)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"other\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, there's no row in the table where the percentage of registered voters is exactly 50.1%; we must consider whether any city has a value close enough or if it was meant as an approximate figure.\n\nLet's go through the relevant columns in the table:\n\n- **Registered Voters (%)**: This column shows the percentage of the population that is registered to vote.\n- **Other (%)**: This column provides the percentage of registered voters who identify as \"other.\"\n\nWe need to check each row for:\n- A registration rate close or exactly 50.1% (since exact match does not exist, we'll look for 50.7% which is closest in this context).\n- An \"Other\" percentage of 7.6%.\n\nChecking the table:\n\n- **Palm Desert** has a registered voter percentage of 50.7% and an \"other\" percentage of 7.6%, which matches both conditions closely.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, the claim is indeed supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Registered Voters (%)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Other (%)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

A \"strong\" democratic party preference would imply that this percentage is significantly high compared to other cities listed or indicates a majority.\n\nLet's examine the information for Murrieta:\n- Population: 99,476\n- Registered Voters: 48.8%\n- Democratic: 25.3%\n\nThe key data point here is that 25.3% of registered voters in Murrieta are affiliated with the Democratic Party.\n\nWe can evaluate whether this percentage indicates a \"strong\" preference by comparing it to other cities:\n- The highest democratic party percentage in the table is Coachella at 72.1%.\n- Cities like Cathedral City (46.9%), Indio (47.9%), and Palm Springs (50.9%) have significantly higher percentages than Murrieta's 25.3%.\n\nSince Murrieta\u2019s Democratic affiliation of 25.3% does not stand out as particularly strong, especially when compared to the other cities listed with much higher percentages, we can conclude that the claim \"Murrieta have a strong democratic party preference\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cell for this analysis is:\n- Row index corresponding to Murrieta: 18 (since rows are zero-indexed)\n- Column name: \"democratic\"\n\nBased on this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"democratic\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
