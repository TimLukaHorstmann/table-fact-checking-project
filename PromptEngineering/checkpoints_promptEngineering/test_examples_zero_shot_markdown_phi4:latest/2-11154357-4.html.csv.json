We need to identify relevant cells to support this conclusion:\n\n- Italy's silver medals: Row index 0, Column \"silver\"\n- West Germany's silver medals: Row index 1, Column \"silver\"\n- Austria's silver medals: Row index 2, Column \"silver\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the evaluation and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
