    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding Denis Menchov's UCI points and team affiliation, we need to examine specific entries in the provided table:\n\n1. **Cyclist Name**: The claim mentions \"Denis Menchov\". We will locate this name in the \"cyclist\" column.\n2. **Team**: The claim states he is on the \"rabobank\" team. This information should be verified in the \"team\" column corresponding to Denis Menchov's row.\n3. **UCI Points**: The claim asserts that he scored \"40 UCI points\". We will check this against the \"uci points\" column for his entry.\n\nNow, let's go through these steps using the table:\n\n- Locate the row where the cyclist is \"Denis Menchov\":\n  - This is found in the second row of the table.\n  \n- Check Denis Menchov's team:\n  - In the same row (second row), under the \"team\" column, it lists \"rabobank\". This matches the claim.\n\n- Verify his UCI points:\n  - Still within the same row, in the \"uci points\" column, the value is \"40\". This confirms the claim's assertion about his UCI points.\n\nSince all components of the claim are validated by examining the relevant cells in the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- Row index 1 (second row), \"cyclist\" column: Contains \"Denis Menchov\".\n- Row index 1, \"team\" column: Contains \"rabobank\".\n- Row index 1, \"uci points\" column: Contains \"40\".\n\nTherefore, the JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cyclist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"uci points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
