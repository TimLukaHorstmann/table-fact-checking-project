    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the raptor win only 1 time for the first 13 days of March,\" we need to identify which games were played within this date range and determine their outcomes (win or loss).\n\n### Relevant Time Period:\n- The claim specifies the first 13 days of March. Therefore, we should consider games from March 1st through March 13th.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Games Played Between March 1st and March 13th:**\n   - Look for rows with dates ranging from March 1 to March 13.\n   \n2. **Check the Outcomes of These Games:**\n   - Determine whether each game was a win (indicated by \"w\") or a loss (indicated by \"l\").\n\n### Analysis:\n- **March 1** (Row 61): Date is \"march 1\", Outcome is \"l\" (loss).\n- **March 3** (Row 62): Date is \"march 3\", Outcome is \"l\" (loss).\n- **March 6** (Row 63): Date is \"march 6\", Outcome is \"l\" (loss).\n- **March 8** (Row 64): Date is \"march 8\", Outcome is \"l\" (loss).\n- **March 11** (Row 65): Date is \"march 11\", Outcome is \"l\" (loss).\n- **March 13** (Row 66): Date is \"march 13\", Outcome is \"l\" (loss).\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll games played from March 1 to March 13 resulted in losses.

Identify the highest number of high assists by any player in March:\n   - The maximum value for `high assists` is 19, achieved by Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n in game 73.\n\n2. Determine who has the second-highest number of high assists:\n   - After removing Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n's record of 19 assists (game 73), we look for the next highest value.\n   - The next highest value is 16, which also belongs to Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n from game 62.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nJos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n has both the highest and the second-highest number of high assists in March.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"The Raptors record remained above .500 for the month of March,\" we need to determine if their win-loss record was better than 50% during this period.\n\nIn basketball statistics, a team's record is expressed as \"W - L\" (Wins - Losses). A record above .500 means that the number of wins exceeds the number of losses. For example, a record of 10-9 (.529) is above .500 because there are more wins than losses.\n\nWe need to examine the \"record\" column for each game in March and determine if at any point their win-loss ratio was below .500 (i.e., more losses than wins).\n\nHere's how we analyze it:\n\n1. **March 1**: Record is 23-38, which is a loss.\n2. **March 3**: Record becomes 23-39 after another loss.\n3. **March 6**: Record is now 23-40, still below .500.\n4. **March 8**: Record updates to 23-41, continuing the losing streak.\n5. **March 11**: The record changes to 23-42.\n6. **March 13**: It becomes 23-43.\n7. **March 15**: They win, making it 24-43, still below .500 (since they have more losses).\n8. **March 16**: Record updates to 24-44 after a loss.\n9. **March 20**: Another loss brings the record to 24-45.\n10. **March 22**: The team wins, changing the record to 25-45.\n11. **March 25**: They win again, updating the record to 26-45.\n12. **March 27**: Another win changes the record to 27-45.\n13. **March 29**: Winning this game updates the record to 28-45.\n\nAfter March 15, their record was 24-43; by March 22 it improved to 25-45. By March 29, they reached 28-45. Throughout March, even after achieving more wins than losses (28 vs. 45), the Raptors' win-loss percentage never exceeded .500. \n\nTo calculate the exact point at which a record exceeds .500:\n\n- A record of 24-43: Wins are less than half the total games played (24 out of 67).\n- A record of 25-45: Again, wins are less than half of the total games (25 out of 70).\n- A record of 26-45: Still not above .500 (26 out of 71).\n- A record of 27-45: Same condition persists (27 out of 72).\n- A record of 28-45: Finally, they have more wins than losses but still do not surpass the 50% threshold until they reach at least a 29-45 record.\n\nIn conclusion, throughout March, their win-loss percentage never surpassed .500. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are those pertaining to the \"record\" column in each row of the table for the month of March:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
