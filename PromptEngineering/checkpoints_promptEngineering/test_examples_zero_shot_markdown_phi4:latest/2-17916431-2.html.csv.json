    "resp": "To verify the claim \"March be feature more often as a month in the date than any other month,\" we need to count how many times each month appears in the \"date\" column of the table. We will then compare these counts to determine if March is indeed the most frequent month.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data**: Focus on the \"date\" column as it contains the months we need to analyze.\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Count how many times each month appears in this column.\n3. **Compare Counts**: Determine if March has more occurrences than any other month.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Extract Relevant Data\n\nWe will extract the month from each date entry:\n\n- August: 9 entries (games 1 to 4)\n- September: 5 entries (games 5 to 9)\n- October: 6 entries (games 10 to 15)\n- November: 5 entries (games 16 to 19)\n- December: 4 entries (games 20 to 23)\n- January: 4 entries (games 24 to 27)\n- February: 5 entries (games 28 to 32)\n- March: 9 entries (games 33 to 39)\n\n### Step 2: Count Occurrences\n\nCount the number of times each month appears:\n\n- August: 4\n- September: 5\n- October: 6\n- November: 5\n- December: 4\n- January: 4\n- February: 5\n- March: 9\n\n### Step 3: Compare Counts\n\nMarch has 9 occurrences, which is more than any other month.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince March appears more frequently than any other month in the \"date\" column, the claim is true.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

They earned 0 points.\n   - In the game on 3 March 2009, Bradford City won 5-0. They earned 3 points.\n\n3. **Determine Highest Points Scored by Bradford City:**\n   - We need to check all games to find the highest point total scored by Bradford City in any single match:\n     - Game 1: 2 goals (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 2: 2 goals (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 3: 2 goals (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 4: 2 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 5: 2 goals (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 6: 4 goals (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 7: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 8: 0 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 9: 1 goal (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 10: 2 goals (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 11: 2 goals (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 12: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 13: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 14: 0 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 15: 5 goals (Win, 3 points) - Against Aldershot Town\n     - Game 16: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 17: 0 goals (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 18: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 19: 0 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 20: 1 goal (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 21: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 22: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 23: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 24: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 25: 1 goal (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 26: 1 goal (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 27: 0 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 28: 5 goals (Win, 3 points) - Highest total goals in a single game\n     - Game 29: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 30: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 31: 0 goals (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 32: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 33: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 34: 1 goal (Win, 3 points)\n     - Game 35: 5 goals (Win, 3 points) - Against Aldershot Town\n     - Game 36: 0 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 37: 0 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 38: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 39: 0 goals (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 40: 0 goals (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 41: 1 goal (Draw, 1 point)\n     - Game 42: 1 goal (Loss, 0 points)\n     - Game 43: 1 goal (Draw, 1 point)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The highest total goals scored by Bradford City in a single game is 5, which occurred twice: against Port Vale on 3 March 2009 and against Aldershot Town on 3 March 2009.\n   - Since they achieved the same goal total in both games, the claim that \"Aldershot Town be the opponent when Bradford City score their highest point total\" is true because one of those instances was indeed against Aldershot Town.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 35 (Game 15): Columns `opponent` and `result`.\n- Row 28 (Game 29): Columns `opponent` and `result`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

From the markdown table, this corresponds to `row_index = 36`.\n   - Check the value of the `opponent` column for that row: it shows \"alderhot town\".\n\n2. **Checking the Result on 10 March 2009**:\n   - The result column for `row_index = 36` indicates \"0 - 3\", meaning Bradford City scored 0 goals.\n\n3. **Checking Highest Point Total**:\n   - We need to review all results where Bradford City was the home team (as they score points at home).\n   - Calculate the points Bradford City earned in each game: \n     - A win gives 3 points.\n     - A draw gives 1 point.\n     - A loss gives 0 points.\n   - Here is a summary of their scores and corresponding results:\n     - Game 1: Scored 2, Result \"2 - 1\" (Win: 3 points)\n     - Game 3: Scored 2, Result \"2 - 0\" (Win: 3 points)\n     - Game 7: Scored 2, Result \"2 - 0\" (Win: 3 points)\n     - Game 14: Scored 1, Result \"1 - 0\" (Win: 3 points)\n     - Game 23: Scored 1, Result \"1 - 4\" (Loss: 0 points)\n     - Game 27: Scored 5, Result \"5 - 0\" (Win: 3 points)\n     - Game 30: Scored 1, Result \"1 - 0\" (Win: 3 points)\n     - Game 33: Scored 1, Result \"1 - 3\" (Loss: 0 points)\n     - Game 34: Scored 1, Result \"1 - 0\" (Win: 3 points)\n     - Game 39: Scored 0, Result \"0 - 1\" (Loss: 0 points)\n     - Game 41: Scored 1, Result \"1 - 1\" (Draw: 1 point)\n\n   From this analysis, the highest goals scored by Bradford City in a single game was 5 on March 7, corresponding to 3 points.

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"bradford city go against port vale 2 time accord to the chart , on 13 september 2008 and 28 march 2009,\" we need to examine the table for games played by Bradford City against Port Vale, specifically focusing on the dates mentioned: 13 September 2008 and 28 March 2009.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Opponent \"Port Vale\":**\n   - We need to find rows where the opponent is \"port vale\" (case-insensitive) since markdown tables are often case-sensitive in rendering, but we'll consider the actual entries.\n   \n2. **Check Dates:**\n   - For each row identified as having Port Vale as the opponent, check if the date matches either 13 September 2008 or 28 March 2009.\n\n3. **Verify Game Information:**\n   - Ensure that the venue and result match for these dates to confirm they are indeed games involving Bradford City against Port Vale.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n- **Row 5:** Date is \"6 september 2008,\" Opponent is \"port vale,\" Venue is \"away.\"\n- **Row 39:** Date is \"28 march 2009,\" Opponent is \"port vale,\" Venue is \"home.\"\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- There is only one game against Port Vale on 13 September 2008. The opponent on that date (Row 6) is Exeter City.\n- There is a game against Port Vale on 28 March 2009 (Row 39).\n\nThe claim states there are two games against Port Vale on the specified dates, but we found only one such game.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is false because Bradford City did not play against Port Vale on both specified dates. The relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- Row 5 (Game against Port Vale on 6 September 2008)\n- Row 6 (Game against Exeter City on 13 September 2008)\n- Row 39 (Game against Port Vale on 28 March 2009)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
