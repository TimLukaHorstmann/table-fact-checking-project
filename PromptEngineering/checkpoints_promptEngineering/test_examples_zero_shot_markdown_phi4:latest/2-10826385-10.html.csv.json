This score is above 15.00.\n\n   - **Richmond:**\n     - Look for rows where Richmond is listed as either a home or away team.\n     - Row 2 shows Richmond as the home team with a score of 15.14 (104). This score is above 15.00.\n\n   - **Collingwood:**\n     - Look for rows where Collingwood is listed as either a home or away team.\n     - Row 3 shows Collingwood as the away team with a score of 19.14 (128). This score is above 15.00.\n\n   - **Fitzroy:**\n     - Look for rows where Fitzroy is listed as either a home or away team.\n     - Row 5 shows Fitzroy as the away team with a score of 15.9 (99). This score is also above 15.00.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - All four teams mentioned in the claim have scores of 15.00 or above on that date.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Melbourne's score: Row 1, \"away team score\"\n- Richmond's score: Row 2, \"home team score\"\n- Collingwood's score: Row 3, \"away team score\"\n- Fitzroy's score: Row 5, \"away team score\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the scores of the specified teams: geelong, north melbourne, and south melbourne.\n\n1. **Geelong**: According to the table, Geelong's score is \"9.11 (65)\". The first number in parentheses before the decimal point represents the total goals scored, which is 9. Since 9 is less than or equal to 10, Geelong satisfies the condition.\n\n2. **North Melbourne**: The table shows that North Melbourne's score is \"6.11 (47)\". Here, the first number is 6, which is also less than or equal to 10. Therefore, North Melbourne satisfies the condition as well.\n\n3. **South Melbourne**: South Melbourne's score is listed as \"8.11 (59)\". The first number here is 8, which again is less than or equal to 10. Thus, South Melbourne satisfies the condition too.\n\nSince all three teams have a score of 10.00 or less, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Geelong: Row 0, \"home team score\"\n- North Melbourne: Row 1, \"home team score\"\n- South Melbourne: Row 3, \"home team score\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
