    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the points column in the table and see if the difference between the highest and lowest values is at most 11.\n\nFirst, let's extract the relevant data from the \"points\" column:\n\n- Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team: 456 points\n- BP Ford World Rally Team: 337 points\n- Citro\u00ebn Junior Team: 217 points\n- Stobart M - Sport Ford Rally Team: 176 points\n- Munchi's Ford World Rally Team: 58 points\n\nNext, we calculate the difference between the highest and lowest values:\n\n- Highest value: 456 (Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team)\n- Lowest value: 58 (Munchi's Ford World Rally Team)\n\nThe difference is \\( 456 - 58 = 398 \\).\n\nSince 398 is greater than 11, the claim that \"between all of the constructor there be a difference of at most 11 point\" is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The highest points (456) are in row index 0.\n- The lowest points (58) are in row index 4.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
