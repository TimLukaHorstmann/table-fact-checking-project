    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the given table, we need to carefully analyze each part of the claim and compare it with the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Team Identification**: The claim mentions \"iowa\" as the team. In the table, all entries under the \"team\" column for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 list \"iowa,\" and even the \"college totals\" row lists \"college totals.\" This confirms that \"iowa\" is indeed the team mentioned in the table.\n\n2. **Player's Name**: The claim mentions \"vanderberg.\" We need to verify if there is any indication of a player named vanderberg associated with the team \"iowa.\" However, the table does not provide any direct information about individual players or their names; it only provides aggregated statistics for the team.\n\n3. **Completion Status - Redshirt**: The claim specifies that the completion status should be \"redshirt.\" In the table:\n   - For the year 2008, all columns related to attempts, completions, completion percentage, and yards are labeled as \"redshirt.\"\n   - This implies that for the year 2008, no statistical data was recorded because it is marked as a redshirt year.\n\n4. **Claim Analysis**: The claim essentially states that \"iowa\" was the team vanderberg belonged to when his completion status was redshirted. Since the table indicates that in 2008 (a redshirt year), all relevant statistical categories are marked as \"redshirt,\" it is reasonable to infer that this applies to all players on the team during that year, including potentially vanderberg.\n\nGiven these points, the claim aligns with the information provided in the table for the year 2008. However, since there is no explicit mention of a player named vanderberg in the table, we must rely on the context and logical inference from the redshirt status.\n\nThus, the claim can be considered TRUE based on the available data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"completions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"completion %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, while there were indeed 42 completions in the year 2009 alone, the total number of completions over all years (according to \"college totals\") is 507.\n   - Therefore, stating that team Iowa has a total of 42 completions is misleading unless specifically referring to just the year 2009.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249,\" let's break down each part of the statement and verify against the table:\n\n1. **\"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa\":**\n   - This part refers to an instance where a player named \"vanderberg\" (presumably C.J. Beathard, who played as quarterback at Iowa) has 404 passing attempts.\n   - From the table:\n     - In the row corresponding to the year 2011 for team \"iowa,\" there are 404 attempts.\n\n2. **\"...when the record yard be 2249\":**\n   - This part refers to a situation where the highest recorded yards in a season is 2249.\n   - From the table:\n     - The highest yardage listed, 3022 yards, corresponds to the year 2011 for team \"iowa.\"\n     - In 2012, the yardage is 2249.\n\nNow let's evaluate whether both conditions can be true simultaneously:\n\n- For 404 attempts (year 2011), the corresponding yardage is 3022.\n- The record yard of 2249 occurs in a different year (2012).\n\nSince the claim suggests these two statistics occur simultaneously for \"vanderberg on iowa,\" but they actually occur in separate years, the claim cannot be true.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table data is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
