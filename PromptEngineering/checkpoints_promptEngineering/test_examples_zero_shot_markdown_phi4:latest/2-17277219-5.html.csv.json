    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim and compare it with the data in the table:\n\nClaim: \"gary player be the player of south africa with a place of t4\"\n\n1. **Player Name**: The claim states that Gary Player should be identified as the player from South Africa. We need to check if Gary Player is listed under the 'player' column and whether his associated country is South Africa.\n\n2. **Place**: The claim specifies that Gary Player has a place of \"t4\". This means we must verify that Gary Player's placement in the table corresponds to position \"t4\".\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For **Gary Player**:\n  - Check if he is listed under 'player': He appears in the table at row index 5.\n  - Verify his country: In column 'country' for row index 5, it states \"south africa\".\n  - Confirm his place: In column 'place' for row index 5, it shows \"t4\".\n\nThe claim is fully supported by these conditions. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells to Verify the Claim**:\n- Row Index 5, Column 'player': \"gary player\"\n- Row Index 5, Column 'country': \"south africa\"\n- Row Index 5, Column 'place': \"t4\"\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thus, we cannot verify Gary Player's position or performance after just one round based on this data.\n  \n- Since there is no direct information in the table about any player's standing after only one round, including Gary Player's, the claim cannot be verified as true.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
