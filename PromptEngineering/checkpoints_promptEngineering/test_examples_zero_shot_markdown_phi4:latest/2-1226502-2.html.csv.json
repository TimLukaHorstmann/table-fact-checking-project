However, we can infer his involvement by examining historical context or known associations between drivers and teams during these years.\n\n2. **Check Chassis Evolution for Gugelmin:**\n   - We need to verify if there is a sequence of chassis changes from \"march 881\" to \"jordan 192.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Cells in the Table:**\n\n   - **1988:** \n     - Row 0: `chassis = march 881`\n     - This matches the starting point mentioned in the claim.\n\n   - **1992:**\n     - Row 5: `entrant = sasol jordan yamaha`, `chassis = jordan 192`\n     - This matches the ending point mentioned in the claim.\n     - Historically, Teo Fabi and Bertrand Gachot were drivers for Jordan during this period, but Nigel Mansell was the notable driver later on. However, Eddie Cheever, who drove for Leyton House (1989), switched to Jordan mid-1991. Michele Alboreto also drove for Jordan in 1992, but Nigel Mansell is the more recognized driver associated with Jordan 192.\n     - Since Gugelmin was known to drive for March and later moved to Jordan, it's reasonable to associate him with these transitions.\n\n4. **Verify Transition:**\n   - The table shows:\n     - 1988: Leyton House March Racing Team used \"march 881\".\n     - 1992: SASOL Jordan Yamaha used \"jordan 192\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is supported by the transition from \"march 881\" to \"jordan 192\" over the years, aligning with known driver transitions.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE based on the table data and historical context.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the chassis of Gugelmin's auto staying the same as the March 881 over the years, we need to examine the table and identify if there is any entry for a driver named Gugelmin or an equivalent indication. Since the provided data does not explicitly mention drivers like Gugelmin, the claim cannot be directly assessed from this information.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that over the years, Gugelmin's auto chassis remains the same as March 881.\n   \n2. **Checking Relevance to Table**: \n   - The table provides data about entrants (teams), chassis types, engine specifications, and points for various years from 1988 to 1992.\n   - There is no direct mention of a driver named Gugelmin in the \"entrant\" column.\n\n3. **Analyzing Chassis Information**:\n   - In 1988, Leyton House March Racing Team used March 881 chassis with Judd V8 engine and scored 5 points.\n   - In 1989, Leyton House Racing also used March 881 chassis for one entry, alongside March CG891 for another entry.\n\n4. **Assessing the Claim**:\n   - Since Gugelmin is not mentioned in any of the entries, we cannot verify if he was associated with these teams or specific chassis.\n   - The table does not provide any data to confirm that Gugelmin drove a March 881 chassis consistently over multiple years.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without explicit information linking Gugelmin to the March 881 chassis across different years in this dataset, we cannot affirm the claim as true based on the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\" because there are no relevant cells in the table that directly support or verify the claim about Gugelmin's chassis usage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
