    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions:\n1. The number of games played at the \"boston garden\" location.\n2. Whether all these games occurred before December 17.\n\nLet's examine each relevant column in the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Column: Location / Attendance** - This will help us identify which games were played at \"boston garden.\"\n- **Column: Date** - This will allow us to check whether the identified games happened before December 17.\n\nNow, let's go through the table row by row and record relevant data for these columns:\n\n1. Row 20: \n   - Location / Attendance: \"boston garden\"\n   - Date: December 3\n2. Row 24:\n   - Location / Attendance: \"boston garden\"\n   - Date: December 8\n3. Row 25:\n   - Location / Attendance: \"boston garden\"\n   - Date: December 11\n4. Row 26:\n   - Location / Attendance: \"boston garden\"\n   - Date: December 15\n5. Row 28:\n   - Location / Attendance: \"boston garden\"\n   - Date: December 22\n\nNow, let's count the number of games played at \"boston garden\" and check their dates:\n\n- Games at \"boston garden\": Rows 20, 24, 25, 26, 28\n- Total count: 5 games\n\nNext, we verify if all these games occurred before December 17:\n- Row 20: December 3 (before December 17)\n- Row 24: December 8 (before December 17)\n- Row 25: December 11 (before December 17)\n- Row 26: December 15 (before December 17)\n- Row 28: December 22 (not before December 17)\n\nFrom this, we see that not all games at \"boston garden\" were played before December 17, specifically row 28 was on December 22.\n\nThus, the claim is false. The relevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
