    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"during the 1984 European Grand Prix, Elio De Angelis was the fastest driver\" is true or false, we need to understand what it means for a driver to be \"the fastest\" in this context.\n\nIn race results tables like this one, being \"the fastest\" typically refers to having completed the most laps and finishing at the top of the standings. This is usually associated with either winning the race or achieving the best overall time (excluding retirements).\n\nFrom the table:\n\n1. **Laps Completed**: \n   - The winner would be the driver who completed the highest number of laps, as long as they did not retire from the race.\n\n2. **Retirement Status**:\n   - We need to ensure that drivers with fewer laps due to retirement are not considered when determining the fastest or winning status unless specified otherwise (such as in historical contexts like lap records).\n\nNow, examining relevant columns in the table:\n\n- **driver**: Identify Elio De Angelis.\n- **laps**: Check how many laps he completed.\n- **time / retired**: Determine if he finished the race or retired. If retired, we look for drivers with more laps who didn't retire.\n\nEvaluating these criteria from the table:\n- Elio de Angelis completed 25 laps and retired due to a turbo issue.\n- Alain Prost completed 67 laps and did not retire, making him the driver with the most laps finished and therefore the winner (or fastest in terms of completing laps).\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n1. **Elio De Angelis's row**:\n   - \"laps\": 25 (row index: 24)\n   - \"time / retired\": turbo (row index: 24)\n\n2. **Alain Prost's row**, as he finished first with the most laps:\n   - \"laps\": 67 (row index: 0)\n   - \"grid\": 2 (provides context but not directly necessary for determining fastest)\n\nBased on this analysis, Elio De Angelis was not the fastest driver; Alain Prost was.
