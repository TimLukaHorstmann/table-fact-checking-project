    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding shutout games for the New Jersey Devils, we need to examine each game in the table and determine if there were any instances where the New Jersey Devils did not score at all (i.e., had a shutout loss).\n\nThe relevant column for this analysis is \"score,\" as it contains information about the goals scored by both teams. The structure of the scores is such that the first number represents the visitor's score and the second number represents the home team's score, with New Jersey always being the home team in this table.\n\nLet's analyze each game where New Jersey was the home team:\n\n1. **November 2**: Score - \"2 - 3\" (New Jersey Devils scored 3 goals)\n2. **November 8**: Score - \"1 - 4\" (New Jersey Devils scored 4 goals)\n3. **November 17**: Score - \"6 - 2\" (New Jersey Devils scored 6 goals)\n4. **November 21**: Score - \"2 - 1\" (New Jersey Devils scored 2 goals)\n5. **November 23**: Score - \"3 - 0\" (New Jersey Devils scored 3 goals)\n6. **November 24**: Score - \"3 - 2\" (New Jersey Devils scored 3 goals)\n7. **November 28**: Score - \"2 - 4\" (New Jersey Devils scored 4 goals)\n8. **November 30**: Score - \"0 - 4\" (New Jersey Devils scored 4 goals)\n\nIn the cases where New Jersey was defeated:\n- November 2: They lost 3 - 2, but they did score.\n- November 10: They lost 1 - 2 as visitors; not a home game.\n- November 14: They lost 4 - 2 at home; however, they scored 2 goals.\n\nThe only instance where New Jersey Devils were shutout (scored 0) and lost was:\n- **November 16**: Score - \"1 - 0\" against New Jersey\n\nSince the claim specifies that New Jersey lost three games with a score of zero points (a shutout loss), we find only one such occurrence in this table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
