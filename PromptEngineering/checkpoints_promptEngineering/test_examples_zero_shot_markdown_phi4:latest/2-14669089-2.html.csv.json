This means it became the tallest in 1973, so it doesn't affect the period 1970-1973.\n- Other buildings have earlier \"years as tallest,\" meaning they were not taller during 1970-1973.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. The building has 31 floors.\n2. It was indeed the tallest from 1970 to 1973, as no other building in the table is recorded as being taller during this period.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n- For \"floors\": Row index 1, column name \"floors\".\n- For \"years as tallest\": Row index 1, column name \"years as tallest\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The city listed is Johannesburg.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Number of Floors\n- From row index 0, check the \"floors\" column for the number of floors. It shows 50 floors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is incorrect because while Carlton Centre does have 50 floors, it is not located in Cape Town; it is located in Johannesburg.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n1. **Location Check**:\n   - Row index: 0\n   - Column name: \"city\"\n\n2. **Number of Floors Check**:\n   - Row index: 0\n   - Column name: \"floors\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
