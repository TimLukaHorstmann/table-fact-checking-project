Chad Nkang follows with an overall pick number after Andrew Carnahan.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions using the table data:\n\n- **Andrew Carnahan**:\n  - Row index: 10\n  - Overall Pick Number: 252\n\n- **Chad Nkang**:\n  - Row index: 9\n  - Overall Pick Number: 251\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other players with an overall pick number higher than or equal to Andrew Carnahan (252):\n\n- We need to compare the \"overall\" column for all rows.\n- The highest overall pick numbers in the table are:\n  - Derek Landri: 166\n  - Josh Gattis, Uche Nwaneri: 150 and 149 respectively\n  - Brian Smith, Adam Podlesh, Mike Sims-Walker, Justin Durant, Reggie Nelson: 113, 101, 79, 48, and 21 respectively\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- Andrew Carnahan's overall pick number of 252 is indeed the highest in the table.\n- Chad Nkang follows immediately after with an overall pick number of 251.\n\nThus, both conditions stated in the claim are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".
