    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"over 40 points be score for at least 5 games\" is true or false, we need to examine the \"points\" column in the table and check how many rows have a points value greater than 40.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column here is \"points\" because it indicates the total number of points after each game.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Each Row**:\n   - December 2: 32 points\n   - December 4: 34 points\n   - December 6: 35 points\n   - December 9: 37 points\n   - December 11: 37 points\n   - December 13: 37 points\n   - December 16: 37 points\n   - December 18: 39 points\n   - December 20: 41 points (over 40)\n   - December 21: 42 points (over 40)\n   - December 27: 44 points (over 40)\n   - December 29: 46 points (over 40)\n   - December 30: 48 points (over 40)\n\n3. **Count Rows with Over 40 Points**:\n   - There are 5 games where the points exceed 40: December 20, December 21, December 27, December 29, and December 30.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there are at least 5 games with over 40 points scored, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 9 (\"December 20\"): 41 points\n- Row index 10 (\"December 21\"): 42 points\n- Row index 11 (\"December 27\"): 44 points\n- Row index 12 (\"December 29\"): 46 points\n- Row index 13 (\"December 30\"): 48 points\n\nHere is the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
