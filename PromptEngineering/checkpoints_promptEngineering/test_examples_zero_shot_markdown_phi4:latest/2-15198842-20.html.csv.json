    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the Atlanta Falcons have the 5th pick in more than four separate rounds according to the table provided.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant column \"pick\" for each round to see where the 5th pick occurs:\n\n- **Round 1:** Pick = 2\n- **Round 2:** Pick = 17\n- **Round 3:** Not listed\n- **Round 4:** Pick = 5\n- **Round 5:** Not listed\n- **Round 6:** Pick = 12\n- **Round 7:** Not listed\n- **Round 8:** \n  - First instance: Pick = 5\n  - Second instance: Pick = 19\n- **Round 9:** Pick = 4\n- **Round 10:** Pick = 5\n- **Round 11:** Pick = 4\n- **Round 12:** Pick = 5\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that the Falcons have the 5th pick in the following rounds:\n1. Round 4\n2. Round 8 (first instance)\n3. Round 10\n4. Round 12\n\nThis makes a total of four rounds where the Falcons have the 5th pick.\n\nThe claim states they should have the 5th pick in more than four separate rounds. Since they only have it in exactly four rounds, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Round 4, Pick = 5\n- Round 8, First instance, Pick = 5\n- Round 10, Pick = 5\n- Round 12, Pick = 5\n\nThese correspond to the following rows and columns:\n1. Row Index: 3, Column Name: \"pick\"\n2. Row Index: 5, Column Name: \"pick\"\n3. Row Index: 8, Column Name: \"pick\"\n4. Row Index: 10, Column Name: \"pick\"\n\nThus, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
