The names of the individuals mentioned in the claim: \"Claudio Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl.\"\n2.

This does not match the information from the table (which lists them at 174).\n\n### Conclusion\nSince both the name and the place do not match, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- The relevant cells are those containing the names and places of \"Claudia Koch / Peter Sch\u00fcbl.\"\n- These are located in row 20 under the columns \"name\" and \"places.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"places\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
