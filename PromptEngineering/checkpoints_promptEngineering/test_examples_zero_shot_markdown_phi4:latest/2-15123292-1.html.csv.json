The team in question is the Washington Redskins.\n2. They played exactly 2 games in December 1953.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Rows\nWe need to focus on rows where the date falls within December 1953. This corresponds to weeks 11 and 12 of the season:\n- Week 11 (Row 10) has a date of \"December 6, 1953.\"\n- Week 12 (Row 11) has a date of \"December 13, 1953.\"\n\n### Step 2: Verify Team Information\nFor these rows, we need to check if the opponent mentioned aligns with games played by the Washington Redskins. The table does not explicitly mention the Washington Redskins, so we infer that all listed opponents were indeed their opponents in those weeks.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Games\nWe count how many games are listed for December:\n- Two games are recorded: one on December 6 and another on December 13.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe table indicates that there are exactly two games played by Washington Redskins during December 1953. The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those in rows corresponding to weeks 11 and 12, under the \"date\" column.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Washington Redskins have a winning record during the 1953 season\" is true or false, we need to evaluate their performance based on the provided table.\n\n1. **Understanding \"Winning Record\":** \n   - A team has a winning record if it has more wins than losses over the course of a season.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - We need to look at the \"result\" column to count how many games were won (\"w\") and lost (\"l\").\n\n3. **Counting Wins and Losses:**\n   - Week 1: w (Win)\n   - Week 2: t (Tie, does not affect win/loss record)\n   - Week 3: w (Win)\n   - Week 4: l (Loss)\n   - Week 5: l (Loss)\n   - Week 6: l (Loss)\n   - Week 7: w (Win)\n   - Week 8: l (Loss)\n   - Week 9: w (Win)\n   - Week 10: w (Win)\n   - Week 11: w (Win)\n   - Week 12: l (Loss)\n\n4. **Calculating Wins and Losses:**\n   - Total Wins = 6\n   - Total Losses = 5\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Washington Redskins have more wins than losses, so they do indeed have a winning record.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
