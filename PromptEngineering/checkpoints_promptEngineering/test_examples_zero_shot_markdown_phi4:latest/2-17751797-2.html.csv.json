    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the majority of replay game be win by the away team\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table and focus on the \"replay\" rows. Each replay row indicates a match that required an additional game to decide a winner after the initial match ended in a draw.\n\nLet's identify all the replay games from the table:\n\n1. **Row 3 (Replay)**: \n   - Home Team: Northampton Town\n   - Score: 0 - 1\n   - Away Team: Barnet\n\n2. **Row 8 (Replay)**:\n   - Home Team: Peterborough United\n   - Score: 2 - 0\n   - Away Team: Wycombe Wanderers\n\n3. **Row 9 (Replay)**:\n   - Home Team: Cambridge United\n   - Score: 2 - 1\n   - Away Team: Fulham\n\n4. **Row 13 (Replay)**:\n   - Home Team: Halifax Town\n   - Score: 1 - 2\n   - Away Team: Rotherham United\n\n5. **Row 16 (Replay)**:\n   - Home Team: Leyton Orient\n   - Score: 4 - 1\n   - Away Team: Colchester United\n\n6. **Row 18 (Replay)**:\n   - Home Team: Chester City\n   - Score: 4 - 0\n   - Away Team: Leek Town\n\nNext, we need to determine which team won each replay:\n\n- In Row 3, Barnet (away team) wins.\n- In Row 8, Peterborough United (home team) wins.\n- In Row 9, Cambridge United (home team) wins.\n- In Row 13, Rotherham United (away team) wins.\n- In Row 16, Leyton Orient (home team) wins.\n- In Row 18, Chester City (home team) wins.\n\nNow we count the number of replays won by the away team:\n\n- Barnet (Row 3)\n- Rotherham United (Row 13)\n\nThere are 2 replays where the away team won. There are a total of 6 replays.\n\nTo verify if the majority of replay games were won by the away team, we check if more than half of these replays were won by the away teams:\n\n- Number of replays won by the away team: 2\n- Total number of replays: 6\n\nSince 2 is not greater than half of 6 (which would be 3), the claim that \"the majority of replay game be win by the away team\" is FALSE.\n\nFinally, we compile the relevant cells for these replays:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table for games where one team won with a score of at least 4-0 and verify if Woking played in such a game.\n\nThe relevant part of the claim is that Woking played \"the highest scoring shut out game\" with a result of \"4 to 0\". This means we are looking for a game where:\n\n1. The winning team won by at least four goals.\n2. The losing team did not score any goals (shutout).\n3. Woking participated in this particular match.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- Row 5 shows: \"woking | 5 - 1 | merthyr tydfil | 08 / 12 / 1990\"\n  - Here, Woking won against Merthyr Tydfil with a score of 5-1. This is not a shutout since the away team scored one goal.\n\nNow, we need to check other games for any 4-0 or higher scoring shutouts:\n\n- Row 16: \"wigan athletic | 2 - 0 | hartlepool united | 08 / 12 / 1990\"\n  - Wigan Athletic won 2-0, not a 4-0 shutout.\n\nNo other games in the table have a score of 4-0 or higher with one team scoring all the goals. Therefore, there is no game where Woking played and achieved a 4-0 win or more as a shutout.\n\nThe claim that \"Woking play the highest scoring shut out game: 4 to 0\" is false because:\n\n1. Woking did not achieve any shutout victory of 4-0 or higher.\n2. No other team has a recorded shutout of 4-0 in the table.\n\nThus, we conclude the claim is FALSE.
