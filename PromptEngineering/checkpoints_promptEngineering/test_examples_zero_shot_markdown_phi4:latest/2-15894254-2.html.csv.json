    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and identify the relevant data that relates to the given claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"runner-up be the outcome of the match on 12 September 2003.\"\n\nLet's break this down into parts:\n\n1. **Date Condition**: The claim specifies a date of \"12 September 2003.\"\n2. **Outcome Condition**: It claims that the outcome for this date is \"runner-up.\"\n\n### Table Analysis:\nWe need to search the table for an entry where the `date` matches \"12 September 2003\" and check if the corresponding `outcome` is \"runner-up.\"\n\n1. **Search by Date**:\n   - The table provides various dates in the second column.\n   - Check each row to see if any of these dates match \"12 September 2003.\"\n\n2. **Check Outcome for Matching Date**:\n   - If a date matches, verify the `outcome` in that row.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Row Iteration**:\n   - Row 0: Date is \"27 July 2003\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 1: Date is \"12 September 2004\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 2: Date is \"28 May 2006\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 3: Date is \"4 June 2006\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 4: Date is \"23 July 2006\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 5: Date is \"17 September 2006\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 6: Date is \"24 September 2006\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 7: Date is \"1 October 2006\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 8: Date is \"6 April 2008\" \u2013 does not match.\n   - Row 9: Date is \"5 October 2008\" \u2013 does not match.\n\n2. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no row in the table where the `date` matches \"12 September 2003.\"\n   - Therefore, there can't be an outcome of \"runner-up\" for this date since it doesn't exist in the table.\n\n### Result:\nThe claim is false because there is no match for the specified date in the table. \n\nHere's the JSON representation of the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Since no row matches the date \"12 September 2003,\" both `row_index` values are `null`, indicating that no relevant cells could be found for this claim.",
