We need to locate this team name in the table.\n2. **Sport**: The claim specifies \"baseball\" as the sport, so we should ensure that the row pertains to baseball.\n3. **Class**: The claim mentions that the team is in the \"AAA class\", thus we must check the 'class' column for a value of \"aaa\".\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The Evansville Triplets are listed on the 11th row (row index starting from 0, which corresponds to index 10).\n- In this row:\n  - **Team Name**: \"evansville triplets\" matches.\n  - **Sport**: \"baseball\" is confirmed.\n  - **Class**: The value in the 'class' column is \"aaa\", matching the claim.\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the table data.
