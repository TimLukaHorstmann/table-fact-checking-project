Verify if episode \"s07e04\" corresponds to the title \"the engagement ring\".\n2. Check that its original air date is October 4, 2008.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows and columns:\n\n- The column \"tv broadcast\" contains the TV episode identifier (e.g., s07e01). We need to find row(s) where this equals \"s07e04\".\n- For that same row, check if the \"originalairdate\" is October 4, 2008.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n1. **Locate \"s07e04\" in the \"tv broadcast\" column:**\n   - We find that row index 3 contains \"s07e04\".\n\n2. **Check the air date for this episode:**\n   - In row 3, under the \"originalairdate\" column, the value is October 4, 2008.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (the TV broadcast identifier and the original air date match), the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tv broadcast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"originalairdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
