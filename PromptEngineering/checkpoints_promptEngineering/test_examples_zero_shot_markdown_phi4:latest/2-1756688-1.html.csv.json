There is no explicit data for 2009 or 2010. Hence, based on the available information, he did not play for four consecutive years with Geelong.\n\n**Part 2: Switching from Geelong to Gold Coast**\n\n- The table shows an entry for Gold Coast in 2011.\n- This suggests a switch after his last recorded season with Geelong (2007).\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- **Row Index 4:** Season 2011, Team Gold Coast\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states Nathan Ablett played for Geelong for four years before switching to Gold Coast.

In 2005:\n   - The \"disposals\" value is given as 27 (6.8).\n\n2. In 2007:\n   - The \"disposals\" value is listed as 191 (9.1).\n\nTo determine if Ablett had 164 more disposals in 2007 compared to 2005, we calculate the difference between these two values:\n\n- Disposals in 2007: 191\n- Disposals in 2005: 27\n\nThe difference is calculated as:\n\\[ \n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Disposals in 2007} - \\text{Disposals in 2005} = 191 - 27 = 164\n\\]\n\nThe calculation confirms that Ablett had exactly 164 more disposals in 2007 than he did in 2005.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate Nathan Ablett's performance for each year he played with Geelong and identify his best year in terms of points scored. The table provides data on goals and behinds, which can be used to calculate total points (since a goal is worth 6 points and a behind is worth 1 point).\n\nLet's break down the relevant information:\n\n1. **2005:**\n   - Goals: 8\n   - Behinds: 2\n   - Points = (8 goals * 6) + (2 behinds * 1) = 48 + 2 = 50\n\n2. **2006:**\n   - Goals: 4\n   - Behinds: 3\n   - Points = (4 goals * 6) + (3 behinds * 1) = 24 + 3 = 27\n\n3. **2007:**\n   - Goals: 34\n   - Behinds: 18\n   - Points = (34 goals * 6) + (18 behinds * 1) = 204 + 18 = 222\n\n4. **2008:**\n   - Data is missing, so we cannot calculate points for this year.\n\nFrom the calculations:\n- The best year in terms of points scored was 2007 with 222 points.\n- Since there's no data available for 2008, it can't be considered as his best year.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Ablett's best year for points was 2008\" is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Goals and behinds for each season (2005, 2006, 2007) to calculate points.\n- The missing data row for 2008 confirms no information is available for that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
