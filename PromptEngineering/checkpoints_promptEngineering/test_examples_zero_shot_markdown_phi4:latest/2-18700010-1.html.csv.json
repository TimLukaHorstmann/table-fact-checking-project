    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two conditions: \n\n1. Identify if there are exactly 2 players with the highest number of total goals.\n2. Verify if those players are Ian Robins and Chris Topping.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the \"total goals\" column since it directly indicates each player's goal count. We will scan through this column to find the maximum number of goals scored by any player(s).\n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- Ian Robins has a total of 27 goals.\n- No other player matches or exceeds 27 goals.\n\nNow, check if there is exactly one other player with 27 goals (to meet the \"2 players\" condition). Since no other player has 27 goals, only Ian Robins has the highest number of total goals. Therefore, there aren't two players sharing the highest goal count.\n\nNext, we verify the involvement of Chris Topping:\n\n- Chris Topping has a total of 0 goals.\n\nSince Chris Topping is not among those with the highest number of goals (as he scored none), this part of the claim is incorrect as well. \n\nGiven these observations:\n1. Only one player, Ian Robins, holds the highest number of goals.\n2. The second player mentioned in the claim, Chris Topping, does not share the highest goal count.\n\nThe claim is false because it incorrectly states that there are two players with the highest number of total goals and identifies them as Ian Robin (Robins) and Chris Topping.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this information include those related to \"total goals\" for Ian Robins and Chris Topping:\n\n- Row index 12, column \"total goals\" for Ian Robins.\n- Row index 22, column \"total goals\" for Chris Topping.\n\nHere is the resulting JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
