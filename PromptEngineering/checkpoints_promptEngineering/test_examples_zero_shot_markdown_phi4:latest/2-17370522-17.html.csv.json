    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ashley grime play for millwall\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to verify if there is a record of Ashley Grimes transferring to Millwall.\n\nHere's how we can analyze the table:\n\n1. Identify the row where the player named \"Ashley Grimes\" appears.\n2. Check the column \"to club\" for that row to see if it mentions \"Millwall.\"\n3. Confirm the transfer details, such as position and exit date, match those in the claim.\n\nLet's go through these steps with reference to the table:\n\n- The player \"Ashley Grimes\" is found on the 4th row (index 3) of the table.\n- In this row, under the column \"to club,\" it lists \"Millwall.\"\n- Additionally, the exit date matches as \"1 july 2008,\" and the position listed is \"mf\" (midfielder), which aligns with a player playing for a football team.\n\nGiven that Ashley Grimes did indeed transfer to Millwall according to this row in the table, we can conclude that the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.
