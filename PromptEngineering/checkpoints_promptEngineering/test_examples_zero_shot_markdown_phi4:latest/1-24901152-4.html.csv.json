    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each part of it against the table provided.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"The partner in 2004 at the Indian Wells championship be Martina Navratilova\":**\n   - Look for a row where `year` is 2004 and `championship` is \"indian wells\".\n   - Check the corresponding `partner` value.\n   \n2. **\"but in 2003 at the Toronto championship, the partner be Lisa Raymond\":**\n   - Look for a row where `year` is 2003 and `championship` is \"toronto\".\n   - Check the corresponding `partner` value.\n\n### Verification against Table:\n\n1. **For Indian Wells 2004:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row Index 2: \n       - `year`: 2004\n       - `championship`: indian wells\n       - `partner`: elena likhovtseva\n   - The claim states Martina Navratilova, but the partner is actually Elena Likhovtseva. Thus, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n2. **For Toronto 2003:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row Index 1:\n       - `year`: 2003\n       - `championship`: toronto\n       - `partner`: martina navratilova\n   - The claim states Lisa Raymond, but the partner is actually Martina Navratilova. Thus, this part of the claim is also FALSE.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are false based on the data from the table, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For verifying Indian Wells 2004: \n  - Row Index 2, `year`, `championship`, and `partner`.\n- For verifying Toronto 2003:\n  - Row Index 1, `year`, `championship`, and `partner`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
