Here\u2019s how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The driver name \"cesare perdisa\" is found in the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Row Index:**\n   - By scanning through the table, Cesare Perdisa is listed on row 6 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n3. **Check the \"time / retired\" Column:**\n   - In row 6, under the \"time / retired\" column, the value is \"+ 6 laps\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Cesare Perdisa has a time / retired of \"+ 6 lap\". The table shows \"+ 6 laps\", which matches the claim.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Robert Manzon who have 88 lap with a Maserati have average 22 grid,\" we need to examine specific pieces of information from the table.\n\n1. Identify Robert Manzon's row in the table:\n   - According to the table, Robert Manzon is mentioned twice:\n     - Row index 9: laps = 94, grid = 18\n     - Row index 14: laps completed = 87\n\n2. Determine if Robert Manzon completed 88 laps with a Maserati:\n   - In row index 14, he completed 87 laps and not 88, so this information does not match the claim.\n   \n3. Check for any mention of \"Maserati\" associated with his 88 laps in the table (which doesn't exist):\n   - None of Robert Manzon's entries list Maserati as the constructor.\n\n4. Determine if he has an average grid position of 22:\n   - His actual grids are 18 and 18, so the average would be 18 (not 22).\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is not supported by any data in the table because:\n- Robert Manzon did not complete exactly 88 laps with a Maserati.\n- He does not have an average grid position of 22.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE. The relevant rows and columns for verification are those that contain information about Robert Manzon's laps and grid positions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
