There must be a draft pick associated with the Calgary team prior to (before) the entry for Mark Farraway.\n2. The context of 'be pick' in the claim suggests there should be an identifiable draft pick by Calgary that precedes Mark Farraway.\n\nLet's examine these points:\n\n- **Identify Draft Picks by Calgary**:\n  - From the table, we see entries associated with the team \"calgary stampeders\" and another entry simply for \"calgary.\"\n  - The first is at row index 4 (5th in the numbering starting from 1), where \"cfl team\" is \"calgary stampeders\".\n  - The second is at row index 6 (7th in the table) with the team as \"calgary\", and player name \"jason clemett\".\n\n- **Identify Mark Farraway's Entry**:\n  - Row index 7 (8th entry in the table): Player is Mark Farraway, associated with the Edmonton team.\n\nNext, let's determine if there's a draft pick by Calgary before Mark Farraway:\n\n1.
