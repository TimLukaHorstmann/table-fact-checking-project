    "claim": "217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true, we need to analyze the table for two conditions:\n1. Identify all rows where the \"lbsc name\" column contains the name \"granville\".\n2. Check the corresponding values in the \"1st lbsc no\" column to verify if 217 is indeed the lowest number among them.\n\nLet's evaluate these steps using the data provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation\n\n1. **Locate Entries with Lbsc Name \"Granville\":**\n   - We need to find all rows where the \"lbsc name\" equals \"granville\".\n   \n2. **Identify 1st lbsc Numbers for Granville:**\n   - From these entries, note down the numbers in the \"1st lbsc no\" column.\n\n3. **Check if 217 is the Lowest Number:**\n   - Compare all extracted numbers to see if 217 is the smallest among them.\n\n### Table Examination\n\n- **Row with \"granville\":** \n  - Row index 15 contains the name \"granville\".\n  - The corresponding \"1st lbsc no\" for this row is 216.\n\nSince there's only one entry for \"granville\", and its associated number is 216, which is less than 217, it indicates that 217 cannot be the lowest \"1st lbsc no\" for any entity named \"granville\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that \"217\" should be the lowest \"1st lbsc no\" for the \"lbsc name\" of \"granville\". However, we found that the only entry with this name has an \"1st lbsc no\" of 216. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
