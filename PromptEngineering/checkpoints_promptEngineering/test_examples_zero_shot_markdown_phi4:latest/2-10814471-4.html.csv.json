The aim is to check if there are exactly three matches listed at \"the willows\" venue.\n\n1. **Identify the Match Date:**  \n   - We first locate the match that occurred on 16/3/01. This corresponds to row index 1 in the table (as it follows the markdown format with a header row).\n\n2. **Check Venue for this Match:**  \n   - In row 1, under the \"venue\" column, it confirms the venue as \"the willows.\"\n\n3. **Count Matches at \"The Willows\":**  \n   - Next, we need to search through the entire table to count all occurrences where the venue is listed as \"the willows.\"\n   - Scan through each row's \"venue\" column for matches with \"the willows\":\n     - Row 1 (16/3/01) has the venue as \"the willows.\"\n     - No other rows list \"the willows\" in the venue column.\n\n4. **Determine Total Matches at the Venue:**  \n   - After examining all entries, only one match is found to be at \"the willows.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**  \n   - The claim states that 16/3/01 should be one of three matches at this venue.\n   - Since there is only one recorded match at \"the willows,\" the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - For verifying the date and venue, we focus on:\n     - Row index 1 for both \"date\" (16/3/01) and \"venue\" (\"the willows\").\n     - Additional checks across all rows to confirm no other matches at \"the willows.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.
