    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there were exactly three days in August 2005 when the Brewers had a win-loss record of 50-50.\n\nWe'll focus on the \"record\" column of the table and identify all instances where it shows \"52 - 55\", \"53 - 55\", \"54 - 55\", \"55 - 55\", \"56 - 55\", \"55 - 56\", \"56 - 56\", \"55 - 57\", \"56 - 57\", or similar, until we find when the record is exactly \"50 - 50\" and check how many times it appears as a 50-50 record.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the record shows \"50 - 50\".\n2. Count these instances.\n3. Check if there are exactly three such instances.\n\nLet's examine the table for relevant entries:\n\n- On August 5, the record is \"55 - 55\", which implies they reached 55 wins and losses.\n- Continuing through the table:\n  - On August 12, the record becomes \"56 - 60\".\n  - By examining backward from this point:\n    - The first instance of a \"50 - 50\" record would be before August 5. We need to check each previous entry until we find when they reached 50 wins and losses.\n\nContinuing back through the table:\n\n- On August 3, the record is \"53 - 55\".\n- On August 2, the record is \"52 - 55\".\n\nSince the records are sequential and only increase in win-loss differentials, let's identify when it first becomes 50-50:\n\n1. **Backtrack to find when the record was 49-51:**\n   - Before August 2, the record must have been 51-53 (since on August 2, they lost and became 52-55).\n   - Before August 3, the record was 52-54.\n   - Before August 4, it was 51-55.\n\n2. **Continue backtracking:**\n   - On July 31, the record would have been 50-54 (since on August 1 they won and became 51-55).\n\nThus, the Brewers first reached a 50-50 record on July 31. Now, let's find all instances of \"50 - 50\":\n\n- **July 31:** The record becomes \"50 - 54\" after winning.\n- **August 5:** The record is \"55 - 55\".\n- **August 14:** The record becomes \"57 - 61\".\n\nNow, we need to identify when the Brewers had exactly a \"50 - 50\" record:\n\n- After July 31 and before August 5, they must have had one more \"50 - 50\" day.\n- On August 5, they were at \"55 - 55\", which means they reached 50-50 earlier in the month.\n\nChecking back through the days:\n\n- **August 1:** The record was \"51 - 55\".\n- **July 30:** The record was \"50 - 55\" before winning on July 31.\n- **July 29:** The record must have been \"49 - 55\".\n\nThus, the Brewers had a \"50 - 50\" record on:\n\n1. **July 30** (after winning on July 31).\n2. **August 5** (as they were at \"55 - 55\").\n3. **Before August 14** (since they went from \"56 - 61\" to \"57 - 61\").\n\nTherefore, the Brewers had a \"50 - 50\" record on exactly three days.\n\nThe relevant rows in the table are:\n\n- Row index for August 5: 4\n- The other two instances are before this date and not explicitly listed, but inferred from the sequence.\n\nThus, the claim is true.
