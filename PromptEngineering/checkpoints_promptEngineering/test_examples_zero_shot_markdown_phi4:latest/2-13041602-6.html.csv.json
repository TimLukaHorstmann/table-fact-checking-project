Check if the Brewers won that particular game.\n\nLet's go through the relevant columns:\n\n- **Attendance**: This column will help us find the game with the lowest number of attendees.\n- **Record**: This column indicates whether the Brewers won or lost a specific game, as it shows their win-loss record after each match.\n\nFirst, we identify the row with the smallest attendance value in the \"attendance\" column:\n\n1. August 2: 32,453\n2. August 3: 40,659\n3. August 4: 30,359\n4. August 5: 31,759\n5. August 6: 35,800\n6. August 7: 35,017\n7. August 8: 30,260\n8. August 9: 28,556\n9. August 10: 37,650\n10.

August 31: 15,062 (Second Lowest)\n\nThe game on August 31 had the lowest attendance with 15,062 people.\n\nNext, we check if the Brewers won that game by examining their record:\n\n- Before the game on August 31, the Brewers' record was 64 - 67.\n- After the game, it became 65 - 68.\n\nThis indicates they won the game because their win count increased from 64 to 65 while their loss count remained unchanged at 68 (meaning they did not lose that particular game).\n\nFinally, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- The row with the lowest attendance: August 31\n- \"attendance\" column in the row for August 31.\n- \"record\" column before and after the match on August 31.\n\nThe JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The task is to identify whether there was any point during the month when the Brewers had more wins than losses, indicated by a positive difference between the number of wins and losses.\n\n1. **Understand Winning Record**: A team has a winning record if their wins exceed their losses. For example, a record of 60-50 indicates a winning record because there are more wins (60) than losses (50).\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Entry in August**:\n   - We examine the \"record\" column for each game played in August.\n   - The initial record on August 1st is not provided, but we start with the first available record: `52-55`.\n   \n3. **Check Record Progression**:\n   - August 2: `52-55` (Losses > Wins)\n   - August 3: `53-55`\n   - August 4: `54-55`\n   - August 5: `55-55`\n   - August 6: `55-56`\n   - August 7: `56-56` (Wins = Losses, not a winning record)\n   - August 8: `56-57`\n   - August 9: `56-58`\n   - August 10: `56-59`\n   - August 12: `56-60`\n   - August 13: `56-61`\n   - August 14: `57-61`\n   - August 15: `57-62`\n   - August 16: `58-62`\n   - August 17: `59-62`\n   - August 18: `60-62`\n   - August 19: `60-63`\n   - August 20: `61-63` (This is a winning record)\n   - August 21: `61-64`\n   - August 23: `62-64`\n   - August 24: `63-64` (Another instance of a winning record)\n   - August 25: `63-65`\n   - August 26: `64-65`\n   - August 27: `64-66`\n   - August 28: `64-67`\n   - August 30: `64-68`\n   - August 31: `65-68`\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Brewers had a winning record on August 20 (`61-63`) and August 24 (`63-64`).\n   - Thus, the claim that \"there be no day in august 2005 in which the brewer have a winning record\" is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant rows for this evaluation are those where the Brewers had records of `61-63`, `63-64`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
