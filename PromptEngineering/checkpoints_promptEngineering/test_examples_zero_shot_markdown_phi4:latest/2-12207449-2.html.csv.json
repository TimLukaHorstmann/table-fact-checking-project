    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the \"record\" column in the table for streaks of losses by the Blue Jays in April 1986.\n\nThe record column shows a sequence of wins and losses:\n1. April 8: Loss (0 - 1)\n2. April 9: Win (1 - 1)\n3. April 10: Win (2 - 1)\n4. April 11: Win (3 - 1)\n5. April 12: Loss (3 - 2)\n6. April 13: Loss (3 - 3)\n7. April 14: Loss (3 - 4)\n8.

Confirm that this score represents their worst loss in April 1986.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the relevant cells from the markdown table:\n\n- **Identify the Game**: We look for the row where both \"date\" is \"april 22\", and \"opponent\" is \"rangers\". The relevant data is:\n  - Date: april 22\n  - Opponent: rangers\n  - Score: 10 - 1\n\n- **Verify It's the Worst Loss**: We need to check all games in April against other teams and compare scores. A loss means the opponent scored more than them, so we're looking for the largest difference where they lost.\n\nFrom the table:\n- For every game, if the team is on the losing side (the \"score\" column shows higher numbers for the opponent), we note the score difference.\n- The significant losses are:\n  - April 22 vs Rangers: Score 10 - 1, Loss by 9 runs\n  - Other notable losses include:\n    - April 23 vs Rangers: Score 9 - 8, Loss by 1 run\n    - April 29 vs Angels: Score 4 - 3, Loss by 1 run\n    - April 30 vs Angels: Score 6 - 4, Loss by 2 runs\n\nFrom these observations, the largest loss margin is on April 22 against the Rangers with a score of 10 - 1 (loss by 9 runs).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"the worst loss of their 1986 april be 10 - 1 against the ranger on the 22nd\" is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- April 22 game details: Score and Opponent\n- Other games to compare losses\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}, // Since the game was postponed\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the pitcher Stieb being the worst start pitcher in April with a score of 0 - 2, we need to examine the relevant cells from the table.\n\nThe claim states that Stieb has a record of 0 wins and 2 losses. To verify this, we should look at:\n\n1. The \"loss\" column for entries involving Stieb.\n2. The \"record\" column after each game involving Stieb to see how his individual record is reflected.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **April 8:** Loss by Stieb (0 - 1). Relevant cell: `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}`\n- **April 13:** Loss by Stieb (0 - 2). Relevant cell: `{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}`\n- **April 18:** Loss by Stieb (0 - 3). Relevant cell: `{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}`\n\nNow, let's check the record after each game:\n\n- After April 8: Record is 0 - 1.\n- After April 13: Record is 3 - 3.\n- After April 18: Record is 4 - 6.\n\nThe record of the team does not directly reflect individual pitcher records. However, from the \"loss\" column, Stieb has a personal record of 0 wins and 2 losses by April 13. There are no other pitchers with more than 2 losses in this period.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim that they scored 11 runs in an 11-10 win over the Orioles is incorrect.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- We only need to check rows where the opponent is \"orioles\" for a score with the Blue Jays scoring 11 runs.

The claim specifically mentions a game with a score of \"10 - 1\" and attributes it as the \"worst loss\" on \"April 22\" against \"orioles.\" Let's break this down:\n\n1. **Date Check**: Verify if there is an entry for April 22 in the table.\n   - Row index 16: The date is \"april 22,\" which matches.\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: Ensure that the opponent on April 22 was indeed \"orioles.\"\n   - Row index 16: The opponent listed is \"rangers.\"\n\n3. **Score Check**: Verify if the score for this game was \"10 - 1\" and confirm it as a loss.\n   - Row index 16: The score is \"10 - 1.\" According to the team's perspective, they lost (as they scored 1).\n\n4. **Determine if It Was the Worst Loss**:\n   - Evaluate all other games in April to check for any game with a larger margin of loss.\n   - Check scores where the opposing team won by more than a 9-point difference.\n\nHere are additional losses in April and their score differences:\n\n- Row index 2: Score \"11 - 10\" (1 point difference)\n- Row index 3, 4, 5: All within 1 to 3 points\n- Row index 6: Score \"7 - 4\" (3 points)\n- Row index 7: Score \"5 - 3\" (2 points)\n- Row index 8: Score \"7 - 4\" (3 points)\n- Row index 9: Score \"6 - 4\" (2 points)\n- Row index 10: Score \"6 - 5\" (1 point)\n- Row index 11: Score \"6 - 4\" (2 points)\n- Row index 12: Score \"7 - 6\" (1 point)\n- Row index 13, 14, 15: All within a 1 to 3-point difference\n- Row index 17: Score \"11 - 5\" (6 points)\n- Row index 18: Score \"8 - 0\" (8 points)\n- Row index 19: Score \"4 - 3\" (1 point)\n- Row index 20: Score \"6 - 4\" (2 points)\n\nThe April 22 game with a score of \"10 - 1\" against the rangers indeed has the largest margin of defeat for any game in April, confirming it as the worst loss by more than any other listed.\n\nSince the opponent on April 22 was not the orioles but the rangers, the claim is factually incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells are related to verifying date, opponent, score, and comparing margins of defeat for all games in April.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
