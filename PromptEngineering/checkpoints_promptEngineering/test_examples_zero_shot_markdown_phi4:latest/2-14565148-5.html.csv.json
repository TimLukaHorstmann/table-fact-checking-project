Let's break down the relevant conditions:\n\n1. **Year greater than 1961:** We are looking at records from years after 1961.\n2. **Ed Byhre as the Coach:** The coach listed must be Ed Byhre.\n3. **Last Record:** It should be the last such record in the table.\n\nNow, let's examine each row:\n\n- **1953, 1959, 1961 (Paul S McBrae):** These are before or up to 1961, so they are not relevant for our claim.\n  \n- **1965 (James E Baechtold):** This is after 1961 but not coached by Ed Byhre.\n\n- **1972 (Guy R Strong):** This is after 1961 but not coached by Ed Byhre.\n\n- **1979 (Ed Byhre):** This fits all conditions: the year is after 1961, and Ed Byhre is the coach. Additionally, this is the last entry for the Ohio Valley conference in the table.\n\nThus, Ed Byhre was indeed the coach of the last Ohio Valley conference record after 1961. The relevant cells to verify this are from the row with the year 1979:\n\n- **Year:** \"year\" column at row index 5\n- **Coach:** \"coach\" column at row index 5\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"coach\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
