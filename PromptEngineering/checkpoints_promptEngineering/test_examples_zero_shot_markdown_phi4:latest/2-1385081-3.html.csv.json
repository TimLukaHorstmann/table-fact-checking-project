    "resp": "To determine if the claim about Cho Jae-jin's total goals is true or false based on the given table, we need to assess the data in each row where a goal count is specified and sum these values.\n\nHere's how we will approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are interested in the \"score\" column since it shows the number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in each match listed.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Goals**:\n   - 25 September 2003: 1 goal\n   - 24 October 2003: 1 goal\n   - 19 December 2004: 1 goal\n   - 1 February 2006: 1 goal\n   - 26 May 2006: 1 goal\n   - 6 September 2006: 2 goals\n   - 11 October 2006: 1 goal\n   - 5 July 2007: 2 goals\n\n3. **Sum the Goals**: \n   \\[\n   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states that Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 15 goals in the matches shown. Our calculation shows he scored 10 goals.\n\n5. **Determine Result**:\n   - Since the calculated total (10) does not match the claimed total (15), the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells are those from which we derived the goal counts in the \"score\" column for each row where a score was mentioned.\n\nLet's construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
