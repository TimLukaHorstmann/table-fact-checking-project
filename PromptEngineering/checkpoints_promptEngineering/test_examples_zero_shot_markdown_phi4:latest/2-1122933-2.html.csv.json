However, since Marc Surer completed 65 laps and Thierry Boutsen only completed 54, Thierry could not have finished immediately after him.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Thierry Boutsen finish the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix right after Marc Surer\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are those indicating the number of laps completed by both drivers. These correspond to:\n\n- Thierry Boutsen: Row index 11, Column \"laps\"\n- Marc Surer: Row index 9, Column \"laps\"\n\nHere's the JSON response with the determined result and the relevant cell information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
