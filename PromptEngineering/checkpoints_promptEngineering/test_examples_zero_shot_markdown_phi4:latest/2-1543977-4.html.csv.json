Not relevant to Cape Town.\n- **Row 1 (Year 1998):** Location is Auckland, New Zealand. Not relevant to Cape Town.\n- **Row 2 (Year 1997):** Location is Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA. Not relevant to Cape Town.\n- **Row 3 (Year 1996):** Location is Cape Town, South Africa. This matches the year in question for Cape Town.\n- **Rows 4, 5, and 6 (Years 1995, 1994, and 1993):** Locations are Shenzhen, China; Dorado, Puerto Rico; Orlando, Florida, USA respectively. None of these rows list Cape Town.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCape Town is listed as a location only in the year 1996, with no previous occurrences in earlier years within this dataset.
