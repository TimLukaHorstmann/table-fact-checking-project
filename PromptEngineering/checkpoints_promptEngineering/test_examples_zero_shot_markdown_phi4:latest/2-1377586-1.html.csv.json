    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to verify if two players from Australia have played as a nightwatchman in the given data.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The term \"nightwatchman\" in cricket refers to a lower-order batsman who is sent to bat higher up the order, often during the final session of the day's play, with the purpose of protecting more skilled batsmen.\n   - The claim states that there are 2 players from Australia who have been nightwatchmen. \n\n2. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - We need to look for records where Australian players have scored notably high scores as a lower-order batsman since this might indicate they were acting in the capacity of a nightwatchman.\n   - Notably high individual scores or \"not out\" performances can be an indicator, though it is not definitive proof without additional context (like match conditions).\n\n3. **Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - The column \"team\" will help identify players from Australia.\n   - The column \"score\" can give us insights into the performance of these players.\n\n4. **Identifying Australian Players in the Table:**\n   - Row 1: Tony Mann, team = australia, score = 105\n   - Row 5: Jason Gillespie, team = australia, score = 201 not out\n\n5. **Evaluating if They Played as Nightwatchman:**\n   - Both players are from Australia.\n   - High scores in their performances suggest they might have been batting at a lower order to protect more skilled batsmen.\n   - While the table does not explicitly mention \"nightwatchman,\" high-scoring innings by lower-order batsmen is often associated with this role.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the given information and typical cricket roles, it's reasonable to conclude that both Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie could have been playing as nightwatchmen.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"2 players in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from Australia\" is supported by the data.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"2 players in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from Pakistan,\" we need to consider what a nightwatchman is and how it relates to the given table.\n\n1. **Understanding Nightwatchman**: In cricket, a nightwatchman is typically a lower-order batsman who comes in to bat at a crucial stage of the innings, often late on an evening or just before stumps are drawn. The primary role is not necessarily to score high runs but to protect more skilled batsmen from tough bowling conditions and help them avoid injury.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**: We need to focus on players associated with Pakistan and see if any of their performances could imply they served as a nightwatchman. Specifically, we should look at:\n   - The player's name.\n   - Their team (which must be Pakistan).\n   - The context of their score (though high scores are less typical for a nightwatchman).\n\n3. **Checking the Table**:\n\n   - Row 0: \n     - Player: nasim - ul - ghani\n     - Team: pakistan\n     - Score: 101\n     - Year: 1962\n\n   This row indicates that Nasim-ul-Ghani, playing for Pakistan, scored 101 runs. While this is a high score and not typical for a nightwatchman's role, the table does not provide context on when he batted (e.g., late in the innings). However, historically, Nasim-ul-Ghani is known to have played as a nightwatchman.\n\n   - No other rows involve players from Pakistan.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on historical knowledge and the information provided, only one player from Pakistan (Nasim-ul-Ghani) is mentioned in the table, and he is known for playing as a nightwatchman.
