The match involving Hawthorn occurred on August 28, 1971.\n2. Hawthorn scored 18.16 during that match.\n3. The venue for this match was Glenferrie Oval.\n\nLet's examine the relevant cells in the table to check these conditions:\n\n- **Date Verification**: \n  - We need to find a row where \"hawthorn\" is listed as the home team and ensure the date matches August 28, 1971.\n  - In row 0, the \"home team\" column shows \"hawthorn,\" and the \"date\" column confirms \"28 august 1971.\"\n\n- **Score Verification**:\n  - We need to check that Hawthorn's score in this match was 18.16.\n  - In row 0, the \"home team score\" column shows \"18.16 (124),\" which confirms the score as 18.16.\n\n- **Venue Verification**:\n  - We need to ensure the venue for this match was Glenferrie Oval.\n  - In row 0, the \"venue\" column indicates \"glenferrie oval.\"\n\nAll three conditions are satisfied by row 0 of the table:\n\n1. Date: \"28 august 1971\"\n2. Home team score: \"18.16 (124)\"\n3.
