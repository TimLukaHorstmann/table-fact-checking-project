All dates in the table for the 1964 VFL season take place on \"22 August 1964\".\n2. The lowest crowd was 14,151 at the venue \"junction oval\".\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n#### Condition 1: Check all dates\n- We need to check each row's date column to ensure they are all \"22 August 1964\".\n- Relevant cells for this condition:\n  - Row 0, Column \"date\"\n  - Row 1, Column \"date\"\n  - Row 2, Column \"date\"\n  - Row 3, Column \"date\"\n  - Row 4, Column \"date\"\n  - Row 5, Column \"date\"\n\n#### Condition 2: Lowest crowd and venue\n- Identify the row with the lowest crowd number (14,151) and check its venue.\n- Relevant cells for this condition:\n  - Row 5, Column \"crowd\" (since it has the lowest value of 14,151)\n  - Row 5, Column \"venue\" (to verify if it matches \"junction oval\")\n\n### Verification Results\n\n1. **Date Check:**\n   - All rows have the date \"22 August 1964\". This condition is satisfied.\n\n2. **Lowest Crowd and Venue Check:**\n   - The lowest crowd number is indeed 14,151 at row index 5.\n   - However, the venue for this row is \"brunswick street oval\", not \"junction oval\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while all dates are correct, the lowest crowd was not at \"junction oval\" but at \"brunswick street oval\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
