This column indicates how many wins and losses the team accumulated up until that particular game. We'll track changes in wins when Cleveland is the home team (meaning they won) or the visitor (indicating a loss).\n\nHere's a breakdown of each match in March:\n\n1. **March 1**: Visitor: Cleveland, Loss, Record before: N/A, Record after: 33 - 25\n2. **March 3**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 33 - 25, Record after: 34 - 25 (Win)\n3. **March 5**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 34 - 25, Record after: 35 - 25 (Win)\n4. **March 7**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 35 - 25, Record after: 36 - 25 (Win)\n5. **March 10**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 36 - 25, Record after: 37 - 25 (Win)\n6. **March 11**: Visitor: Cleveland, Loss, Record before: 37 - 25, Record after: 38 - 25\n7. **March 13**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 38 - 25, Record after: 39 - 25 (Win)\n8. **March 14**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 39 - 25, Record after: 40 - 25 (Win)\n9. **March 17**: Visitor: Cleveland, Loss, Record before: 40 - 25, Record after: 41 - 25\n10. **March 20**: Home: Cleveland, Loss, Record before: 41 - 25, Record after: 41 - 26\n11. **March 21**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 41 - 26, Record after: 41 - 27 (Win)\n12. **March 23**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 41 - 27, Record after: 42 - 27 (Win)\n13. **March 25**: Home: Cleveland, Loss, Record before: 42 - 27, Record after: 42 - 28\n14. **March 27**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 42 - 28, Record after: 43 - 28 (Win)\n15. **March 28**: Visitor: Cleveland, Loss, Record before: 43 - 28, Record after: 43 - 29\n16. **March 31**: Home: Cleveland, Win, Record before: 43 - 29, Record after: 44 - 29 (Win)\n\nNow, count the number of wins and losses for Cleveland in March:\n\n- Wins: Games 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 21, 23, 27, and 31.\n- Losses: Games 1, 6, 9, 11, and 15.\n\nThis results in:\n- Total Wins = 10\n- Total Losses = 5\n\nThe claim states that Cleveland went 11 - 4 (11 wins and 4 losses).
