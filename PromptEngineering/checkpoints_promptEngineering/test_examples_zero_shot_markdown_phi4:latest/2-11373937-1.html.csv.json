The livery associated with locomotive BL27.\n\nLet's examine each step:\n\n- **Locomotive Name**: According to the claim, we are interested in locomotive \"BL27.\"\n  \n- **Serial Number Verification**: We check the second column under the header \"serial no\" for the row corresponding to BL27. The table shows:\n  - Row: BL27\n  - Serial No: 83 - 1011\n\nThis matches the serial number specified in the claim.\n\n- **Livery Verification**: Next, we look at the \"livery\" column for the same row (BL27). The table indicates:\n  - Livery: Pacific National Blue & Yellow\n\nThe livery mentioned here is exactly what the claim states.\n\nSince both the serial number and livery match the details provided in the claim, we conclude that the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- The cell containing the locomotive name BL27 is not necessary to verify because it's clear from context.\n- Serial No (83 - 1011) at row index 1, column \"serial no.\"\n- Livery (\"Pacific National Blue & Yellow\") at row index 1, column \"livery.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"serial no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"livery\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
