    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"England competed against both Scotland and Ireland two times in 1988,\" we need to evaluate the relevant entries from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving England:**\n   - We must find rows where the 'opposing teams' are either \"scotland\" or \"ireland.\"\n\n2. **Check Frequency of Matches Against Each Team:**\n   - Count how many times \"scotland\" appears in the 'opposing teams' column.\n   - Count how many times \"ireland\" appears in the 'opposing teams' column.\n\n3. **Verify Dates:**\n   - Ensure that all matches occurred in 1988, as per the dates provided.\n\n**Relevant Rows and Columns from the Table:**\n\n- **Scotland:**\n  - Row index 2: \n    - opposing teams: \"scotland\"\n    - date: \"05 / 03 / 1988\"\n\n- **Ireland:**\n  - Row index 3:\n    - opposing teams: \"ireland\"\n    - date: \"19 / 03 / 1988\"\n  - Row index 4:\n    - opposing teams: \"ireland\"\n    - date: \"23 / 04 / 1988\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- England competed against Scotland once in 1988 (Row index 2).\n- England competed against Ireland twice in 1988 (Rows indices 3 and 4).\n\nThe claim states that England competed against both teams two times. However, the table shows only one match against Scotland.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nFor \"scotland\":\n- Row index 2, column 'opposing teams'\n- Row index 2, column 'date'\n\nFor \"ireland\":\n- Row index 3, column 'opposing teams'\n- Row index 3, column 'date'\n- Row index 4, column 'opposing teams'\n- Row index 4, column 'date'\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
