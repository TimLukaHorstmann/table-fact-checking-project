Identify all rows relevant to either Tim Coleman or Ben Lock:\n   - Look for entries involving \"tim coleman\" (row index 2).\n   - Look for entries involving \"ben lock\" (row index 6).\n\n2. Check if there is any overlap between these two fighters in terms of a match against each other within the specified year, i.e., 2006:\n   - Tim Coleman's fight occurred on 2006-06-15.\n   - Ben Lock's fight occurred on 2005-11-26.\n\n3. Verify whether they fought each other:\n   - The opponent in Tim Coleman's row is \"tim coleman.\"\n   - The opponent in Ben Lock's row is \"ben lock.\"\n   - Since these opponents do not match, there was no fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006 or any other year mentioned in the table.\n\nGiven that they did not fight each other during the specified year (or at all), the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE,\" and the relevant cells are those containing details of the fights involving Tim Coleman and Ben Lock.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Muhsin Corbbrey fought in four fights that lasted more than five rounds between 2006 and 2009,\" we need to analyze the relevant columns from the provided table: \"date\", \"round\", and possibly \"result\" for completeness of data.\n\nHere's how we can determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. **Date Range**: The claim specifies fights that took place between 2006 and 2009. We will check each row to ensure the date falls within this range.\n\n2. **Number of Rounds**: The claim specifies fights lasting more than five rounds, so we are looking for rows where the \"round\" column is greater than 5.\n\n3. **Count**: The claim states there were four such fights, so we need exactly four rows meeting both conditions above.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (2009 - 02 - 28)**: Round = 6\n- **Row 2 (2006 - 09 - 15)**: Round = 4\n- **Row 3 (2006 - 06 - 15)**: Round = 6\n- **Row 4 (2006 - 04 - 21)**: Round = 1\n- **Row 5 (2006 - 03 - 09)**: Round = 4\n- **Row 6 (2006 - 01 - 26)**: Round = 4\n- **Row 7 (2005 - 11 - 26)**: Round = 4 (outside date range)\n- **Row 8 (2005 - 04 - 26)**: Round = 4 (outside date range)\n- **Row 9 (2005 - 04 - 08)**: Round = 4 (outside date range)\n\nFrom the above, only rows 1 and 3 meet both conditions of being between 2006 and 2009 and having more than five rounds. Thus, there are only two fights that satisfy all criteria.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it states there were four such fights, but we found only two.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those containing the date and round information for rows 1 and 3:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
