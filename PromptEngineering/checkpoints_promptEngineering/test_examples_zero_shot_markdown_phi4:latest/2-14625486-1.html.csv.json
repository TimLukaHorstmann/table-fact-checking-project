Locate Marcus Marshall in the table:\n   - He is found in the row where his name appears, which corresponds to the last entry in the table (row index 19).\n\n2. Identify the \"best\" column for Marcus Marshall:\n   - The claim specifies a value related to the \"best\" time.\n   - In the table, the \"best\" column contains the best times achieved by each driver.\n\n3. Check the value in the \"best\" column for Marcus Marshall:\n   - For Marcus Marshall, the \"best\" column shows 59.2 (row index 19).\n\n4. Validate the claim against the table:\n   - The claim states that Marcus Marshall's best time is 59.2.\n   - The table confirms this value as it matches exactly.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"best\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The best time for the team must be less than 57.\n\nLet's examine each driver associated with the \"rocketsports\" team in the table:\n\n- **Timo Glock**:\n  - Team: rocketsports racing\n  - Qual 2 Time: 58.385 (satisfies condition 1)\n  - Best Time: 58.385 (does not satisfy condition 2)\n\n- **Ryan Hunter-Reay**:\n  - Team: rocketsports racing\n  - Qual 2 Time: 58.693 (satisfies condition 1)\n  - Best Time: 58.693 (does not satisfy condition 2)\n\nNo driver from the \"rocketsports\" team meets both conditions simultaneously. The best times for both drivers are greater than 57, meaning they do not fulfill the second condition.\n\nNow, let's ensure no other teams meet these criteria:\n- Check each row in the table to see if any driver has a Qual 2 time of 58 and a Best time less than 57.\n- Only Paul Tracy (Forsythe Racing), Cristiano da Matta (PKV Racing), S\u00e9bastien Bourdais (Newman/Haas Racing), Andrew Ranger (MI-Jack Conquest Racing), Alex Tagliani (Team Australia), Oriol Servi\u00e0 (Newman/Haas Racing) have Best times less than 57.
