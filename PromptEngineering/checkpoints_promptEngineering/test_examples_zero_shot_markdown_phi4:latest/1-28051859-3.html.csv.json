    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine the relevant information in the table. The claim states: \"the team with the most recent tenure be the coventry comet, end in 1990.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We are concerned with the `tenure` column as it specifies the time range during which each school's team operated.\n   - Specifically, we need to find the team with the latest ending year (most recent tenure).\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry in the Tenure Column**:\n\n   - Barberton Magics: 2005 - 2011\n   - Coventry Comets: 1969 - 1983\n   - Field Falcons: 1978 - 1990\n   - Hudson Explorers: 1949 - 1997\n   - Manchester Panthers: 1949 - 1976\n   - Mogadore Wildcats: 1958 - 1968\n   - Norton Panthers: 1972 - 2005\n   - Twinsburg Tigers: 1958 - 1964\n\n3. **Determine the Most Recent Tenure**:\n   - The team with the most recent ending year is Barberton Magics, which ended in 2011.\n   - Coventry Comets ended in 1983.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Coventry Comet has the most recent tenure and ends in 1990.\n   - This is incorrect because Coventry Comet's tenure ended in 1983, not 1990, and it is not the team with the most recent tenure (Barberton Magics ended in 2011).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For the team \"Coventry Comets\", the relevant cell for tenure is at row index 1, column name \"tenure\".\n   - For the team with the most recent tenure \"Barberton Magics\", the relevant cell is at row index 0, column name \"tenure\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tenure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tenure\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
