    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the New Orleans Saints game and its associated attendance record, we need to evaluate the specific conditions stated in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim consists of two parts:\n1. The attendance for the New Orleans Saints game was 66,189.\n2. The team's record at that time was 6-1.\n\nLet's break down each condition and match them with relevant information from the table:\n\n1. **Attendance Verification:**\n   - We need to locate the row where \"opponent\" is \"new orleans saints.\"\n   - According to the table, this occurs in week 7.\n   - The attendance for that game listed under the column \"attendance\" is indeed 66,189.\n\n2. **Record Verification:**\n   - Again, using week 7 from the table:\n   - The \"record\" for the team after this game is shown as 6-1.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data in row 7 of the table. Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the information provided.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells for this verification:\n\n- The attendance number (66,189) found at row index 7 under the \"attendance\" column.\n- The record (6-1) found at row index 7 under the \"record\" column.\n\nGiven these findings, we conclude that the claim is true. Here's the JSON object representing our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"66084 crowd attend the indianapolis colt game on december 30 , 2001\", we need to verify two specific conditions from the provided table: \n\n1. The opponent was indeed the \"indianapolis colts\".\n2. The attendance for that particular game was \"66084\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the markdown table:\n\n- The row with week number 16 corresponds to December 30, 2001.\n- In this row:\n  - The \"opponent\" column lists \"indianapolis colts\", which matches part of our claim.\n  - The \"attendance\" column shows \"66084\", which exactly matches the claimed attendance figure.\n\nSince both conditions from the claim align perfectly with the data in row 16, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE. \n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for this verification:\n\n- For confirming the opponent: \n  - Row index: 16\n  - Column name: \"opponent\"\n\n- For confirming the attendance:\n  - Row index: 16\n  - Column name: \"attendance\"\n\nThus, we have verified that both conditions necessary to support the claim are met.

Therefore, an attendance of 66189 does not apply here.\n\n- **Record after Week 7**: After week 7, the record listed in the table is `6 - 1`.\n\nThe claim states that \"66189 crowd attend the game with a record of 6 - 1 on week 8.\" The record part of this statement is correct for week 7, but the attendance figure does not apply to week 8 since it is marked as `nan`.
