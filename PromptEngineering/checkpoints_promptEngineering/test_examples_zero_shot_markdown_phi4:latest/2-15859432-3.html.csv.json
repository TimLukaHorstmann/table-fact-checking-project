    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gilberto godoy filho be 192 inch tall\" is true or false, we need to verify two main points based on the information provided in the table:\n\n1. **Check the identity**: Ensure that the row corresponds to the player named \"gilberto godoy filho\".\n2. **Verify the height**: Confirm whether the height for this player is 192 inches.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions step-by-step using the given markdown table:\n\n- The table lists various volleyball players with their attributes including name, date of birth, height, weight, spike, and block.\n  \n- Locate the row where \"name\" is \"gilberto godoy filho\". From the table:\n  - This player appears in the fourth row (keeping in mind that markdown tables are often read starting from index 0 for programming purposes).\n  \n- Check the \"height\" value in this row:\n  - The height listed under gilberto godoy filho is indeed 192.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied: \n- The player's name matches \"gilberto godoy filho\".\n- The height is correctly stated as 192 inches.\n\nTherefore, based on the evaluation, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nNow, let's format this conclusion into a JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON reflects that the claim is true and indicates which cells were relevant for verifying it.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gilberto godoy filho is taller than andr\u00e9 nascimento\" is true or false, we need to compare their heights as specified in the table. Here\u2019s how we do it:\n\n1. **Locate Gilberto Godoy Filho's Height**:\n   - Find the row for \"gilberto godoy filho\".\n   - Check the \"height\" column for this row.\n\n2. **Locate Andr\u00e9 Nascimento's Height**:\n   - Find the row for \"andr\u00e9 nascimento\".\n   - Check the \"height\" column for this row.\n\n3. **Compare Their Heights**:\n   - Compare the height values from both rows to verify if Gilberto Godoy Filho is indeed taller than Andr\u00e9 Nascimento.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Gilberto Godoy Filho**: \n  - Row index: 3\n  - Height: 192 cm\n\n- **Andr\u00e9 Nascimento**:\n  - Row index: 4\n  - Height: 195 cm\n\nBy comparing these heights, we find that Gilberto Godoy Filho's height (192 cm) is less than Andr\u00e9 Nascimento's height (195 cm). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let\u2019s list the relevant cells to verify this conclusion:\n\n- \"gilberto godoy filho\" in the \"height\" column at row index 3.\n- \"andr\u00e9 nascimento\" in the \"height\" column at row index 4.\n\nThe JSON object with our findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
