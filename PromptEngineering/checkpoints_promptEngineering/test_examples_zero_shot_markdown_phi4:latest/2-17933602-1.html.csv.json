    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the conditions in the claim and verify each part against the table.\n\n**Claim:** \"club belenenses, benfica and sporting cp be 3 of 4 place with lisbon as the city.\"\n\n1. **Identify Clubs Mentioned:**\n   - Belenenses\n   - Benfica\n   - Sporting CP\n\n2. **Check City for Each Club:**\n\n   From the table:\n\n   - **Belenenses**: \n     - Row Index: 1\n     - Column \"city\": Lisbon\n   \n   - **Benfica**:\n     - Row Index: 2\n     - Column \"city\": Lisbon\n\n   - **Sporting CP**:\n     - Row Index: 15\n     - Column \"city\": Lisbon\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n\n   The claim states that these three clubs are among four clubs with Lisbon as their city. We need to check if there is a fourth club listed in the table with Lisbon as its city.\n\n   From the table, we identify:\n\n   - Belenenses (Row 1) has Lisbon as the city.\n   - Benfica (Row 2) has Lisbon as the city.\n   - Sporting CP (Row 15) has Lisbon as the city.\n   \n   We need to check for any other clubs with Lisbon as their city:\n\n   - **Sporting CP** is listed again in Row 15.\n   - No other club besides Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP is associated with Lisbon.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Only three clubs (Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP) are listed as being from Lisbon, not four. Therefore, the claim that they are \"3 of 4\" is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- Belenenses city: Row Index 1, Column \"city\"\n- Benfica city: Row Index 2, Column \"city\"\n- Sporting CP city: Row Index 15, Column \"city\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"city\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
