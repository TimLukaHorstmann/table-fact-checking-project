    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down and analyze each part of the claim against the given table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **\"Hydraulics,\"** - We need to find entries in the \"time / retired\" column that mention \"hydraulics.\"\n2. **\"drive by Damon Hill,\"** - Check if Damon Hill, found in the \"driver\" column, is associated with any of these hydraulics-related entries.\n3. **\"have a grid number bigger than 1,\"** - Finally, verify if the corresponding entry for Damon Hill has a \"grid\" value greater than 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Entries Mentioning Hydraulics:**\n   - Damon Hill's row: \"damon hill | jordan - mugen - honda | 19 | hydraulics | 7\"\n     - This entry mentions \"hydraulics.\"\n   - Ricardo Rosset's row: \"ricardo rosset | tyrrell - ford | 16 | hydraulics | 18\"\n     - Another entry mentioning \"hydraulics.\"\n\n2. **Check Damon Hill's Entry:**\n   - Damon Hill is associated with the hydraulics issue as indicated by his entry.\n   - His grid number, found in the column labeled \"grid,\" is 7.\n\n3. **Verify Grid Number Condition:**\n   - Damon Hill's grid number (7) is indeed greater than 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- All parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from Damon Hill\u2019s row, specifically focusing on \"driver,\" \"time / retired,\" and \"grid.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
