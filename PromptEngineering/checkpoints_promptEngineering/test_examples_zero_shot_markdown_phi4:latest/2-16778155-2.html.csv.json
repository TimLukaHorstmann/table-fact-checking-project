This match should occur in week 10.\n\nLet's examine these conditions one by one using the data from the table:\n\n- **Condition 1: Attendance = 62,170**\n\n  We need to find a row where the attendance is exactly 62,170. From the table, this value appears in row index 10 (as we start counting from 0).\n\n- **Condition 2: Opponent = \"dallas cowboys\"**\n\n  In the same row where the attendance is 62,170 (row index 10), we check the opponent column. The opponent listed is indeed \"dallas cowboys\".\n\n- **Condition 3: Week = 10**\n\n  Finally, in row index 10, the week number is 11.\n\nThe claim states that when the attendance is 62,170, the opponent should be \"dallas cowboys\" for week 10. However, while conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied, condition 3 is not met because the match occurred during week 11, not week 10.\n\nSince all conditions must be true for the claim to be considered TRUE, but one of them (week number) does not hold, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this evaluation include:\n\n- The attendance cell in row index 10.\n- The opponent cell in row index 10.\n- The week cell in row index 10.\n\nHere's the JSON response with these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
