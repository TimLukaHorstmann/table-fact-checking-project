Therefore, the relevant column is \"team champion\".\n\n2. **Find the row for the specified season (year)**: We need to look at the row where the season (or year) is 2008.\n\n3. **Check the cell in that row and column**:\n   - Locate the row with `season` as 2008.\n   - Look at the \"team champion\" column within this row.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The row for the season 2008 has the following data:\n  - Champion: giorgio pantano (racing engineering)\n  - Second: bruno senna (isport international)\n  - Third: lucas di grassi (barwa int campos team)\n  - Team champion: barwa international campos team\n\nThe claim states that \"barwa international campos team\" was the champion in 2008, which matches the data from the table.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Lucas di Grassi placed third in 2008,\" we need to examine the row corresponding to the season 2008 within the provided table and specifically check the column for \"third\" positions.\n\nFirst, let's locate the relevant row:\n- The year 2008 is listed as row index 3 (keeping in mind that markdown tables typically start indexing from 0).\n\nNext, we need to examine the \"third\" position for the season of 2008:\n- In row index 3, under the column named \"third,\" the name listed is \"Lucas di Grassi.\"\n\nThis confirms that Lucas di Grassi indeed placed third in the year 2008.\n\nGiven this information, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table data, we need to analyze it step-by-step:\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\nThe claim states: \"the highest season with barwa international campos team as champion be 2010.\"\n\n1. **Understanding \"highest season\"**: The term \"highest season\" is ambiguous in this context. It could refer to either:\n   - Chronologically the latest year.\n   - A specific metric like points or ranking, but since such metrics are not provided in the table, we'll assume it refers to the most recent year.\n\n2. **Determine when \"barwa international campos team\" was champion**:\n   - Look at the column \"team champion\" for each row to find instances of \"barwa international campos team.\"\n\n### Table Analysis\n\n- **Row 2008**: The table shows \"barwa international campos team\" as the champion in this year.\n\nThere is no mention of \"barwa international campos team\" being champions in any other seasons. \n\n- **Year 2010**: There is no entry for \"barwa international campos team\"; instead, it lists \"rapax\" as the champion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim suggests that the highest season (latest year) when \"barwa international campos team\" was a champion should be 2010. However, based on the table data:\n- The latest year they were champions is actually **2008**.\n- In 2010, it wasn't them but another team (\"rapax\").\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information are in row 2008 under \"team champion.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
