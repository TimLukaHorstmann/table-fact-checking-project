The table is organized with models listed under the first column. By scanning through these entries:\n\n- We see that \"17.250e\" appears as a model in one of the rows.\n  \nNext, identify the relevant column for the claim. Since the claim concerns \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\", we need to check this particular column. The table shows the columns in this order: \n\n1. model\n2. engine make / capacity\n3. power kw rpm\n4. torque nm rpm\n5. gvm (kg) technical capacity\n6. gcm (kg) technical capacity\n\nNow, verify the data:\n\n- For \"17.250e\", we locate it in the table:\n  - The row index for \"17.250e\" is 10.\n  \n- Then, check its value under the \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\" column:\n  - At this position (row index 10), the gcm (kg) technical capacity indeed shows as 35000.\n\nThis confirms that the claim is true since the gcm (kg) technical capacity for model \"17.250e\" is precisely 35000 kg, matching the statement in the claim.\n\nThus, we construct a JSON response to reflect this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gcm (kg) technical capacity\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
