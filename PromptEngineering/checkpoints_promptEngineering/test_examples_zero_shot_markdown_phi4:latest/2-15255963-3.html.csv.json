    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must verify each part of the statement against the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The claim states \"on march 13 1990\". We need to check if there's a row with the date \"13 March 1990\".\n\n2. **Opponent Verification**: It claims that the match is \"against dundee\". This means we need to find a row where the opponent is listed as \"dundee\".\n\n3. **Result Verification**: The claim mentions the result should be \"3 - 1\". We need to confirm if there's a row with this exact result.\n\nNow, let's verify each part against the table:\n\n- For the date \"13 March 1990\":\n  - Row index 2 has the date \"13 March 1990\".\n\n- For the opponent \"dundee\":\n  - In row index 2, the opponent is listed as \"dundee\".\n\n- For the result \"3 - 1\":\n  - In row index 2, the result is recorded as \"3 - 1\".\n\nAll parts of the claim are verified against the table:\n\n- The date matches.\n- The opponent matches.\n- The result matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. We can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We will systematically examine each row in the table for these specific conditions.\n\nHere are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The columns relevant to our claim are \"opponent\", \"result\".\n\n2. **Scan Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Date: 26 January 1990\n     - Opponent: East Fife\n     - Result: 1 - 1\n     - Conclusion: Not the opponent we're looking for.\n   \n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Date: 29 January 1990\n     - Opponent: East Fife\n     - Result: 2 - 1\n     - Conclusion: Again, not the opponent we're interested in.\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Date: 23 February 1990\n     - Opponent: Airdrieonians\n     - Result: 2 - 0\n     - Conclusion: The opponent is different; continue to next row.\n   \n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Date: 13 March 1990\n     - Opponent: Dundee\n     - Result: 3 - 1\n     - Conclusion: We have the correct opponent, but the result does not match \"3 - 4\".\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Date: 6 April 1991\n     - Opponent: St Johnstone\n     - Result: 0 - 0\n     - Conclusion: The opponent doesn't match.\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Date: 18 May 1991\n     - Opponent: Motherwell\n     - Result: 3 - 4\n     - Conclusion: The result matches, but the opponent is different.\n\nUpon reviewing all rows, no entry has \"Dundee\" as the opponent with a match of the result \"3 - 4\".
