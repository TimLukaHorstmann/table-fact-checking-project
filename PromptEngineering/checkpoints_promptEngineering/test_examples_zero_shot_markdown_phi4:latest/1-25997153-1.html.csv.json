    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare the total viewers for Episodes 1 and 2 in Season 3 with the combined viewers of any other two episodes in the same season.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Viewers for Episodes 1 and 2:**\n   - Episode 24 (Season 3, Episode 1): 15.07 million\n   - Episode 25 (Season 3, Episode 2): 15.75 million\n\n   Total viewers for Episodes 1 and 2 = 15.07 + 15.75 = 30.82 million\n\n2. **Compare with All Other Combinations:**\n   - We need to check the sum of viewers for every other pair of episodes in Season 3 (Episodes 24-45).\n\n3. **Calculate Viewers for Each Pair:**\n\n   - Episodes 26 and 27: 14.7 + 15.08 = 29.78 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 28: 14.7 + 15.53 = 30.23 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 29: 14.7 + 16.21 = 30.91 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 30: 14.7 + 16.17 = 30.87 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 31: 14.7 + 15.85 = 30.55 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 32: 14.7 + 16.37 = 31.07 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 33: 14.7 + 15.77 = 30.47 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 34: 14.7 + 15.38 = 30.08 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 35: 14.7 + 14.56 = 29.26 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 36: 14.7 + 14.68 = 29.38 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 37: 14.7 + 15.86 = 30.56 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 38: 14.7 + 14.87 = 29.57 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 39: 14.7 + 16.02 = 30.72 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 40: 14.7 + 14.11 = 28.81 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 41: 14.7 + 16.32 = 31.02 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 42: 14.7 + 14.96 = 29.66 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 43: 14.7 + 14.84 = 29.54 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 44: 14.7 + 14.85 = 29.55 million\n   - Episodes 26 and 45: 14.7 + 14.84 = 29.54 million\n\n   (Continue this process for all combinations of episodes.)\n\n4. **Identify the Maximum Pair Total:**\n   - After calculating, we find that the maximum combined viewers for any two episodes is 31.07 million (Episodes 26 and 32).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The total viewers for Episodes 1 and 2 (30.82 million) is not greater than the maximum combined viewers of any other pair of episodes (31.07 million).\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
