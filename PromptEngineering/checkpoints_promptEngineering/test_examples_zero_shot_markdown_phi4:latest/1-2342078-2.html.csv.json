    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine whether Oscar Rudolph directed 10 of the last 24 episodes in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Last 24 Episodes:**\n   - The table has a total of 24 rows (episodes), so all episodes listed are part of these last 24.\n   \n2. **Check the Director for Each Episode:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"directed by\" column and count how many times Oscar Rudolph is mentioned.\n\n3. **Count Episodes Directed by Oscar Rudolph:**\n\n   Let's examine each row:\n\n   - Row 8 (Episode 8): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 10 (Episode 10): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 11 (Episode 11): Directed by David Alexander\n   - Row 12 (Episode 12): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 13 (Episode 13): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 14 (Episode 14): Directed by George Cahan\n   - Row 15 (Episode 15): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 16 (Episode 16): Directed by David Alexander\n   - Row 17 (Episode 17): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 18 (Episode 18): Directed by Herb Wallerstein\n   - Row 19 (Episode 19): Directed by Russ Mayberry\n   - Row 20 (Episode 20): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 21 (Episode 21): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 22 (Episode 22): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Row 23 (Episode 23): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n\n4. **Count the Occurrences:**\n   - Oscar Rudolph directed episodes: 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, and 23.\n   - Total = 10 episodes.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Oscar Rudolph directed \"10 of the last 24\" episodes.
