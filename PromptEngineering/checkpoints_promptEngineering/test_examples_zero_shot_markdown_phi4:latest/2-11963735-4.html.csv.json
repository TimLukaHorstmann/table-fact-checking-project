We need to find rows where this column is labeled \"nuggets\".\n\n- **Score**: For each identified home game, we look at the \"score\" column to determine how many points the Nuggets scored.\n\nNow, let's extract the relevant data:\n\n1. **6 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Mavericks\n   - Score: 122 - 109 (Nuggets scored 122)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n2. **8 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Kings\n   - Score: 97 - 101 (Nuggets scored 101)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n3. **12 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Hornets\n   - Score: 99 - 105 (Nuggets scored 105)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n4. **15 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Spurs\n   - Score: 91 - 102 (Nuggets scored 102)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n5. **16 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Trail Blazers\n   - Score: 116 - 105 (Nuggets scored 116)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n6. **20 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Rockets\n   - Score: 111 - 112 (Nuggets scored 112)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n7. **21 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Trail Blazers\n   - Score: 96 - 99 (Nuggets scored 96)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n8. **23 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Kings\n   - Score: 106 - 105 (Nuggets scored 106)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n9. **26 December 2007**:\n   - Visitor: Bucks\n   - Score: 105 - 125 (Nuggets scored 125)\n   - Home: Nuggets\n\n10. **28 December 2007**:\n    - Visitor: Warriors\n    - Score: 124 - 120 (Nuggets scored 124)\n    - Home: Nuggets\n\n11. **30 December 2007**:\n    - Visitor: Warriors\n    - Score: 105 - 95 (Nuggets scored 95)\n    - Home: Nuggets\n\nFrom this data, the highest score by the Nuggets in a home game was 125 points against the Bucks on 26 December 2007.

This score was their highest home total in December 2007.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1. **Check the specific game score:**\n   - Locate the row for December 20, 2007:\n     - Row index: 8\n     - Home team: Nuggets\n     - Visitor: Rockets\n     - Score: 111 - 112 (Rockets scored more)\n     - Nuggets' score: 112\n\n2. **Determine if this was their highest home total in December 2007:**\n   - Compare the Nuggets' scores for all home games in December:\n     - December 6, 2007: Scored 122\n     - December 8, 2007: Scored 101\n     - December 12, 2007: Scored 105\n     - December 20, 2007: Scored 112\n     - December 23, 2007: Scored 106\n     - December 28, 2007: Scored 124\n\n   The highest home score was on December 6, 2007, with 122 points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Nuggets did score 112 points against the Rockets on December 20, but it was not their highest home total in December. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row index 8: Score column (Nuggets' score of 112)\n- Row indices 4, 6, 8, 10, 12: Score columns for all Nuggets' home games to determine if 112 was the highest score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
