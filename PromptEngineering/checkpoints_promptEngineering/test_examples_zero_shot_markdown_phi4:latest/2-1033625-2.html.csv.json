    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the score for March 24, 1982 be 1 - 1\" is true or false, we need to examine the table provided and check if there is a match for the specified date with the corresponding score.\n\nThe relevant columns in the table are \"date,\" \"score,\" and perhaps indirectly, \"result,\" as they contain information about when each game occurred and its respective scores.\n\nWe will go through the entries row by row, focusing on the \"date\" column to find any entry matching \"24 March 1982.\" \n\n1. **Row-by-row examination:**\n\n   - Row 0: Date is \"27 March 1974\", not relevant.\n   - Rows 1-10 have dates ranging from September 1974 to November 1976, none match \"24 March 1982\".\n   - Rows 11-23 continue with dates in December 1976 and April 1977, still irrelevant.\n   - Row 24: Date is \"24 August 1977\", not relevant.\n   - Row 25: Date is \"15 February 1978\", not relevant.\n   - Rows 26-29 have June 1978 matches, none are \"24 March 1982\".\n   - Row 30: Date is \"30 August 1978\", not relevant.\n   - Rows 31-32 cover dates in March and August 1979, still irrelevant.\n   - Row 33: Date is \"17 October 1979\", not relevant.\n   - Rows 34-36 cover November 1980 to May 1981, none are the date of interest.\n   - Row 37: Date is \"17 June 1981\", not relevant.\n   - **Row 38**: The date here is \"24 March 1982\". We check the score: it shows \"5 - 0\", which does not match \"1 - 1\".\n   - Row 39 has a different date, \"21 June 1982\", and thus is irrelevant.\n\nThere is only one entry in the table with the year 1982 on March 24th (or any part of March), and it records a score of \"5 - 0\".
