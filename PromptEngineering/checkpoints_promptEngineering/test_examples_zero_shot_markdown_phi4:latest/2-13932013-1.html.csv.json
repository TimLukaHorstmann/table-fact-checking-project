The task is to count how many quarterbacks have a wins value greater than 30.\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Sipe, Brian - Wins = 57\n2. **Row 1**: Kosar, Bernie - Wins = 53\n3. **Row 2**: Ryan, Frank - Wins = 52\n4. **Row 3**: Graham, Otto - Wins = 57\n5. **Row 6**: Plumb, Milt - Wins = 33\n6. **Row 8**: Anderson, Derek - Wins = 16 (not greater than 30)\n7. **Row 9**: Testaverde, Vinny - Wins = 16 (not greater than 30)\n8. **Rows 10-28**: All these rows have wins values less than or equal to 10.\n\nFrom the above analysis, quarterbacks with more than 30 wins are in rows: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6. This gives us a total of 5 quarterbacks who have won more than 30 games.\n\nThe claim states that there are only 10 such quarterbacks, but we found only 5. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"wins\"\n- Row 1, Column \"wins\"\n- Row 2, Column \"wins\"\n- Row 3, Column \"wins\"\n- Row 6, Column \"wins\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
