    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n1. Check if season 2 aired in January.\n2. Check if season 10 aired in January.\n\nThe relevant column for determining the air date is \"original air date.\"\n\nLet's examine each condition:\n\n### Condition 1: Season 2\n- **Row Index:** 1 (Season 2)\n- **Original Air Date:** November 23, 1996\n\nFrom this information, season 2 aired in November, not January.\n\n### Condition 2: Season 10\n- **Row Index:** 9 (Season 10)\n- **Original Air Date:** January 11, 1997\n\nFor condition 2, season 10 did air in January, specifically on January 11, 1997.\n\nNow let's assess the claim:\n- The claim states that both seasons 2 and 10 aired in January, almost exactly one year apart. However, we found that season 2 aired in November 1996, not January. Therefore, this part of the condition is false.\n- Even if season 10 did air in January 1997, the two seasons are not approximately a year apart due to season 2 airing in November.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim include:\n- The \"original air date\" column for both row index 1 (season 2) and row index 9 (season 10).\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
