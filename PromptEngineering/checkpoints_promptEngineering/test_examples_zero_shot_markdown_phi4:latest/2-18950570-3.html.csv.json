    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The percentage value associated with \"yellow\" is \"1.09%.\"\n2. The value \"0 , 35723\" corresponds to \"yellow.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant parts of the table and check these conditions:\n\n### Table Analysis\n\nThe markdown table has multiple rows for each category, including \"brazil 100%\", \"white\", \"black\", \"yellow\", \"brown (multiracial)\", and \"indians\". Each row appears to represent different data points.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Check the Percentage for Yellow:**\n   - In the first row, under the column labeled with percentages next to each category name, we find:\n     - For \"yellow,\" it is \"1.09%\".\n\n2. **Locate the Value \"0 , 35723\" for Yellow:**\n   - In the fourth row, which contains numerical values (seemingly different data), we look under the column corresponding to \"yellow\":\n     - The value listed is \"0 , 35723\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- \"1.09%\" is indeed the percentage for \"yellow\" in the first row.\n- \"0 , 35723\" is the value associated with \"yellow\" in the fourth row.\n\nThus, the claim is verified as TRUE based on the data provided in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"brazil 100%\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"yellow\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe first cell checks the percentage for \"yellow,\" and the second cell confirms the value \"0 , 35723\" associated with \"yellow.\"",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table and the specifics mentioned in it.\n\nThe claim is: \"1 178 391 be the yellow fertility rate when brazil be 0 , 43407\"\n\nFirst, let's decipher this claim:\n\n- \"1 178 391 be the yellow fertility rate\" implies that 1,178,391 is associated with a fertility rate specifically for the \"yellow\" category.\n- \"when brazil be 0 , 43407\" indicates that this corresponds to a situation where Brazil has a certain figure represented as \"0 , 43407\".\n\nNow, let's break down the table:\n\n1. The first row lists percentages and categories:\n   - Columns include: \"brazil 100%\", \"white\", \"black\", \"yellow\", \"brown (multiracial)\", \"indians\".\n\n2. The second row contains numerical figures:\n   - For \"yellow\": 420,952\n   - For \"brazil 100%\": 45,932,294\n\n3. The third row provides percentage distributions for each category.\n\n4. The fourth row gives updated population or similar figures:\n   - For \"yellow\": 1,178,391 (this matches the claim of 1,178,391)\n   - For \"brazil 100%\": 105,816,285\n\n5. The fifth row contains decimal values, potentially representing fertility rates or another metric.\n   - For \"brazil 100%\": 0 , 43407\n   - For \"yellow\": 0 , 35723\n\nNow let's match the claim components to table data:\n\n- **1 178 391 (Yellow Figure)**: This number appears in the fourth row under the \"yellow\" column, suggesting it might be related to population or another metric.\n  \n- **brazil be 0 , 43407**: The value 0 , 43407 is found in the fifth row under the \"brazil 100%\" column.\n\nThe claim suggests that 1,178,391 is a fertility rate for yellow when Brazil's corresponding figure is 0 , 43407. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- 1,178,391 does not appear to be labeled or described as a fertility rate in any part of the table.\n- The fifth row seems to represent some metric (possibly fertility rates) with decimal values.\n\nGiven these observations, there is no direct evidence from the table that 1,178,391 is explicitly stated or implied to be a \"fertility rate\" for yellow. It merely appears as a figure in the fourth row under the yellow column without context indicating it's a fertility rate.\n\nThus, the claim is not fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"yellow\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"brazil 100%\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yellow\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
