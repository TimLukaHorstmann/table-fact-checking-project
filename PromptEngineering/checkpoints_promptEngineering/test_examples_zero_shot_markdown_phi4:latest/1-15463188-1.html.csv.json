It appears as \"jhofel morales\" (with an 's') at row index 0.\n\n2. **Position**: The claim states that jhofel morale plays \"guard.\" According to the table, at row index 0, the position is indeed listed as \"guard.\"\n\n3. **School/Club Team**: The claim specifies \"far eastern school / club team.\" In the table, for row index 0, the school/team is listed as \"far eastern,\" which matches.\n\n4. **Year (Season)**: The claim refers to the year \"2012.\" For row index 0 in the table, the season is given as 2012.\n\nGiven these checks:\n\n- Name: Partial match due to missing 's' in \"morales.\"\n- Position: Matches exactly.\n- School/Club Team: Matches exactly.\n- Season: Matches exactly.\n\nSince the claim contains a minor typographical error with the name (missing an 's'), but all other aspects match, we consider whether this affects the overall truth of the statement.
