We will focus on the \"time\" and \"attendance\" columns.\n\n**Middle of the Day Games (12:00 pm):**\n- September 11, South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida: Attendance = 90,612\n- September 11, Indiana State vs. Cincinnati: Attendance = 30,807\n- September 11, Texas Southern vs. Connecticut: Attendance = 37,359\n\n**Later in the Afternoon or Evening Games (1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, 7:00 pm):**\n- September 11, New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh: Attendance = 50,120\n- September 11, Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville: Attendance = 51,427\n- September 10, No. 23 West Virginia vs. Marshall: Attendance = 41,382\n- September 11, Syracuse vs. Washington: Attendance = 62,418\n\nNow, let's compare:\n\n1. **South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida (90,612)** is greater than any of the later games.\n2. **Indiana State vs. Cincinnati (30,807)** is less than all later games.\n3. **Texas Southern vs. Connecticut (37,359)** is less than all later games.\n\nFrom this comparison, we see that not all middle-of-the-day games have lower attendance than those played in the afternoon or evening.

From the table, the result for this game is \"l 20 - 41,\" indicating a loss (denoted by 'l') for the home team, Washington.\n\n3. **Attendance**: The claim mentions an attendance of \"62418 fan at home.\" According to the table, the attendance for this game is indeed 62,418.\n\nBased on the verification:\n- The result does not support the claim that Washington won; they lost.\n- The attendance figure matches the claim.\n\nSince the critical part of the claim about the outcome (Washington winning) is false, the overall claim is FALSE.
