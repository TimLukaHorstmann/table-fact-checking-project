This totals eight countries, not six.\n\n### Condition 2: \"These countries tie for 16th place.\"\n\n- We need to verify that the countries identified in condition 1 also tie for 16th place.\n- From the table:\n  - Belarus (Row 16): Total = 1\n  - Bosnia and Herzegovina (Row 17): Total = 1\n  - Bulgaria (Row 18): Total = 1\n  - Israel (Row 19): Total = 1\n  - Portugal (Row 20): Total = 1\n  - Ukraine (Row 21): Total = 1\n\nThese countries indeed tie for 16th place, each with a total of one medal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that \"6 countries win just a single bronze medal\" and these are the ones tying for 16th. However, eight countries have exactly one bronze medal, not six.\n- Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly identifies the number of countries with one bronze medal as six instead of eight.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nWe focus on the \"bronze\" and \"total\" columns for these rows to verify both parts of the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
