    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions against the table:\n\n1. The venue on April 6, 2007.\n2. The score on April 6, 2007.\n\nThe claim states that \"twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007 , where the score be 22 - 12.\"\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions one by one:\n\n1. **Venue Check**:\n   - From the table, for the row with the date \"6 April 2007,\" we find that the venue is listed as \"twickenham stoop.\" This matches the claim.\n\n2. **Score Check**:\n   - For the same row (\"6 April 2007\"), the result (score) is given as \"30 - 28.\"\n   - The claim states the score should be \"22 - 12.\"\n\nSince the actual score on that date does not match the claimed score, the condition regarding the score fails.\n\nTherefore, based on these checks, the claim is false. We can identify the relevant cells in the table that were used to verify the claim:\n\n- **Row Index**: This corresponds to the first occurrence of \"6 April 2007\" in the table.\n- **Column Names**:\n  - The date cell (\"date\") at row index 0, which identifies the specific match.\n  - The venue cell (\"venue\") at row index 0, where \"twickenham stoop\" is confirmed.\n  - The result (score) cell (\"result\") at row index 0, where \"30 - 28\" contradicts the claimed score.\n\nThe JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
