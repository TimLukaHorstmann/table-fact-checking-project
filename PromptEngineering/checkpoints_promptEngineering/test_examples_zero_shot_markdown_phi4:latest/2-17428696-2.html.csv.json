    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if there is an event in the table with a record of \"2 - 0,\" which lasts for 3 rounds and has a time duration of \"1:51.\"\n\nLet's break down the necessary conditions from the claim:\n\n1. **Record of \"2 - 0\"**: We must find a row where the `record` column shows \"2 - 0.\"\n2. **Time of \"1:51\"**: The corresponding event should have a time duration of \"1:51.\"\n3. **Number of Rounds is 3**: The `round` column for this event should be \"3.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- We find that there is an entry with a record of \"2 - 0\":\n  ```\n  | win   | 2 - 0       | brian peterson    | ko                            | ifc warriors challenge 14            |       3 | 1:51  | fresno , california , united states      |\n  ```\n\n- For this entry:\n  - The `round` column is \"3,\" which satisfies the condition for number of rounds.\n  - The `time` column shows \"1:51,\" satisfying the time condition.\n\nAll conditions match, confirming that there is indeed an event with a record of \"2 - 0\" that goes 3 rounds and has a time of \"1:51.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is verified as true. Below are the relevant cells:\n\n- Record column (record = \"2 - 0\")\n- Round column (round = \"3\")\n- Time column (time = \"1:51\")\n\nThese correspond to row index 33 in the table (considering zero-based indexing). Here is the JSON object reflecting this verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
