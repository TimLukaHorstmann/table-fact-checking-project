By examining the first column (\"date\"), we find that the entry for April 9 is on the 9th row (considering the header as the first row).\n\n3. **Check the Attendance Column**: Once the correct row is identified, we need to check the \"attendance\" column for this specific date.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claimed Value**: The claim states that the attendance on April 9 was 19,007.
