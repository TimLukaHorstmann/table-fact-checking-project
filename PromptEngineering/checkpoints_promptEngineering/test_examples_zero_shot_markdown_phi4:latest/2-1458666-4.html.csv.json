Then, for these rows, we'll check if `team wins` is at least one.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **United States**: \n   - Total Wins: 32 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 1 (at least 1) \n\n2. **Australia**:\n   - Total Wins: 5 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 0 (not at least 1)\n\n3. **England**: \n   - Total Wins: 5 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 1 (at least 1) \n\n4. **South Africa**:\n   - Total Wins: 4 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 2 (at least 1)\n\n5. **Northern Ireland**: \n   - Total Wins: 2 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 0 (not at least 1)\n\n6. **Germany**: \n   - Total Wins: 2 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 1 (at least 1) \n\n7. **Canada**: \n   - Total Wins: 1 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 0 (not at least 1)\n\n8. **Fiji**: \n   - Total Wins: 1 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 0 (not at least 1)\n\n9. **Sweden**: \n   - Total Wins: 1 (greater than 0)\n   - Team Wins: 0 (not at least 1)\n\n10. **Italy**:\n    - Total Wins: 1 (greater than 0)\n    - Team Wins: 0 (not at least 1)\n\n11. **Japan**: \n    - Total Wins: 1 (greater than 0)\n    - Team Wins: 1 (at least 1) \n\n12. **Wales**:\n    - Total Wins: 1 (greater than 0)\n    - Team Wins: 1 (at least 1)\n\nNations Australia, Northern Ireland, Canada, Fiji, Sweden, and Italy have total wins but do not meet the criteria for team wins, which invalidates the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are the ones corresponding to `total wins` and `team wins`. Here's a summary of these relevant cells by their row index:\n\n- Row 1 (Australia): Total Wins, Team Wins\n- Row 4 (Northern Ireland): Total Wins, Team Wins\n- Row 5 (Germany): Total Wins, Team Wins\n- Row 6 (Canada): Total Wins, Team Wins\n- Row 7 (Fiji): Total Wins, Team Wins\n- Row 8 (Sweden): Total Wins, Team Wins\n- Row 9 (Italy): Total Wins, Team Wins\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
