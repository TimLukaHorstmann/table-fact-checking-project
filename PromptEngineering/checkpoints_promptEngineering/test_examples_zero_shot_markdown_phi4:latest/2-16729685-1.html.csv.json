    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"artist maggie toal have draw 7 for the song fee him with love,\" we need to verify specific conditions using the table provided.\n\n1. **Artist Name**: The claim mentions the artist as \"maggie toal.\" We should check if there is a row where the artist column exactly matches \"maggie toal.\"\n\n2. **Draw Number**: The claim states that this artist has draw number 7. This means we need to find a row with a draw value of 7 corresponding to the artist \"maggie toal.\"\n\n3. **Song Title**: The song mentioned in the claim is \"fee him with love.\" We should confirm if there's a row where the song title matches this phrase exactly, and it aligns with both the artist and draw conditions.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- For row 7:\n  - Artist: maggie toal\n  - Draw: 7\n  - Song: feed him with love\n\nThe artist \"maggie toal\" is indeed listed in row 7. The draw number for this row is also 7, which matches the claim.\n\nHowever, there's a discrepancy in the song title:\n- Claimed song title: \"fee him with love\"\n- Actual song title: \"feed him with love\"\n\nThe song title does not match exactly due to a typographical error (\"fee\" instead of \"feed\"). Therefore, this condition is not fully satisfied.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is FALSE because the song title in the claim does not match the actual song title in the table.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 7, Column: artist\n- Row 7, Column: draw\n- Row 7, Column: song\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
