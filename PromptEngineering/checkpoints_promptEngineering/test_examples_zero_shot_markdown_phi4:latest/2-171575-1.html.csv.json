The worldwide gross for this film must match the value given in the claim.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n- **Claim:** \"the number 1 rank film have a worldwide gross receipt of 914691118\"\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Check the Rank:**\n   - From the table, look at the `rank` column for the row where the value is `1`.\n   - The row with `rank` = 1 corresponds to \"jurassic park\".\n\n2. **Verify Worldwide Gross:**\n   - In the same row (where rank is 1), check the `worldwide gross` column.\n   - According to the table, for \"jurassic park\", the worldwide gross is indeed listed as 914691118.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied:\n\n- The film at rank 1 is \"jurassic park\".\n- The worldwide gross for this film matches the value given in the claim (914691118).\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table. We identify the relevant cells used to verify this claim as follows:\n\n- Row index `0` corresponds to the first row in markdown tables (which starts from 1), where \"jurassic park\" is listed.\n- The columns checked are `\"rank\"` and `\"worldwide gross\"`.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"worldwide gross\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
