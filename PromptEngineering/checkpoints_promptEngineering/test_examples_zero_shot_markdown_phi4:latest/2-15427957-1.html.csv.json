This means we should look at the table to see when they first entered Tier 1.\n- We need to find where the value of the \"tier\" column is \"1,\" indicating Tier 1 participation, and then determine if this occurs for the first time in or after 1999.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n1. **Row 0** (Season: 1997 - 98): Tier is 2.\n2. **Row 1** (Season: 1998 - 99): Tier is 2.\n3. **Row 2** (Season: 1999 - 00): Tier is 1.\n4. Subsequent rows should be checked for any earlier occurrence of Tier 1, but as shown in Rows 0 and 1, the team was not in Tier 1 before 1999.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- The first occurrence of \"tier\" being \"1\" is at Row 2 (Season: 1999 - 00).\n\nNow let's confirm whether any earlier row had a tier value of \"1\":\n- Rows 0 and 1 have tier values of \"2,\" indicating they were not in Tier 1 before the season 1999-2000.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the first time they be in tier 1 be in 1999\" is true because their first participation in Tier 1 indeed starts from the season 1999 - 00.
