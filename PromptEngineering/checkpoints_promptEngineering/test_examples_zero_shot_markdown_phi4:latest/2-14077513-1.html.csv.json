    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze each condition in the claim and check it against the data.\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"there be 0 drawn for 7 game with 4 loss , 19 - 19 point differential and 6 point\"\n\nWe will evaluate this by checking each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Number of Games**: The claim specifies \"7 games.\" We need to find a row where `games` is equal to 7.\n2. **Drawn Matches**: The claim states \"0 drawn.\" So, we look for a row with `drawn` equal to 0.\n3. **Lost Matches**: The claim mentions \"4 loss,\" meaning `lost` should be 4.\n4. **Points Difference**: The claim specifies \"19 - 19 point differential.\"\n5. **Total Points**: Finally, the claim states \"6 points.\"\n\nNow, let's examine each row in the table to find a match:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 1, Lost: 0, Points Difference: 41 - 16, Points: 13\n  - Does not meet criteria for drawn, lost, or points difference.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 4, Lost: 0, Points Difference: 30 - 21, Points: 10\n  - Does not meet criteria for drawn, lost, or points difference.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 1, Lost: 2, Points Difference: 24 - 20, Points: 9\n  - Does not meet criteria for drawn, lost, or points difference.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 2, Lost: 2, Points Difference: 23 - 28, Points: 8\n  - Does not meet criteria for drawn, lost, or points difference.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 1, Lost: 3, Points Difference: 22 - 15, Points: 7\n  - Does not meet criteria for drawn, lost, or points difference.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 0, Lost: 4, Points Difference: 19 - 19, Points: 6\n  - Meets all criteria: games = 7, drawn = 0, lost = 4, points difference = 19 - 19, points = 6.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 0, Lost: 6, Points Difference: 13 - 26, Points: 2\n  - Does not meet criteria for lost or points difference.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Games: 7, Drawn: 1, Lost: 6, Points Difference: 13 - 40, Points: 1\n  - Does not meet criteria for drawn, lost, or points difference.\n\nThe claim is fully supported by row 5. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\nHere are the relevant cells from row 5:\n\n- Row index: 5, Column name: games\n- Row index: 5, Column name: drawn\n- Row index: 5, Column name: lost\n- Row index: 5, Column name: points difference\n- Row index: 5, Column name: points\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
