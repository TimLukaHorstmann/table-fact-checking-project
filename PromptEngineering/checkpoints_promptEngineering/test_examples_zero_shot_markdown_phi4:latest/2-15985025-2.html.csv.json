    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the claim against the table data:\n\n1. **Person Verification**: The claim mentions \"david bielkheden\". We should first identify all entries related to David Bielkheden in the table.\n\n2. **Location Verification**: The claim specifies that the event occurred in Stockholm, Sweden. We need to find matches for this location from David Bielkheden's records.\n\n3. **Match Outcome Verification**: The claim states a \"highest record win\" against Diego Gonzalez. We need to identify all wins by David Bielkheden and see if the one against Diego Gonzalez is indeed his highest-recorded win in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **David Bielkheden's Matches**:\n  - Rows with \"res\": \"win\"\n    - Row index 0: Opponent is Diego Gonzalez, Location is Stockholm, Sweden.\n    - Other wins are at different locations or not against Diego Gonzalez.\n\n- **Highest Record Verification**:\n  - The record in row 0 shows a win against Diego Gonzalez in Stockholm, Sweden. We need to ensure no other win in Stockholm has a higher record than this one.\n  - Checking other wins by Bielkheden:\n    - Row index 19: Win against Kimmo Nurkse, Location is Turku, Finland.\n    - Row index 20: Win against Joni Kyllonen, Location is Helsinki, Finland.\n    - Row index 21: Win against Kai Rintakorpi, Location is Turku, Finland.\n\nNone of these other wins are in Stockholm.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"David Bielkheden won a majority of his matches by unanimous decision,\" we need to examine David Bielkheden's match record in the table and identify instances where he won by unanimous decision.\n\nFirst, let's define what constitutes a \"win by unanimous decision.\" In the context of this table:\n- A win is marked as \"res\" = \"win\".\n- The method of victory is specified under the column \"method.\"\n- For it to be a \"unanimous decision,\" the entry in the \"method\" column should explicitly state \"decision (unanimous)\".\n\nNow, let's evaluate David Bielkheden\u2019s record for wins:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Result: win\n   - Method: decision (unanimous)\n   \n2. **Row 3**:\n   - Result: win\n   - Method: tko (punches)\n\n3. **Row 7**:\n   - Result: y win\n   - Method: tko (punches)\n\n4. **Row 8**:\n   - Result: y win\n   - Method: submission (armbar)\n\n5. **Row 9**:\n   - Result: y win\n   - Method: ko\n\n6. **Row 10**:\n   - Result: y win\n   - Method: decision\n\n7. **Row 11**:\n   - Result: y win\n   - Method: tko (strikes)\n\n8. **Row 12**:\n   - Result: y win\n   - Method: submission (strikes)\n\n9. **Row 13**:\n   - Result: y win\n   - Method: decision (unanimous)\n\n10. **Row 14**:\n    - Result: y win\n    - Method: submission\n\n11. **Row 15**:\n    - Result: y win\n    - Method: decision (unanimous)\n\n12. **Row 16**:\n    - Result: x win\n    - Method: submission (punches)\n\nFrom this examination, David Bielkheden has a total of 12 wins (counting both \"y\" and \"x\").

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"David Bielkheden won a majority of his matches by KO,\" we need to analyze the table for all of David Bielkheden's wins and identify how many were achieved via KO (knockout). A win by KO will be listed in the \"method\" column with the text \"ko.\"\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Wins:**\n   - Look at the \"res\" column for all entries labeled as \"win\" or \"y win,\" indicating these are victories.\n\n2. **Check Method of Win:**\n   - For each identified win, check the \"method\" column to see if it states \"ko.\"\n\n3. **Count and Compare:**\n   - Count how many wins were by KO.\n   - Determine if this count constitutes a majority (more than half) of his total wins.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- Wins (res = \"win\" or \"y win\"):\n  - Row 0: Method is \"decision (unanimous)\"\n  - Row 3: Method is \"ko\"\n  - Row 7: Method is \"submission (armbar)\"\n  - Row 9: Method is \"ko\"\n  - Row 11: Method is \"submission (strikes)\"\n  - Row 13: Method is \"decision (unanimous)\"\n  - Row 15: Method is \"submission (punches)\"\n  - Row 17: Method is \"tko (strikes)\"\n  - Row 19: Method is \"submission (strikes)\"\n  - Row 21: Method is \"submission\"\n  - Row 23: Method is \"decision (unanimous)\"\n\n- Total Wins: 12\n- Wins by KO:\n  - Row 3: KO\n  - Row 9: KO\n\nThere are only two wins via KO out of a total of 12 wins.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDavid Bielkheden did not win the majority of his matches by KO. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant rows where he won and method was checked:\n- Wins with methods \"ko\" (Row indices): 3, 9\n- All wins to verify majority calculation (Row indices): 0, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
