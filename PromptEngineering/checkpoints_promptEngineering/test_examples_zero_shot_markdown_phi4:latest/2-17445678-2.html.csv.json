The location of this match is \"south dakota , united states\".\n3. The opponent's name in this match is \"brian dunn\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- We need to find rows where the `round` column equals 2, and the `location` column matches \"south dakota , united states\".\n  \nChecking each row:\n- Row 3: \n  - `record`: \"10 - 4 - 1\"\n  - `opponent`: \"heath sims\"\n  - `method`: \"submission (strikes)\"\n  - `event`: \"sf 2 - on the move\"\n  - `round`: 2\n  - `location`: \"oregon , united states\"\n\n- Row 5:\n  - `record`: \"10 - 2 - 1\"\n  - `opponent`: \"brian dunn\"\n  - `method`: \"submission (rear naked choke)\"\n  - `event`: \"msf - total destruction\"\n  - `round`: 2\n  - `location`: \"south dakota , united states\"\n\nThe only row that satisfies all three conditions is Row 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n1. The match must be against an opponent named \"Brian Dunn.\"\n2. This match should take place in South Dakota, United States.\n3. The match should last 3 rounds.\n\nLet's examine the relevant columns: `opponent`, `location`, and `round`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Brian Dunn as Opponent:**\n   - Scan through the column `opponent` to find any row where \"brian dunn\" is listed.\n   - Row 12 matches this condition (opponent = \"brian dunn\").\n\n2. **Verify Location for Match Against Brian Dunn:**\n   - Check the `location` of the match identified in step 1 (Row 12).\n   - The location in Row 12 is \"south dakota, united states.\"\n\n3. **Check Round Duration for Match Against Brian Dunn:**\n   - Verify the `round` number from Row 12.\n   - The round for this match is 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- While the opponent and location conditions are met (Brian Dunn and South Dakota), the round condition is not satisfied, as it states 3 rounds but the actual data shows only 2 rounds.\n\nBased on these findings, the claim is **FALSE**.
