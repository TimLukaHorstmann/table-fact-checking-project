Verify if Pavel \u0160nobel was indeed an opponent who played on hard court.\n\nThe relevant columns for evaluating this claim are \"surface\" and \"opponent in the final.\"\n\nLet's review each entry:\n\n- **Row 3**: Opponent is \"pavel \u0161nobel,\" Surface is \"hard.\" This matches part of our claim.\n  \nNext, we must ensure that Pavel \u0160nobel was the only opponent to play on a surface other than clay. Let's examine all rows for any non-clay surfaces:\n\n- **Row 3**: Surface is \"hard\" (Opponent: pavel \u0161nobel) \u2013 Matches hard court condition.\n\nChecking every row for other opponents who played on non-clay surfaces, we find:\n- All other opponents are listed with a surface of \"clay.\"\n\nThus, Pavel \u0160nobel is the only opponent who played in the final on a non-clay (hard) surface. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 3 (\"surface\" and \"opponent in the final\").\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
