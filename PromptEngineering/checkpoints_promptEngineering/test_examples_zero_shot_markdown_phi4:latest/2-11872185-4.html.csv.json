    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"lifetime India share earlier than 2009 be 0,\" we need to examine the 'year' column for each movie entry in the provided table and determine if there are any movies released before 2009. If such a movie exists, we must then check its corresponding 'lifetime India distributor share' value.\n\nHere's the relevant examination:\n\n1. **3 Idiots** - Released in 2009 (included as \"earlier than 2009\" means strictly less than 2009).\n2. Other movies are released in or after 2010, which do not meet the criteria of being earlier than 2009.\n\nFrom this analysis, there are no movies listed in the table that were released before 2009. Therefore, it is impossible to verify if their lifetime India distributor share is 0 because there are no such entries at all. Since there's nothing to contradict the claim (as no movies meet the \"earlier than 2009\" condition), we can say the claim is supported by default.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis involve checking each row\u2019s 'year' and confirming whether it precedes 2009:\n\n- Row indices checked: all rows (0 through 9) in the 'year' column.\n  \nThus, our conclusion is that there are no entries before 2009 to contradict the claim.
