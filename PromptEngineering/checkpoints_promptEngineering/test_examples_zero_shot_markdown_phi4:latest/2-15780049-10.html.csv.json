    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check the attendance figures for games held at the Air Canada Centre and see if the April 29 game has the highest attendance.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **April 27 Game**:\n  - Location: Air Canada Centre\n  - Attendance: 20,138\n\n- **April 29 Game**:\n  - Location: Air Canada Centre\n  - Attendance: 20,112\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the location and attendance for games at the Air Canada Centre. We compare the attendance numbers:\n\n- April 27 game had an attendance of 20,138.\n- April 29 game had an attendance of 20,112.\n\nSince 20,138 (April 27) is greater than 20,112 (April 29), the claim that the April 29 game was the highest attended at the Air Canada Centre is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n1. Row 3, Column \"location attendance\" (Air Canada Centre 20138)\n2. Row 4, Column \"location attendance\" (Air Canada Centre 20112)\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
