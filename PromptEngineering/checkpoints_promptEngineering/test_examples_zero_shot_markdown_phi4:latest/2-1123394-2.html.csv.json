This information is found in the \"constructor\" column.\n\n3. **Cross-reference and Verify:**\n   - Locate the row(s) with \"williams - bmr\" in the \"constructor\" column.\n   - Check the corresponding value in the \"time / retired\" column for that row to see if it matches \"+ 37.311\".\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table:\n\n- Row 4: \n  - Constructor: \"williams - bmw\"\n  - Time/Retired: \"+ 37.311\"\n\nThis confirms that in the row where the constructor is \"williams - bmw\", the time / retired value is indeed \"+ 37.311\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cell to verify this claim is:\n- Row Index: 4 (1-based index from the table)\n- Column Name: \"time / retired\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis includes both the time/retired and constructor columns for completeness in verification.",
