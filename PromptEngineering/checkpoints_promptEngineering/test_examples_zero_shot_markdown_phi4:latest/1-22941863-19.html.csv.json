This condition should apply to \"stage 9\".\n\n### Table Examination:\n\n#### Relevant Cells from Stage 9:\n- **Column**: `winner`\n  - **Cell (Row 8, Column 'winner')**: \"fabian cancellara\"\n\n- **Column**: `sprints classification`\n  - **Cell (Row 8, Column 'sprints classification')**: \"enrico gasparotto\" \n\n### Verification:\n1. In stage 9, the winner is indeed \"fabian cancellara\". This satisfies the first condition of the claim.\n2. However, for the sprint classification in stage 9, it is listed as \"enrico gasparotto\", not \"no award\". This does not satisfy the second condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the sprint classification in stage 9 is awarded to \"enrico gasparotto\" and not marked as \"no award,\" the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"sprints classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
