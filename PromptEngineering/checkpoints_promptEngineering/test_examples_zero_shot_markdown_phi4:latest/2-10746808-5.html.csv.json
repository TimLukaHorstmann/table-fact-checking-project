    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"south melbourne lose by the largest amount of points of any other team,\" we need to calculate the point differences for each match in the table and identify which one is the largest.\n\nThe relevant data from the table includes the scores of home teams and away teams. We will compute the absolute difference between these scores, as this represents the margin of victory or defeat for both teams involved in each match.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Melbourne vs Richmond**:\n   - Melbourne score: 122\n   - Richmond score: 89\n   - Difference: |122 - 89| = 33\n\n2. **Essendon vs St Kilda**:\n   - Essendon score: 85\n   - St Kilda score: 38\n   - Difference: |85 - 38| = 47\n\n3. **South Melbourne vs North Melbourne**:\n   - South Melbourne score: 75\n   - North Melbourne score: 73\n   - Difference: |75 - 73| = 2\n\n4. **Hawthorn vs Footscray**:\n   - Hawthorn score: 67\n   - Footscray score: 100\n   - Difference: |67 - 100| = 33\n\n5. **Geelong vs Collingwood**:\n   - Geelong score: 68\n   - Collingwood score: 75\n   - Difference: |68 - 75| = 7\n\n6. **Fitzroy vs Carlton**:\n   - Fitzroy score: 58\n   - Carlton score: 48\n   - Difference: |58 - 48| = 10\n\nNow, let's identify the largest point difference:\n\n- The largest difference is 47 points in the Essendon vs St Kilda match.\n\nNext, we need to check if South Melbourne lost by more than any other team. From our calculations:\n- South Melbourne lost by only 2 points, which is not the largest margin of loss.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"south melbourne lose by the largest amount of point of any other team\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing the scores and their differences:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
