This game results in a loss (\"l\") and contributes to a losing streak.\n\nLet's examine each relevant condition against the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n**Condition 1: Opponent is \"Chicago\" with a score of \"l 68 - 60\".**\n\n- Locate rows where the opponent is \"chicago\".\n- Check if any of these games have a score of \"l 68 - 60\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 16: Opponent = \"chicago\", Score = \"w 74 - 67\"\n- Row 19: Opponent = \"chicago\", Score = \"w 66 - 57\"\n- **Row 23**: Opponent = \"chicago\", Score = \"l 68 - 60\"\n\nThis condition is satisfied by row 23.\n\n**Condition 2: The game results in a loss and continues the losing streak.**\n\n- Check if the game in question (row 23) is marked as a loss (\"l\").\n- Verify that it follows another loss, indicating a continuing streak.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 22: Result = \"w\", Record = \"11 - 11\"\n- **Row 23**: Result = \"l\", Record = \"11 - 12\" (This indicates a loss and follows a win in row 22)\n  \nAlthough it does not immediately follow another loss, it is part of an overall losing streak as indicated by the record moving from \"11 - 11\" to \"11 - 12\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is partially correct: Chicago is indeed the opponent when the score is \"l 68 - 60\", and this game results in a loss. However, it does not directly follow another loss (the previous result was a win), so it doesn't continue an immediate losing streak.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is fully supported by the table data is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
