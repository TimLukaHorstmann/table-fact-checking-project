    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Matchday have 6 rounds which have a draw date on August 26, 2010,\" we need to examine the table's relevant columns and rows.\n\nThe important aspects of the claim involve two specific pieces of information:\n1. The phase should be \"group stage.\"\n2. Each matchday within this phase should have a \"draw date\" of \"26 August 2010.\"\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions against the provided markdown table:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Column Check:**\n- **Phase Column**: This column indicates the competition phase, which we need to be \"group stage\" for each row considered.\n- **Draw Date Column**: This column provides the draw date for each round. We are looking specifically for \"26 August 2010.\"\n\n**Row Evaluation (for group stage):**\n\n1. **Matchday 1**\n   - Phase: Group Stage\n   - Draw Date: 26 August 2010\n\n2. **Matchday 2**\n   - Phase: Group Stage\n   - Draw Date: 26 August 2010\n\n3. **Matchday 3**\n   - Phase: Group Stage\n   - Draw Date: 26 August 2010\n\n4. **Matchday 4**\n   - Phase: Group Stage\n   - Draw Date: 26 August 2010\n\n5. **Matchday 5**\n   - Phase: Group Stage\n   - Draw Date: 26 August 2010\n\n6. **Matchday 6**\n   - Phase: Group Stage\n   - Draw Date: 26 August 2010\n\nEach of these rows confirms that they belong to the \"group stage\" phase and have a draw date of \"26 August 2010.\" Therefore, there are indeed six rounds (matchdays) in the group stage with this specific draw date.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is verified as TRUE because all conditions specified in the claim match the data presented for each relevant cell in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and verify each part of the statement:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - \"The knockout stage have the most rounds\"\n   - \"All of which have draw date in August 2010 and March 2011\"\n\n2. **Verification Steps:**\n\n   a. **Identify Rounds in Each Stage:**\n      - **Qualifying:** \n        - First qualifying round\n        - Second qualifying round\n        - Third qualifying round\n\n      - **Play-off:**\n        - Play-off round\n\n      - **Group Stage:**\n        - Matchday 1 to Matchday 6 (six rounds)\n\n      - **Knockout Phase:**\n        - Round of 16\n        - Quarter-finals\n        - Semi-finals\n        - Final\n\n      The knockout phase has four rounds, and the group stage also has six rounds. Therefore, the claim that \"the knockout stage have the most rounds\" is false.\n\n   b. **Check Draw Dates for Knockout Stage:**\n      - Round of 16: 17 December 2010\n      - Quarter-finals: 18 March 2011\n      - Semi-finals: 18 March 2011\n      - Final: 18 March 2011\n\n      Not all draw dates are in August 2010 and March 2011; the round of 16 has a draw date in December 2010. This part of the claim is also false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The claim is false because:\n   - The knockout stage does not have the most rounds (group stage does).\n   - Not all knockout stage draw dates are in August 2010 and March 2011.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells to Verify Claim:**\n\n   - For checking the number of rounds:\n     - Group Stage rows (6-11)\n     - Knockout Phase rows (12-15)\n\n   - For verifying draw dates in the knockout phase:\n     - Round of 16 row (draw date: 17 December 2010)\n     - Quarter-finals row (draw date: 18 March 2011)\n     - Semi-finals row (draw date: 18 March 2011)\n     - Final row (draw date: 18 March 2011)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"phase\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"draw date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"none of the leg of the quarter-final or semi-final be in April 2011\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant sections of the table regarding the knockout phase.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections:**\n   - The table has a section labeled \"knockout phase,\" which includes \"round of 16,\" \"quarter-finals,\" \"semi-finals,\" and \"final.\"\n   - We need to focus on the rows that mention \"quarter-final\" and \"semi-final.\"\n\n2. **Extract Information for Quarter-Finals:**\n   - The row for \"quarter-finals\" indicates:\n     - First leg: 5 - 6 April 2011\n     - Second leg: 12 - 13 April 2011\n\n3. **Extract Information for Semi-Finals:**\n   - The row for \"semi-finals\" indicates:\n     - First leg: 26 - 27 April 2011\n     - Second leg: 3 - 4 May 2011\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that none of the legs of the quarter-final or semi-final should be in April 2011.\n   - However, both the first and second legs of the quarter-finals are scheduled for April 2011 (5-6 and 12-13 respectively).\n   - Additionally, the first leg of the semi-finals is also scheduled for April 2011 (26-27).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because there are indeed legs of both the quarter-final and semi-final that occur in April 2011.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For \"quarter-finals\":\n  - Row index: 10\n    - Column \"first leg\": 5 - 6 April 2011\n    - Column \"second leg\": 12 - 13 April 2011\n\n- For \"semi-finals\":\n  - Row index: 11\n    - Column \"first leg\": 26 - 27 April 2011\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"first leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"second leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"first leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
