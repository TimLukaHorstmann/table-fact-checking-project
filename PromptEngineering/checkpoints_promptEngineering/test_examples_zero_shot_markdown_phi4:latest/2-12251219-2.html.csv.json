Since this is not true for stage 4, the entire claim does not hold.\n\nWe now identify the relevant cells in the table:\n- Stage 2, 'mountains classification': row index 1\n- Stage 3, 'mountains classification': row index 2\n- Stage 4, 'mountains classification': row index 3\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mountains classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze it in detail against the provided table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the 1992 Giro d'Italia table show detail and date of event on the 22nd stage plus the final.\"\n\n1. **Detail and Date of Event:** \n   - The table provides information about winners for each stage, various classifications (general classification, points classification, mountains classification, young rider classification, intergiro classification, and trofeo fast team), but it does not provide explicit dates for any stages.\n   - There is no mention or implication of the specific date when the 22nd stage or the final took place.\n\n2. **Specific Stages Mentioned:**\n   - The table includes a \"final\" row indicating cumulative results, but this doesn't equate to details about a particular stage labeled as the 22nd.\n   - The last numbered stage provided is Stage 21. After that, there's only a \"final\" entry, which typically summarizes overall standings rather than detailing a separate event.\n\nBased on these observations:\n- There are no specific dates mentioned for any stages in the table.\n- While it does list Stage 1 to 22 winners and final results, the term \"detail\" is not adequately addressed beyond listing names associated with various classifications.\n  \nThus, the claim that the table shows \"detail and date of event on the 22nd stage plus the final\" is incorrect.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are those corresponding to row indices for stages 21, 22 (if we assume it includes the \"final\"), which list winners and classification leaders. However, none provide dates or extensive details beyond names.\n\n**JSON Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
