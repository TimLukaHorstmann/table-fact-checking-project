This will help us identify potential candidates for setting a speed record at that location.\n\n2. **Verify Malcolm Campbell's Involvement**:\n   - For each entry found in step 1, check if \"Malcolm Campell\" is listed as the pilot in the \"pilot (s)\" column.\n\n3. **Compile Relevant Cells**:\n   - Note down the row index and relevant columns for any rows where both conditions are satisfied.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Row 17**: \n  - Location: \"coniston water\"\n  - Pilot(s): \"Malcolm Campbell\"\n  - This entry satisfies both conditions (location and pilot).\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - No other entries at Coniston Water list Malcolm Campbell as the pilot, confirming that he set a record there only once.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the record speed at Coniston Water was set by Malcolm Campbell. Based on the analysis of the table:\n\n- Malcolm Campbell did indeed set a record speed at Coniston Water.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"pilot (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
