    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant information from the table.\n\nThe claim specifically pertains to:\n- The programme named \"big brother\".\n- A specific return date of September 9, 2011.\n\nFrom the markdown table provided:\n\n| programme             | date (s) of original removal      | original channel (s)   | date of return   | new channel (s)                  |\n|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------|\n| big brother           | 10 september 2010                 | channel 4              | 9 september 2011 | channel 5                        |\n\nTo verify the claim, we look at:\n1. The row where \"programme\" is \"big brother\".\n2. The \"date of return\" column to see if it matches September 9, 2011.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The \"date of return\" for \"big brother\" is indeed listed as \"9 september 2011\".\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied: \n- The programme is \"big brother\".\n- The date of return is September 9, 2011.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim include:\n- The row index for \"big brother\", which is row 1 (considering zero-based indexing).\n- The column names \"programme\" and \"date of return\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The program name: \"born to be different\".\n2. The date of return mentioned in the claim: August 18, 2011.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: We need to find the row where the program is \"born to be different\". This corresponds to the fifth row (index 4) in the table.\n\n2. **Check Date of Return**:\n   - According to the table, for the program \"born to be different\", the date of return is given as September 9, 2011.\n   - The claim states that the program will return on August 18, 2011.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - The date from the table (September 9, 2011) does not match the date mentioned in the claim (August 18, 2011).\n\nSince the dates do not align, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are found at row index 4 for the columns \"date of return\" and potentially \"programme\" to ensure we're referring to the correct show.
