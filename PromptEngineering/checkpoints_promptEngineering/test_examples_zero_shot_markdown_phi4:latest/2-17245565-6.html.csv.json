    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 3 golfers scored under par on all three rounds\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to analyze each golfer's individual round scores and their total score relative to par.\n\nLet's break down what it means for a golfer to score \"under par on all three rounds.\" Scoring under par in golf means that the golfer took fewer strokes than the course's designated par value for a particular hole or set of holes (in this case, three separate rounds).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table:**\n   - The table includes columns for place, player name, country, individual round scores summed to a total score, and overall \"to par\" performance.\n   - Each player's performance is given in terms of their total strokes across three rounds.\n\n2. **Checking Individual Rounds:**\n   - We are interested in the column detailing each golfer's scores for the three separate rounds (e.g., 71 + 71 + 65 = 207).\n   - For a golfer to score under par on all three rounds, each of their round scores must individually be less than the course par.\n\n3. **Assumptions:**\n   - We assume the standard par for a golf course is typically around 72 per round (common in many professional tournaments), though this isn't specified explicitly in the table.\n   - The \"to par\" column can give us insight but does not directly tell us if each individual round was under par.\n\n4. **Evaluating Each Player:**\n   - Jim Simons: Scores were 71, 71, and 65. Only one round (65) is likely under a standard par of 72.\n   - Jack Nicklaus: Scores were 69, 72, and 68. Two rounds are under 72.\n   - Bobby Nichols: Scores were 69, 72, and 69. Two rounds are under 72.\n   - Lee Trevino, George Archer, Jim Colbert, Bob Erickson: All have at least one round equal to or above 72.\n   - Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin: All have at least one round equal to or above 72.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - No golfer in the table scored under par on all three rounds (i.e., less than 72 for each round if we assume a standard course par of 72).\n   - The claim states \"more than 3 golfers\" must score this way, but none satisfy even one individual's condition.\n\n### Final Determination:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because no golfer scored under par on all three rounds. We identified that only two rounds (at most) were under par for any player listed in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells from Table:\nWe need to look at the cells containing scores for each round for every golfer to make this determination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
