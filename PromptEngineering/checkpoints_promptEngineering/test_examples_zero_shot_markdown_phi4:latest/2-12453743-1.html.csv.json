    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the inegi code for mexicali, which have an area of 12,700 km be 2.0,\" we need to verify two aspects against the provided table:\n\n1. Check if the INEGI code for Mexicali is indeed 2.\n2. Verify if the area of Mexicali is listed as 12,700 km\u00b2.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row Index 1 (Municipality: Mexicali)**\n  - **INEGI Code**: The value in this column for Mexicali is indeed `2`.\n  - **Area (km\u00b2)**: The value listed here is `13700`, not `12700`.\n\nThe claim specifies that the area should be `12,700 km\u00b2` but the table indicates it as `13,700 km\u00b2`. Therefore, one of the conditions in the claim does not match the data from the table.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The INEGI code condition is true.\n- The area condition is false.\n\nSince both conditions must be satisfied for the claim to be true and the area condition fails, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these aspects are in row index 1 (Mexicali) under the columns \"inegi code\" and \"area (km2)\".\n\nHere's the resulting JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"inegi code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"area (km2)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
