Specifically, we will focus on the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: We look for the row where \"fitzroy\" appears as an away team because the claim involves a match between South Melbourne (as the home team) and Fitzroy.\n\n2. **Examine the Identified Row**:\n   - In the third row, we see:\n     - Home Team: south melbourne\n     - Away Team: fitzroy\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**: The table shows that in the match between South Melbourne and Fitzroy on April 23, 1966, South Melbourne was indeed the home team.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The away team scored 9.4 (58).\n2. Footscray was the home team for that match.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Home Team: Essendon\n  - Away Team Score: Geelong with 9.4 (58)\n  - This matches condition 1, but the home team is not Footscray, so it doesn't satisfy condition 2.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team: Collingwood\n  - Away Team Score: Hawthorn with 9.8 (62)\n  - Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team: South Melbourne\n  - Away Team Score: Fitzroy with 9.8 (62)\n  - Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team: Melbourne\n  - Away Team Score: St Kilda with 17.7 (109)\n  - Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home Team: Footscray\n  - Away Team Score: North Melbourne with 13.9 (87)\n  - This satisfies condition 2, but not condition 1.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team: Carlton\n  - Away Team Score: Richmond with 16.10 (106)\n  - Neither condition is satisfied here.\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, there is no row where Footscray is the home team and the away team scored 9.4 (58). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 0: \"away team score\" because it matches the score condition.\n- Rows 0 through 5: \"home team\" to check if Footscray was the home team in any match where the away team scored 9.4 (58).\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
