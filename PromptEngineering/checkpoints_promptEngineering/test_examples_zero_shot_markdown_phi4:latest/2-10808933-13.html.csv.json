Hawthorn should appear as an \"away team\".\n2. The corresponding \"home team score\" for that row should be 12.10 (82).\n3. The match must occur after the date of 13 July 1968.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify rows where Hawthorn is the away team:**\n   - In row with `row_index` 5, Hawthorn is listed as the \"away team\".\n\n2. **Check the home team score for that row:**\n   - In the same row (index 5), the \"home team score\" is given as 12.10 (82).\n\n3. **Verify the date condition:**\n   - The match on `row_index` 5 occurs on 13 July 1968, not after it.\n\nSince the match involving Hawthorn as the away team with a home team score of 12.10 (82) occurred on 13 July 1968 and not after this date, the condition about the date is not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the conditions in the claim are:\n\n- `row_index` 5, column \"away team\": This checks if Hawthorn is the away team.\n- `row_index` 5, column \"home team score\": This verifies the home team score as 12.10 (82).\n- `row_index` 5, column \"date\": This confirms that the date is not after 13 July 1968.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
