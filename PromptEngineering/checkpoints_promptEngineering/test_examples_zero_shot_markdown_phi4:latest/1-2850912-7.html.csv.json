    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim that \"Mike Stapleton was picked ahead of any other Canadian player shown in the table,\" we need to examine two specific columns for each player listed: \"nationality\" and \"pick.\"\n\nThe claim is specifically about Mike Stapleton's draft pick position relative to other players from Canada. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Mike Stapleton's Pick**:  \n   - Look at the row where the player's name is \"Mike Stapleton.\"\n   - Note his draft pick number.\n\n2. **Check Other Canadian Players**:\n   - Identify all rows where the nationality is \"Canada.\"\n   - Record each of these players' draft pick numbers.\n\n3. **Compare Pick Numbers**:\n   - Determine if Mike Stapleton's pick number is lower than that of any other player from Canada, as a lower pick number indicates an earlier selection in the draft order.\n\nLet\u2019s go through this process:\n\n- **Mike Stapleton**: \n  - Row index: 6\n  - Pick number: 132\n\n- **Other Canadian Players**:\n  - Mike Vellucci (Row 5): Pick 131\n  - Cliff Ronning (Row 8): Pick 134\n  - Luciano Borsato (Row 9): Pick 135\n  - Blaine Chrest (Row 10): Pick 136\n  - Scott Mactavish (Row 11): Pick 137\n  - Kevan Melrose (Row 12): Pick 138\n  - Thomas Hussey (Row 13): Pick 140\n  - Kelly Murphy (Row 14): Pick 146\n\nFrom the above, we observe that Mike Vellucci was picked at number 131, which is before Mike Stapleton's pick number of 132. Therefore, there is at least one Canadian player who was selected ahead of Mike Stapleton.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this determination are:\n\n- The \"pick\" and \"nationality\" columns for Mike Stapleton.\n- The \"pick\" and \"nationality\" columns for all other players listed as Canadian in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
