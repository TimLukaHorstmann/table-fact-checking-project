    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy have the highest rebound count against Miami in the provided table.\n\n1. Identify games played against Miami:\n   - Row 5: Game vs. Miami on April 8.\n   - Row 10: Game vs. Miami on April 15.\n\n2. Examine the \"high rebounds\" column for these specific rows to identify the player(s) with the highest rebound count:\n   - Row 5: High Rebounds are Michael Bradley (8).\n   - Row 10: High Rebounds are Jerome Williams (17).\n\n3. Verify if Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy have the highest rebounds in any of these games against Miami:\n   - In Row 5, Michael Bradley has 8 rebounds, which is indeed the highest for that game.\n   - In Row 10, neither Michael Bradley nor Jelani McCoy is mentioned; Jerome Williams has the highest with 17.\n\n4. Conclusion: The claim states \"Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy (14) have the highest rebound against Miami,\" but only in one of the two games did Michael Bradley have the highest rebounds, and Jelani McCoy had no rebounds recorded against Miami. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells are those from rows 5 and 10 under the \"high rebounds\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
