In a typical sports context, \"set of games\" may refer to an individual team's performance across several matches.\n   \n2. **Score and Points:**\n   - The claim mentions a total score of 69 points.\n   - The table includes columns for 'games', 'drawn', 'lost', 'points difference', and 'points'.\n   - In the 'points difference' column, we see scores in the format \"X - Y\", where X is presumably the team's own score, and Y is the opponent's score.\n\n3. **Verification Steps:**\n   - Identify which row corresponds to the second set of games based on typical context (usually chronological or sequential order).\n   - Verify if the 'points difference' for this row shows a total score by the team of 69 points.\n   \n### Evaluation:\n1. **Row Indexing:** \n   - In markdown tables, indexing starts at 0. Hence, the second set corresponds to index 1 in typical sequential data.\n\n2. **Points Difference Analysis:**\n   - For row index 1 (second row), the 'points difference' is \"69 - 07\". This indicates that in this particular set of games, the team scored a total of 69 points.\n   \n3. **Checking for Highest Score:**\n   - To confirm if this is indeed the highest score total among all rows:\n     - Row 0: Scored 35 points\n     - Row 1: Scored 69 points (our focus)\n     - Row 2: Scored 19 points\n     - Row 3: Scored 29 points\n     - Row 4: Scored 03 points\n\n   Comparing these scores, the second set of games at index 1 indeed has the highest score total of 69 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table.
