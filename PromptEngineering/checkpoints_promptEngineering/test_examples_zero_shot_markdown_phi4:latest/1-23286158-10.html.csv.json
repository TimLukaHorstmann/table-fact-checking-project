The table provides data for games 77 through 81.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant columns: \"team\" (to confirm it\u2019s a game involving the Portland Trail Blazers), and \"high rebounds\" (to check if Marcus Camby was noted as having the highest number of rebounds).\n\n1. **Game 77**: \n   - Team: Sacramento\n   - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (15)\n   - This game involves the Portland Trail Blazers, and Marcus Camby is listed as the high rebounder.\n\n2. **Game 78**:\n   - Team: LA Clippers\n   - High Rebounds: Lamarcus Aldridge (12)\n   - The Portland Trail Blazers played this game, but Marcus Camby was not the high rebounder.\n\n3. **Game 79**: \n   - Team: Dallas\n   - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (18)\n   - This is a game involving the Portland Trail Blazers, and Marcus Camby is listed as the high rebounder.\n\n4. **Game 80**:\n   - Team: LA Lakers\n   - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (17)\n   - The Portland Trail Blazers played this game, with Marcus Camby again being the high rebounder.\n\n5. **Game 81**: \n   - Team: Oklahoma City\n   - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (13)\n   - This is another game involving the Portland Trail Blazers where Marcus Camby was the high rebounder.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that Marcus Camby was the high rebounder in games 77, 79, 80, and 81.
