    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the relevant parts of the claim and verify them against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"well fargo center (19684) be the location and attendance total from the game on december 1.\"\n\nWe need to check two conditions:\n1. The game on December 1 should have \"Wells Fargo Center\" as its location.\n2. The attendance for that game should be 19,684.\n\nFirst, identify the row corresponding to the game played on December 1:\n- From the table, we see that in the first column under \"game,\" row index 0 has a value of 26, and the second column under \"december\" has a value of 1. This indicates the game was played on December 1.\n\nNext, check the relevant details for this row:\n- Location / Attendance: The entry is \"Wells Fargo Center (19684).\" \n  - This confirms that the location is indeed Wells Fargo Center.\n  - It also shows an attendance number of 19,684 within parentheses after the location name.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are met by examining these details for row index 0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine if game 32 indeed has the highest number of points compared to other games in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column \"points\" is relevant because it directly addresses the claim about having the highest number of points.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Comparison**:\n   - Game 32: Points = 45\n   - Other Games:\n     - Game 26: Points = 34\n     - Game 27: Points = 36\n     - Game 28: Points = 38\n     - Game 29: Points = 39\n     - Game 30: Points = 41\n     - Game 31: Points = 43\n     - Game 33: Points = 47\n     - Game 34: Points = 49\n     - Game 35: Points = 49\n     - Game 36: Points = 49\n     - Game 37: Points = 51\n\n3. **Compare Values**: \n   - The highest number of points in the table is 51, which occurs in game 37.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since game 32 does not have the highest number of points (it has 45), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row index for game 32: 7\n   - Row indices for games with higher or equal points to game 32: 9, 10, 11, and 12\n\nThe relevant cells are those in the \"points\" column for these rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check the relevant details from the table for December 4th:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim mentions December 4th.

Therefore, we need to verify both the \"location / attendance\" and the specific figures within it.\n\nNow, let's go through the table:\n\n- In row 27 (Game 27), the date is December 4th.\n  - The location/attendance is recorded as \"Wells Fargo Center (19657)\". \n  - This does not match the specified attendance of 19684 in the claim.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row index 27, column \"december\" to confirm it's December 4th.\n- Row index 27, column \"location / attendance\" to check the location and attendance details.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE** because the attendance does not match (19657 vs. 19684).\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"december\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
