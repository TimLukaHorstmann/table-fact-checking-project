    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze specific data from the table provided.\n\n**Claim**: \"There be 132741 left in hand after debt of 82741.\"\n\nLet's break down what this means:\n- The claim is making two assertions about specific candidates:\n  1. A candidate has a \"cash on hand\" value of 132,741.\n  2. Another candidate or the same candidate (as context is not provided) has an \"after debt\" value of 82,741.\n\n### Step-by-step verification:\n\n1. **Find the candidate with \"cash on hand\" equal to 132,741:**\n\n   - Look through the \"cash on hand\" column:\n     - Rudy Giuliani: 16,649,825\n     - Mitt Romney: 9,216,517\n     - Fred Thompson: 7,121,744\n     - Ron Paul: 5,443,667\n     - John McCain: 3,488,627\n     - **Mike Huckabee: 65,1300** (This is the correct number; it should be read as 651,300)\n     - Duncan Hunter: 132,741 (This matches our claim.)\n     - Tom Tancredo: 110,079\n     - Sam Brownback: 94,653\n\n   So, for \"cash on hand\" = 132,741, the relevant row is Duncan Hunter.\n\n2. **Find the candidate with \"after debt\" equal to 82,741:**\n\n   - Look through the \"after debt\" column:\n     - Rudy Giuliani: 16,480,569\n     - Mitt Romney: -8,133,483\n     - Fred Thompson: 6,443,312\n     - Ron Paul: 5,443,667\n     - John McCain: 1,757,936\n     - **Mike Huckabee: 603,490** (This is the correct number; it should be read as 603,490)\n     - Duncan Hunter: 82,741 (This matches our claim.)\n     - Tom Tancredo: -185,524\n     - Sam Brownback: 94,653\n\n   So, for \"after debt\" = 82,741, the relevant row is also Duncan Hunter.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth conditions of the claim refer to Duncan Hunter. Therefore, the data in the table supports the claim that \"there be 132,741 left in hand after debt of 82741.\"\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"cash on hand\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"after debt\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions based on the table:\n\n1. The value for \"cash on hand\" should be 603490.\n2. The value for \"after debt\" should be 651300.\n\nLet's examine these columns in the table for each candidate:\n\n- **Mitt Romney**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 9216517\n  - After Debt: -8133483\n\n- **Mike Huckabee**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 651300\n  - After Debt: 603490\n\nFrom this examination, we see that for Mike Huckabee, the \"cash on hand\" is indeed 651300 and the \"after debt\" value is 603490. This matches the conditions given in the claim but with their values swapped.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data:\n\n- The condition \"cash on hand be 603490 when after debt be 651300\" does not hold for any candidate.\n  \nThus, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to check this are the \"cash on hand\" and \"after debt\" columns for Mike Huckabee.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"cash on hand\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"after debt\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
