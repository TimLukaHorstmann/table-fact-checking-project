In this table, it corresponds to row index 35.\n\n3. **Verify Each Piece of Information from the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - **Team:** Check if the team name in the relevant row (row index 35) is \"minnesota\".\n     - From the table, `team` column at row 35 has \"minnesota\", which matches.\n   \n   - **Attendance:** Check if the attendance value in the relevant row is 11,921.\n     - From the table, `location attendance` column at row 35 has \"target center 11921\", indicating an attendance of 11,921, which matches.\n\n   - **Location:** Check if the location name in the relevant row is \"Target Center\".\n     - From the table, `location attendance` column at row 35 includes \"target center\", which matches.\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data in row index 35 of the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe JSON response should indicate this truth and specify the relevant cell from the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
