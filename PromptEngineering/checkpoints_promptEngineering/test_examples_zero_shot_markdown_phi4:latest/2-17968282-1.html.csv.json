According to the table, it is located in the fifth row.\n\n2. **Verify Points for 1991 - 92**:\n   - Check the data under the \"1991 - 92\" column for the row corresponding to Hurac\u00e1n.\n   - The value listed is `40`.\n\n3. **Verify Points for 1993 - 94**:\n   - Check the data under the \"1993 - 94\" column for the same row (Hurac\u00e1n).\n   - The value listed is `43`.\n\nThe claim states that Hurac\u00e1n scored 40 points in the season 1991-92 and 43 points in the season 1993-94. Both values match exactly with those found in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince both conditions of the claim are met as per the data in the table, the claim is supported by the evidence provided.\n\n### JSON Representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1991 - 92\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1993 - 94\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
