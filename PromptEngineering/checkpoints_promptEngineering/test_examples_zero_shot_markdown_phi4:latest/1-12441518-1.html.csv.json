The \"character\" column to identify Kevin Lucas.\n2. The \"main cast seasons\" column to see which main seasons he was part of.\n3. The \"recurring cast seasons\" column to check if there is any mention of him appearing in all seasons, as the claim suggests.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Kevin Lucas Row:**\n   - Locate the row where \"character\" is \"kevin lucas\". This is found at `row_index` 2.\n\n2. **Check Main Cast Seasons:**\n   - Verify the \"main cast seasons\" column for Kevin Lucas, which lists \"seasons 1 - 2\".\n\n3. **Verify Recurring Cast Seasons:**\n   - Check if there's any indication that Kevin Lucas appears in all seasons in the \"recurring cast seasons\" column. It states he \"appears in all seasons.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Kevin Lucas appears in all seasons.\n- Although Kevin Lucas is a main cast member for seasons 1 and 2, the table also explicitly notes that he \"appears in all seasons\" under \"recurring cast seasons\".\n- This information supports the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"character\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"main cast seasons\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"recurring cast seasons\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
