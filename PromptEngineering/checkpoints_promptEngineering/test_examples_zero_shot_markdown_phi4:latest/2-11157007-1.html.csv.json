    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"week 16 be win 38 - 16\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify two aspects of the claim against the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. **Week Number**: The claim references \"week 16\". We must locate row 16 in the table.\n2. **Result (Score)**: The claim specifies a win with a score of \"38 - 16\". We need to check if this result matches what is recorded in row 16 for the \"result\" column.\n\nLet's examine the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Look at the row corresponding to week 16.\n- Check the contents of the \"week\", \"result\", and ensure that the values match \"16\" for week number and \"w 38 - 16\" for result (indicating a win with the specified score).\n\nBased on the markdown table provided:\n- Row index 16 corresponds to week 16.\n- The cell under column \"week\" should be 16.\n- The cell under column \"result\" should show \"w 38 - 16\".\n\nAfter verifying these cells, here's what we find:\n\n- Row index 16 (\"December 18 , 1988\"), has:\n  - Week: 16\n  - Result: w 38 - 16\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied, confirming that week 16 was indeed won with a score of \"38 - 16\".\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification process are:\n- Row index 16, column \"week\"\n- Row index 16, column \"result\"\n\nHere is the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(Note: The row index is given as zero-based in the instructions, so week 16 corresponds to row index 15.)",
