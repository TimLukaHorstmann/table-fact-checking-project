    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\" is true or false, we need to analyze the scores for each home team in the table.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Total Number of Matches:**\n   There are a total of 6 matches listed in the table. Therefore, one-third of the matches would be \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\).\n\n2. **Extract Home Team Scores:**\n   We need to check the scores for each home team to see how many have scored higher than 10.0 goals.\n\n   - **Hawthorn:** Scored 14.12 (96) \u2014 This is more than 10.0.\n   - **Fitzroy:** Scored 8.10 (58) \u2014 This is less than 10.0.\n   - **Richmond:** Scored 8.18 (66) \u2014 This is less than 10.0.\n   - **Geelong:** Scored 7.10 (52) \u2014 This is less than 10.0.\n   - **Essendon:** Scored 12.9 (81) \u2014 This is more than 10.0.\n   - **South Melbourne:** Scored 10.12 (72) \u2014 This is more than 10.0.\n\n3. **Count Home Teams with Scores Higher Than 10.0:**\n   From the above, we find:\n   - Hawthorn: More than 10.0\n   - Essendon: More than 10.0\n   - South Melbourne: More than 10.0\n\n   Therefore, 3 home teams have scored higher than 10.0.\n\n4. **Comparison with Required Number:**\n   The claim states that \"2 - third\" (i.e., at least 2) of the home teams should have scores higher than 10.0. We found that 3 home teams meet this criterion, which is more than or equal to 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because at least two-thirds of the home teams scored higher than 10.0 goals, as required by the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this claim, we need to look at the \"home team score\" column for each row in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
