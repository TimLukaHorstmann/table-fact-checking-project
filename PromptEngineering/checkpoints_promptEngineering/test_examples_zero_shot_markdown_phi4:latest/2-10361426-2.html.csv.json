This means the team scored 9 points against Los Angeles Rams.\n  \nNext, we compare this score of 9 with scores from all other games to ensure it's indeed the fewest:\n\n- **Row 1:** Scored 16\n- **Row 2:** Scored 13\n- **Row 3:** Scored 3\n- **Row 4:** Scored 9 (same as against Rams, but not fewer)\n- **Row 5:** Scored 13\n- **Row 6:** Scored 21\n- **Row 8:** Scored 3 (same as against Packers, but not fewer)\n- **Row 9:** Scored 7\n- **Row 10:** Los Angeles Rams were not opponents; the score is irrelevant.\n- **Row 11:** Scored 13\n- **Row 12:** Los Angeles Rams were not opponents; the score is irrelevant.\n- **Row 13:** Scored 7 (same as against Lions, but not fewer)\n- **Row 14:** Scored 7\n\nFrom this comparison, we see that there are other games where only 3 and 7 points were scored.
