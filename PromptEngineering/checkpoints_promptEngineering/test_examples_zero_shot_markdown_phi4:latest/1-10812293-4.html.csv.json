Ford was the highest scorer with 24 points.\"\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to December 23:**\n   - The date in question is December 23.\n   - According to the table, this corresponds to row 27.\n\n2. **Check the relevant columns for December 23 (row 27):**\n   - **Date:** Confirm it matches December 23. It does.\n   - **Score:** Check who was the highest scorer and their points:\n     - The \"high points\" column lists \"T.J. Ford (24)\" for this game, indicating he scored 24 points.\n\n3. **Verify if T.J. Ford was indeed the highest scorer:**\n   - Since the \"high points\" column shows only T.J. Ford's name and his score of 24, it confirms that he was the highest scorer in that game.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the game on December 20, we need to focus specifically on the cell in the table that contains information about the \"high points\" for that date.\n\n1. **Locate the Relevant Row and Column:**\n   - The claim pertains to the game played on December 20.\n   - In the table provided, each row corresponds to a specific game, with the `game` column serving as an identifier for the sequential games. \n   - According to the table:\n     - Game number 26 is listed as occurring on December 20.\n\n2. **Extract Information from the Relevant Row:**\n   - Locate the row where `game` equals 26.\n   - In this row, identify the \"high points\" column to determine the player and their score contribution during that game.\n\n3. **Verify Against the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the high point getter scored more than 25 points on December 20.\n   - In the table:\n     - For Game 26 (December 20), the \"high points\" entry is `fred jones (23)`.\n   - Fred Jones, who had the highest score for this game, achieved 23 points.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Fred Jones scored only 23 points, which is not more than 25, the claim is false.\n   - The relevant cell to verify this information is in row index 26 (0-based index) of the \"high points\" column.\n\nThus, we conclude that the answer is FALSE. Below is the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `row_index` is 25 because it's a 0-based index in programming terms (the row for December 20 game), and the relevant column name is \"high points\" where we found the necessary information to assess the claim.",
