On April 17, the home team is the Chicago Black Hawks.\n2. On April 17, the record should be 2 - 3.\n\nNow, let's find the row corresponding to April 17 in the table:\n\n- The row for April 17 has these details:\n  - date: April 17\n  - visitor: Detroit Red Wings\n  - score: 5 - 3\n  - home: Chicago Black Hawks\n  - record: 2 - 3\n\nChecking the conditions against this row:\n1. **Home Team:** The \"home\" column for April 17 lists the team as \"Chicago Black Hawks\". This matches the claim.\n2. **Record:** The \"record\" column for April 17 shows \"2 - 3\", which also matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are verified against the table and found to be true.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, we'll identify the relevant cells from this row that were checked:\n- Row index: 5 (as the first row is indexed as 0)\n- Column names for verification: \"home\" and \"record\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
