Therefore, we need to infer which teams Marc Surer was associated with during those years.\n\n2. **Historical Context:**\n   - Marc Surer drove for Arrows Racing Team and later for Marlboro McLaren and others. In 1984, he raced for the \"Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW\" team.\n   - In 1985, his known association was with \"Motor Racing Developments Ltd,\" racing a Brabham.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - For 1984:\n     - The relevant row is where \"entrant\" is \"barclay nordica arrows bmw.\" This corresponds to the points value of 1.\n   - For 1985:\n     - The relevant row is where \"entrant\" is \"motor racing developments ltd,\" corresponding to a points value of 5.\n\n4. **Calculate Difference in Points:**\n   - In 1984, Marc Surer's team scored 1 point.\n   - In 1985, Marc Surer's team scored 5 points.\n   - The difference is \\(5 - 1 = 4\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that Marc Surer scored 4 more points in 1985 compared to 1984 is supported by the data.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - For 1984: Row index 9, \"points\" column.\n   - For 1985: Row index 10, \"points\" column.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Marc Surer scored 4 points 1 time less than he scored 0 points.\"\n\nLet's analyze each relevant part of the claim:\n\n1. **Identify rows where Marc Surer participated:**\n   - We need to know if there is an entry for Marc Surer in the table. The table does not explicitly list drivers, so we must rely on external knowledge that Marc Surer raced during this period.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of points scored:**\n   - Count how many times Marc Surer scored 0 points.\n   - Count how many times Marc Surer scored 4 points.\n\n3. **Compare the counts to validate the claim:**\n\nBased on historical data, Marc Surer participated in Formula 1 during these years and with teams such as Arrows. We will cross-reference this information with the table:\n\n- **1982**: Arrows Racing Team, Arrows A4 (3 points)\n- **1982**: Arrows Racing Team, Arrows A5 (3 points)\n- **1983**: Arrows Racing Team, Arrows A6 (4 points)\n\nMarc Surer did not participate in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1984, 1985, or 1986 according to the table entries. Therefore, we focus on:\n\n- In 1982, he scored 3 points twice.\n- In 1983, he scored 4 points once.\n\nNow, let's verify the claim:\n\n- **0 Points**: Marc Surer has no entries with 0 points in the table.\n- **4 Points**: Marc Surer scored 4 points once (1983).\n\nThe claim states that he scored 4 points 1 time less than he scored 0 points. Since he scored 0 points zero times, scoring 4 points one time is indeed one more time than scoring 0 points.\n\nThus, the claim is true because:\n\n- He scored 4 points once.\n- He scored 0 points zero times (one less than once).\n\nRelevant rows for Marc Surer are those where he participated and scored points:\n\n- **Row 6**: Arrows Racing Team, Arrows A6, 1983, 4 points\n- **Row 7**: Arrows Racing Team, Arrows A5, 1982, 3 points\n- **Row 8**: Arrows Racing Team, Arrows A4, 1982, 3 points\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table with respect to the given claim: \"Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points in his 4 races in 1982.\"\n\nSteps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Year**: The year specified in the claim is 1982.\n\n2. **Extract Data for 1982**:\n   - Find all rows where the 'year' column equals 1982.\n   \n3. **Check Points Scored by Marc Surer**:\n   - The table does not explicitly mention drivers, so we must assume that if a specific driver's name is to be checked, additional information would typically be needed unless it's common knowledge or provided elsewhere.\n\n4. **Sum the Points for 1982**:\n   - From the table, find the 'points' column values for the rows where 'year' equals 1982.\n   - Sum these points to see if they total 9.\n\n5. **Check Number of Races in 1982**:\n   - Count the number of entries (races) for the year 1982.\n\n6. **Verify Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - Compare the calculated total points and number of races with those mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- For the year 1982, the table has two relevant rows:\n  - Row 6: `arrows racing team`, `arrows a4`, `cosworth v8`, `3` points\n  - Row 7: `arrows racing team`, `arrows a5`, `cosworth v8`, `3` points\n\n- Total Points in 1982:\n  - \\(3 + 3 = 6\\)\n\n- Number of Races in 1982:\n  - 2 races\n\nThe claim states that Marc Surer scored 9 points in 4 races, but according to the table, only 6 points were scored across 2 races. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 6: `year`, `points`\n- Row 7: `year`, `points`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
