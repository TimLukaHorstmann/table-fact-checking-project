In `row_index: 6`, Liverpool is indeed listed as \"team 2\".\n3. Since the claim mentions a first leg score of \"1 - 3\", we need to check the \"1st leg\" column for both rows:\n   - For `row_index: 4` (Panathinaikos), the \"1st leg\" score is \"1 - 3\". This matches part of the claimed score where Panathinaikos would be team 1 and score 1.\n   - However, Liverpool is not listed as team 2 in this row. Instead, Liverpool appears in `row_index: 6` with a different first leg score.\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that \"Panathinaikos\" played against \"Liverpool\" with the specific first leg score of \"1 - 3\".
