    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the 2008 catalan motorcycle grand prix only have 23 lap where the grid be greater than 20,\" we need to check two aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Total Laps:** Verify if there are indeed only 23 completed laps.\n2. **Grid Number Greater Than 20:** Identify any riders who started with a grid number greater than 20.\n\n**Checking Total Laps:**\n\n- We must see if any rider has less than 23 completed laps, which would indicate fewer than 23 laps were completed by everyone.\n- The table shows several riders with fewer than 23 completed laps (e.g., Mika Kallio, Imre Toth, Karel Abraham, Aleix Espargaro, and Daniel Arcas). This confirms the race did not have a full 23 laps for all participants.\n\n**Checking Grid Numbers Greater Than 20:**\n\n- We need to identify if any rider had a starting grid number greater than 20.\n- From the table:\n  - Roberto Locatelli started at position 11.\n  - Doni Tata Pradita started at position 24, which is indeed greater than 20.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n1. The race did not complete 23 laps for all riders, confirming there were only 23 laps completed by some participants but not all.\n2. There was a rider (Doni Tata Pradita) who started from grid number 24.\n\nThe claim states \"only have 23 lap where the grid be greater than 20,\" which is somewhat ambiguous in wording. However, considering both parts of the claim:\n\n- The race did not complete 23 laps for everyone.\n- There was at least one rider with a starting grid position greater than 20.\n\nThus, based on these findings, the statement holds true under the given interpretation that there were only 23 completed laps and a grid number greater than 20 exists.\n\nRelevant cells include:\n- Doni Tata Pradita's row for both \"laps\" (23) and \"grid\" (24).\n- Mika Kallio\u2019s row for \"laps\" (19), indicating not all riders completed 23 laps.\n- Any other rows with less than 23 laps to confirm the total lap count.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
