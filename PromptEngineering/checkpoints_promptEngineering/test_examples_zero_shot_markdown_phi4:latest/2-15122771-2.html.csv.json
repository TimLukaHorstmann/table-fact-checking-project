    "resp": "To verify the claim about the Washington Redskins' win total for the 1962 season from the provided table, we need to evaluate each game's result in the \"result\" column and count the number of wins.\n\nThe claim states that the Washington Redskins won a total of 2 games during this season. Let\u2019s examine the relevant data:\n\n1. **Week 1:** Result is \"t 35 - 35\", which is a tie, not a win.\n2. **Week 2:** Result is \"w 17 - 16\", which indicates a win.\n3. **Week 3:** Result is \"w 24 - 14\", which indicates another win.\n4. **Week 4:** Result is \"w 20 - 14\", indicating a win.\n5. **Week 5:** Result is \"t 17 - 17\", which is a tie, not a win.\n6. **Week 6:** Result is \"w 27 - 21\", indicating a win.\n7. **Week 7:** Result is \"l 49 - 34\", which is a loss, not a win.\n8. **Week 8:** Result is \"l 38 - 10\", which is a loss, not a win.\n9. **Week 9:** Result is \"w 17 - 9\", indicating a win.\n10. **Week 10:** Result is \"l 23 - 21\", which is a loss, not a win.\n11. **Week 11:** Result is \"l 42 - 24\", which is a loss, not a win.\n12. **Week 12:** Result is \"l 37 - 14\", which is a loss, not a win.\n13. **Week 13:** Result is \"l 34 - 21\", which is a loss, not a win.\n14. **Week 14:** Result is \"l 27 - 24\", which is a loss, not a win.\n\nBy counting the wins (indicated by \"w\"), we find that there are 5 wins in total for the Washington Redskins during this season: Weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Therefore, the claim of having only 2 wins is incorrect.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim:\n- Row 1 (Week 2): \"result\" column has \"w 17 - 16\"\n- Row 2 (Week 3): \"result\" column has \"w 24 - 14\"\n- Row 3 (Week 4): \"result\" column has \"w 20 - 14\"\n- Row 5 (Week 6): \"result\" column has \"w 27 - 21\"\n- Row 8 (Week 9): \"result\" column has \"w 17 - 9\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.

This can be verified by checking the date column.\n   \n   - Relevant cell for date verification: `{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}`\n   \n2. **Attendance Check**: In Row 7 (Week 7), the attendance is listed as 62,844.\n\n3. **Highest Attendance Verification**:\n   - Review all entries in the \"attendance\" column to find if any value exceeds 60,671.\n   - The attendance figures from the table are: \n     - Week 1: 15,730\n     - Week 2: 57,491\n     - Week 3: 37,419\n     - Week 4: 18,104\n     - Week 5: 38,264\n     - **Week 6: 60,671**\n     - **Week 7: 62,844** (this is higher than 60,671)\n     - Week 8: 49,888\n     - Week 9: 48,169\n     - Week 10: 21,231\n     - Week 11: 49,219\n     - Week 12: 32,229\n     - Week 13: 56,964\n     - Week 14: 34,508\n\n   From this comparison, it is evident that the game on October 28, 1962 (Week 7), with an attendance of 62,844, has a higher figure than the one stated in the claim (60,671).
