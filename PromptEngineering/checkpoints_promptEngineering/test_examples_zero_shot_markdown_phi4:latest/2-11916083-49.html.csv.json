We need to check if there is a row corresponding to the theme \"amethyst crystal\" within this year.\n\n2. **Theme: amethyst crystal**\n   - In the 2008 column, we find:\n     - \"Amethyst crystal\" at row index 2.\n   \n3. **Composition: 99.99% silver**\n   - For the row with \"amethyst crystal\", check the composition:\n     - The composition for this row is indeed \"99.99% silver\".\n\n4. **Issue Price: 94.95**\n   - Verify the issue price for the same row:\n     - The issue price matches 94.95.\n\nAll conditions in the claim are satisfied by the relevant cells in the table.
