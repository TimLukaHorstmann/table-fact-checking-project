    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the bobcat have a record of more wins than losses\" is true or false based on the table provided, we need to focus specifically on the \"record\" column of each row. The \"record\" column shows the number of wins and losses for the team (Bobcats) up to that point in the season.\n\nTo verify the claim:\n\n1. We will examine the record after each game as noted in the table.\n2. A win is indicated by an increase in the first part of the record (before the dash), while a loss increases the second part of the record (after the dash).\n3. The final record in the last row will help us determine if there are more wins than losses.\n\nLet's analyze each \"record\" entry:\n\n- Game 47: Record is 24 - 23 (Wins = 24, Losses = 23)\n- Game 48: Record is 24 - 24 (Wins = 24, Losses = 24)\n- Game 49: Record is 24 - 25 (Wins = 24, Losses = 25)\n- Game 50: Record is 25 - 25 (Wins = 25, Losses = 25)\n- Game 51: Record is 26 - 25 (Wins = 26, Losses = 25)\n- Game 52: Record is 26 - 26 (Wins = 26, Losses = 26)\n- Game 53: Record is 27 - 26 (Wins = 27, Losses = 26)\n- Game 54: Record is 27 - 27 (Wins = 27, Losses = 27)\n- Game 55: Record is 27 - 28 (Wins = 27, Losses = 28)\n- Game 56: Record is 27 - 29 (Wins = 27, Losses = 29)\n\nFrom this data, we see that by the end of game 56, the team has a record of 27 wins and 29 losses. This means there are more losses than wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the bobcat have a record of more win than loss\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those in the \"record\" column across all rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
