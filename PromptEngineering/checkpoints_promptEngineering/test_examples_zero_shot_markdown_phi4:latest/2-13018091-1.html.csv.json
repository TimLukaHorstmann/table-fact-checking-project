    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table, we need to break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Widnes Vikings' Position:** The claim states that \"the Widnes Vikings place second.\" We need to check if Widnes Vikings are indeed in position 2.\n\n2. **Highest Points Against Them:** The claim also states they have the highest points scored against them. This requires checking the \"pts agst\" column for the club with the highest value and confirming it corresponds to Widnes Vikings.\n\nLet's verify these conditions using the table:\n\n### Step 1: Check Widnes Vikings' Position\n- From the table, we see:\n  - Row index 2 (third row in markdown, as indexing starts from 0) has \"widnes vikings\" listed under the \"club\" column.\n  - The corresponding \"position\" for this entry is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Check Highest Points Against Them\n- We need to find the maximum value in the \"pts agst\" column:\n  - Castleford Tigers: 247\n  - Widnes Vikings: 220\n  - Halifax: 421\n  - Whitehaven: 342\n  - Leigh Centurions: 474\n  - Sheffield Eagles: 527\n  - Dewsbury Rams: 572\n  - Batley Bulldogs: 645\n  - Rochdale Hornets: 700\n  - Doncaster Lakers: 778\n\n- The highest value in the \"pts agst\" column is 778, which corresponds to Doncaster Lakers (Row index 9).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Widnes Vikings are indeed placed second.\n- However, they do not have the highest points scored against them; that distinction belongs to Doncaster Lakers.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim must be true for it to hold, and the second condition is false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pts agst\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
