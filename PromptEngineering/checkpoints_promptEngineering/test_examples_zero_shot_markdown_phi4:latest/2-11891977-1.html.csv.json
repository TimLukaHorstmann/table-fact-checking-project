This can be done by examining the 'year' column.\n\n3. **Search for Category Name**: Within the filtered data, we search for a category named \"best support actress\".\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - From the table provided, there is an entry under the 'category' column that reads \"best supporting actress\" (note the difference in wording: \"supporting\" instead of \"support\").\n   - The row corresponding to this category shows it as \"nominated\", and the nominee is Carmen Salinas.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the table has a category named \"best supporting actress\" and not \"best support actress\", the claim that there be a category called \"best support actress\" in 2001 is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- The row index for the entry with \"best supporting actress\" is 5.\n- Relevant columns are 'year', 'category', and 'nominee'.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
