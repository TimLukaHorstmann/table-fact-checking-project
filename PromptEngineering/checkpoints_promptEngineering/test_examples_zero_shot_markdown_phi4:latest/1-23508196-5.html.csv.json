    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant columns in the table for the \"single-engine fighter group\" and \"twin-engine fighter group.\" Specifically, we should check the \"number of crews\" column since it pertains to verifying if they both share the same number of crew.\n\n1. **Identify Rows:**\n   - The row corresponding to the \"single-engine fighter group\" is found under the \"type of unit\": \"single-engine fighter group.\"\n   - The row corresponding to the \"twin-engine fighter group\" is found under the \"type of unit\": \"twin-engine fighter group.\"\n\n2. **Examine Relevant Cells:**\n   - For the \"single-engine fighter group,\" locate the cell under the column \"number of crews.\" \n   - Similarly, for the \"twin-engine fighter group,\" locate the corresponding cell in the same column.\n\n3. **Verify Values:**\n   - The value under \"number of crews\" for the \"single-engine fighter group\" is between 108 and 126.\n   - The value under \"number of crews\" for the \"twin-engine fighter group\" is also between 108 and 126.\n\n4. **Check Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - The claim states that both groups have a fixed number of 45 crews. \n   - From the table, we observe ranges (108 to 126) instead of a fixed number of 45 for both groups.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claimed fixed number of \"45\" does not match the range provided in the table.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response containing the relevant cells used to verify the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"number of crews\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"number of crews\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
