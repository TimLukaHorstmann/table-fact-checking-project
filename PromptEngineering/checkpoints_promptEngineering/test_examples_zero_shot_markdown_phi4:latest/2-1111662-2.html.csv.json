Identify the row corresponding to the discus throw:\n   - The discus throw event is listed as having a record of \"69.84 m.\"\n\n2. Locate the date associated with this record:\n   - The date for the discus throw is given as \"5 September 1986.\"\n\n3. Compare this date against the claim:\n   - The claim states that the date should be after September 5, 1986.\n   - Since the actual date is precisely \"5 September 1986,\" it does not satisfy the condition of being strictly \"after\" September 5, 1986.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is FALSE. \n\nNow we will identify the relevant cells from the table:\n- The row index for the discus throw event is row 11 (considering a zero-based index).\n- The relevant column names are \"record\" and \"date.\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
