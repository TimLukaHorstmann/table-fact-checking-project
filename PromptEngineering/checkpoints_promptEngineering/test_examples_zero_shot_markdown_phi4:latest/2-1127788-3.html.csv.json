Here's how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Goals Scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez:**\n   We look at each row to find entries where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal (i.e., \"score\" column shows a result where he scored multiple times).\n\n2. **Check for Years:**\n   For each instance where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal, we check the year of the match.\n\n3. **Relevant Rows:**\n   - Row 3: Date is \"3 september 2000\", and score is \"5 - 1\". This indicates Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored multiple goals in this game.\n   - There are no other rows where he scores more than one goal.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   The claim states that 2000 should be one of two years when M\u00e1rquez scored more than once. However, from the table:\n   - He only scored more than once in the year 2000 (row 3).\n   - There is no other instance in the table where he scores more than once.\n\nThus, the claim that \"2000 be 1 of 2 year\" is incorrect because there is only one such instance in the year 2000 and none in any other year according to the provided data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The claim is FALSE.\n- Relevant cells are those that confirm M\u00e1rquez scored more than once, specifically row 3.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
