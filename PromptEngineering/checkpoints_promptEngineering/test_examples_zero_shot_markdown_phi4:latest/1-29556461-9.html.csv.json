    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant part of the table: the scores in which the team won. The claim states that \"the most point score by the owl in 1 game be 74.\" Therefore, we are interested in the columns related to games where the team scored more than their opponent and the highest points scored by any player or combination of players.\n\nLet's break down each row:\n\n- **Row 29:** The team won with a score of 73 - 67. The most points scored by an individual is 19 (Fernandez). Since 73 is less than 74, this does not support the claim.\n  \n- **Row 30:** The team won with a score of 90 - 82. The highest points scored by an individual is 24 (Allen). Although 90 is more than 74, it refers to the total game score and not specifically the \"owl\" points as per the context.\n\n- **Row 31:** The team won with a score of 96 - 76. The most points scored by an individual is 23 (Moore). Again, 96 is greater than 74 but pertains to the entire game score.\n\n- **Row 33:** The team won with a score of 66 - 64. The highest points scored by individuals or combination is 23 (Moore / Fernandez). Since 66 is less than 74, this does not support the claim.\n\nNo row shows a game where an individual player's or players' combined score for \"the owl\" exceeds 74 in a single game. Hence, based on the data provided, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells that were analyzed:\n\n- Score columns for games won: Row 29 (Column \"score\"), Row 30 (Column \"score\"), Row 31 (Column \"score\"), and Row 33 (Column \"score\").\n- High points columns where individual or combined scores were checked: Rows 29, 30, 31, and 33.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
