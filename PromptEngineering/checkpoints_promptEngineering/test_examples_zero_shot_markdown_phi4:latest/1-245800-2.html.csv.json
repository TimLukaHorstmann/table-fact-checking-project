    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the longest expedition after 5 June 1980, we need to identify all expeditions with a launch date on or after this day and compare their durations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Expeditions:**\n   - Look for expeditions with a \"launch date\" of 5 June 1980 or later.\n   \n2. **Extract Durations:**\n   - For each relevant expedition, note the \"duration (days)\".\n\n3. **Compare Durations:**\n   - Determine which expedition has the longest duration among those identified in step 1.\n\n### Relevant Expeditions and Durations:\n\n- **Expedition:** salyut 6 - ep - 5\n  - Launch Date: 26 May 1980 (Before 5 June 1980, so not relevant)\n  \n- **Expedition:** salyut 6 - ep - 6\n  - Launch Date: 5 June 1980\n  - Duration: 3.93 days\n\n- **Expedition:** salyut 6 - ep - 7\n  - Launch Date: 23 July 1980\n  - Duration: 7.86 days\n\n- **Expedition:** salyut 6 - ep - 8\n  - Launch Date: 18 September 1980\n  - Duration: 7.86 days\n\n- **Expedition:** salyut 6 - eo - 5\n  - Launch Date: 27 November 1980\n  - Duration: 12.80 days\n\n- **Expedition:** salyut 6 - eo - 6\n  - Launch Date: 12 March 1981\n  - Duration: 74.73 days\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe longest expedition after 5 June 1980 is \"salyut 6 - eo - 6\" with a duration of 74.73 days, not \"soyuz 28\" which has a duration of only 7.93 days and was launched before the specified date.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row for salyut 6 - ep - 6 (Launch Date: 5 June 1980)\n- Row for salyut 6 - ep - 7\n- Row for salyut 6 - ep - 8\n- Row for salyut 6 - eo - 5\n- Row for salyut 6 - eo - 6\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"launch date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"duration (days)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
