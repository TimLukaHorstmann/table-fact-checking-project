    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table provided in markdown format, let's carefully analyze each part of the claim and compare it with the relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The statement is \"week 7 tops the chart with a total attendance of 74827.\"\n   - This implies two parts:\n     1. Week 7 has the highest attendance.\n     2. The attendance for week 7 is indeed 74,827.\n\n2. **Verification Steps:**\n\n   - **Check Attendance for Week 7:**\n     - From the table, locate the row corresponding to \"week 7\" which is:\n       ```\n       |      7 | october 18 , 1992 | denver broncos    | l 27 - 21 |        74827 |\n       ```\n     - The attendance for week 7 is indeed listed as 74,827. This confirms the second part of the claim.\n\n   - **Check if Week 7 Has the Highest Attendance:**\n     - Review all entries in the \"attendance\" column to identify which has the highest value.\n     - Here are the attendance numbers from each row:\n       - Row 1 (week 1): 63,713\n       - Row 2 (week 2): 44,851\n       - Row 3 (week 3): 60,955\n       - Row 4 (week 4): 57,491\n       - Row 6 (week 6): 54,254\n       - Row 7 (week 7): 74,827\n       - Row 8 (week 8): 58,701\n       - Row 9 (week 9): 58,074\n       - Row 10 (week 10): 57,348\n       - Row 11 (week 11): 56,726\n       - Row 12 (week 12): 63,597\n       - Row 13 (week 13): 73,711\n       - Row 14 (week 14): 62,193\n       - Row 15 (week 15): 57,285\n       - Row 16 (week 16): 59,898\n       - Row 17 (week 17): 61,742\n\n     - Comparing all these values confirms that the highest attendance is indeed 74,827 in week 7.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n     - Week 7 has an attendance of 74,827.\n     - Week 7's attendance is the highest compared to other weeks.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n   The relevant cells from the table that were checked are:\n   \n   - For verifying week 7\u2019s attendance:\n     - Row index 6 (0-based) and column \"attendance\".\n   - For checking if it's the highest:\n     - All rows' \"attendance\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
