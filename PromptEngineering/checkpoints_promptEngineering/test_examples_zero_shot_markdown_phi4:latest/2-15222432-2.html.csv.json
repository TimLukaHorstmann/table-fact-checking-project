S\u00e3o Paulo played a total of 16 games.\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells for these checks:\n\n- **S\u00e3o Paulo's Points**: We need to check the \"points\" column for the row where the team is \"s\u00e3o paulo\".\n- **Games Played by S\u00e3o Paulo**: We also need to verify the \"played\" column for the same row.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The row index for \"s\u00e3o paulo\" is 5.\n- In this row, under the \"points\" column, the value is 16 (not 15 as claimed).\n- Under the \"played\" column, the value is indeed 16.\n\nSince S\u00e3o Paulo's points are actually 16 and not 15, the claim is false.
