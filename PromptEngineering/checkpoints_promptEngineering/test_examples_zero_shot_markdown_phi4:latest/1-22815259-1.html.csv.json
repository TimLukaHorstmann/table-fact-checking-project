Verify that the result of this game was indeed a \"win\".\n\nLet's break down these steps using the table data:\n\n- **Step 1: Find the Row with 23 Points**\n  - We look at the column `cowboys points` to find where it equals 23. This is located in row 1.\n\n- **Step 2: Check the Date of the Game**\n  - In row 1, under the `date` column, we see \"sept 20\", which matches the date specified in the claim.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Result**\n  - Still focusing on row 1, check the `result` column. It shows \"win\", confirming that the game result was indeed a win.\n\nThe claim states that this result should be a win before September 20th.
