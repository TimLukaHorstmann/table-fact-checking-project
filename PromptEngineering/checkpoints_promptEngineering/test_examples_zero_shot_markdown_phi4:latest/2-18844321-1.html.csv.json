This means Cambridge University was scored against by an opponent with 12 points.\n   - However, this information does not directly relate to how many teams scored exactly 12 in other matches.\n\n3. **Search for all instances where a team scored exactly 12:**\n   - We need to check the \"against\" column across all rows to find entries equal to 12.\n\n4. **List of teams scoring exactly 12:**\n   - From row 0, Cambridge University was scored against by an opponent with 12 points.\n   - From row 3, London Counties scored 12 against their opponent.\n   - From row 4, Munster scored 12 against their opponent.\n   - From row 7, Wales scored 12 against their opponent.\n\n5. **Count the number of teams scoring exactly 12:**\n   - The following rows have a score of 12 in the \"against\" column:\n     - Row 0 (Cambridge University)\n     - Row 3 (London Counties)\n     - Row 4 (Munster)\n     - Row 7 (Wales)\n\n6. **Verification of the claim:**\n   - The claim states that there are four teams that scored exactly 12 against Cambridge University.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the matches listed in October of 1978 and verify if all took place after the 25th of the month.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We focus on rows where the date column indicates a match occurred in October 1978.\n   \n2. **Check Each Date**:\n   - Row 0: \"18 october 1978\" (Before the 25th)\n   - Row 1: \"21 october 1978\" (Before the 25th)\n   - Row 2: \"25 october 1978\" (On or after the 25th, but exactly on the 25th which doesn't satisfy \"after\")\n   - Row 3: \"28 october 1978\" (After the 25th)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since rows 0 and 1 have dates before October 25th, the claim that all matches in October took place after the 25th is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**: We identify cells from rows where the date column indicates a match occurred in October 1978, as these are necessary for verifying the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
