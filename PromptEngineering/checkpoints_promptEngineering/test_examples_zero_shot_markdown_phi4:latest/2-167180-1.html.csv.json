If so, what the corresponding rank of that movie is.\n\nFrom the table, let's identify relevant cells:\n\n- Check each row under the \"director (s)\" column to see if it contains \"m night shyamalan\".\n- Verify the \"rank\" value for the row where M. Night Shyamalan is listed as the director.\n\nLooking at the data in the table:\n- Row 7 has \"m night shyamalan\" listed under \"director (s)\".\n- The rank for this row is 7.\n\nThus, the claim matches the information in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 6 (since markdown tables usually have a header starting at index 0), column \"rank\": value 7\n- Row index 6, column \"director (s)\": value \"m night shyamalan\"\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"george lucas be the director for star war episode ii : attack of the clone,\" we need to verify two parts of this statement against the provided table:\n\n1. The title of the movie is \"star wars episode ii: attack of the clones.\"\n2. The director of that movie is \"george lucas.\"\n\nLet's examine these aspects in detail using the data from the table.\n\n- **Row Identification**: \n  - We need to find the row where the title matches \"star wars episode ii: attack of the clones.\" Upon inspecting the table, we identify this as:\n    - Row index: 3\n    - Column for title: \"title\"\n  \n- **Title Verification**:\n  - The value in the 'title' column at row index 3 is \"star war - man,\" which does not match our required title. However, moving down to row index 4, we find:\n    - Row index: 4\n    - Column for title: \"title\"\n    - Value: \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones\" (Note: The space after 'ii' matches exactly as presented in the table)\n\n- **Director Verification**:\n  - Now, check if the director listed for this movie is \"george lucas.\"\n  - At row index 4, under the column \"director(s)\" we have:\n    - Row index: 4\n    - Column for director(s): \"director (s)\"\n    - Value: \"george lucas\"\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied in this specific row of the table.
