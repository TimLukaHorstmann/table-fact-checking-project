The relevant cells to verify this are those containing information about where the Scottish Claymores' stadiums are located:\n\n- For the scottish claymores:\n  - Hampden Park: Row index 17, \"city\" column (Glasgow, Scotland)\n  - Murrayfield Stadium: Row index 18, \"city\" column (Edinburgh, Scotland)\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"city\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
