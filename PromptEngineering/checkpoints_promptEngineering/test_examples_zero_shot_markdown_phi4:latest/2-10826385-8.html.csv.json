Compare this crowd size with all other games listed in the table to see if it is indeed the largest.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant details from the table:\n\n- **Identify the Game at Lake Oval:**\n  - Look for the row where the \"venue\" column states \"lake oval.\"\n  - The corresponding row is:\n    ```\n    | south melbourne | 9.7 (61)          | fitzroy     | 18.11 (119)       | lake oval         |   12421 | 20 may 1972 |\n    ```\n\n- **Crowd Size for the Lake Oval Game:**\n  - The \"crowd\" column for this row shows a crowd size of 12,421.\n\n- **Identify the Largest Crowd Size in the Table:**\n  - Check all rows to find the maximum value in the \"crowd\" column:\n    - Collingwood vs. Footscray at Victoria Park: 25,986\n    - Melbourne vs. Geelong at MCG: 19,023\n    - South Melbourne vs. Fitzroy at Lake Oval: 12,421\n    - North Melbourne vs. Essendon at Arden Street Oval: 14,091\n    - St Kilda vs. Carlton at Moorabbin Oval: 31,547\n    - Richmond vs. Hawthorn at VFL Park: 25,845\n\n- **Compare the Crowd Sizes:**\n  - The largest crowd size is 31,547 for the game between St Kilda and Carlton at Moorabbin Oval.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim states that the game at Lake Oval has the largest crowd of 31,547. However, our examination reveals that the game at Lake Oval had a crowd of only 12,421, which is not the largest. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n- Row index 2 (South Melbourne vs. Fitzroy): Verify venue and crowd size.\n- Row indices 4 and all other rows to compare the crowd sizes.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that all these games had a crowd of less than 20,000.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row:\n\n1. **VFL Park**:  \n   - Row: 5\n   - Venue: VFL Park\n   - Crowd: 25,845\n\n2. **Lake Oval**:  \n   - Row: 2\n   - Venue: Lake Oval\n   - Crowd: 12,421\n\n3. **Arden Street Oval**:  \n   - Row: 3\n   - Venue: Arden Street Oval\n   - Crowd: 14,091\n\nNow, let's verify the claim against these values:\n\n- For VFL Park (Row 5), the crowd is 25,845, which is not less than 20,000.\n- For Lake Oval (Row 2), the crowd is 12,421, which is less than 20,000.\n- For Arden Street Oval (Row 3), the crowd is 14,091, which is less than 20,000.\n\nSince the game at VFL Park did not have a crowd of less than 20,000, the claim is false.
