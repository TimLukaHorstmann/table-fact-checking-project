    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jacqueline du Bief is true, we need to verify two conditions from the table: her number of placings and her total score.\n\n1. **Condition 1**: Check if \"Jacqueline du Bief\" has 14 placings.\n2. **Condition 2**: Verify if her total score is 188.67.\n\nLet's locate the relevant row in the table:\n- The table shows that Jacqueline du Bief is ranked 2nd.\n- In this row, the column for \"placings\" indicates a value of 14.\n- In the same row, the column for \"total\" indicates a score of 188.67.\n\nBoth conditions align perfectly with the claim provided. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used to verify the claim:\n\n- Row index 1 (second row due to zero-indexing):\n  - Column \"placings\" has a value of 14.\n  - Column \"total\" has a value of 188.67.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this verification is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"placings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
