    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"on october 25 , the opponent be panathinaikos\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions against the table:\n\n1. The date must be October 25.\n2. On that date, the opponent must be Panathinaikos.\n\nLet's examine each condition in detail with respect to the relevant row from the table:\n\n- **Date Condition**: We check the \"date\" column for the value \"25 october\".\n- **Opponent Condition**: We check the \"opponent\" column for the value \"panathinaikos\".\n\nFrom the provided table, we identify that:\n- The third row has the date \"25 october\".\n- In the same row, under the opponent column, it lists \"panathinaikos\".\n\nThese observations confirm that both conditions required by the claim are met in this specific row.\n\nNow, let's summarize which cells from the table were relevant to verify the claim:\n\n1. The cell in the third row (row index 2) and the column named \"date\" for checking the date \"25 october\".\n2. The cell in the same row (row index 2) and the column named \"opponent\" for verifying that the opponent is \"panathinaikos\".\n\nThus, based on this verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
