    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the team's win percentage and losses in a specific year, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states:\n- The win percentage (\\(win\\%\\)) should be 0.72 (or 720/1000 when converted for comparison).\n- The number of losses should total 23 during that year.\n\nLet's examine each relevant column in the markdown table to identify any row meeting these conditions:\n\n1. **Win Percentage Column**: We need a win percentage of exactly 0.72, which is equivalent to 720 per thousand or 720 in the given format.\n2. **Losses Column**: The losses should be exactly 23.\n\nNow, we'll go through each row of the table and check these conditions:\n\n- Row 1: \\(win\\% = 195\\), Losses = 66\n- Row 2: \\(win\\% = 476\\), Losses = 43\n- Row 3: \\(win\\% = 585\\), Losses = 34\n- ...\n- Row 24: \\(win\\% = 756\\), Losses = 20\n- ...\n- Row 31: \\(win\\% = 684\\), Losses = 26\n- ...\n- Row 49: \\(win\\% = 744\\), Losses = 21\n- **Row 50: \\(win\\% = 671\\), Losses = 27**\n- ...\n- **Row 55: \\(win\\% = 540\\), Losses = 23**\n\nUpon checking the table, row 55 matches the condition for losses being 23. However, its win percentage is 540, not 720.\n\nNo row in the table meets both conditions of having a win percentage of 720 and exactly 23 losses simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim does not hold true.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 55, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 55, \"column_name\": \"win%\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"0.72 be the highest win percentage when there be 22 loss,\" we must examine each row in the table and identify those with exactly 22 losses (in the 'losses' column). Then, for these rows, we compare their win percentages to determine if any meet or exceed a win percentage of 0.72.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with 22 Losses:**\n   - We need to find all rows where the 'losses' value is exactly 22.\n   - Looking through each row, we find:\n     - Row index 7 (1979-80 season) has 27 losses.\n     - Row index 12 (1992-93 season) has 20 losses.\n     - **Row index 15 (1995-96 season) has 23 losses.**\n     - Row index 17 (1997-98 season) has 26 losses.\n     - Row index 29 (2004-05 season) has 20 losses.\n     - **Row index 30 (2005-06 season) has 28 losses.**\n     - **Row index 31 (2006-07 season) has 21 losses.**\n\n2. **Find Rows with Exactly 22 Losses:**\n   - By examining each row, we find:\n     - **Row index 8 (1980-81 season) has 22 losses and a win percentage of 0.7205882352941176.**\n\n3. **Check Win Percentages for These Rows:**\n   - For the identified row with exactly 22 losses:\n     - Row index 8: 'win_percentage' is 0.7205882352941176.\n\n4. **Evaluate Against the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies that 0.72 should be the highest win percentage when there are 22 losses.\n   - In our findings, row index 8 has a win percentage of approximately 0.7206, which is indeed 0.72 rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThus, the claim holds true because the identified row with exactly 22 losses does have a win percentage of about 0.72, and it is the highest among those rows since it's the only one.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"win_percentage\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
