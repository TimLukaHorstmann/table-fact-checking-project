The event took place at \"lugano, switzerland wta virginia slims\".\n3. The opponent was \"bonnie gadusek\".\n\nWe'll go through the rows of the table to find any matching entry.\n\n- First, we identify the relevant columns in the table: \"Outcome\", \"Event\", and \"Opponent\".\n- We then examine each row for a match with these three conditions:\n\n1. Row 8:\n   - Outcome: \"runner - up\"\n   - Event: \"lugano , switzerland wta tier v\"\n   - Opponent: \"bonnie gadusek\"\n\n2. Row 21:\n   - Outcome: \"winner\"\n   - Event: \"geneva , switzerland wta tier iv\"\n   - Opponent: Not relevant since the outcome does not match.\n\n3. Row 22:\n   - Outcome: \"runner - up\"\n   - Event: \"barcelona , spain wta tier iii\"\n   - Opponent: Not relevant since the event and opponent do not match.\n\n4.
