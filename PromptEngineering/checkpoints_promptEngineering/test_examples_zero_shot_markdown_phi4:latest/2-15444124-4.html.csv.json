    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to evaluate each part of it against the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \n- \"the gp / g in 2003\" \u2014 This refers to the \"gp / gs\" column for the year 2003.\n- \"...when the number of total point be mark as did not play always have 1 goal\" \u2014 This suggests that if \"total points\" is marked as \"did not play,\" then it should imply there is exactly one goal.\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows for evaluation:**\n   - We need to look at the years where \"total points\" are marked as \"did not play\". These years are 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004.\n\n2. **Check the \"goals\" column for these specific years:**\n   - For 2000:\n     - Goals = \"did not play\"\n   - For 2001:\n     - Goals = \"did not play\"\n   - For 2003:\n     - Goals = \"did not play\"\n   - For 2004:\n     - Goals = \"did not play\"\n\nIn all these instances where the \"total points\" are marked as \"did not play,\" the corresponding value in the \"goals\" column is also \"did not play.\" This means there were zero goals (or no recorded goals) for these years, contradicting the claim that they always have 1 goal.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because whenever \"total points\" are marked as \"did not play,\" it does not imply having exactly one goal; in fact, it indicates no goals were recorded or played.\n\n4. **Identify relevant cells for verification:**\n   - We need to check the rows corresponding to years where \"total points\" = \"did not play\". Specifically, we're interested in checking both the \"goals\" and \"gp / gs\" columns for these years:\n     - 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Row index 5: \n  - Column \"gp / gs\"\n  - Column \"goals\"\n\n- Row index 6:\n  - Column \"gp / gs\"\n  - Column \"goals\"\n\n- Row index 8:\n  - Column \"gp / gs\"\n  - Column \"goals\"\n\n- Row index 9:\n  - Column \"gp / gs\"\n  - Column \"goals\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gp / gs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gp / gs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gp / gs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gp / gs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
