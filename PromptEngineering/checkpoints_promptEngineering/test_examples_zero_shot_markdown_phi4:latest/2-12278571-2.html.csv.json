This matches the claim.\n\n3. **Score**: The claim mentions a score of \"282.\" In the table, under the column \"total\" (which represents the total strokes), Tiger Woods has a score of \"282.\" This also matches the claim.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table:\n\n- Player: \"tiger woods\" corresponds to \"Tiger Wood\" considering potential typo.\n- Finish: \"t12\" matches \"tie for 12th.\"\n- Score: \"282\" matches a score of \"282.\"\n\nSince all conditions in the claim are verified against the table and found to be true, the answer is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For the player, the relevant cell is in row index 2 under the column \"player.\"\n- For the finish, the relevant cell is in row index 2 under the column \"finish.\"\n- For the score, the relevant cell is in row index 2 under the column \"total.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This part of the claim aligns with the table.\n\n3. **Finish Position**: The claim states that this player finished \"tie for fourth.\" We need to check the \"finish\" column for \"ernie els,\" which shows \"t4,\" indicating a tie for 4th place. This portion of the claim is correct according to the table.\n\nBy examining these relevant components:\n\n- Player Name: Mismatch (\"ernie el\" vs. \"ernie els\")\n- Country: Matches (South Africa)\n- Finish Position: Matches (tie for fourth)\n\nThe primary issue here lies with the incorrect player name in the claim, which makes the overall statement false.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells that are necessary to verify this claim:\n\n- The cell containing \"player\" information at row index 0.\n- The cell containing \"country\" information at row index 0.\n- The cell containing \"finish\" information at row index 0.\n\nThus, based on the analysis, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"finish\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
