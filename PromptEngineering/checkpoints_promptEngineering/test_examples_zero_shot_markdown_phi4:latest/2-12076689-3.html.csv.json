Verify that the corresponding record for that date is indeed \"28 - 24\".\n\nLet's go through these steps using the given markdown table.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n- **Identify Row Index:** \n  We scan through each row until we find the one with the date \"may 30\". This corresponds to the last row in the provided table, which is indexed as `row_index = 23` (considering that indices start from 0).\n\n- **Check the Date:**\n  In row 23, the date column value is indeed \"may 30\".\n\n- **Verify the Record:**\n  Next, we look at the \"record\" column in the same row. The record shown there is \"28 - 24\", which matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied for the claim to be true:\n\n1. The game took place on May 30.\n2. The team's record was \"28 - 24\" following that game.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table needed to verify this claim are:\n- Row 23, Column \"date\": Contains \"may 30\"\n- Row 23, Column \"record\": Contains \"28 - 24\"\n\nThus, based on the verification process above, the claim is true. The JSON output reflecting this conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
