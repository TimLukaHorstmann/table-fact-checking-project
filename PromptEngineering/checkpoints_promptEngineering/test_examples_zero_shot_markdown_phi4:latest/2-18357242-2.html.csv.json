    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table provided, we need to verify each part of it against the relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Points Check**: The claim states that Ryan Hunter-Reay and Jimmy Vasser both have fewer than 2 points.\n   - For Ryan Hunter-Reay:\n     - Points are listed as `1`, which is not fewer than 2.\n   - For Jimmy Vasser:\n     - Points are listed as `0`, which satisfies the condition of being fewer than 2.\n\n2. **Grid Position Check**: The claim requires that both drivers have a grid position larger than 4.\n   - For Ryan Hunter-Reay:\n     - Grid is `9`, which is indeed larger than 4.\n   - For Jimmy Vasser:\n     - Grid is `16`, also larger than 4.\n\n3. **Team Membership Check**: Both should be on the American Spirit Team Johansson.\n   - For Ryan Hunter-Reay:\n     - The team column indicates \"american spirit team johansson\", which matches.\n   - For Jimmy Vasser:\n     - Similarly, the team is listed as \"american spirit team johansson\".\n\nAfter evaluating all conditions:\n\n- The points condition fails for Ryan Hunter-Reay because he has 1 point, not fewer than 2. Thus, the entire claim cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the answer to the claim is FALSE. Now, let's identify the relevant cells from the table that are needed to verify these conditions:\n\n- For Ryan Hunter-Reay:\n  - Points: Row index `12`, Column name `\"points\"`\n  - Grid: Row index `12`, Column name `\"grid\"`\n  - Team: Row index `12`, Column name `\"team\"`\n\n- For Jimmy Vasser:\n  - Points: Row index `13`, Column name `\"points\"`\n  - Grid: Row index `13`, Column name `\"grid\"`\n  - Team: Row index `13`, Column name `\"team\"`\n\nHere is the JSON object with these details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down each condition in the claim and verify it against the table:\n\n1. **Team: Patrick Racing**\n   - Identify all drivers on \"Patrick Racing\":\n     - Patrick Lemari\u00e9 (Row 9)\n\n2. **Points Less Than 2**\n   - Check if the driver(s) from \"Patrick Racing\" have fewer than 2 points:\n     - Patrick Lemari\u00e9 has 3 points.\n\n3. **Grid Number Greater Than 4**\n   - Check if any drivers on \"Patrick Racing\" have a grid number larger than 4:\n     - Patrick Lemari\u00e9 has a grid of 12, which is greater than 4.\n\nSince the only driver from \"Patrick Racing\" does not meet the condition of having fewer than 2 points, the claim about this team cannot be true. Therefore, there are no drivers on the \"Patrick Racing\" team who satisfy both conditions.\n\nNow let's evaluate the second part of the claim:\n\n4. **Drivers with Fewer Than 2 Points and Grid Larger Than 4**\n   - Identify all drivers in the table with fewer than 2 points:\n     - Mario Dominguez (Row 12)\n     - Jimmy Vasser (Row 13)\n     - Rodolfo Lav\u00edn (Row 14)\n     - Mario Haberland (Row 15)\n     - Tiago Monteiro (Row 19)\n\n   - Check if any of these drivers have a grid number larger than 4:\n     - Mario Dominguez: Grid 8\n     - Jimmy Vasser: Grid 16\n     - Rodolfo Lav\u00edn: Grid 18\n     - Mario Haberland: Grid 11\n     - Tiago Monteiro: Grid 10\n\n5. **Ryan Hunter-Reay and Oriol Servi\u00e0**\n   - Check if Ryan Hunter-Reay or Oriol Servi\u00e0 are among these drivers:\n     - Ryan Hunter-Reay (Row 11): Has 1 point, grid 9 (satisfies both conditions)\n     - Oriol Servi\u00e0 (Row 16): Has 0 points, grid 4 (does not satisfy the grid condition)\n\nSince Ryan Hunter-Reay meets all conditions but Oriol Servi\u00e0 does not, the claim is false because it incorrectly includes Oriol Servi\u00e0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim is FALSE.\n- Relevant cells to verify this are those related to \"Patrick Racing\" and drivers with fewer than 2 points and a grid larger than 4:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
