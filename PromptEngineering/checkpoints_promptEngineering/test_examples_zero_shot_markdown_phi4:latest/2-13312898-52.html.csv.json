    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess if three offensive players were drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in this table.\n\nThe key components of the claim involve:\n1. **Offensive Players**: The position of each player must be checked to see if it is typically considered an offensive role.\n2. **Drafted by the Indianapolis Colts**: We assume from context that this draft corresponds to a round where the Colts were active, but since no specific team assignments are given in the table, we rely on understanding typical positions for offense.\n\n**Offensive Positions (commonly recognized):**\n- Tight End\n- Guard\n- Quarterback\n- Running Back\n- Wide Receiver\n- Offensive Lineman (including Guards and Tackles)\n- Placekicker\n\nLet's evaluate each player from rounds 3, 4, 5, and onwards to see if they fit the offensive role:\n\n1. **Round 3:**\n   - Ben Hartsock | Position: Tight End (offensive) | College: Ohio State\n     - Offensive position.\n   - Gilbert Gardner | Position: Linebacker (defensive) | College: Purdue\n     - Defensive position.\n\n2. **Round 4:**\n   - Kendyll Pope | Position: Linebacker (defensive) | College: Florida State\n     - Defensive position.\n   - Jason David | Position: Cornerback (defensive) | College: Washington State\n     - Defensive position.\n\n3. **Round 5:**\n   - Jake Scott | Position: Guard (offensive) | College: Idaho\n     - Offensive position.\n\n4. **Rounds 6 and 7:**\n   - Von Hutchins | Position: Cornerback (defensive) | College: Mississippi\n     - Defensive position.\n   - Jim Sorgi | Position: Quarterback (offensive) | College: Wisconsin\n     - Offensive position.\n   - David Kimball | Position: Placekicker (special teams, considered offensive) | College: Penn State\n     - Offensive/Special Teams position.\n\nSummarizing the analysis:\n- Ben Hartsock (Tight End) is an offensive player.\n- Jake Scott (Guard) is an offensive player.\n- Jim Sorgi (Quarterback) is an offensive player.\n- David Kimball (Placekicker) can be considered part of special teams/offense.\n\nTherefore, three players identified as playing offensive positions are Ben Hartsock, Jake Scott, and Jim Sorgi. \n\nSince the table does not explicitly specify which team drafted each player but based on typical draft round assignments for a team like Indianapolis Colts and common knowledge that these rounds (2-7) could include picks by them, we will assume it is plausible they were picked.\n\nThus, the claim \"3 offensive players be draft by the indianapolis colt\" can reasonably be considered TRUE.

Row 0: bob sanders\n2. Row 1: ben hartsock\n3. Row 2: gilbert gardner\n4. Row 3: kendyll pope\n5. Row 4: jason david\n6. Row 5: jake scott\n7. Row 6: von hutchins\n8. Row 7: jim sorgi\n9. Row 8: david kimball\n\nThere are a total of 9 players listed in the table.\n\nThe claim states that \"10 players\" were drafted, which does not align with our count of 9 players. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo complete the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates the claim is false and provides the relevant cells (the `name` column in each row) used to verify the player count.",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the first player select by the colt in this draft be bob sander,\" we need to check if Bob Sanders is indeed the first player selected by the Colts in this draft.\n\nThe table provides information about players selected in a draft, with each row representing a selection. The relevant columns for verifying the claim are:\n\n1. **Round**: Indicates which round of the draft the player was picked.\n2. **Pick**: Shows the pick number within that round.\n3. **Name**: Provides the name of the player.\n\nThe first player selected in any draft would be in the earliest round and have the lowest pick number within that round. Here, we look for the smallest values in the \"round\" and \"pick\" columns.\n\n- The first row has a \"round\" value of 2 and a \"pick\" value of 12.\n- Comparing this with other rows, no other player is selected earlier (i.e., in a lower round or with a smaller pick number within the same round).\n\nThe name corresponding to the smallest \"round\" and \"pick\" values is Bob Sanders. Therefore, Bob Sanders was indeed the first player selected by the Colts in this draft.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"round\"\n- Row 0, Column \"pick\"\n- Row 0, Column \"name\"\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
