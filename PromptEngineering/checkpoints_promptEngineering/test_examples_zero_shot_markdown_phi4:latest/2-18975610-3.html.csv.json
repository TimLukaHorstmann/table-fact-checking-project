    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down and verify each part of the claim against the data in the markdown table:\n\n1. **Claim Part 1: \"red cliff have no bye\"**\n   - Look at the row for \"red cliffs\".\n   - Check the \"byes\" column to see if it contains a value.\n   - In the table, for \"red cliffs\", the \"byes\" value is `0`.\n   - The claim states there are no byes, and indeed, there are 0 byes.\n\n2. **Claim Part 2: \"less than 4 loss\"**\n   - Again, look at the row for \"red cliffs\".\n   - Check the \"losses\" column to see how many losses there are.\n   - In the table, for \"red cliffs\", the \"losses\" value is `18`.\n   - The claim states that losses should be less than 4. Here, it's 18, which does not satisfy the condition of being less than 4.\n\n3. **Claim Part 3: \"more than 2494 against\"**\n   - Look at the row for \"red cliffs\".\n   - Check the \"against\" column to see what the value is.\n   - In the table, for \"red cliffs\", the \"against\" value is `2422`.\n   - The claim states that this should be more than 2494. Here, it's 2422, which does not satisfy being more than 2494.\n\nBased on these checks:\n- The condition of having no byes (0) is satisfied.\n- The conditions regarding losses (less than 4) and against value (more than 2494) are not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim cannot be considered TRUE because it does not meet all specified conditions. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells to check this claim:\n\n- For \"no bye\", we look at `row_index: 8` and `column_name: \"byes\"`.\n- For \"less than 4 loss\", we look at `row_index: 8` and `column_name: \"losses\"`.\n- For \"more than 2494 against\", we look at `row_index: 8` and `column_name: \"against\"`.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"byes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
