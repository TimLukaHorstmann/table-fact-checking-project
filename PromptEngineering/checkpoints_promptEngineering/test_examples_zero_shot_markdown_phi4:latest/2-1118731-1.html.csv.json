    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table for entries related to the year 1972 and check if the power of the engine is given in horsepower (hp) or kilowatts (kw).\n\n1. Locate the rows corresponding to the year 1972:\n   - The row with \"generation: i\", \"years: 1972\" specifies a \"455in cubic oldsmobile v8\" engine.\n\n2. Check the relevant column for power information:\n   - For the identified row, the \"power\" column entry is \"-\".\n\n3. Analyze the claim against this data:\n   - The claim states that \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\".\n   - Since the power value is \"-\", it indicates that no specific power information is provided.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The absence of a specified power value supports the claim that the power is not given in horsepower or kilowatts for the 1972 engine.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\". The relevant cell from the table is at row index 2 (considering zero-based indexing) and column name \"power\".\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
