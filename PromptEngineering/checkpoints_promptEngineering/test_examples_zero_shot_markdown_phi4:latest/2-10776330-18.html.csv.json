This date suggests that these games are part of the VFL's 1961 season. However, determining if this was the 65th season requires historical knowledge about the league rather than specific data within the table itself.\n\nThe Victorian Football League (VFL) began in 1897. To find out which season 1961 corresponds to:\n\n- Count the number of seasons from 1897 up to and including 1961.\n- The first season is 1897, so 1961 would be the 65th season because \\(1961 - 1897 + 1 = 65\\).\n\nThus, based on historical context rather than specific data points in the table, we can confirm that the claim about the 1961 VFL season being the 65th is true.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two main conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **The Venue with the Least Amount of Crowd:**\n   - We'll check each row's \"crowd\" column to find out which venue had the least number of attendees.\n   \n2. **The Match between Essendon and Collingwood:**\n   - Verify if this match took place at the venue identified as having the least crowd.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Venue with the Least Crowd\nWe need to compare the \"crowd\" values in each row:\n- Footscray vs. Geelong at Western Oval had a crowd of **42,015**.\n- Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval had a crowd of **12,815**.\n- Carlton vs. Melbourne at Princes Park had a crowd of **21,863**.\n- St Kilda vs. North Melbourne at Junction Oval had a crowd of **24,250**.\n- Richmond vs. Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval had a crowd of **15,177**.\n- Essendon vs. Collingwood at Windy Hill had a crowd of **18,500**.\n\nFrom these values, the smallest crowd is **12,815**, which corresponds to the match between Fitzroy and South Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Essendon vs. Collingwood was at Brunswick Street Oval\n- The match between Essendon and Collingwood took place at Windy Hill with a crowd of **18,500**.\n- Since Brunswick Street Oval hosted the Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne match (and not the Essendon vs. Collingwood match), this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that \"brunswick street oval be the venue with the least amount of crowd and it be when essendon play collingwood.\" While Brunswick Street Oval did have the least crowd, it was for a different match (Fitzroy vs. South Melbourne), not Essendon vs. Collingwood.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The \"crowd\" column for each row to identify the smallest value.\n- The \"venue\" and \"home team\" columns to verify which match took place at Brunswick Street Oval and compare it with the Essendon vs. Collingwood match.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two key parts:\n1. When Essendon is the home team and Collingwood is the away team, check if Essendon has a score of 25.29 (179) as stated.\n2. Verify that this 25.29 (179) score is indeed the highest on the table.\n3. Check if Collingwood has the lowest score mentioned, which is 8.15 (63).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identifying Relevant Match:**\n   - Look for a row where Essendon is listed as the \"home team\" and Collingwood as the \"away team.\"\n   - According to the table, this occurs in row index 5.\n\n2. **Verify Scores for This Match:**\n   - For row index 5, check \"essendon\" under \"home team\" and \"collingwood\" under \"away team\".\n   - The scores are \"12.16 (88)\" for Essendon and \"13.10 (88)\" for Collingwood.\n   - Therefore, the claim that Essendon scored 25.29 (179) is FALSE.\n\n3. **Check Highest Score:**\n   - Review all \"home team score\" entries to find the highest score:\n     - footscray: 12.12 (84)\n     - fitzroy: 25.29 (179)\n     - carlton: 13.12 (90)\n     - st kilda: 10.12 (72)\n     - richmond: 8.8 (56)\n     - essendon: 12.16 (88)\n\n   - The highest score is indeed 25.29 (179) by Fitzroy in row index 1, not Essendon.\n\n4. **Check Lowest Score:**\n   - Review all \"away team score\" entries to find the lowest score:\n     - geelong: 8.15 (63)\n     - south melbourne: 11.10 (76)\n     - melbourne: 13.13 (91)\n     - north melbourne: 9.13 (67)\n     - hawthorn: 11.15 (81)\n     - collingwood: 13.10 (88)\n\n   - The lowest score is indeed 8.15 (63) by Geelong in row index 0, not Collingwood.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE as Essendon did not have the highest score of 25.29 (179), and Collingwood did not have the lowest score of 8.15 (63).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The cells relevant to verifying this are:\n  - Row index 1, \"home team score\" for Fitzroy's high score.\n  - Row index 0, \"away team score\" for Geelong's low score.\n  - Row index 5, all columns related to the Essendon vs. Collingwood match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
