    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the latest stage win by Mikhail Ignatiev was Stage 6\" is true or false, we need to examine the table and identify the relevant information.\n\n1. **Identify Rows Relevant to Mikhail Ignatiev:**\n   - We first locate where Mikhail Ignatiev's name appears in the column labeled \"winner.\" This indicates that he won a stage.\n   - Upon examining the table:\n     - In row 6, under the \"stage\" column (index 0), it is marked as 6, and under the \"winner\" column (index 1), it shows \"mikhail ignatiev.\"\n\n2. **Determine If It's the Latest Stage Win:**\n   - We need to ensure there are no rows beyond row 6 where Mikhail Ignatiev appears as a winner.\n   - Looking at row 7, the winner is listed as \"edvald boasson hagen,\" not Mikhail Ignatiev.\n\n3. **Conclude Based on Findings:**\n   - Since Mikhail Ignatiev only wins in stage 6 and no further stages list him as the winner, his latest stage win is indeed Stage 6.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"stage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- The relevant cells to verify the claim include the row where Mikhail Ignatiev is listed as a winner (Stage 6) and checking subsequent stages for any further wins by him.",

Identify the relevant column: The \"winner\" column contains information about who won each stage.\n2. Locate where \"Daniele Bennati\" appears in this column and note the corresponding row index (stage).\n3. Determine if \"Daniele Bennati\" is listed as a winner for any stages after stage 6.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n- In the table, Daniele Bennati is listed as the winner in stage 3.\n- There are no other entries for Daniele Bennati as a winner from stages 4 to 7.\n\nSince Daniele Bennati's latest win occurs in stage 3 and not after or at stage 6, the claim that his latest stage win is 6 is incorrect. Thus, the statement is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are those where \"Daniele Bennati\" appears as a winner:\n\n- Row index 2 (stage 3) under the column \"winner\".\n\nThe JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
