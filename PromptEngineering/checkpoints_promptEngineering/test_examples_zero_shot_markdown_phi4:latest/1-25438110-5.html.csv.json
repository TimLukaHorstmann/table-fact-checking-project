Washoe having the \"most casinos\" on this road.\n\n### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Road \"i - 80\":**\n   - We need to find which rows have \"i - 80\" in the \"road\" column.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 2: washoe, i - 80\n     - Row 3: elko, i - 80\n\n2. **Count Casinos on Road \"i - 80\":**\n   - For row 2 (washoe): There are 32 casinos.\n   - For row 3 (elko): There are 17 casinos.\n\n3. **Compare Casino Counts:**\n   - Washoe has 32 casinos, and Elko has 17 casinos on the road \"i - 80.\"\n   - Therefore, Washoe indeed has more casinos than any other county on this road based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is fully supported by the table.
