    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table, we need to verify several components mentioned in the claim against the corresponding entries in the provided table. The claim states:\n\n1. \"On June 9\" - We need to find this date in the 'date' column.\n2. \"The record be 28 - 29\" - This refers to the 'record' column and needs to match with the entry for June 9.\n3. \"with a loss of mulholland (5 - 6)\" - This corresponds to the 'loss' column, which must list \"mulholland (5 - 6)\" as the value.\n4. \"and an opponent of the yankee\" - The 'opponent' column should state \"yankees.\"\n\nLet's go through these checks with reference to the table:\n\n1. **Date Check:**\n   - Find the row where the date is June 9.\n\n2. **Record Check:**\n   - Verify that for this date, the record reads \"28 - 29\".\n\n3. **Loss Check:**\n   - Confirm that the loss is attributed to \"mulholland (5 - 6)\".\n\n4. **Opponent Check:**\n   - Ensure that the opponent mentioned is \"yankees.\"\n\nBy examining the table, we find:\n\n- The row with date \"june 9\" corresponds to `row_index = 8`.\n- In this row, the 'record' column shows \"28 - 29\".\n- The 'loss' column indicates \"mulholland (5 - 6)\".\n- The 'opponent' column states \"yankees\".\n\nSince all components of the claim match the data in the table for June 9:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
