    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding the game with the highest attendance on April 18 against the Rangers, we need to analyze the \"attendance\" column in the table for each game.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: We focus on the \"attendance\" column since it contains the data needed to verify which game had the highest attendance.\n\n2. **Compare Attendance Values**:\n   - Check all entries under the \"attendance\" column.\n   - Find the maximum value in this column.\n\n3. **Locate April 18 Game**:\n   - Identify the row corresponding to April 18 and note its attendance.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - If the attendance on April 18 is equal to the highest attendance found, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n- Highest attendance values from the table are as follows:\n  - April 1: 40299\n  - April 2: 31310\n  - April 4: 26331\n  - April 5: 31226\n  - April 6: 29106\n  - April 8: Postponed (no attendance)\n  - April 9: 746\n  - April 10: 14180\n  - April 11: Postponed (no attendance)\n  - April 12: Postponed (no attendance)\n  - April 13: 19143\n  - April 14: 25642\n  - April 15: 25582\n  - April 16: 26139\n  - **April 18**: 30452\n  - April 19: 44206\n  - April 20: 34333\n  - April 21: 13413\n  - April 22: 13353\n  - April 23: 13117\n  - April 25: 31215\n  - April 26: 31420\n  - April 27: 32160\n  - April 29: 12533\n  - April 30: 13004\n\n- The highest attendance recorded is on **April 19** with an attendance of 44206.\n\nSince the game on April 18 had an attendance of 30452, it is not the highest.

Let's look at those:\n  - **April 1**: Score is 6 - 5 (10) = Total runs = 11\n  - **April 21**: Score is 5 - 4 (13) = Total runs = 9\n  - **April 23**: Score is 5 - 4 (10) = Total runs = 9\n  - **April 29**: Score is 6 - 5 (10) = Total runs = 11\n\nNone of these games exceed the total of 21 runs from April 25.

Identify if there was a game against the White Sox with an attendance of less than 500.\n2. Confirm if this game had the lowest attendance among all games listed in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Games Against White Sox:**\n   - The relevant rows for games against the White Sox are those where \"opponent\" is \"white sox\".\n   - From the table, these rows are 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n2. **Check Attendance for These Games:**\n   - Row 0 (April 1): Attendance = 40299\n   - Row 1 (April 2): Attendance = 31310\n   - Row 6 (April 8): The game was postponed.\n   - Row 7 (April 9): Attendance = 746\n   - Row 8 (April 10): Attendance = 14180\n\n3. **Determine if Any White Sox Game Had Less Than 500 Attendance:**\n   - Among these, only row 7 has an attendance of 746, which is less than 1000 but not less than 500.\n   - No game against the White Sox had an attendance of less than 500.\n\n4. **Find the Least Attended Game Overall:**\n   - Compare all \"attendance\" values across all rows:\n     - The lowest attendance value in the table is 746 (Row 7, April 9).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There was no game against the White Sox with less than 500 attendees.\n   - Row 7 (April 9) had the least attendance among all games listed but not specifically for a White Sox game.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because there was no game against the White Sox with less than 500 attendees.
