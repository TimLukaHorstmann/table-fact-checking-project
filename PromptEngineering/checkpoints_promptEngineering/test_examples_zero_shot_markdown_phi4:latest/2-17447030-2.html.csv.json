    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine the \"record\" column for each entry.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement suggests that exactly one row in the table should have the record \"5 - 3\".\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - We need to look at each row and check if any of them has the \"record\" value as \"5 - 3\".\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - The relevant rows for verification are those where the \"record\" column is listed.\n   - Specifically, we want to identify which rows have a record of \"5 - 3\" and how many such rows exist.\n\n4. **Check Each Row**:\n   - Row 0: Record is \"6 - 4 (1)\"\n   - Row 1: Record is \"5 - 4 (1)\"\n   - Row 2: Record is \"5 - 3 (1)\" \u2014 This matches the record we're checking for.\n   - Row 3: Record is \"5 - 2 (1)\"\n   - Row 4: Record is \"4 - 2 (1)\"\n   - Row 5: Record is \"3 - 2 (1)\"\n   - Row 6: Record is \"3 - 1 (1)\"\n   - Row 7: Record is \"3 - 1\"\n   - Row 8: Record is \"3 - 0\"\n   - Row 9: Record is \"2 - 0\"\n   - Row 10: Record is \"1 - 0\"\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Occurrences**:\n   - Only row 2 has a record of \"5 - 3 (1)\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since only one row meets the condition, the claim is true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON response with relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
