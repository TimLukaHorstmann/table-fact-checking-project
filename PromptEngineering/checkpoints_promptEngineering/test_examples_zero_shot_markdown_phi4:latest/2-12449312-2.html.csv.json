However, since the table provides total gold medals per game but not broken down by country, we cannot directly compare Chile's performance year over year from the provided data alone.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant part of the claim using the available data:\n\n1. **First Game (1951)**: \n   - According to the table, in 1951, there were 9 gold medals awarded.\n   \n2. **Chile\u2019s Gold Medal Record**: \n   - The table does not provide a breakdown by country; it only lists total gold medals per year.\n   - Without additional data indicating which countries won those medals each year, we cannot confirm whether Chile won the most gold medals in 1951 compared to any other year.\n\nSince there is no information within the provided table regarding which specific countries received the gold medals, we lack the necessary evidence to verify if Chile indeed got its highest count of gold medals during the first Pan-American games.

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"Chile won the most silver medals it has ever won in 2011,\" we need to check if the number of silver medals won by Chile in 2011 is greater than or equal to the number of silver medals won in any other year.\n\nFrom the table, we focus on the column labeled \"silver\" and check for all years:\n\n- **1951**: 20 silver\n- **1955**: 7 silver\n- **1959**: 2 silver\n- **1963**: 2 silver\n- **1967**: 1 silver\n- **1971**: 3 silver\n- **1975**: 0 silver\n- **1979**: 4 silver\n- **1983**: 3 silver\n- **1987**: 2 silver\n- **1991**: 1 silver\n- **1995**: 6 silver\n- **1999**: 4 silver\n- **2003**: 10 silver\n- **2007**: 5 silver\n- **2011**: 16 silver\n\nWe can see that in the year 2011, Chile won 16 silver medals. Comparing this to all other years listed, 16 is indeed the highest number of silver medals won by Chile in any given year according to this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Chile won the most silver medals it has ever won in 2011\" is supported by the data.\n\nRelevant cells include each row's silver medal count and particularly for the year 2011:\n\n- All rows with their respective \"silver\" column values\n- Specifically, the row corresponding to 2011\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
