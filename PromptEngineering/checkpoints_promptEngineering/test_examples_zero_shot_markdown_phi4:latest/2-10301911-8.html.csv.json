    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the rider in third position indeed has a time of \"1:19.02.8\". \n\nFirst, identify the relevant column and row from the table:\n- The column for positions is labeled as \"place\".\n- The column for times is labeled as \"time\".\n\nNext, locate the row corresponding to the third position:\n- Check the \"place\" column for the value \"3\", which indicates the rider in third position.\n\nOnce we find the correct row:\n- Verify if the \"time\" column for this row matches \"1:19.02.8\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps using the table data:\n\n1. Locate the row where \"place\" is 3.\n   - In row index 2 (since markdown tables are typically zero-indexed), the \"place\" value is indeed 3.\n\n2. Check the \"time\" for this row:\n   - For row index 2, the \"time\" value is \"1:19.02.8\".\n\nBoth conditions are met, so the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"rider fred launchbury from east germany reach a speed of 84.25 mph,\" we need to verify two specific aspects based on the table: \n\n1. The rider's name is Fred Launchbury.\n2. The country associated with Fred Launchbury is East Germany.\n3. The speed achieved by Fred Launchbury is 84.25 mph.\n\nLet\u2019s check each condition against the relevant data in the table:\n\n- **Rider:** We need to find \"fred launchbury\" in the rider column. In row 5, the rider is listed as \"fred launchbury.\"\n  \n- **Country:** For Fred Launchbury's entry (row 5), we must check the country. It shows \"united kingdom,\" not \"east germany.\"\n\n- **Speed:** Finally, for row 5, verify if the speed is 84.25 mph. Indeed, it matches the claimed speed.\n\nThe claim fails because, although the rider name and speed are correct, the associated country is incorrect. Thus, Fred Launchbury is from the United Kingdom, not East Germany.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- Row 5, \"rider\" for verifying the name.\n- Row 5, \"country\" for checking the country of origin.\n- Row 5, \"speed\" for confirming the speed value.\n\nGiven that one of these conditions (the country) is incorrect, we conclude that the claim is false. \n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
