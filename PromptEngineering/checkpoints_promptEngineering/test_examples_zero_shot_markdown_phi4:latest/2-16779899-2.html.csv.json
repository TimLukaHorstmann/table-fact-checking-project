    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The game on December 14, 1986, falls in week 15.\n2. The result of this game was a loss with a score of 34 - 3.\n\nLet's examine these conditions against the provided table data:\n\n- **Condition 1: Date and Week Check**\n  - Locate the row where \"date\" is \"December 14, 1986\".\n  - Verify that the corresponding \"week\" value is 15.\n\n- **Condition 2: Result Verification**\n  - For the identified date (December 14, 1986), check the \"result\" column to confirm it reads \"l 34 - 3\".\n\nNow, let's verify these using the relevant cells:\n\n1. The row with \"date\": December 14, 1986, is found at `row_index: 15`.\n2. In this row:\n   - The \"week\" value is 15.\n   - The \"result\" value is \"l 34 - 3\".\n\nBoth conditions from the claim match perfectly with the table data.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim is fully supported by the table.\n  \nThe relevant cells that verify the claim are located in `row_index: 15` for both the \"week\" and \"result\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON response summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine specific conditions mentioned in it and compare them against the provided table.\n\nThe claim states: \"week 15th 's game on december 14 , 1986 be a win of 34 - 3\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant components of this claim:\n\n1. **Week**: The claim mentions \"week 15th.\" We should check row corresponding to week 15.\n\n2. **Date**: The claim specifies the date as \"december 14 , 1986.\" We need to verify if this matches the date in the table for week 15.\n\n3. **Result**: The claim states that the game result was a win with a score of \"34 - 3.\" This implies two things: \n   - The team won the game.\n   - The final score should be 34-3 (with our team scoring more than 3).\n\nLet's locate these relevant details in the table for week 15:\n\n- **Row corresponding to Week 15**:\n  - **Week**: 15\n  - **Date**: December 14, 1986\n  - **Result**: l 34 - 3\n  - **Attendance**: 58062\n\nNow let's verify each part of the claim against this data:\n\n1. The row for week 15 corresponds to \"December 14, 1986,\" which matches the date given in the claim.\n2. However, the result recorded is \"l 34 - 3,\" indicating a loss (denoted by 'l'). Additionally, the score was 34-3, not a win.\n\nGiven this information:\n- The game took place on December 14, 1986.\n- The team lost the game with a score of 34-3.\n\nSince the claim incorrectly states that it was a \"win,\" and instead the result shows a loss ('l'), the entire claim is false. \n\nThus, the answer to whether this claim is TRUE or FALSE is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
