    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify several components of it against the table:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim states \"april 1939\". From the table, all games occurred on \"29 april 1939\", so this condition is met.\n\n2. **Teams**: The claim mentions a match between \"hawthorn\" and \"north melbourne\".\n\n3. **Score**: The claim says \"17 to 11\". We need to check:\n   - Hawthorn's score: \"17.13 (115)\" which translates to 17 goals and 13 behinds.\n   - North Melbourne's score: \"11.11 (77)\" which translates to 11 goals and 11 behinds.\n\n4. **Result Interpretation**: The claim uses the term \"destroyed\", implying a significant victory by Hawthorn over North Melbourne. We need to check if this is reflected in the scores:\n   - Hawthorn's score: 115 points\n   - North Melbourne's score: 77 points\n\nThe difference in score is \\(115 - 77 = 38\\) points, which is a notable margin but may or may not be considered \"destroyed\" depending on interpretation. However, the claim does accurately reflect the scores.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells from the table to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row**: The match between Hawthorn and North Melbourne is in row index 0.\n- **Columns**:\n  - \"home team\": Should be \"hawthorn\".\n  - \"away team\": Should be \"north melbourne\".\n  - \"home team score\": Should be \"17.13 (115)\".\n  - \"away team score\": Should be \"11.11 (77)\".\n  - \"date\": Should include \"29 april 1939\".\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 0, Column: \"home team\"\n- Row index 0, Column: \"away team\"\n- Row index 0, Column: \"home team score\"\n- Row index 0, Column: \"away team score\"\n- Any row, Column: \"date\" (since all dates match)\n\nBased on the verification above, the claim is factually correct in terms of date, teams, and scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the relevant rows for Essendon and North Melbourne from the table.\n2. Check the attendance figures for each row in the table to find the lowest number.\n3. Compare these findings against the claim.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Row 0**: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne, attendance: 11,000\n- **Row 1**: Fitzroy vs St Kilda, attendance: 15,000\n- **Row 2**: Essendon vs Melbourne, attendance: 20,000\n- **Row 3**: Richmond vs Footscray, attendance: 26,000\n- **Row 4**: South Melbourne vs Collingwood, attendance: 17,000\n- **Row 5**: Geelong vs Carlton, attendance: 15,000\n\nThe lowest attended game is Row 0 (Hawthorn vs North Melbourne) with an attendance of 11,000.
