    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The game played on March 28.\n2. Whether the opponent for this game was indeed the Colorado Rockies.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n- **Identify the row corresponding to March 28:**\n  - We will look at the \"march\" column to find the entry where the value is 28.\n\n- **Verify the opponent for that specific date (March 28):**\n  - Once we identify the correct row, we need to check the \"opponent\" column in that row to see if it matches \"colorado rockies\".\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. Locate the row where \"march\" is equal to 28:\n   - Row index: 13 (since indexing starts from zero, this corresponds to game number 74).\n\n2. Check the opponent for the identified row:\n   - In row index 13, under the column \"opponent\", we find \"colorado rockies\".\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- The game played on March 28 involved the Colorado Rockies as opponents.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE. Now, let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- The cell in the \"march\" column where the value is 28 (row index 13).\n- The cell in the \"opponent\" column for that row (row index 13) to verify it says \"colorado rockies\".\n\nHere is the JSON response summarizing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Hence, there's no opponent listed for that date.\n- Therefore, the claim \"the opponent that be present on march 24 be the colorado rockies\" cannot be true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
