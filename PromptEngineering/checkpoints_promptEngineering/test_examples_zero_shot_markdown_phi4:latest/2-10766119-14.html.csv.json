    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to examine the table and focus on two specific columns: \"venue\" and \"crowd\". The claim states that Victoria Park had the largest crowd during a match in the 1928 VFL season.\n\nFirst, let's identify all entries where \"Victoria Park\" is listed as the venue:\n\n- **Row Index 2**: \n  - Venue: Victoria Park\n  - Crowd: 30000\n\nNow, we need to compare this crowd size with the crowd sizes of all other matches in the table to verify if it is indeed the largest.\n\nLet's list all \"crowd\" values from each row:\n- **Row Index 0**: 11000\n- **Row Index 1**: 14000\n- **Row Index 2**: 30000 (Victoria Park)\n- **Row Index 3**: 10000\n- **Row Index 4**: 13562\n- **Row Index 5**: 16000\n\nBy examining these values, we can see that the largest crowd is indeed 30000, which corresponds to the match held at Victoria Park.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"victoria park venue have the largest crowd in the 1928 vfl season\" is TRUE. The relevant cells for this verification are:\n- The cell with \"venue\": Victoria Park (Row Index 2)\n- The cell with \"crowd\": 30000 (Row Index 2)\n\nAdditionally, to ensure no larger crowd exists elsewhere, we check all other \"crowd\" values from the table.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare the scores of Essendon as an away team and Hawthorn as an away team from the table.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows:**\n   - The match where Essendon is playing as the away team is in row 5.\n   - The match where Hawthorn is playing as the away team is in row 3.\n\n2. **Extract scores for comparison:**\n   - In row 5, Essendon's score as an away team is \"18.11 (119)\".\n   - In row 3, Hawthorn's score as an away team is \"11.13 (79)\".\n\n3. **Convert the scores to numerical values:**\n   - Essendon: \\(18 \\times 6 + 11 = 108 + 11 = 119\\)\n   - Hawthorn: \\(11 \\times 6 + 13 = 66 + 13 = 79\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the difference in scores:**\n   - Difference = Essendon's score - Hawthorn's score = 119 - 79 = 40\n\n5. **Compare with the claim:**\n   - The claim states that Essendon has a higher score by 6.35 points than Hawthorn.\n   - Since the actual difference is 40, not 6.35, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells for verification:**\n   - For Essendon (row 5): \"away team score\" column\n   - For Hawthorn (row 3): \"away team score\" column\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
