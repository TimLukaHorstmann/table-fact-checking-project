Locate the row where the \"overall\" score is 16:\n   - According to the table, in the year 2010, the \"overall\" score is 16. This corresponds to the sixth row (index 5 when considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. Check the \"super g\" value for this specific season:\n   - For the year 2010, the \"super g\" value given in the table is indeed 9.\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied by examining these relevant cells:\n\n- The overall score of 16 corresponds to row index 5.\n- In that same row (index 5), the super G value is confirmed as 9.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim \"the super g value for the season that have an overall score of 16 be 9\" is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"super g\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
