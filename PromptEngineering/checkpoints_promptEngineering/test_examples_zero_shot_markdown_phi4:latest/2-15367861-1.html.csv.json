    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point,\" we need to verify two conditions for the Corinthians team in the table:\n\n1. **Points Scored**: Check if Corinthians scored more than 25 points.\n2. **Losses**: Verify if there were any losses when this condition was met.\n\nThe relevant column for checking the points scored by each team is \"points.\" The column indicating losses is \"lost.\"\n\nLet's examine the data for Corinthians:\n\n- From the table, the row for Corinthians (row index 5) shows:\n  - Points: 22\n  - Lost: 10\n\nFrom this information:\n1. **Points Scored**: Corinthians scored only 22 points, which is less than 25.\n2. **Losses**: They have 10 losses.\n\nSince Corinthians did not score over 25 points at any point, the condition of scoring more than 25 and having zero losses when doing so is vacuously true (as they never met the initial condition).\n\nThus, the claim holds because there were no instances where Corinthians scored over 25 points; hence, there couldn't have been any losses under that condition.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The \"points\" column for row index 5.\n- The \"lost\" column for row index 5.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the specific details provided in the table regarding the team \"corinthians.\" The claim states: \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 point.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant parts of this claim:\n\n1. **Team Identification**: We are looking for information about the team \"corinthians.\"\n2. **Points Condition**: The table should show that \"corinthians\" have amassed 22 points.\n3. **Losses Condition**: Verify if \"corinthians\" have less than 11 losses.\n\nNow, let's identify and examine these details in the table:\n\n- Locate the row for \"corinthians\":\n  - In row with `position` 6, we find the team name \"corinthians.\"\n  \n- Check the points:\n  - The \"points\" column shows that \"corinthians\" have 22 points.\n  \n- Verify the losses:\n  - The \"lost\" column for \"corinthians\" shows they have 10 losses.\n\nSince the conditions of having 22 points and less than 11 losses are both satisfied, the claim is TRUE.
