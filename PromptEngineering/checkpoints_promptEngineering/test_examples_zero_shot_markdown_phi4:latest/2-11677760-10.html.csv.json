    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n1. Billy Owens is from California.\n2. He was a first-round draft pick in 1993.\n\nLet's break down each part of the claim and check the relevant cells from the table:\n\n### Part 1: \"Billy Owen's be the only player from California on the team\"\n- Check each player's hometown for California:\n  - Alonzo Mourning: Chesapeake, VA\n  - Chris Jackson: Gulfport, MS\n  - Chris Mills: Los Angeles, CA (relevant cell)\n  - Billy Owens: Carlisle, PA\n  - Kenny Williams: Elizabeth City, NC\n\nFrom this, we see that only Chris Mills is from California. Therefore, the claim that Billy Owens is from California is false.\n\n### Part 2: \"and be a 1st round draft pick in 1993\"\n- Check Billy Owens' NBA Draft details:\n  - Year of draft: 1st round - 3rd pick of 1991 (relevant cell)\n  \nBilly Owens was drafted in 1991, not 1993. Thus, this part of the claim is also false.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are false, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Chris Mills' hometown: Los Angeles, CA\n- Billy Owens' draft year and pick\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Chris Mills is the tallest player:**\n   - We compare the heights provided for each player:\n     - Alonzo Mourning: 6'10\"\n     - Chris Jackson: 6'0\"\n     - Chris Mills: 6'7\"\n     - Billy Owens: 6'9\"\n     - Kenny Williams: 6'10\"\n\n   - The tallest players according to the heights are Alonzo Mourning and Kenny Williams, both at 6'10\". Therefore, Chris Mills is not the tallest player.\n\n2. **Billy Owens is the shortest player:**\n   - From the list of heights:\n     - Chris Jackson is 6'0\", which is shorter than Billy Owens' height of 6'9\".\n   \n   - Thus, Billy Owens is not the shortest player; Chris Jackson is the shortest.\n\n3. **Both be selected for the NBA:**\n   - Both players mentioned in the claim were indeed drafted into the NBA:\n     - Chris Mills was drafted 1st round - 22nd pick of 1993 draft (Cavs).\n     - Billy Owens was drafted 1st round - 3rd pick of 1991 draft (Kings).\n\n   - This part of the claim is true.\n\nSince parts one and two of the claim are false, the entire claim is FALSE.
