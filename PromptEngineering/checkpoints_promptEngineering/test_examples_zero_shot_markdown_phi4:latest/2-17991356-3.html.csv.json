    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"all of the 7 players in the 2003 PGA Championship were from the United States,\" we need to focus on two key aspects:\n\n1. The **country** column: We must check if all listed players are from the United States.\n2. The **year won** column: Although not explicitly part of the claim, verifying that these records pertain to winners prior to 2003 is implicit in evaluating a historical context.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- For each player:\n  - Check the \"country\" column to confirm if they are from the United States.\n  - Verify the \"year won\" to ensure it does not include any year after or including 2003, as this would imply inclusion of players post-2003.\n\nNow, let's verify these points:\n\n| Player        | Country       | Year Won |\n|---------------|---------------|----------|\n| Paul Azinger  | United States | 1993     |\n| Davis Love III| United States | 1997     |\n| Mark Brooks   | United States | 1996     |\n| John Daly     | United States | 1991     |\n| Bob Tway      | United States | 1986     |\n| Jeff Sluman   | United States | 1988     |\n| Rich Beem     | United States | 2002     |\n\n- All players listed are from the United States.\n- The latest year recorded is 2002, which means all these records precede the 2003 PGA Championship.\n\nSince the claim pertains to the 2003 event and we have only information up until 2002, there's no data suggesting any player other than those listed. Therefore, based on the given data:\n\n- All players are from the United States.\n- None of these records include the year 2003 or later.\n\nThus, it can be concluded that all winners recorded in this table prior to the 2003 PGA Championship were indeed from the United States, supporting the claim as true under the assumption that no other winners post-2002 and pre-2003 are missing here.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"5 of the 7 2003 PGA Championship players have to par +11,\" we need to examine each player's performance in the provided table and check if they match the condition specified.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The column \"to par\" is relevant because it specifies the number of strokes over or under par for each player.\n2. **Count Entries with 'to par' Equal to '+11':** We need to count how many players have a \"to par\" value of \"+11\".\n3. **Verify Number of Players:** The claim states that 5 out of 7 players in the 2003 PGA Championship had \"to par +11\". However, we notice from the table's years column that none of the entries correspond to the year 2003.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0 (Paul Azinger):** Year won = 1993, To Par = \"+9\"\n- **Row 1 (Davis Love III):** Year won = 1997, To Par = \"+9\"\n- **Row 2 (Mark Brooks):** Year won = 1996, To Par = \"+11\"\n- **Row 3 (John Daly):** Year won = 1991, To Par = \"+11\"\n- **Row 4 (Bob Tway):** Year won = 1986, To Par = \"+11\"\n- **Row 5 (Jeff Sluman):** Year won = 1988, To Par = \"+14\"\n- **Row 6 (Rich Beem):** Year won = 2002, To Par = \"+17\"\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- Only three players have \"to par +11\": Mark Brooks, John Daly, and Bob Tway.\n- No player listed is from the year 2003.\n\nThus, the claim does not hold because there are no entries for the 2003 PGA Championship in the table, making it impossible to verify if 5 of the players had a \"to par +11.\"\n\nThe answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\" The relevant cells are those that contain \"to par\" values and the \"year won\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
