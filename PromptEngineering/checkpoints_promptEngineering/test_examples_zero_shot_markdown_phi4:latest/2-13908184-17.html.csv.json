The claim mentions a player named \"Randy Andreachuk.\"\n2. It specifies that his position should be \"center.\"\n3. It asserts he was drafted first.\n\nLet's break down these conditions using the table data:\n\n- **Player Name:** We locate Randy Andreachuk in the table.\n  - In row index 3, the player is listed as \"Randy Andreachuk.\"\n\n- **Position:** The position should be \"center.\"\n  - In row index 3, under the column \"position,\" it states \"center.\" This matches the claim.\n\n- **Draft Order:** The draft order must be first.\n  - Draft order is indicated by the \"round\" column. \n  - In row index 3, the round number is 4. This indicates that Randy Andreachuk was drafted in the 4th round, not the 1st.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- While the player's name and position match the claim, the draft order does not (he was drafted in the 4th round).\n\nTherefore, the claim \"center Randy Andreachuk be drafter first\" is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify this are those containing his name, position, and draft round.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"All of the center draft picks are from the United States,\" we need to evaluate the table and identify all entries where the player's position is \"center.\" Then, we must check their nationality.\n\nLet's go through each row in the provided markdown table:\n\n1. **Row 3**: \n   - Position: `right wing`\n   - Not relevant since the position isn't \"center.\"\n\n2. **Row 4**:\n   - Player: `randy andreachuk`\n   - Position: `center`\n   - Nationality: `canada`\n   - This is a center pick, but from Canada, not the United States.\n\n3. **Row 5**:\n   - Player: `dennis sobchuk`\n   - Position: `center`\n   - Nationality: `canada`\n   - Another center pick, but again, from Canada.\n\nSince we have identified at least one center pick that is not from the United States (rows 4 and 5), the claim \"All of the center draft picks are from the United States\" is false. We can conclude our analysis here as finding a single counterexample disproves the universal claim.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for this determination:\n\n- Row 4: Position, Nationality\n- Row 5: Position, Nationality\n\nThus, the JSON object with the evaluation results would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
