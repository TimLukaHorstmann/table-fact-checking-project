    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Norman Sissiky be re-elected after 1982,\" we need to analyze the relevant information in the table about Norman Sisisky's election history.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - The row corresponding to Norman Sisisky is the third one (index 3), under the district \"Virginia 4.\"\n\n2. **Check Conditions**:\n   - The claim states that Norman Sisisky should be re-elected after 1982.\n   - From the table, we need to verify two conditions:\n     a. The year he was first elected is indeed 1982.\n     b. He was re-elected, as indicated by \"re-elected.\"\n\n3. **Examine Relevant Cells**:\n   - The cell under \"first elected\" for Norman Sisisky (row index 3) shows the year 1982.\n   - The cell under \"results\" for Norman Sisisky (row index 3) indicates \"re-elected.\"\n   \n4. **Determine Truth of Claim**:\n   - Since both conditions are satisfied (he was first elected in 1982 and re-elected), the claim is true.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n     - Row index 3, Column \"first elected\"\n     - Row index 3, Column \"results\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the JSON object representing the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
