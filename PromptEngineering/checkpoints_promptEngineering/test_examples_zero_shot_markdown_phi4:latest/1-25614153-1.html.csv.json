The claim states:\n\n\"joel houston compose 4 of the song on the album con todo\"\n\nLet's break down and verify each part of this claim with respect to the provided table.\n\n1. **Composer: \"joel houston\"**  \n   We need to identify all songs in the table where Joel Houston is listed as the composer. According to the table, we find:\n\n   - Row 1: \"para exaltarte\" (composer: joel houston)\n   - Row 2: \"correr\u00e9\" (composer: joel houston)\n   - Row 4: \"desde mi interior\" (composer: joel houston)\n   - Row 9: \"soy libre\" (composer: joel houston, matt crocker & scott ligertwood)\n\n   Joel Houston is indeed the composer for four songs in total.

Row 1: \n   - Song: para exaltarte\n   - Original Album: this is our god\n\n2. Row 2:\n   - Song: correr\u00e9\n   - Original Album: this is our god\n\n3. Row 3:\n   - Song: hosanna\n   - Original Album: saviour king\n\n4. Row 4:\n   - Song: desde mi interior\n   - Original Album: unidos permanecemos\n\n5. Row 5:\n   - Song: canci\u00f3n del desierto\n   - Original Album: this is our god\n\n6. Row 6:\n   - Song: en la cruz\n   - Original Album: mighty to save\n\n7. Row 7:\n   - Song: rey salvador\n   - Original Album: saviour king\n\n8. Row 8:\n   - Song: poderoso para salvar\n   - Original Album: mighty to save\n\n9. Row 9:\n   - Song: soy libre\n   - Original Album: saviour king\n\n10. Row 10:\n    - Song: poderoso\n    - Original Album: this is our god\n\n11. Row 11:\n    - Song: s\u00f3lo cristo\n    - Original Album: unidos permanecemos\n\n12. Row 12:\n    - Song: es nuestro dios\n    - Original Album: this is our god\n\n13. Row 13:\n    - Song: eres mi fortaleza\n    - Original Album: saviour king\n\nFrom the above analysis, we identify the following rows where the \"original album\" is \"this is our god\":\n- Row 1\n- Row 2\n- Row 5\n- Row 10\n- Row 12\n\nThere are five songs from the original album \"this is our god,\" not just one.
