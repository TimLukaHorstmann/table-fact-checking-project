    "resp": "To verify the claim \"dane krager have the lowest long with 59 car,\" we need to evaluate two components of the statement:\n\n1. **\"Dane Krager has the lowest long\":** We must check if Dane Krager's value in the \"long\" column is indeed the smallest among all players.\n\n2. **\"with 59 car\":** This part refers to checking Dane Krager's number of carries, which should be 59 according to the claim.\n\nLet's break down each component:\n\n### Step 1: Check if Dane Krager has the lowest \"long\"\n\n- From the table:\n  - Dane Krager's \"long\" is 24.\n  - We need to compare this with all other players' \"long\" values.\n\n- List of \"long\" values from the table:\n  - Dane Krager: 24\n  - Kevin Nickerson: 9\n  - Torrance Marshall: 12\n  - Henry Bryant: 14\n  - John Fitzgerald: 10\n  - Sedrick Robinson: 8\n  - Chance Mock: 4\n  - Donvetis Franklin: 3\n  - Darrin Chiaverini: 2\n  - Fred Coleman: 3\n  - Greg Brown: 0\n\n- The lowest \"long\" value is 0 (Greg Brown), not 24.
