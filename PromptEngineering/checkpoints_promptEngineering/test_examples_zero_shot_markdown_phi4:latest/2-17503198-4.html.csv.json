    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding the performance of a team named \"valor\" in the first qualifying round of the 2008 - 09 UEFA Champions League, we must examine the provided table for relevant data.\n\nThe claim states: \"In the first qualifying round of the 2008 - 09 UEFA Champions League, valor was able to win and then proceed to 3 more qualifying rounds.\"\n\nHere's how we can analyze this:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Section in the Table**: \n   We need to focus on the \"2008 - 09 uefa champions league\" part of the table since it pertains to the UEFA Champions League.\n\n2. **Locate the First Qualifying Round Results**:\n   The relevant row for the first qualifying round is:\n   - Team 1: bate borisov\n   - Aggregate: 3 - 0\n   - Team 2: valur (note: \"valor\" in the claim should be interpreted as a typographical error, referring to \"valur\")\n   - First Leg: 2 - 0\n   - Second Leg: 1 - 0\n\n3. **Verify the Result**:\n   In this row, bate borisov defeated valur with an aggregate score of 3 - 0 (2 - 0 in the first leg and 1 - 0 in the second leg). Therefore, valur did not win.\n\n4. **Check for Subsequent Qualifying Rounds**:\n   Since valur lost in the first qualifying round, they could not proceed to any subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is false because valur did not win and hence did not advance further in the competition.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
