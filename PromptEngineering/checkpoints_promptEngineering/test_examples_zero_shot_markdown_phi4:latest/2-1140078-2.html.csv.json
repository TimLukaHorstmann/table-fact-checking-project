According to the table, this is found at row index 4.\n\n2. **Check the Constructor for This Race:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row (index 4), we need to check the 'constructor' column in that same row.\n   - For row index 4, the constructor listed is \"ligier - ford\".\n\n3. **Verify if All Conditions of the Claim Are Met:**\n   - The claim specifies two conditions:\n     - The race should be located at Zolder.\n     - The constructor for this race should be Ligier-Ford.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by row index 4 in the table.\n\nThus, based on our analysis:\n\n- Row Index: 4\n- Location Column ('location'): \"zolder\"\n- Constructor Column ('constructor'): \"ligier - ford\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.
