    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Didi Benami sing the song choice 'Angel' before 'Lean on Me'\" is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify when Didi Benami performed \"Angel.\"\n2. Identify when she performed \"Lean on Me\" and ensure that \"Angel\" was sung in an earlier round.\n\nFrom the table, each row represents a performance episode with the columns detailing the week, theme, song choice, original artist, order of performance, and result. The relevant information from this claim can be extracted as follows:\n\n- **Finding when \"Angel\" was performed:**\n  - In the fourth row (under \"Hollywood\" week), the song choice is \"Angel,\" originally by Sarah McLachlan. This indicates that Didi Benami sang \"Angel\" during her second solo in Hollywood.\n\n- **Finding when \"Lean on Me\" was performed:**\n  - In the sixth row (under \"Top 20 (10 women)\"), the song choice is \"Lean on Me,\" originally by Bill Withers. This indicates she sang this song as part of the Billboard Hot 100 Hits theme.\n\nNow, we need to verify if the performance of \"Angel\" happened before \"Lean on Me.\" The table lists these performances chronologically:\n\n1. Didi performed \"Angel\" in one of her Hollywood episodes.\n2. Later, she performed \"Lean on Me\" during the Top 20 (10 women) episode.\n\nGiven this order of events, it is clear that Didi Benami sang \"Angel\" before she sang \"Lean on Me.\" Thus, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table include:\n- The row for the performance of \"Angel.\"\n- The row for the performance of \"Lean on Me.\"\n\nHere are these cells with their respective indices and column names:\n\n1. Row 3 (indexing starts at 0): Column \"song choice\" contains \"Angel.\"\n2. Row 5: Column \"song choice\" contains \"Lean on Me.\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, there is no direct reference to her name in this table.\n   - Since there's no information given about specific participants or their names, we must assume that the table implicitly refers to Didi Benami for these entries if it's meant to be verified.\n\n### Relevant Rows and Columns:\n- **Row 5:** \"Top 20 (10 women)\"\n  - Check 'order' column: The value is 5.\n  \n- **Row 6:** \"Top 16 (8 women)\"\n  - Check 'order' column: The value is 5.\n\nBoth rows satisfy the condition that Didi Benami is number 5 in order for both weeks.
