    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"the Japan player is 3 strokes back from Seve Ballesteros,\" we need to examine relevant information in the table:\n\n1. **Score and To Par Values:**\n   - Seve Ballesteros' score is given as \\(71 + 68 = 139\\) with a to par value of \\(-5\\).\n   - Tsuneyuki Nakajima's score is \\(70 + 71 = 141\\) with a to par value of \\(-3\\).\n\n2. **Understanding \"Strokes Back\":**\n   - \"3 strokes back\" refers to the number of strokes difference between two players.\n   - Seve Ballesteros' total score is 139.\n   - Tsuneyuki Nakajima's total score is 141.\n\n3. **Calculating Stroke Difference:**\n   - The stroke difference can be calculated by subtracting Ballesteros\u2019 score from Nakajima\u2019s score:\n     \\[\n     141 - 139 = 2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the Japan player (Tsuneyuki Nakajima) is actually 2 strokes back from Seve Ballesteros.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the Japan player is 3 strokes back, but our calculation shows he is only 2 strokes back.\n   - Hence, the claim is not accurate based on the data provided in the table.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table to verify this:\n\n- Seve Ballesteros' score and to par:\n  - Row index: 0\n  - Column name for score: \"score\"\n  - Column name for to par: \"to par\"\n\n- Tsuneyuki Nakajima's score and to par:\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Column name for score: \"score\"\n  - Column name for to par: \"to par\"\n\nWith this information, we can provide the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
