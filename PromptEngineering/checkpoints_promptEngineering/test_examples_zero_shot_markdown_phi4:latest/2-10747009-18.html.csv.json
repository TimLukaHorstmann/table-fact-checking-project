    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Carlton be the away team when they play St Kilda,\" we need to analyze the table and identify relevant cells that can verify this information.\n\nThe claim involves two specific teams: Carlton and St Kilda. Therefore, the rows in the table where either Carlton or St Kilda is mentioned are relevant. We will focus on these teams' appearances as both home and away teams.\n\n1. **Identify rows involving Carlton and/or St Kilda:**\n   - Row 2 involves Carlton playing against St Kilda.\n   - Check if Carlton is listed as the \"away team\" in this row.\n\n2. **Verify the details for the relevant row (Row 2):**\n   - Home Team: Carlton\n   - Away Team: St Kilda\n\nFrom this information, we can see that in Row 2, Carlton is the home team, not the away team. Therefore, the claim \"Carlton be the away team when they play St Kilda\" is FALSE.\n\n3. **Relevant cells for verification:**\n   - The relevant columns are \"home team,\" \"away team.\"\n   - We need to check Row 2 of these columns.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
