    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding Greg Pursley's best season ranking in 2007 according to the given table, we need to examine the \"season rank\" column for each year listed.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Greg Pursley's best season ranking was achieved in 2007.\n   - To verify this, we must identify which year had the highest (i.e., numerically lowest) rank value in the \"season rank\" column.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - We will examine each entry for the \"year\" and its corresponding \"season rank\":\n     - 1999: 64th\n     - 2002: 9th\n     - 2007: 69th\n     - 2008: 32nd\n     - 2009: 3rd\n     - 2010: 5th\n     - 2011: 1st\n     - 2012: 2nd\n\n3. **Determining the Best Ranking Year:**\n   - The best ranking is indicated by the lowest numerical value in \"season rank\".\n   - The rankings are as follows:\n     - 1999: 64th (low)\n     - 2002: 9th\n     - 2007: 69th (worst among these entries)\n     - 2008: 32nd\n     - 2009: 3rd\n     - 2010: 5th\n     - 2011: 1st (best ranking)\n     - 2012: 2nd\n\n4. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - The best season ranking is 1st, achieved in the year 2011.\n   - In contrast, 2007 had a rank of 69th, which is not the best.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - Since 2007 does not have the best ranking compared to other years (notably 2011), the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - To verify this conclusion, we need the \"season rank\" values for all rows.\n\nGiven these findings, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"season rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
