    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"new zealand's player be rank second overall\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information in the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies a player from New Zealand.\n   - It also states that this player should have the rank of 2 (second place).\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data in the Table**:\n   - We need to check each row for the column labeled \"country\" to find any entry with \"new zealand\".\n   - Once we locate a player from New Zealand, we verify their rank.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: Player is Lee Trevino, Country is United States (not relevant).\n   - **Row 2**: Player is Bob Charles, Country is New Zealand (relevant).\n     - Rank of Bob Charles: 2\n   - **Rows 3 to 5**: Players are from the United States (not relevant).\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The player from New Zealand identified in Row 2 has a rank of 2.\n   - This matches the condition specified in the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Bob Charles, who is from New Zealand, is ranked second overall, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, based on the verification process, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Row 2, Column \"country\" (to verify the player's country).\n   - Row 2, Column \"rank\" (to confirm the rank of the New Zealand player).\n\nHere is the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"mike hill be rank in the top 3\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the relevant cells from the table related to player rankings.\n\n1. Identify the column that contains ranking information: The \"rank\" column.\n2. Locate the row corresponding to \"Mike Hill\" and check his rank value:\n   - In the table, \"mike hill\" appears in row 4 with a rank of 4.\n\n3. Evaluate the claim based on the data:\n   - The claim states that \"mike hill be rank in the top 3.\" To meet this condition, Mike Hill's rank would need to be 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Since his rank is 4, he does not fall within the top 3.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 3 (since markdown tables are typically zero-indexed in programming contexts but here I'll use 1-based indexing for clarity), column \"rank\" shows Mike Hill's rank as 4.\n- Row index 4, column \"player\" verifies that the row indeed corresponds to Mike Hill.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
