    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table for information about playoff goals scored by Chicago Blackhawks players.\n\nThe claim states: \"Bobby Hull have score the most playoff goal of all Chicago Blackhawk player.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The relevant data from the table are the playoff columns because they show how many playoff games each player participated in, which is crucial for determining if Bobby Hull scored the most goals in playoffs.\n\n2. **Check Bobby Hull's Playoff Record**:\n   - Bobby Hull has played 62 playoff games (as shown in the \"playoffs\" column).\n\n3. **Compare with Other Players**:\n   - We need to compare Bobby Hull's playoff participation against other players listed.\n   - The highest number of playoff games among other players is Stan Mikita and Denis Savard, each having participated in 59 games.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Bobby Hull has the highest number of playoff games (62) compared to any other player listed (with a maximum of 59 by others), he indeed played more playoff games than any other player on this list. However, the claim specifically mentions \"scored the most playoff goals,\" which is not directly verifiable from the given data since it only provides the number of playoff appearances, not the actual number of goals scored in those playoffs.\n\n5. **Final Determination**: Since we do not have information about the number of goals scored by each player in the playoffs (only the number of games played), we cannot confirm if Bobby Hull scored the most playoff goals based solely on this table.

    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"no two players have scored the same total number of goals,\" we need to examine the \"total\" column in the given table and check if there are any duplicate values.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column for this claim is the \"total\" column, as it represents the total number of goals scored by each player.\n\n2. **Extract Values from \"Total\" Column**:\n   - bobby hull: 666\n   - stan mikita: 600\n   - steve larmer: 451\n   - denis savard: 438\n   - dennis hull: 331\n   - jeremy roenick: 302\n   - tony amonte: 281\n   - hubert pit martin: 269\n   - bill mosienko: 268\n   - ken wharram: 268\n\n3. **Check for Duplicates**:\n   - The values are: 666, 600, 451, 438, 331, 302, 281, 269, 268, 268.\n   - We observe that the value \"268\" appears twice (for bill mosienko and ken wharram).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are duplicate values in the \"total\" column, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those with the total goals for both players who have the same total score (268).\n   - These are located at row indices 8 and 9 under the \"total\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
