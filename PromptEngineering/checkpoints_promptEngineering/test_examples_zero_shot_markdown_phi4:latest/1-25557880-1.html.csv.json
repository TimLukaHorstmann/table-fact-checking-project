    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"every team have several win\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the \"wins\" column for each row in the table.\n\nThe claim requires that every team listed must have more than one win (\"several\" implying at least two wins). Let's go through each entry and check the relevant cells:\n\n1. **Row 0:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n2. **Row 1:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n3. **Row 2:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 4\n\n4. **Row 3:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n5. **Row 4:** \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n6. **Row 5:** \n   - Team: manor motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\n7. **Row 6:** \n   - Team: manor motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\n8. **Row 7:** \n   - Team: bvm - target racing\n   - Wins: 3\n\n9. **Row 8:** \n   - Team: s fortec motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that:\n- The \"bvm minardi team\" has one instance of several wins (4 in row 2), but other instances have 0 or 1 win.\n- The \"manor motorsport\" does not have any wins.\n- The \"bvm - target racing\" has several wins (3).\n- The \"s fortec motorsport\" has no wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because not every team listed in the table has several (at least two) wins. \n\nThe relevant cells that verify this are those associated with the \"wins\" column where the number of wins is 0 or less than 2:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
