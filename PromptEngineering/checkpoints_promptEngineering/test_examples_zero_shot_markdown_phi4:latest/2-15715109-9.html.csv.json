    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must evaluate each part of it against the table data:\n\n1. **Claim:** \"Pat Rupp was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba\"\n   - From the table, Pat Rupp's birthplace is listed as Detroit, Michigan.\n   \n2. **Claim:** \"on July 3, 1935\"\n   - The table shows that Pat Rupp\u2019s birthdate is August 12, 1942.\n\n3. **Claim:** \"he is currently playing for the Green Bay Bombcats\"\n   - According to the table, there is no indication of current team affiliation as it only lists teams from 1963-1964.\n   - The team associated with Pat Rupp during that time was Flin Flon Bombers (SJHL).\n\nSince none of the conditions in the claim are supported by the table data, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"birthplace\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"birthdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of relevant cells:\n- The birthplace cell (Detroit, Michigan) and birthdate cell (August 12, 1942) for Pat Rupp directly contradict the claim about his place and date of birth. These are crucial checks to determine if any part of the claim is supported by the table.",
