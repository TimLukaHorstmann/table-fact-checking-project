    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two conditions from the statement:\n\n1. **Identifying the game with the lowest score:**\n   - We should calculate the total points for each game by adding both teams' scores together.\n   \n2. **Checking if this game occurred in week 1 against \"the head of the city of Kansas\":**\n   - The team mentioned is \"Kansas City Chiefs,\" which corresponds to the capital city of Kansas, Topeka.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Scores for Each Game\n\n- Week 1: Kansas City Chiefs vs. (score: 47 + 27 = 74)\n- Week 2: Denver Broncos vs. (score: 34 + 23 = 57)\n- Week 3: Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. (score: 20 + 13 = 33)\n- Week 4: San Francisco 49ers vs. (score: 20 + 17 = 37)\n- Week 5: Philadelphia Eagles vs. (score: 23 + 21 = 44)\n- Week 6: Los Angeles Raiders vs. (score: 23 + 13 = 36)\n- Week 7: Atlanta Falcons vs. (score: 31 + 24 = 55)\n- Week 8: New York Giants vs. (score: 21 + 13 = 34)\n- Week 9: Los Angeles Rams vs. (score: 28 + 10 = 38)\n- Week 10: Seattle Seahawks vs. (score: 27 + 3 = 30)\n- Week 11: Green Bay Packers vs. (score: 38 + 14 = 52)\n- Week 12: Minnesota Vikings vs. (score: 30 + 23 = 53)\n- Week 13: Los Angeles Rams vs. (score: 29 + 3 = 32)\n- Week 14: St. Louis Cardinals vs. (score: 28 + 16 = 44)\n- Week 15: San Francisco 49ers vs. (score: 31 + 19 = 50)\n- Week 16: Atlanta Falcons vs. (score: 16 + 10 = 26)\n\nThe game with the lowest score is in **Week 16** against the **Atlanta Falcons** with a total of 26 points.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Claim\n\n- The claim states that the game with the lowest score was in Week 1 against \"the head of the city of Kansas,\" which implies Kansas City Chiefs.\n- From our calculations, the game with the lowest score occurred in Week 16, not Week 1.
