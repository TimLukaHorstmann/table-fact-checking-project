These correspond to the rows marked by the \"year\" in the `player` column.\n\n- **Year 2010**:\n  - Rows with \"2010\" as the player name are relevant.\n  \n- **Year 2011**:\n  - Rows with \"2011\" as the player name are relevant.\n\n### Step 2: Check for John Isner's Events\n\nWithin these identified rows, check for any mention of \"John Isner.\"\n\n#### Year 2010:\n\n| player                | rank | event                                          | surface   | score                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----:|------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| nikolay davydenko     |    6 | beijing , china                                | hard      | 7 - 6 (7 - 2) , 6 - 4                                   |\n\n- No mention of John Isner in this year.\n\n#### Year 2011:\n\n| player                | rank | event                                          | surface   | score                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----:|------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| david ferrer          |    5 | paris , france                                 | hard (i)  | 6 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3                                   |\n\n- No mention of John Isner in this year.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there are no mentions of John Isner for either the year 2010 or 2011, we can conclude that he does not have any events listed in those years according to the table. Therefore, the claim \"both in 2010 and 2011 john isner have 2 event\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nAs there are no relevant entries for John Isner in either year, all cells under the respective player rows for these years become relevant by default as they confirm his absence from the events.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding John Isner's performance on grass surfaces from 2009 to 2013 using the provided table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The claim pertains to player names, events, and surface types for matches played within the specified timeframe (2009-2013). Therefore, relevant columns are \"player\", \"event\", and \"surface\".\n\n2. **Scan Each Row in the Table:**\n   - We need to check if John Isner is mentioned as a player.\n   - For rows where he appears, we need to verify if the surface is specified as \"grass\".\n   - Count occurrences of matches on grass surfaces for John Isner.\n\n3. **Reviewing Each Year from 2009-2013:**\n   - **2009:** Rows 1 and 2 list players Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and Andy Roddick. No mention of John Isner.\n   - **2010:** Row 4 lists Nikolay Davydenko. No mention of John Isner.\n   - **2011:** Row 6 lists David Ferrer. No mention of John Isner.\n   - **2012:** Rows 8, 9, 10, and 11 list Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Janko Tipsarevi\u0107, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga again, and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych. No mention of John Isner.\n   - **2013:** Rows 13, 14, and 15 list Milos Raonic, Novak Djokovic, and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro. No mention of John Isner.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no rows in the table where \"player\" is John Isner.\n   - Consequently, there cannot be any records of him playing on a grass surface within the given timeframe.\n\nThe claim states that John Isner played on a grass surface three times from 2009 to 2013. However, based on our examination of the table data, this is not supported as he does not appear in the dataset at all.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\". There are no relevant cells because John Isner's name is not present in any row related to playing matches during that period.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
