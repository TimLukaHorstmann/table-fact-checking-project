So, we need to check all rows where the opponent column has \"forrest griffin\".\n\n2. **Check for KO Method and Round**:\n    - We look at the `method` column to see if there's an entry that includes \"ko\" (knockout).\n    - Additionally, verify whether this knockout happened in round 4 by examining the `round` column.\n\n3. **Scan Relevant Rows**: \n   - The rows with Forrest Griffin as the opponent are indexed at 0 and 5.\n   - Row 0: Method is \"decision (unanimous)\" and not a KO. Round is 3.\n   - Row 5: Method is \"decision (unanimous)\" and not a KO. Round is 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: There are no entries for Forrest Griffin involving a knockout in any round, let alone round 4.\n\nSince there is no record of a knockout by Forrest Griffin in round 4 or at all, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
