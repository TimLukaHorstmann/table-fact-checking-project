    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the European record, we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. The athlete and country associated with setting the European record.\n2. The time and location where this record was set.\n\nThe claim states:\n- The European record is set by Hassiba Boulmerka (ALG) with a time of 4:05:67 at Rome, Italy.\n\nNow let's check these details against the table:\n\n- **European Record Details from Table**:\n  - Athlete: Tatyana Kazankina (URS)\n  - Time: 3:52.47\n  - Location: Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland\n\nComparing this with the claim:\n- The athlete in the claim is Hassiba Boulmerka (ALG), while the table shows it as Tatyana Kazankina (URS). This is not consistent.\n- The time in the claim is 4:05.67, whereas the table lists it as 3:52.47. These times are different.\n- The location in the claim is Rome, Italy, but according to the table, it was set in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.\n\nNone of these details match what is stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells from the table for verification:**\n- Row index 7 (European record row):\n  - Column \"championship record\" (athlete)\n  - Column \"time\"\n  - Column \"location\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"world record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"qu yunxia ( chn )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"3:50.46\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"beijing , china\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
