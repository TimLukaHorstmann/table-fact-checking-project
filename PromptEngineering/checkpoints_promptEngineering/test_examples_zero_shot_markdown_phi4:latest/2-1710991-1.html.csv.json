    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Liselotte Neumann's wins resulting from playoffs in June 1996 and March 1998, we need to analyze the relevant rows of the table for these specific dates and tournament details.\n\nThe claim specifies two conditions:\n1.

However, Liselotte Neumann is not listed among the runners-up.\n\n2. **March 22, 1998**:\n   - Date: 22 Mar 1998\n   - Tournament: Standard Register Ping\n   - Margin of Victory: Playoff (indicated as \"playoff\" in the table)\n   - Runner(s)-up: Rosie Jones\n\n   Again, a playoff is indicated, but Liselotte Neumann is not listed among the runners-up.\n\nIn neither case does Liselotte Neumann appear as associated with the victories or playoffs on those dates.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on a specific period between 1998 and 2004 and identify instances where Liselotte Neumann had a final winning score of under 206.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the claim into its components:\n1. The time frame is specified as \"between 1998 and 2004.\"\n2. We are interested in \"Liselotte Neumann\u2019s\" tournament results.\n3. Her \"final winning score must be under 206.\"\n4. There should be exactly \"3 such instances.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the table to find relevant entries:\n\n1. **Time Frame (1998 - 2004):**\n   - Relevant rows are those with dates from 22 Mar 1998 to 10 Oct 2004.\n\n2. **Liselotte Neumann as Winner:**\n   - Check if Liselotte Neumann is listed in the \"runner(s) up\" column for any of these entries, indicating she was not the winner there.\n\n3. **Winning Score under 206:**\n   - Verify that her winning score, if any, during this period is indeed less than 206.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant row within the specified timeframe:\n\n- **22 Mar 1998:** \"Standard Register Ping\"  \n  - Winning Score: -13 (279)  \n  - Winner: Not Liselotte Neumann; Rosie Jones  \n\n- **26 Apr 1998:** \"Chick-fil-A Charity Championship\"  \n  - Winning Score: -14 (202)  \n  - Winner: Not Liselotte Neumann; Lori Kane and Dottie Pepper  \n\n- **10 Oct 2004:** \"Asahi Ryokukken International Championship\"  \n  - Winning Score: -15 (273)  \n  - Winner: Grace Park\n\nUpon checking the rows from 1998 to 2004, there are no instances where Liselotte Neumann is listed as a winner with a score under 206. Thus, she doesn't meet any of the conditions specified in the claim during this period.\n\nSince none of her scores fall below 206 and because she isn't the winner within these years, the condition that \"3 of Liselotte Neumann\u2019s final winning scores be under 206\" is not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winning score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"winning score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze whether Liselotte Neumann has won five tournaments with a margin of victory greater than two strokes based on the data provided in the table.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The columns relevant for this task are \"runner(s) - up\" and \"margin of victory\". We need to check each row to see if Liselotte Neumann is listed as a runner-up, which indicates she did not win that particular tournament.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - For each tournament (row), we examine the margin of victory.\n   - If the margin of victory is more than two strokes, we then check if Liselotte Neumann is mentioned in the \"runner(s) - up\" column for that row.\n   - We need to count how many such instances exist where she was a runner-up and the margin of victory was greater than two.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Tournament**:\n   - 7 Sep 1988: Margin = 3 strokes, Runner-Up = Patty Sheehan (Neumann not mentioned)\n   - 10 Nov 1991: Margin = 2 strokes (not more than 2)\n   - 12 Jun 1994: Margin = 2 strokes (not more than 2)\n   - 12 Aug 1994: Margin = 3 strokes, Runner-Up = Dottie Pepper, Annika S\u00f6renstam (Neumann not mentioned)\n   - 2 Oct 1994: Margin = 3 strokes, Runner-Up = Elaine Crosby, Pearl Sinn (Neumann not mentioned)\n   - 14 Jan 1996: Margin = 11 strokes, Runner-Up = Karrie Webb (Neumann not mentioned)\n   - 17 Mar 1996: Margin = 1 stroke (not more than 2)\n   - 6 Jun 1996: Margin = Playoff (no specific margin of victory)\n   - 21 Sep 1997: Margin = 3 strokes, Runner-Up = Nancy Harvey (Neumann not mentioned)\n   - 9 Nov 1997: Margin = 1 stroke (not more than 2)\n   - 22 Mar 1998: Margin = Playoff (no specific margin of victory)\n   - 26 Apr 1998: Margin = 2 strokes (not more than 2)\n   - 10 Oct 2004: Margin = 3 strokes, Runner-Up = Grace Park (Neumann not mentioned)\n\n4. **Count Relevant Instances**:\n   - Liselotte Neumann is never listed as a runner-up in any of the tournaments where the margin of victory was more than two strokes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Liselotte Neumann does not appear as a runner-up in any tournament with a margin greater than two, she did not win such tournaments by losing to another player (as claimed).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. Here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nNo rows are relevant for confirming Liselotte Neumann as a runner-up in a tournament won with more than two strokes of margin.",
