The second largest is 20527.\n- **Second Smallest Attendance**: The smallest attendance is 15183. The second smallest is 15943.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that the \"second largest crowd at the Rose Garden be 19980\" is FALSE because the second largest is actually 20527.\n- The claim that the \"second smallest crowd be 15183\" is also FALSE because the second smallest is actually 15943.\n\nTherefore, the overall answer to the claim is FALSE. \n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells for this evaluation:\n\n- Attendance of 19980 (December 6)\n- Attendance of 19980 (December 14)\n- Attendance of 15183 (December 17)\n- Attendance of 20527 (December 21)\n\nHere's the JSON output with the relevant cell information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
