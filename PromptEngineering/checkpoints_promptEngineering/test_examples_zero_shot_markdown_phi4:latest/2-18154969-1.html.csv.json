    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to carefully evaluate each condition stated in the claim against the data presented in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **There be 6 teams on the 2nd leg that have a score of 1.**\n2. **One of these matches should be a tie (i.e., both teams scoring 1).**\n3. **The remaining ones should be losses for the team in column \"team 1\".**\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Teams with a Score of 1 in the 2nd Leg:**\n   - We will examine each row and extract scores from the \"2nd leg\" column where the score is of the form `x - 1` or `1 - x`.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences:**\n   - We need exactly six instances where a team scored 1 in the second leg.\n\n3. **Identify Ties:**\n   - Check if any match with a score of `1 - 1` (a tie) is present among these occurrences.\n\n4. **Identify Losses:**\n   - Ensure that for all other scores, teams scoring 1 are indeed on the losing side (`x - 1`).\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- **Row 0**: `2nd leg = 0 - 1`: Team 1 scored 0 (loss).\n- **Row 1**: `2nd leg = 3 - 5`: No team scored 1.\n- **Row 2**: `2nd leg = 1 - 2 (aet)`: Team 1 scored 1 (loss).\n- **Row 3**: `2nd leg = 1 - 1`: Both teams scored 1 (tie).\n- **Row 4**: `2nd leg = 1 - 4`: Team 1 scored 1 (loss).\n- **Row 5**: `2nd leg = 2 - 0`: No team scored 1.\n- **Row 6**: `2nd leg = 1 - 4`: Team 1 scored 1 (loss).\n- **Row 7**: `2nd leg = 6 - 0`: No team scored 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- We identified six occurrences of teams scoring 1 in the second leg: Rows 0, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n- One match was a tie (Row 3).\n- The remaining matches were losses for team 1 (Rows 0, 2, 4, 6).\n\nAll conditions specified by the claim are met. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells in the table for this verification process are found in column \"2nd leg\" for rows where a score of 1 appears: Rows 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
