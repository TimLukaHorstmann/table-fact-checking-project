    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Yevgeny Kafelnikov be tie for the most common opponent with 2 match,\" we need to analyze the table and count how many times each opponent appears in the \"opponent in the final\" column.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column is \"opponent in the final.\"\n\n2. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Yevgeny Kafelnikov: Appears twice (rows 5 and 6).\n   - Martin Damm: Appears once (row 1).\n   - Renzo Furlan: Appears once (row 2).\n   - Jan Siemerink: Appears once (row 3).\n   - Todd Martin: Appears once (row 4).\n   - Fabrice Santoro: Appears once (row 7).\n   - Harel Levy: Appears once (row 8).\n   - Marat Safin: Appears once (row 9).\n   - Paradorn Srichaphan: Appears once (row 10).\n   - Andre Agassi: Appears once (row 12).\n   - Nicolas Kiefer: Appears once (row 13).\n   - Mario An\u010di\u0107: Appears once (row 14).\n   - Ivo Karlovi\u0107: Appears once (row 15).\n\n3. **Determine Common Opponents**: \n   - Yevgeny Kafelnikov is the only opponent who appears twice.\n\n4. **Check for Ties**:\n   - No other opponent appears as frequently as Yevgeny Kafelnikov, so there is no tie for the most common opponent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim that Yevgeny Kafelnikov ties for the most common opponent with 2 matches is false because he is the only one with 2 appearances, and thus not tied with anyone else.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Rows where Yevgeny Kafelnikov appears: 5 and 6 in the \"opponent in the final\" column.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
