    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Denny Hulme be the driver at Anderstorp in 1973\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant information from the provided table.\n\nThe claim consists of three parts:\n1. The year should be 1973.\n2. The location should be Anderstorp.\n3. The driver should be Denny Hulme.\n\nLet's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n1. **Year**: Look for the row with \"year\" as 1973. We find this in the sixth row of the table (index 5).\n\n2. **Location**: Check if the \"location\" column for the year 1973 is \"Anderstorp\". In the same row, the location is indeed listed as Anderstorp.\n\n3. **Driver**: Verify if the \"driver\" column for the year 1973 lists Denny Hulme. The table shows that the driver is Denny Hulme in this row.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are met by the data in the specified row, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim:\n- Row index 5 (corresponding to the year 1973)\n  - \"year\" column: Value is 1973\n  - \"location\" column: Value is Anderstorp\n  - \"driver\" column: Value is Denny Hulme\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
