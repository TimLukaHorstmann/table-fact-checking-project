According to the table, the district named \"arkansas 2\" corresponds to row index 1.\n\n2. **Candidate Name Verification**: The claim states the candidate for this district is \"wilbur mill (d) unopposed\". We need to verify:\n   - The name matches exactly.\n   - The party affiliation is democratic (\"(d)\").\n   - The status of being \"unopposed\".\n\n3. **Relevant Table Data**:\n   - For row index 1, column \"district\" should be \"arkansas 2\".\n   - Column \"candidates\" should contain \"wilbur mills (d) unopposed\". \n\nLet's verify these conditions using the data from the table:\n\n- The district is indeed \"arkansas 2\" in row index 1.\n- In the same row, under the column \"candidates\", it lists \"wilbur mills (d) unopposed\".\n  \nThe claim mentions \"wilbur mill,\" which does not match exactly with \"wilbur mills\" as found in the table.
