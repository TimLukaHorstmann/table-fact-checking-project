    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the male bounder book be no,\" we need to verify two specific aspects regarding the character \"bounder\" from the table:\n\n1. **Gender:** The claim states \"male.\" We need to check if \"bounder\" is indeed listed as a male.\n2. **Book Appearance:** The claim suggests that \"bounder\" does not appear in books (\"book be no\"). We must verify this assertion.\n\nLet's locate the relevant data for \"bounder\":\n\n- Locate \"bounder\" in the table:\n  - Row index: 7 (starting from 0)\n  \nFor this row, check the following columns:\n\n- **Gender:** The gender of \"bounder\" is listed as \"male,\" which matches the claim.\n- **Books:** For books, the entry is \"yes (unnamed),\" indicating that \"bounder\" does appear in books, contrary to what the claim states.\n\nSince the books column does not support the claim (\"book be no\"), we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gender\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"books\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
