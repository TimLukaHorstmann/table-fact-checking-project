    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"kansas city have no post-season record in 2013\" is true or false, we need to examine specific cells from the table related to the season of 2013 and its affiliated MLB team.\n\n1. **Identify relevant row**: We locate the row for the year 2013:\n   - The table shows that in 2013, the manager was \"brian buchanan\", with a record of \"44 - 42\" and an associated win percentage of \"512\". It also specifies \"houston\" as the MLB affiliate initially, but this is updated to \"kansas city\".\n\n2. **Check for post-season information**: We need to verify if there's any entry in the \"post-season record\" column for 2013:\n   - The table shows a dash (\"-\") under both \"post-season record\" and \"post-season win %\" columns for 2013.\n\nGiven these points, we conclude that:\n\n- Kansas City indeed had no post-season record in 2013, as indicated by the absence of any recorded data (a dash) in the relevant column for that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this are located at row index 12 under the columns \"post-season record\" and \"mlb affiliate\".\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
