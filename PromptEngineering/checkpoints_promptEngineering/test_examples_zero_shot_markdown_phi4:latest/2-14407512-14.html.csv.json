    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Tom Hilde is true or false, let's break down each part of the claim and verify it against the table:\n\n1. **Claim**: \"tom hilde from norway\"\n   - In the table, Tom Hilde is listed in row 2.\n   - The column \"nationality\" shows \"nor,\" which stands for Norway.\n   - This part of the claim matches with the data.\n\n2. **Claim**: \"be rank 2nd overall\"\n   - We need to check if Tom Hilde has the second highest points in the \"overall wc points (rank)\" column.\n   - The table lists:\n     - Thomas Morgenstern with 1115 points, ranked 1st.\n     - Janne Ahonen with 810 points, ranked 2nd.\n     - Tom Hilde with 682 points, ranked 4th.\n   - Therefore, Tom Hilde is not 2nd overall; he's actually 4th.\n\n3. **Claim**: \"with 682 overall wc point\"\n   - The table shows that Tom Hilde has 682 overall WC points, which matches the claim.\n\nSince the claim states that Tom Hilde is ranked 2nd overall but he is actually ranked 4th according to the data, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row 2, Column \"nationality\" (to confirm nationality as Norway)\n- Row 2, Column \"overall wc points (rank)\" (to verify his rank and points)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall wc points (rank)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Anders Jacobsen and Tom Hilde must both be associated with the nationality \"nor\".\n2. They must have the same number of points as per the \"points\" column.\n\nLet's break down each condition step-by-step:\n\n### Condition 1: Nationality Check\n- **Anders Jacobsen**:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Column: nationality\n  - Value: \"nor\"\n\n- **Tom Hilde**:\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Column: nationality\n  - Value: \"nor\"\n\nBoth Anders Jacobsen and Tom Hilde have the nationality \"nor\". This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Condition 2: Points Check\n- **Anders Jacobsen**:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Column: points\n  - Value: 181.2\n\n- **Tom Hilde**:\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Column: points\n  - Value: 185.6\n\nThe number of points for Anders Jacobsen (181.2) is not equal to the number of points for Tom Hilde (185.6). This part of the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince both conditions must be true for the claim to hold, and the second condition fails, the entire claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The rank indicates a position where a lower number signifies a higher standing.\n\n- Tom Hilde's rank is 4.\n- Janne Ahonen's rank is 2.\n\nSince 4 is greater than 2, Tom Hilde's rank (4) is indeed more than Janne Ahonen's rank (2).\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.
