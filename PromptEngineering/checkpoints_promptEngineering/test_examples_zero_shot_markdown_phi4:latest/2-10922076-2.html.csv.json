Therefore:\n   - The \"location\" column is the third column.\n   - The \"total capacity (mwe)\" column is the fifth column.\n\n2. **Relevant Row Identification**:\n   - By examining the table, we find that the power plant at \"ramakkalmedu\" is in the fourth row of data (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n3. **Capacity Verification**:\n   - Check the value in the \"total capacity (mwe)\" column for this row.\n   - The value is 25 MWE.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied (location matches and capacity is 50 MWE), the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total capacity (mwe)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
