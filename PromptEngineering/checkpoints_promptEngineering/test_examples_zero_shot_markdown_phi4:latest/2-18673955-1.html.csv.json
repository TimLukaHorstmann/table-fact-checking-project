    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to break down and analyze the statement: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date**: We are looking for games played on October 30, 1977.\n\n2. **Check for Games on That Date**:\n   - From the table, in row 7 (week 7), we see a game is listed with the date \"october 30 , 1977\".\n\n3. **Assess Claim**: The claim states that there should be no other games played on October 30, 1977, beyond week 7.\n\n4. **Verify Against Table**:\n   - Look through all rows to see if any other row has the date \"october 30 , 1977\".\n   - Only row 7 contains this date; no other row lists a game on October 30, 1977.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there is only one game listed for October 30, 1977 (which is in week 7), the claim is supported by the data.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those that contain the date \"october 30 , 1977\" and its associated week number.\n   - In row 7: \n     - Column \"date\": \"october 30 , 1977\"\n     - Column \"week\": 7\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
