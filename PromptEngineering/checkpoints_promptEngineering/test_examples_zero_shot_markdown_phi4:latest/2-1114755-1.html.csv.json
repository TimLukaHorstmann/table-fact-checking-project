    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"curragh be the least popular course so only 1 race take placing there,\" we need to analyze the table and focus on identifying races held at the Curragh and checking how many of those have placements.\n\nFirst, let's identify which rows in the table represent races that took place at the Curragh. The \"course\" column indicates where each race was held:\n\n1. **Row 0**: The course is \"curragh.\"\n2. **Row 2**: The course is \"leopardstown.\"\n3. **Row 5**: The course is \"curragh.\"\n\nNext, for races at the Curragh (rows 0 and 5), we need to check if they have placements by examining the \"placing\" column:\n\n- **Row 0**: Placing is 1.\n- **Row 5**: Placing is 1.\n\nBoth races at the Curragh have a placing, which means there are 2 races with placings held at the Curragh. \n\nNow let's determine if any other courses host fewer races with placements:\n\nFor each course:\n- **Curragh** (Rows 0 and 5): 2 races with placings.\n- **Leopardstown** (Row 3): 1 race, placing is 1.\n- **Epsom** (Row 4): 1 race, placing is 1.\n- **Longchamp** (Rows 6 and 7): 2 races with placings.\n\nSince Curragh hosts 2 races with placements, it is not the least popular in terms of number of placed races. The courses Leopardstown and Epsom each have only 1 race with a placing.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"curragh be the least popular course so only 1 race take placing there\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are the ones that indicate the course and having a placement (i.e., where the course is Curragh and where placing is not null):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"placing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"course\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"placing\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to break down the claim and verify it against the relevant data in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. \"Epsom have only 4 runners\" - We need to check if there are indeed only 4 runners for the race held at Epsom.\n2. \"Make it the lowest attended race\" - We need to compare the number of runners for all races in the table to see if the Epsom race has the fewest.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row corresponding to the \"Epsom Derby\" and check the number of runners.\n2. Compare this number with the number of runners in all other races listed in the table to determine if it is indeed the lowest.\n\n### Relevant Data from Table:\n\n- **Row for Epsom Derby:**\n  - **Runners:** 15 (Row Index: 4)\n\n- **Number of Runners for Other Races:**\n  - Dance Design EBF Maiden: 13 (Row Index: 0)\n  - National Stakes: 8 (Row Index: 1)\n  - Ballysax Stakes: 4 (Row Index: 2)\n  - Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial: 4 (Row Index: 3)\n  - Irish Derby: 11 (Row Index: 5)\n  - Prix Niel: 6 (Row Index: 6)\n  - Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe: 10 (Row Index: 7)\n\n### Analysis:\n- The Epsom Derby has 15 runners, not 4.\n- The races with the fewest number of runners (4) are Ballysax Stakes and Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"Epsom have only 4 runners\" is false. Additionally, since Epsom does not have the fewest runners, it cannot be considered the lowest attended race based on the number of runners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"runners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
