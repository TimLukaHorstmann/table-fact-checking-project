    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if both Larry Mize and D.A. Weibring are indeed tied for 5th place in the given table.\n\nThe relevant data points from the claim are:\n- The players' names: \"Larry Mize\" and \"D A Weibring\"\n- Their positions (rank) in the competition\n- Whether their scores and corresponding rankings confirm a tie for 5th place\n\nFrom the table, we locate:\n- Larry Mize is listed with a rank of \"t5\", which indicates he is tied for 5th place.\n- D.A. Weibring is also listed with a rank of \"t5\", indicating he shares the same position as Larry Mize.\n\nTo confirm this claim, we need to verify the following:\n1. The ranking column shows both players have \"t5\" (indicating they are tied for 5th place).\n2. Both players have the same score and corresponding score details, which are consistent with a tie.\n\nRelevant rows in the table:\n- For Larry Mize: row index 4\n  - Column \"place\": \"t5\"\n  - Column \"player\": \"larry mize\"\n  - Column \"score\": \"69 + 67 + 72 = 208\"\n  - Column \"to par\": \"- 5\"\n\n- For D.A. Weibring: row index 5\n  - Column \"place\": \"t5\"\n  - Column \"player\": \"d a weibring\"\n  - Column \"score\": \"71 + 69 + 68 = 208\"\n  - Column \"to par\": \"- 5\"\n\nBoth players have the same place (\"t5\"), score (208), and to par (-5) values, confirming they are indeed tied for 5th place.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.

Players tied for a position are indicated by an \"tX\" notation (e.g., t2, t5).\n\n1. **Scott Simpson:**\n   - Place: t2\n   - Score: 69 + 66 + 72 = 207\n   - To Par: -6\n\n2. **Larry Mize:**\n   - Place: t5\n   - Score: 69 + 67 + 72 = 208\n   - To Par: -5\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- Scott Simpson is listed as \"t2\", which means he is tied for 2nd place.\n- Larry Mize is listed as \"t5\", meaning he is tied for 5th place.\n\nSince their positions differ (Scott Simpson is at t2 and Larry Mize is at t5), they cannot be tied for the same position, specifically 5th place.
