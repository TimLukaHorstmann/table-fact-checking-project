    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Nowitzki be the lead scorer in less than half the game,\" we need to examine the entries for the \"leading scorer\" column across all rows in the provided table. Specifically, we'll count how many times Dirk Nowitzki is listed as the leading scorer and compare it to the total number of games.\n\nThe claim involves checking if Nowitzki was the leading scorer in fewer than half of the recorded games. Let's break this down:\n\n1. **Total Number of Games:** There are 14 rows (games) in the table.\n\n2. **Counting Nowitzki as Leading Scorer:**\n   - 6 February 2008 vs. Bucks\n   - 8 February 2008 vs. Grizzlies\n   - 10 February 2008 vs. Nets\n   - 13 February 2008 vs. Trail Blazers\n   - 14 February 2008 vs. Suns\n   - 20 February 2008 vs. Hornets\n   - 22 February 2008 vs. Grizzlies\n   - 24 February 2008 vs. Timberwolves\n   - 25 February 2008 vs. Bulls\n   - 28 February 2008 vs. Spurs\n   - 29 February 2008 vs. Kings\n\nNowitzki is the leading scorer in 11 out of these 14 games.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Half of 14 games is 7.\n   - Nowitzki was the leading scorer in 11 games, which is more than half (7).\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Nowitzki be the lead scorer in less than half the game\" is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n- Rows where Dirk Nowitzki is mentioned as the leading scorer are relevant:\n  - Row indices: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n- The column to check in these rows is \"leading scorer.\"\n\nHere's the JSON output with this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
