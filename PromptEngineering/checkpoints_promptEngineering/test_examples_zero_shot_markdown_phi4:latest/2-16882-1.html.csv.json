The entities \"incorporated in Netherlands\" should have a group\u2019s equity shareholding of 100%.\n2. They should also have a principal activity of \"flight academy.\"\n\nLet's break down these conditions using the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Entities Incorporated in the Netherlands\n\nFrom the table, we look at the column \"incorporated in\" and find all entries with \"netherlands.\" These are the entities:\n- cygnific\n- epcor\n- high speed alliance\n- klm catering services\n- klm equipment services\n- klm financial services\n- klm flight academy\n- klm health services\n- martinair\n- schiphol logistics park\n- transaviacom\n\n### Step 2: Check the Group's Equity Shareholding for These Entities\n\nNow, we check if these entities have a group\u2019s equity shareholding of 100%:\n\n- **cygnific**: 100%\n- **epcor**: 100%\n- **high speed alliance**: 5% (10% voting right)\n- **klm catering services**: 100%\n- **klm equipment services**: 100%\n- **klm financial services**: 100%\n- **klm flight academy**: 100%\n- **klm health services**: 100%\n- **martinair**: 100%\n- **schiphol logistics park**: 53% (45% voting right)\n- **transaviacom**: 100%\n\nFrom this, we see that not all entities incorporated in the Netherlands have a group\u2019s equity shareholding of 100%.

A group\u2019s equity shareholding of 100%.\n2.

This corresponds to the third row (considering the header as the first row).\n\n2. **Check Relevant Column for Type:**\n   - Within this row, examine the column labeled \"type\" to see what type of entity \"epcor\" is classified as.\n\n3. **Verify Claim Against Data:**\n   - The claim states that \"epcor\" should have a type of \"joint control entity\". According to the table:\n     - In the third row under the \"type\" column, it is listed as \"subsidiary\".\n\n4. **Determine Truth Value:**\n   - Since \"epcor\" is classified as a \"subsidiary\" and not a \"joint control entity\", the claim does not match the data provided in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"the company of epcor have a joint control entity type\" is FALSE. The relevant cell to verify this information is found at row index 2 (third row, considering zero-based indexing) and column name \"type\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to find all entries where \"incorporated in\" is \"netherlands\" and check their \"group 's equity shareholding\" values.\n\n2. **Principal Activities of Flight Academy**: The claim also mentions that the principal activities should be \"flight academy.\" Again, we need to verify if any entry with an equity shareholding of 99% has \"flight academy\" as its principal activity.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **cygnific**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Sales and Service\n\n- **epcor**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Maintenance\n\n- **high speed alliance**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 5% (10% voting right)\n  - Principal Activities: High Speed Trains\n\n- **klm catering services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Catering Services\n\n- **klm cityhopper**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Airline\n\n- **klm equipment services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Equipment Support\n\n- **klm financial services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Financing\n\n- **klm flight academy**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Flight Academy\n\n- **klm health services**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Health Services\n\n- **martinair**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Cargo Airline\n\n- **schiphol logistics park**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 53% (45% voting right)\n  - Principal Activities: Logistics\n\n- **transaviacom**:\n  - Incorporated in: Netherlands\n  - Group's Equity Shareholding: 100%\n  - Principal Activities: Airline\n\nFrom this evaluation, we see that no company incorporated in the Netherlands has a group's equity shareholding of exactly 99%.
