This appears in the second column.\n- For that specific row (identified by the abbreviation), we need to check if the area (in km\u00b2) listed matches 5,139. This information is in the first column.\n\nNow, let's locate these details:\n\n1. Find the row with the abbreviation \"kn\":\n   - The relevant cell for this check is in the second column.\n   \n2. Confirm that the area for that row is 5,139 km\u00b2:\n   - The relevant cell for this check is in the first column.\n\nUpon examining the table, we find:\n\n- The row with abbreviation \"kn\" corresponds to Konin voivodeship.\n- In this row, the area is listed as 5,139 km\u00b2 (1998).\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.

Check if this voivodeship has an area of 10,490.\n\nLet's examine the table for these conditions:\n\n- First, look for a row where the \"Communes\" column equals 47:\n  - The only entry with 47 communes is Zamo\u015b\u0107 Voivodeship (row index 34).\n\n- Next, check if this voivodeship has an area of 10,490:\n  - The area for Zamo\u015b\u0107 Voivodeship is listed as 6,980.\n\nThe claim states that the voivodeship with 47 communes should have an area of 10,490. However, we found that Zamo\u015b\u0107 Voivodeship, which has 47 communes, actually has an area of 6,980.

Specifically, we are looking for values greater than or equal to 700,000 and less than or equal to 750,000.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- **Radom (row index 25):** Citizens = 702,300\n- **Rzesz\u00f3w (row index 28):** Citizens = 648,900\n- **Siedlce (row index 31):** Citizens = 616,300\n- **Tarnobrzeg (row index 36):** Citizens = 556,300\n- **Tarn\u00f3w (row index 37):** Citizens = 607,000\n- **Wa\u0142brzych (row index 44):** Citizens = 716,100\n\nFrom this examination, only Radom and Wa\u0142brzych fall within the specified range:\n\n1. **Radom:** 702,300 citizens (within range)\n2. **Wa\u0142brzych:** 716,100 citizens (within range)\n\nThere are two voivodeships that meet the criteria of having between 700,000 and 750,000 citizens.\n\nSince the claim states there is only one such voivodeship, and our analysis shows two, the claim is not correct.
