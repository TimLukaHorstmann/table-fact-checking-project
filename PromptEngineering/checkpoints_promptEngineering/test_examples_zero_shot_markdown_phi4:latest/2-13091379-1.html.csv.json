This satisfies the condition in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by row 2 of the table, where the engine includes both \"alfa romeo 3.0 v8\" and \"ford cosworth dfv\", with tyres marked as \"f\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
