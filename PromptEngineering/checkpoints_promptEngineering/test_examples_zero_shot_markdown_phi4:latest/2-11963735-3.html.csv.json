    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the trail blazer lose to the home team make their record 6 - 3,\" we need to identify and verify specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant game**: Look for the row where the visitor is the \"Trail Blazers.\"\n\n2. **Determine if Trail Blazers lost**: Check the score column for that row to see if the home team won (i.e., if the second number in the score is greater than the first).\n\n3. **Check Nuggets' record**: Ensure that after this game, the Nuggets' record is 6 - 3.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Locate the row where \"visitor\" is \"trail blazers\":\n   - This occurs on November 14, 2007 (row index 8).\n\n2. Verify if Trail Blazers lost:\n   - The score is \"93 - 110,\" meaning Nuggets won as they scored more points.\n\n3. Check Nuggets' record after this game:\n   - The \"record\" column shows \"6 - 3.\"\n\nAll conditions are satisfied: the Trail Blazers lost to the home team (Nuggets), and the Nuggets' record became 6 - 3 after this game.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. Here are the relevant cells:\n\n- Row index 8, column \"visitor\": confirms the visitor was the Trail Blazers.\n- Row index 8, column \"score\": verifies the Trail Blazers lost to the home team.\n- Row index 8, column \"record\": shows Nuggets' record became 6 - 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
