    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, we need to check if in 1996, the team was indeed the 2nd seed of the southeast region. Let's break down the relevant conditions from the claim and verify them against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Year**: The claim specifies the year as 1996.\n2. **Seed**: According to the claim, they should be the \"2 seed.\"\n3. **Region**: The claim mentions that they are in the \"southeast\" region.\n\nNow let's identify which row in the table corresponds to the year 1996 and check those columns:\n\n- Locate the row with `year` equal to 1996:\n  - In the given table, this is found in row index 5.\n  \n- Check the value in the `seed` column for that row:\n  - The value is `12`.\n\n- Check the value in the `region` column for that row:\n  - The value is `southeast`.\n\nNow let's compare these values with those specified in the claim:\n\n- **Year**: Matches, as both are 1996.\n- **Seed**: Does not match. The table shows a seed of 12, while the claim states it should be 2.\n- **Region**: Matches, as both indicate \"southeast.\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The condition for the year and region is satisfied.\n- However, the seed number does not meet the requirement specified in the claim.\n\nSince all conditions must be true to confirm the claim, and the seed value does not match, the claim is false. \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"seed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"region\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
