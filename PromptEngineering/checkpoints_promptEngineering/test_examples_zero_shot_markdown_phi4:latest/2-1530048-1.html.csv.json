    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the fuel system and valvetrain configuration in the table, we need to verify if there exists an entry where a \"multi-point fuel injection\" fuel system is associated with a \"sohc 8v\" valvetrain.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The columns related to the claim are \"fuel system\" and \"valvetrain\".\n\n2. **Locate Multi-Point Fuel Injection Entries**:\n   - Scan through the rows under the \"fuel system\" column for entries mentioning \"multi-point fuel injection\".\n\n3. **Verify Valvetrain Configuration**:\n   - For each row identified in step 2, check if the corresponding entry in the \"valvetrain\" column is \"sohc 8v\".\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1 (Engine: 2.0 ie)**:\n  - Fuel System: \"multi-point fuel injection\"\n  - Valvetrain: \"dohc 16v\"\n\nThis row matches our condition of having a multi-point fuel injection, but the valvetrain is \"dohc 16v\", not \"sohc 8v\".\n\nNo other rows contain \"multi-point fuel injection\". Thus, there is no instance in the table where both conditions (multi-point fuel injection and sohc 8v) are satisfied simultaneously.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince we found no row that satisfies both parts of the claim, the statement is **FALSE**. The only relevant cell to check was for the second engine model.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"valvetrain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
