    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about the table provided, we need to verify whether \"Spy vs Spy\" is associated with both the arcade genre and the Amstrad CPC format.\n\nThe claim specifies two key conditions:\n1. The game title should be \"Spy vs Spy\".\n2. The genre should be \"arcade\".\n3. It should be available for the Amstrad CPC system (as indicated in the \"others\" column).\n\nLet's examine each relevant piece of information from the table:\n\n- First, we locate the row containing the title \"spy vs spy\". This is the 11th entry in the table, corresponding to `row_index` 10 since indexing starts at 0.\n  \n- We then check the genre for this entry. The column labeled \"genre\" shows \"arcade\", which matches part of our claim.\n\n- Next, we verify if \"amstrad cpc\" is mentioned under the \"others\" column for this title. Indeed, it is listed there, confirming that the game was also available on Amstrad CPC.\n\nBased on these checks:\n- The genre is \"arcade\".\n- The system \"Amstrad CPC\" is noted in the \"others\" column.\n  \nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are satisfied for the title \"Spy vs Spy\". Thus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"genre\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"others\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
