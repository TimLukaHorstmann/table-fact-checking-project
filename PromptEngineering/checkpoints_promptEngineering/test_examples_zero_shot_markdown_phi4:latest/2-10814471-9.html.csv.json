    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Tevita Vaikona scored 100 points on 25 tries,\" we need to check two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Number of Tries:** The player Tevita Vaikona must have made exactly 25 tries.\n2. **Total Points:** The player must have accumulated a total of 100 points.\n\nWe will identify the relevant cells in the table for these checks.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n- **Check Number of Tries:**\n  - Locate the row corresponding to Tevita Vaikona.\n  - Check the value under the \"tries\" column.\n\n- **Check Total Points:**\n  - In the same row, check the value under the \"points\" column.\n\n### Table Analysis\nFrom the table:\n\n| player          | position      |   tries |   goals |   points |\n|:----------------|:--------------|--------:|--------:|---------:|\n| tevita vaikona  | wing          |      25 |       0 |      100 |\n\n- **Row Index:** Tevita Vaikona is in the second row (index 1, as indexing typically starts from 0).\n- **Tries Column Check:** The value for \"tries\" is 25.\n- **Points Column Check:** The value for \"points\" is 100.\n\nBoth conditions match the claim.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Tevita Vaikona is the only player to score at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify players who scored at least 100 points.\n2. Among those, check if they made more than 23 tries.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- **Tevita Vaikona**: \n  - Tries: 25\n  - Points: 100\n\nSince Tevita Vaikona meets both conditions (more than 23 tries and at least 100 points), we need to check if any other player also satisfies these criteria.\n\nNow, let's examine the rest of the players:\n\n- **Robbie Paul**:\n  - Tries: 23\n  - Points: 92\n\n- **Michael Withers**: \n  - Tries: 31\n  - Points: 124\n\n- All other players either have points less than 100 or tries 23 or fewer.\n\nFrom this analysis, Michael Withers also scores at least 100 points with more than 23 tries. Therefore, Tevita Vaikona is not the only player meeting these criteria.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- For Tevita Vaikona: \n  - Tries (25) and Points (100)\n  \n- For Michael Withers:\n  - Tries (31) and Points (124)\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
