The year should be 2009.\n2. The championship should be \"paul hunter classic\".\n3. The opponent in the final should be \"jimmy white\".\n\n### Verification:\n- **Year Condition:** We look for rows where the 'year' column is 2009.\n  \n- **Championship Condition:** From those rows, we further filter to find where the 'championship' column matches \"paul hunter classic\".\n  \n- **Opponent in Final Condition:** Finally, check if the 'opponent in the final' column for these filtered rows equals \"jimmy white\".\n\n### Table Verification:\nFrom the table:\n\n| outcome     |   year | championship                                   | opponent in the final   | score   |\n|:------------|-------:|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------|:--------|\n| winner      |   2009 | paul hunter classic                            | mark selby              | 4 - 0   |\n\nThe relevant row is at index 4 (considering zero-based indexing), where:\n- Year = 2009\n- Championship = \"paul hunter classic\"\n- Opponent in the final = \"mark selby\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nJimmy White was not the opponent in the final of the 2009 Paul Hunter Classic; it was Mark Selby.
