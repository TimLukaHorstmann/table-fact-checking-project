    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the lowest attendance game against Philadelphia in the 2007-08 hockey season, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Philadelphia:**\n   - Look for rows where \"visitor\" or \"home\" is \"philadelphia.\"\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - For each identified game against Philadelphia, note the attendance figure in the \"attendance\" column.\n\n3. **Compare Attendance Figures:**\n   - Compare these figures to all other games' attendances to determine if they are indeed the lowest.\n\n4. **Verification of Claim:**\n   - If one or more games against Philadelphia have the lowest attendance compared to all other games, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Games Against Philadelphia:**\n  - November 2: Attendance = 16055\n  - November 23: Attendance = 19727\n\n- **Other Games' Attendances:**\n  - November 1: 18200\n  - November 5: 12171\n  - November 6: 15530\n  - November 8: 19666\n  - November 10: 14617\n  - November 15: 12101\n  - November 16: 19526\n  - November 19: 13411\n  - November 21: 11669\n  - November 24: 13650\n  - November 26: 11204\n  - November 28: 10526\n  - November 30: 16386\n\n- **Lowest Attendance Across All Games:**\n  - The lowest attendance is on November 28 with an attendance of 10526.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the game against Philadelphia had the lowest attendance. However, the lowest attendance recorded in this table was for a game against Florida on November 28 (attendance = 10526), which is lower than both games against Philadelphia (16055 and 19727).
