    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the claim:\n\n1. **Check for episodes airing on December 10, 2003**: We must identify if there's an episode in the table that aired on this specific date.\n\n2. **Count all episodes that aired in December 2003**: We must count how many episodes aired in the month of December 2003 and verify if it is indeed three or more.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze these conditions step-by-step using the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify Episode Aired on December 10, 2003**:\n   - By examining the \"original air date\" column, we find that the episode titled \"montreal\" aired on December 10, 2003.\n   - This confirms part of the claim: there is at least one episode airing on this specific date.\n\n2. **Count Episodes Aired in December 2003**:\n   - We need to check all rows where the month is December and the year is 2003.\n   - From the table, we find only one entry with a December 2003 airdate: \"montreal\" (December 10, 2003).\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- There is indeed an episode that aired on December 10, 2003.\n- However, there is only one episode that aired in December 2003, not three.\n\nThus, the claim \"december 10 , 2003 be 1 of 3 episode to air in december\" is FALSE because there are not enough episodes airing in December 2003.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- The cell containing the air date December 10, 2003 (\"montreal\"), which confirms one airing on that specific day.\n- All cells with air dates in December 2003 to count how many aired during that month.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to check how many rows have \"don colliver\" listed as the director and ensure that there are a total of 27 entries in the table.\n\n1. **Count Rows Directed by Don Colliver**:\n   - Go through each row in the \"directed by\" column.\n   - Count how many times \"don colliver\" appears.\n\n2. **Total Number of Entries**:\n   - Verify that there are indeed 27 rows in total, as stated in the claim.\n\nLet's perform these checks:\n\n- The \"directed by\" column for all 27 entries lists \"don colliver\".\n- There are 27 rows in total.\n\nSince Don Colliver is listed as the director for all 27 episodes, he directed 27 episodes out of 27, not 25.
