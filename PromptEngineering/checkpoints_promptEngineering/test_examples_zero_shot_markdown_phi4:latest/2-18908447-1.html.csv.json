    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding Jim Obradovich's pick in relation to the table provided, we need to evaluate each part of the claim against the data:\n\n1. **\"Jim Obradovich pick before round 2\"**:\n   - From the table, Jim Obradovich is listed under Round 7 with a Pick of 158.\n   - Therefore, his pick was not before Round 2; it occurred in Round 7.\n\n2. **\"pick 183\"**:\n   - The table shows that John Tate has a pick number of 183 in Round 8.\n   - Jim Obradovich's pick is numbered as 158 in Round 7, so his pick is not 183.\n\n3. **\"play tight end position\"**:\n   - According to the table, Jim Obradovich is indeed listed as playing the position of Tight End.\n\nSince the first two conditions are false (\"pick before round 2\" and \"pick 183\"), we can conclude that the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim include:\n- The row for Jim Obradovich to check his round, pick number, and position.\n- The rows with Round numbers and Pick numbers to verify any potential picks before Round 2 and the specific pick number 183.\n\nHere are the relevant cells identified:\n\n1. For checking Jim Obradovich's details:\n   - Row index: 3\n     - Column \"round\": value is 7 (relevant for condition 1)\n     - Column \"pick\": value is 158 (relevant for conditions 1 and 2)\n     - Column \"position\": value is tight end (relevant for condition 3)\n\n2. For checking the pick number 183:\n   - Row index: 4\n     - Column \"pick\": value is 183 (relevant for condition 2)\n\nThe JSON object representing this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
