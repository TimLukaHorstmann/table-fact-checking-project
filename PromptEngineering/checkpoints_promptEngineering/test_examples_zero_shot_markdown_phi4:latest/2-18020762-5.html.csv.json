Let's analyze the relevant column headers and their contents in the table:\n\n1. **Event Name:** We are looking specifically for the \"200 m individual medley\".\n2. **Date:** The date of interest is \"19 December 2009\".\n\nNow, let's examine the row entries to find any matching event name and date combination.\n\n- Looking at the table:\n  - The row with the event \"200 m individual medley\" states: \n    - Time: `2:04.60`\n    - Date: `19 december 2009`\n    - Meet: `duel in the pool`\n    - Location: `manchester , united kingdom`\n\nThis matches exactly with our criteria, confirming that a \"200 m individual medley\" event did take place on \"19 December 2009\".\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table data. Now we identify and format the relevant cells for this verification:\n\n- Row index for the \"200 m individual medley\": The row starts from index `0`, so counting from the top:\n  - Event name: index `0`\n  - Date: index `2`\n\nBased on this information, the JSON output is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis captures both the event and its date for verification of the claim.",
