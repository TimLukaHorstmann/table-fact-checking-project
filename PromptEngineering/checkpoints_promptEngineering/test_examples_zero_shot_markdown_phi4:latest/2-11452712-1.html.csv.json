This means that among all the picks listed for the team (which are assumed to belong to Tampa Bay Buccaneers based on the context), we need to identify if the highest-numbered pick originates from Alabama.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**: The table provides information about players, their positions, schools, and draft details such as round and pick number.\n   \n3. **Relevant Columns**:\n   - `pick`: This column indicates the draft pick number, which we need to identify the highest one.\n   - `school`: We will check if this school is Alabama for the highest draft pick.\n\n4. **Steps to Verify the Claim**:\n   - Identify all rows where the school is \"alabama\".\n   - Compare the pick numbers from these rows to find the highest pick number.\n   - Confirm that no other row (with a higher pick number) exists in the table with any other school.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Check Row 0: Player `eric curry` from `alabama`, pick number is `6`.\n   - No other row has \"alabama\" as the school.\n   - Now, compare this pick number (6) to all other rows to ensure it's the highest. The smallest pick numbers in the subsequent rounds are greater than 6 (e.g., round 2, pick 34).\n   \n6. **Conclusion**: Since `eric curry` is from \"alabama\" and has the lowest pick number (6), which is indeed the highest when considering all picks, the claim is verified as true.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
