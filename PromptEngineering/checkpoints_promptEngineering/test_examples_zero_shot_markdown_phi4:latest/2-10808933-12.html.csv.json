According to the claim, we are interested in cases where Hawthorn is the away team.\n  \n3. **Check Opponent's Score:**\n   - If Hawthorn is indeed the away team in any row, verify whether their opponent's score matches 17.10 (112).\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Home Team: st kilda\n  - Away Team: south melbourne\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Home Team: fitzroy\n  - Away Team: melbourne\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Home Team: north melbourne\n  - Away Team: footscray\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Home Team: hawthorn\n  - Away Team: essendon\n  - Opponent's Score (essendon): 17.10 (112)\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Home Team: richmond\n  - Away Team: collingwood\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Home Team: geelong\n  - Away Team: carlton\n\n### Conclusion:\n- In Row 3, Hawthorn is listed as the home team and not an away team.
