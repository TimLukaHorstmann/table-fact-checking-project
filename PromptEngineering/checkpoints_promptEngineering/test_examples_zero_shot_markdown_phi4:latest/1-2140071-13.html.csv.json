Therefore, episode 5 corresponds to row index 4.\n\n2. **Column Analysis**:\n   - We are interested in two columns: \"episode summary\" and the title of the episode (not explicitly listed but inferred from the content).\n   \n3. **Verification Against Table Data**:\n   - For row index 4 (\"Episode 5\"), check the \"episode summary\" cell to verify if it contains the phrase \"rita is made into an actress.\" According to the table, this cell indeed reads: \"rita is made into an actress.\"\n   - The claim mentions that the episode title should be \"rita is made into an actress.\" However, the table does not provide explicit episode titles; it only provides summaries. The title of the episode is generally inferred from the summary or given directly in another column (in this case, the summary serves as both).\n   \n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the summary for Episode 5 matches the phrase \"rita is made into an actress,\" and there are no separate titles provided that contradict this, we can infer the claim about the title being \"rita is made into an actress\" holds true based on available information.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant cells from the table to verify the claim include:\n- Row index 4 (Episode 5), Column: \"episode summary.\"\n\nThus, the JSON output reflecting our analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode summary\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
