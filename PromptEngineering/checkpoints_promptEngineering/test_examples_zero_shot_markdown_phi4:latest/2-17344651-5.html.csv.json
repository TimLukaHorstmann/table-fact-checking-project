    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The Boston Celtics played exactly six games at the Boston Garden in December.\n2. They won every one of those six games.\n\nLet's examine each condition step by step using the provided table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games Played at Boston Garden\n\nWe need to find all rows where the \"location\" column contains \"boston garden\". Here are those relevant entries:\n\n- **Row 2**: Opponent is Cleveland Cavaliers, Score is 122 - 99, Record is 15 - 1.\n- **Row 4**: Opponent is Denver Nuggets, Score is 123 - 107, Record is 16 - 2.\n- **Row 7**: Opponent is Atlanta Hawks, Score is 128 - 127, Record is 18 - 2.\n- **Row 10**: Opponent is Utah Jazz, Score is 117 - 106, Record is 20 - 3.\n- **Row 12**: Opponent is Milwaukee Bucks, Score is 92 - 107, Record is 22 - 4.\n- **Row 13**: Opponent is Indiana Pacers, Score is 117 - 107, Record is 23 - 4.\n\nFrom this, we can see that there are indeed six games played at the Boston Garden in December.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Wins for Each Game\n\nFor each game identified above, check if they were wins (i.e., the first score in \"score\" column should be higher):\n\n- **Row 2**: Score is 122 - 99. The Celtics won.\n- **Row 4**: Score is 123 - 107. The Celtics won.\n- **Row 7**: Score is 128 - 127. The Celtics won.\n- **Row 10**: Score is 117 - 106. The Celtics won.\n- **Row 12**: Score is 92 - 107. The Celtics lost.\n- **Row 13**: Score is 117 - 107. The Celtics won.\n\nIn Row 12, the Boston Celtics did not win (they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"boston celtic play 6 game at boston garden in december and win every 1\" is false because they lost one of those six games.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verifying this claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the conditions in the claim and verify them against the table:\n\n1. **Claim about largest loss margin:**\n   - The claim states that the Boston Celtics' largest loss margin in December was 25 points.\n   \n2. **Date of occurrence:**\n   - It specifies that this occurred on December 30.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions by examining the relevant columns and rows in the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify Losses:**\n   - We need to find games where the Boston Celtics lost, i.e., where the \"score\" column shows a higher score for the opponent than for the Celtics.\n   - Relevant cells for losses are:\n     - Row 22 (Philadephia 76ers): Celtics scored 107, opponents scored 110. Loss margin = 3 points.\n     - Row 26 (Milwaukee Bucks): Celtics scored 92, opponents scored 107. Loss margin = 15 points.\n     - Row 32 (Milwaukee Bucks again): Celtics scored 98, opponents scored 114. Loss margin = 16 points.\n\n2. **Largest Loss Margin:**\n   - From the losses identified:\n     - The largest loss margin is 16 points on December 30 against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n3. **Verification of Claim Conditions:**\n   - The claim states a 25-point loss, which does not match any of the calculated loss margins.\n   - The date mentioned in the claim (December 30) corresponds to a 16-point loss, not 25 points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The largest loss margin for the Boston Celtics in December was 16 points, not 25 points.\n- The claim about the occurrence on December 30 is correct regarding the date but incorrect regarding the margin of loss.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those related to losses and their margins:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
