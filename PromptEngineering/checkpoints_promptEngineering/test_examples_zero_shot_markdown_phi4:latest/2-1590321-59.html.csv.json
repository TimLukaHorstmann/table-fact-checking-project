    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Titus Ozon is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Years Active**: The claim states that Titus Ozon was active from 1947 - 1964.\n2. **Goals Scored**: The claim states that Titus Ozon scored 157 goals.\n\nWe will locate Titus Ozon's entry in the table and verify these conditions against the data provided:\n\n1. Locate the row where \"name\" is \"titus ozon\". According to the table, this corresponds to:\n   - Row index: 10\n   - The \"years\" column for Titus Ozon shows \"1947 - 1964\", which matches the claim.\n   - The \"goals\" column for Titus Ozon shows \"157\", which also matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the information in the table. Therefore, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the given table and specifically look for players who played during the years 1950 through 1965 and their respective goal counts.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Timeframe**: We are interested in players whose \"years\" range includes any part of the period from 1950 to 1965.\n   \n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - Row 1: dudu georgescu (1970 - 1986) - Not relevant as it does not include 1950-1965.\n   - Row 2: ionel danciulescu (1993 - present) - Not relevant.\n   - Row 3: rodion camataru (1974 - 1989) - Not relevant.\n   - Row 4: marin radu (1974 - 1989) - Not relevant.\n   - Row 5: ion oblemenco (1964 - 1976) - Partially overlaps with the period. Goals = 170.\n   - Row 6: florea dumitrache (1966 - 1983) - Not relevant as it starts in 1966.\n   - Row 7: mircea sandu (1970 - 1987) - Not relevant.\n   - Row 8: victor piturca (1975 - 1989) - Not relevant.\n   - Row 9: mihai adam (1962 - 1976) - Partially overlaps with the period. Goals = 160.\n   - Row 10: titus ozon (1947 - 1964) - Fully overlaps with the period. Goals = 157.\n\n3. **Analyze Relevant Players**:\n   - ion oblemenco: Played from 1964 to 1976, scoring 170 goals.\n   - mihai adam: Played from 1962 to 1976, scoring 160 goals.\n   - titus ozon: Played from 1947 to 1964, scoring 157 goals.\n\nThe claim states that during the years 1950 through 1965, the goal score must be less than 160. We found:\n- ion oblemenco scored 170 goals (exceeds 160).\n- mihai adam scored exactly 160 goals.\n- titus ozon scored 157 goals (less than 160).\n\nSince ion oblemenco and mihai adam have goal counts that are not less than 160, the claim is not fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
