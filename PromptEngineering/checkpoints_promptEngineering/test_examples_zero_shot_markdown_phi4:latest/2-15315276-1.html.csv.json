For 2013:\n   - Winner's Share: $15,000\n\n2. For 2014 and beyond, the table does not provide any data; hence we only consider up to 2013 based on available information.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the winner's share being never less than $15,000 after 2012. We need to check each year from 2013 onwards (the years given in the table) and ensure that the \"winner's share\" column value meets or exceeds $15,000 for those years.\n\nNow let's verify:\n\n- In 2013, the winner's share is exactly $15,000.\n  \nSince 2014 data is not available in the provided table, we can only validate up to 2013. The claim holds true based on the given data from 2013 onwards as there are no years listed after 2012 where the winner's share drops below $15,000.\n\nThus, the verification of relevant cells yields:\n\n- Row index for 2013: 0\n- Column name: \"winner 's share\"\n\nGiven this information and based on available data in the table, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

From the table data, we see it is actually \"$15,400\", not \"$14,000\".\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's return the JSON object with our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
