    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the year 1989 with symphony tower hold the rank of 2,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The building named \"symphony tower\" should exist in the table.\n2. This building should be associated with the year 1989.\n3. The building should have a rank of 2.\n\nLet's check these conditions against the data provided in the HTML table:\n\n- **Finding Symphony Tower:**\n  - Look through the column \"name\" to find the entry \"symphony tower.\"\n  - This is found in row index 1 (second row) where it says \"Symphony Tower.\"\n\n- **Checking the Year 1989:**\n  - In the same row, check the \"year completed\" column for the year 1989.\n  - The corresponding value in this cell is indeed 1989.\n\n- **Verifying the Rank of 2:**\n  - Finally, verify that the rank associated with this entry is 2.\n  - This matches as well because it's in row index 1 where the \"rank\" column shows 2.\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are met by Symphony Tower at row index 1:\n\n- The name \"Symphony Tower\" appears correctly.\n- It was completed in the year 1989.\n- It holds the rank of 2.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Here's the relevant JSON object reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Meridian Condominiums have 28 floors,\" we need to verify if this information is accurately represented in the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: \n   - We look for the row where \"Meridian Condominiums\" appears as an entry under the column representing building names, which corresponds to the \"name\" or similar heading.\n\n2. **Locate the Column**:\n   - Once we've identified the correct row, we need to find the column that lists the number of floors each building has. In this table, it's clear from context that there is a \"Floors\" or similar column indicating how many floors each structure contains.\n\n3. **Cross-reference and Verify**: \n   - We locate the entry for \"Meridian Condominiums,\" which appears in row 21.\n   - In this row, under the column representing the number of floors (which is labeled as \"Floors\"), we find the number listed to be \"28.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Validity of the Claim**:\n   - Since the table explicitly states that \"Meridian Condominiums\" have 28 floors in row 21, the claim is indeed correct.\n\nThus, based on these steps and observations from the table, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of the indices:\n- Row index 20 corresponds to \"Meridian Condominiums\" because table indexing in many contexts (including this representation) starts at zero.\n- The column names are inferred as \"name\" and \"Floors,\" representing building names and their respective number of floors.",

Locate the row where the building has a rank of 30.\n2. Check the value under the \"year\" column for that specific row.\n3. Compare this year with 1975 to determine if it matches.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the provided table data:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the row corresponding to rank 30. In the given table, we see:\n  - Rank 29: Wells Fargo Plaza\n  - Rank 30: El Cortez Apartment Hotel\n\n  Therefore, the row with \"Rank 30\" corresponds to the building named \"El Cortez Apartment Hotel.\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Check the year for this rank. From the table, we find that:\n  - For rank 30 (El Cortez Apartment Hotel), the \"year\" column shows 1927.\n\n- **Step 3**: Compare this with the year mentioned in the claim (1975). The building with rank 30 was constructed in 1927, not 1975.
