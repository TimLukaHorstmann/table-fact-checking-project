    "resp": "To assess the claim, we need to determine if Ivor Bueb used an Alta Straight-4 engine twice between 1958 and 1959 based on the provided table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. **\"Ivor Bueb race use the alta straight - 4 engine\":** We need to check for entries involving \"Ivor Bueb\" as the entrant and \"Alta Straight-4\" as the engine type.\n2. **\"2 time between 1958 and 1959\":** The events must occur in these two years, specifically more than once.\n\n### Analysis of the Table:\nLet's examine each row for relevant information:\n\n1. **1957, Connaught Engineering, Connaught Type B, Alta Straight-4**\n   - Year: 1957 (not within our range)\n   - Entrant: Connaught Engineering (not Ivor Bueb)\n   - Engine: Alta Straight-4\n\n2. **1957, Gilby Engineering Ltd, Maserati 250F, Maserati Straight-6**\n   - Year: 1957\n   - Entrant: Gilby Engineering Ltd\n   - Engine: Maserati Straight-6 (not relevant)\n\n3. **1958, BC Ecclestone, Connaught Type B, Alta Straight-4**\n   - Year: 1958 (within range)\n   - Entrant: BC Ecclestone (not Ivor Bueb)\n   - Engine: Alta Straight-4\n\n4. **1958, Ecurie Demi Litre, Lotus 12, Climax Straight-4**\n   - Year: 1958\n   - Entrant: Ecurie Demi Litre\n   - Engine: Climax Straight-4 (not relevant)\n\n5. **1959, British Racing Partnership, Cooper T51, Climax Straight-4**\n   - Year: 1959\n   - Entrant: British Racing Partnership\n   - Engine: Climax Straight-4\n\n6. **1959, British Racing Partnership, Cooper T51, Borgward Straight-4**\n   - Year: 1959\n   - Entrant: British Racing Partnership\n   - Engine: Borgward Straight-4\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The Alta Straight-4 engine is only used in years 1957 and 1958.\n- No row lists Ivor Bueb as the entrant with an Alta Straight-4 engine, nor does he appear at all.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim that \"Ivor Bueb race use the alta straight - 4 engine 2 time between 1958 and 1959\" is false because there are no instances of Ivor Bueb racing with an Alta Straight-4 engine in those years. The only relevant entries for the engine type within the specified years do not involve Ivor Bueb.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
