    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the colt draft 3 player from oklahoma,\" we need to verify two key aspects against the data provided in the table: \n\n1. The draft round (specifically, whether it is round 3).\n2. Whether the selected player's college is Oklahoma.\n\nLet's break down these requirements step-by-step:\n\n- **Draft Round**: According to NFL historical draft rounds, each pick number can be associated with a specific round and overall position within that round. For example:\n  - Rounds 1 through 26 contain the first picks in descending order.\n  - Rounds 27 through 53 are the second-round selections.\n  \n  In this table:\n  - Picks 1 to 26 correspond to Round 1.\n  - Picks 27 to 53 correspond to Round 2.\n\n  Therefore, for Round 3, we would expect pick numbers starting from 54 onwards. None of the players listed have a pick number as low as 54; hence, no player listed is part of the third round.\n\n- **College**: We need to check if any player listed attended Oklahoma. According to the table data:\n  - Players from Oklahoma include \"Bobby Boyd\" with pick number 53 and \"Tommy McDonald\" with pick number 66.\n  \nGiven this analysis, since no players in Round 3 are present in the list (because it starts at pick number 1), we can conclude that there is no player drafted in Round 3 from Oklahoma or any other college.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nHere's how this information translates into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of relevant cells:\n- Row index 4 corresponds to Bobby Boyd from Oklahoma with pick number 53. This is the last pick in Round 2 and thus verifies that no player listed is from Round 3.\n- Row index 17 represents Tommy McDonald, also from Oklahoma but picked at number 66, which further confirms he was drafted well after Round 3 started.",

This will tell us whether Tom Roche was selected in the first round.\n\n2. **Find Row for Tom Roche**: We need to locate the row where the name \"Tom Roche\" appears, which corresponds to row index 30 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n3. **Check Round Information**: In row 30, under the column \"round\", we find the value `1`.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the number of player draft between the first and 30th round pick be less then 100,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the table provided.\n\nThe table includes information about players, specifically their row indices from 0 to 29 (which corresponds to 30 players) and other details such as team, position, height, weight, experience, college, and draft-related columns: round, pick, and overall number. \n\nHere are the key considerations:\n\n1. **Draft Rounds:** The claim is concerned with \"the number of player draft between the first and 30th round pick.\" However, in typical NFL drafts, there are only 7 rounds. Therefore, having players drafted beyond a hypothetical 30th round is not possible under standard conditions.\n\n2. **Data Check:** We should check if any player's draft data indicates they were selected in a round greater than the maximum of 7 rounds or within any conceivable valid range between 1 and 30.\n\n3. **Relevant Columns:** The relevant columns for this claim are \"round\" (column index 8) to determine which round each player was drafted, and potentially \"pick\" (column index 9), although it's primarily the \"round\" column that directly addresses the condition of being between rounds 1 and 30.\n\n4. **Verification:** We will look at the data for all players (row indices from 0 to 29) in the \"round\" column to confirm whether any player has a round number beyond 7 or within an invalid range. Since standard NFL drafts do not go beyond 7 rounds, if all players are drafted between rounds 1 and 7, then there is no possibility of reaching a count above zero for rounds 8-30.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** If all player entries in the \"round\" column fall within the valid draft round range (1 to 7), this will support the claim because it's impossible for them to be drafted beyond the 7th round, hence certainly less than 100 players can be selected between rounds 1 and 30.\n\nBy checking each entry:\n\n- The highest draft round in the data is 1.\n- All other entries are missing or implied as not drafted (typically represented by empty values).\n\nTherefore, no player was drafted beyond the 7th round.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"joe sabol be draft first\", we need to verify if Joe Sabol was indeed drafted in the first round of this particular NFL Draft.\n\n1. **Column Analysis**:\n   - The relevant columns for verifying the claim are \"pick\" (indicating the order of selection) and \"name\" (to identify players).\n\n2. **Verification Process**:\n   - Check each player's name to see if it matches \"joe sabol\".\n   - Verify the corresponding pick number to ensure it indicates a first-round draft, which would be within the range 1-32 for the NFL Draft.\n\n3. **Checking Joe Sabol**:\n   - Locate Joe Sabol in the table and check his pick number.\n   - According to the table, Joe Sabol is listed with a \"pick\" of 28.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Joe Sabol was drafted as the 28th pick, he was not drafted first. The claim that \"joe sabol be draft first\" is therefore false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - To verify this claim, we need to look at Joe Sabol's row in the table where both his name and pick number are relevant.\n   - Joe Sabol appears on row index 27 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\nThe JSON object reflecting the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
