    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Chris Vermeulen from the table provided in HTML format, we need to verify each part of the statement:\n\n1. **Rider's Name:** The claim mentions \"Chris Vermeulen.\" We need to locate this name within the 'rider' column.\n2. **Grid Position:** The claim states that he started in the 12th grid position. This corresponds to the 'grid' column value for his row.\n3. **Number of Laps Completed:** It claims he completed 16 laps, which matches with the 'laps' column.\n4. **Race Outcome:** Finally, it mentions that he retired, which should correspond to the 'time' column indicating a retirement.\n\n### Verification Process:\n- Locate the row where \"Chris Vermeulen\" is listed in the 'rider' column. This is at `row_index = 14`.\n  \n- Check if his grid position ('grid') is 12. In this case, it matches with the claim.\n  \n- Confirm that he completed 16 laps ('laps'). Again, it matches the claim.\n\n- Ensure that the race outcome is 'retirement' in the 'time' column, which also matches the statement.\n\nAll parts of the claim are verified against the corresponding cells from Chris Vermeulen's row:\n\n1. **Row Index:** 14 (Chris Vermeulen)\n2. **Columns to Check:**\n   - 'rider': value is \"chris vermeulen\"\n   - 'grid': value is 12\n   - 'laps': value is 16\n   - 'time': value is \"retirement\"\n\nEach condition in the claim has been fully supported by the data within the table.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
