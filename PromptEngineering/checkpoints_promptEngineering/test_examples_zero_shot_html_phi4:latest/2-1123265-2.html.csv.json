The relevant cell to verify this claim is located at row index 16 and the \"laps\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tarso Marques start in grid 13 but do not complete any lap\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Grid Position**: Check if Tarso Marques started in grid position 13.\n2. **Laps Completed**: Verify that Tarso Marques completed 0 laps.\n\nLet's locate Tarso Marques in the table and examine these specific columns for his entry:\n\n- **Driver Name**: \"Tarso Marques\"\n- **Grid Position (column: 'grid')**: We need to find the grid position from the relevant row.\n- **Laps Completed (column: 'laps')**: We need to confirm that he completed 0 laps.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n1. Locate Tarso Marques in the \"driver\" column. He is found in the last row of the table.\n2. Check his grid position:\n   - The cell under the \"grid\" column for this row shows a value of **21**.\n3. Check the laps completed:\n   - The cell under the \"laps\" column for this row shows a value of **0**.\n\nFrom this analysis, Tarso Marques did not start in grid 13; he started in grid position 21. Thus, the first condition of the claim is false. However, the second part of the claim is true since he completed 0 laps.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect (he did not start on grid 13), the entire claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Grid position: Row index 16, column \"grid\"\n- Laps completed: Row index 16, column \"laps\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
