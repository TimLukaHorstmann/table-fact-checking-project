Check if this attendance number (60671) is indeed the highest among all games listed in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Locate the Attendance for October 28, 1962:**\n  - According to the table:\n    - Row index 6 has \"date\" as \"October 28, 1962\".\n    - The \"attendance\" column value is 62844.\n  - This means the claim's stated attendance (60671) does not match the actual recorded attendance for that date.\n\n- **Compare Attendance Across All Games:**\n  - We need to compare 60671 with all other \"attendance\" values in the table:\n    - Row index 0: 15730\n    - Row index 1: 57491\n    - Row index 2: 37419\n    - Row index 3: 18104\n    - Row index 4: 38264\n    - **Row index 5**: *60671* (stated in the claim)\n    - Row index 6: 62844 (actual attendance for October 28, 1962; this is higher than 60671)\n    - Row index 7: 49888\n    - Row index 8: 48169\n    - Row index 9: 21231\n    - Row index 10: 49219\n    - Row index 11: 32229\n    - Row index 12: 56964\n    - Row index 13: 34508\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - The actual highest attendance is 62844, which occurs on October 28, 1962 (Row index 6).\n  - Therefore, the claim that \"the game on October 28, 1962 have the highest attendance of any game with 60671 attendee\" is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The cells relevant to verify the claim include:\n  - Row index 5 for the stated attendance in the claim.\n  - Row index 6 for both date verification and actual attendance comparison.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
