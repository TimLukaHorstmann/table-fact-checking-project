    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze two main components:\n\n1. **Identify the largest loss margin in December**: The loss margin is calculated as the difference between points scored by the opponent and points scored by the Boston Celtics. A negative score for the Celtics indicates a loss.\n\n2. **Check if this largest loss occurred on December 30th**.\n\nLet's evaluate each row that represents a game where the Celtics lost:\n\n- **Row 22 (Game 22)**:  \n  - Date: Fri Dec 14\n  - Opponent: Philadelphia 76ers\n  - Score: 107 - 110\n  - Loss Margin: \\(110 - 107 = 3\\) points\n\n- **Row 26 (Game 26)**:\n  - Date: Wed Dec 19\n  - Opponent: Milwaukee Bucks\n  - Score: 92 - 107\n  - Loss Margin: \\(107 - 92 = 15\\) points\n\n- **Row 28 (Game 28)**:\n  - Date: Sat Dec 22\n  - Opponent: Chicago Bulls\n  - Score: 85 - 110\n  - Loss Margin: \\(110 - 85 = 25\\) points\n\n- **Row 32 (Game 32)**:\n  - Date: Sun Dec 30\n  - Opponent: Milwaukee Bucks\n  - Score: 98 - 114\n  - Loss Margin: \\(114 - 98 = 16\\) points\n\nThe largest loss margin is 25 points, which occurred in Game 28 on December 22nd against the Chicago Bulls. The claim states that the largest loss was on December 30th, but this game (Game 32) had a loss margin of only 16 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim about the Celtics' game in December, we need to check two parts of it:\n\n1. **The Celtics only play one game on a Thursday in December**.\n2. **They lose that particular game**.\n\nLet's go through each part systematically using the provided table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Thursdays and Check for Games\n\n- We will look at the \"date\" column to find games played on any Thursday:\n  \n  - The dates given are:\n    - Sat Dec 1\n    - Sun Dec 2\n    - Tue Dec 4\n    - Wed Dec 5\n    - Sat Dec 8\n    - Sun Dec 9\n    - Tue Dec 11\n    - Wed Dec 12\n    - Fri Dec 14\n    - Sat Dec 15\n    - Tue Dec 18\n    - **Wed Dec 19**\n    - Fri Dec 21\n    - Sat Dec 22\n    - Wed Dec 26\n    - **Thu Dec 27** (This is the only Thursday)\n    - Sat Dec 29\n    - Sun Dec 30\n\n- From this, we find that there is indeed only one game on a Thursday in December: \n  - Game number 30, played on Thu Dec 27.\n\n### Step 2: Verify if They Lose That Game\n\n- For the identified game (Thu Dec 27), we check the \"score\" column to determine if they lost:\n  - The score is \"118 - 103\", with Celtics scoring 118. \n  - Since their score is higher than the opponent's, they won this game.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the Celtics lose the only Thursday game in December, but we've established they actually win it. Therefore, the claim is not true.\n\nNow let's format our findings into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- The first relevant cell corresponds to the date \"Thu Dec 27\" confirming it's a Thursday game.\n- The second relevant cell is the score for this game, verifying they won.",
