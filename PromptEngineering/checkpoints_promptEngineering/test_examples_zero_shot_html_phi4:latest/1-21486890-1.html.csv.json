There is a player who has played **161 innings**.\n2. The same player has scored **5088 runs**.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n- **Condition 1:** Look for a row where the \"Innings\" column equals 161.\n- **Condition 2:** Check if that same row also shows that the player has scored exactly 5088 runs in the \"Runs Scored\" column.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify relevant rows where the \"Innings\" value is 161.\n2. For each identified row, check if the \"Runs Scored\" value is 5088.\n3. Verify if both conditions are satisfied simultaneously for any player.\n\n### Table Examination:\n\n- Go through the table and look at the columns labeled \"Innings\" and \"Runs Scored\".\n- Specifically, focus on rows that meet either condition to see if they collectively satisfy both conditions.\n\n#### Relevant Rows from the Table:\nUpon reviewing the data in the table:\n\n1. **Row 11**: \n   - **Player:** Andrew Symonds\n   - **Column Values:**\n     - \"Innings\": 161 (matches Condition 1)\n     - \"Runs Scored\": 5088 (matches Condition 2)\n\nThe above row satisfies both conditions of the claim simultaneously.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince we have found a player, Andrew Symonds, who has played exactly 161 innings and scored exactly 5088 runs, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Innings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Runs Scored\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object reflects that the claim is true and identifies the relevant cells from row index 11 in both the \"Innings\" and \"Runs Scored\" columns.",

His participation is in less than 161 innings.\n\nLet's check these conditions step-by-step using the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Run Total\nWe will look at the \"runs\" column to identify who has the highest run total. The relevant cell for Andrew Symonds would be located where his name appears, which is row 11 (since indexing starts from 0):\n\n- **Andrew Symonds' runs**: 5088\n\nNow let's check if this is indeed the highest:\n\n- Highest runs in the table: \n  - Shane Watson has 4796\n  - Geoff Marsh has 4357\n  - Michael Hussey has 5442 (higher than Andrew Symonds)\n  - Michael Clarke's data isn't present, but based on available rows, no one else exceeds 5088 except for Michael Hussey.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Andrew Symonds has the highest run total is **FALSE** because Michael Hussey scored more runs (5442).\n\n### Step 2: Verify Inning Participation\nWe will look at the \"innings\" column to verify if Andrew Symonds participated in less than 161 innings:\n\n- **Andrew Symonds' innings**: 198\n\nSince 198 innings is greater than 161, this condition is also not met.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions of the claim are false. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification include:\n\n- Andrew Symonds' run total (row 11, \"runs\")\n- Andrew Symonds' innings participation (row 11, \"innings\")\n- Michael Hussey's runs (for comparison, row 10, \"runs\")\n\nHere is the JSON response reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"innings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"runs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
