    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the blue jays regularly draw more than 40000 fans in the month of June 2000\" is supported by the data, we need to examine each entry for games involving the Blue Jays during that time period and look specifically at the \"Attendance\" column.\n\nFirstly, let's identify the rows related to the Blue Jays from the given table:\n\n1. Row 0: The Blue Jays played against the Angels.\n2. Row 3: The Blue Jays played against the Mariners.\n3. Row 6: The Blue Jays played against the Twins.\n4. Row 9: The Blue Jays played against the Athletics.\n5. Row 12: The Blue Jays played against the Indians.\n\nNext, let's extract and analyze the \"Attendance\" for these games:\n\n- **Row 0**: Attendance is 40,020.\n- **Row 3**: Attendance is 42,035.\n- **Row 6**: Attendance is 39,843.\n- **Row 9**: Attendance is 36,407.\n- **Row 12**: Attendance is 38,473.\n\nWe observe the following:\n- Three games (Rows 0, 3, and 6) had attendance figures exceeding 40,000: 40,020; 42,035; and 39,843 respectively. \n- Two games (Rows 9 and 12) did not reach 40,000 fans: 36,407 and 38,473.\n\nThe term \"regularly\" suggests consistency across most games, which implies that the majority of occurrences should support the claim for it to be considered true. In this case, only 3 out of the 5 Blue Jays' games in June had attendance over 40,000, which is not a clear majority or regular pattern.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the statement does not hold true that the Blue Jays regularly drew more than 40,000 fans during June 2000. The presence of two lower-attendance games suggests inconsistency with the claim.\n\nHence, the conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
