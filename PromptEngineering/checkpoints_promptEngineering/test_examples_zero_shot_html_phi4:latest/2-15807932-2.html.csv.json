We need to identify any country with exactly 1 gold medal.\n2. Check if any such country has a rank less than 2.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Japan, Rank: 1\n  - Gold Medals: 5\n  - This does not satisfy the condition of having 1 gold medal.\n\n- **Row 2**: Netherlands, Rank: 2\n  - Gold Medals: 1\n  - The country has 1 gold medal but its rank is exactly 2, which does not meet the \"smaller than 2\" criterion for ranks.\n\n- **Rows 3 and 4**: Germany and South Korea, both with Rank: 3\n  - Gold Medals: 0 for each\n  - Neither have 1 gold medal.\n\n- **Row 5**: Soviet Union, Rank: 5\n  - Gold Medals: 0\n  - Does not satisfy the condition of having 1 gold medal.\n\n- **Row 6**: Great Britain, Rank: 6\n  - Gold Medals: 0\n  - Does not satisfy the condition of having 1 gold medal.\n\nAfter evaluating all the rows, we see that there is no country with exactly 1 gold medal and a rank smaller than 2. The Netherlands has 1 gold but its rank is exactly 2, which does not fulfill the \"smaller than 2\" part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells for checking this are:\n- For \"1 gold,\" we need to check all rows under the \"gold\" column.\n- For ranks smaller than 2, we only care about row 1 since it's the only one with a rank less than 2.\n\nHere are the JSON results:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
