    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the Toronto Blue Jays' games in May 1991, we need to verify two main conditions:\n1. The team played at least 8 games.\n2. Each of these games had an attendance greater than 5000.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table for relevant data:\n\n- **Date and Opponent Columns**: These columns indicate against which team the Blue Jays played, confirming each game date and opponent.\n  \n- **Score Column**: This is where we determine if it was a home or away game by checking who scored first (typically represented as \"Toronto Blue Jays Score - Opponent Score\"). If Toronto Blue Jays are listed first, they played at home; otherwise, they were the visitors.\n\n- **Attendance Column**: This column provides information about the number of attendees for each game. We need to check if this value exceeds 5000 for games where Toronto played at home.\n\nNow, let's go through the table and collect relevant data:\n\n1. May 4: Attendance = 50252 (Home)\n2. May 5: Attendance = 50249 (Home)\n3. May 6: Attendance = 50267 (Away) - not considered since attendance is not listed for away games.\n4. May 7: Attendance = 50246 (Away) - not considered.\n5. May 8: Attendance = 50252 (Home)\n6. May 9: Attendance = 50268 (Home)\n7. May 10: Attendance = 50342 (Away) - not considered.\n8. May 11: Attendance = 50299 (Home)\n9. May 12: Attendance = 50272 (Away) - not considered.\n10. May 13: Attendance = 50249 (Away) - not considered.\n11. May 14: Attendance = 50315 (Home)\n12. May 15: Attendance = 50271 (Away) - not considered.\n13. May 16: Attendance = 50262 (Home)\n\nFrom this analysis, we identify the following home games with attendance greater than 5000:\n- May 4\n- May 5\n- May 8\n- May 9\n- May 11\n- May 14\n- May 16\n\nThere are 7 games where Toronto Blue Jays played at home with an attendance over 5000.

For May 25, 1991:\n   - The \"Opponent\" again is \"Angels.\"\n   - The \"VAN\" column remains empty, indicating no involvement by the Blue Jays.\n\n3. For May 26, 1991:\n   - The \"Opponent\" continues to be \"Angels.\"\n   - Once more, the \"VAN\" column is empty.\n\n4. Now, checking for any instances where the Toronto Blue Jays (VAN) are listed as visiting and playing against the Angels in May:\n   - On May 28, 1991: The opponent is \"Athletics,\" so this row is not relevant.\n   - On May 29, 1991: Again, the opponent is \"Athletics.\"\n   - On May 30, 1991: The opponent is still \"Athletics.\"\n   - On May 31, 1991:\n     - The \"Opponent\" is \"Angels,\" and the \"VAN\" column is filled with a score (3-5), indicating that this was a game where the Blue Jays played as visitors.\n\nBy analyzing the data above, we can see that the Toronto Blue Jays only played one game against the Angels in May 1991. The rows corresponding to this are those where the \"VAN\" column is filled and the opponent is \"Angels,\" which occurs on May 31.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there was only one occurrence of such a match-up during that month.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this conclusion include:\n- For May 24: Opponent (column_name) at row index 23.\n- For May 25: Opponent (column_name) at row index 24.\n- For May 26: Opponent (column_name) at row index 25.\n- For May 31: Both the \"Opponent\" and \"VAN\" columns are relevant. The Opponent is at row index 29, and VAN at the same row index.\n\nThe final JSON object summarizing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"VAN\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Toronto Blue Jays lose 2 of the last 3 games they play in May 1991\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant rows and columns in the provided table.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Three Games Played by the Blue Jays in May:**\n   - The dates for the last three games are May 28, May 29, and May 30 (all against Athletics) since these are the last entries listed for the Toronto Blue Jays before June begins.\n   \n2. **Check the Results of These Games:**\n   - For each game on May 28, May 29, and May 30:\n     - **May 28:** Result is \"8 - 4\" (Athletics win).\n     - **May 29:** Result is \"8 - 3\" (Athletics win).\n     - **May 30:** Result is \"8 - 6\" (Athletics win).\n\n3. **Determine Wins and Losses:**\n   - The Blue Jays lost all three of these games.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states they lose 2 out of the last 3 games.\n   - Since they actually lost all 3, this supports the claim that they lost at least 2 of the last 3 games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is indeed true because losing 3 out of 3 satisfies the condition of losing 2 out of 3. \n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- **Row Indexes:**\n  - May 28: Row index 26\n  - May 29: Row index 27\n  - May 30: Row index 28\n\n- **Column Name:** \"Opponent\" and \"Result\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
