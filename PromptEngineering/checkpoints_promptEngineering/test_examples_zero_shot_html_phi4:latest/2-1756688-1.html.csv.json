    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding Nathan Ablett's performance with Geelong in the year 2008, we must carefully examine each part of the table provided.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim asserts that \"across all his years with Geelong, Nathan Ablett's best year for points was 2008.\"\n   - To verify this, we need to evaluate Nathan Ablett's performance in terms of total points scored (goals and behinds) for each year he played with Geelong.\n\n2. **Table Examination:**\n   - The relevant rows are those where the team is \"Geelong\" and the columns that detail statistics related to scoring, which include \"goals,\" \"behinds,\" or any combined statistic representing total points.\n   \n3. **Relevant Data Points from the Table:**\n\n   - **2005:**\n     - Goals: 8 (2.0)\n     - Behinds: 2 (0.5)\n\n   - **2006:**\n     - Goals: 4 (0.6)\n     - Behinds: 3 (0.4)\n\n   - **2007:**\n     - Goals: 34 (1.6)\n     - Behinds: 18 (0.9)\n\n   - **2008:**\n     - The statistics for 2008 are not available as they are marked with \"-\".\n\n4. **Calculating Total Points:**\n   - Points in Australian Rules Football are calculated as follows:\n     - Each goal is worth 6 points.\n     - Each behind is worth 1 point.\n\n   - For each year where data is available, calculate the total points:\n\n     - **2005:**\n       \\[\n       \\text{Total Points} = (8 \\times 6) + (2 \\times 1) = 48 + 2 = 50\n       \\]\n\n     - **2006:**\n       \\[\n       \\text{Total Points} = (4 \\times 6) + (3 \\times 1) = 24 + 3 = 27\n       \\]\n\n     - **2007:**\n       \\[\n       \\text{Total Points} = (34 \\times 6) + (18 \\times 1) = 204 + 18 = 222\n       \\]\n\n   - **2008:** No data available, so no points can be calculated.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the calculations, Nathan Ablett's best year for total points while with Geelong is 2007, not 2008.\n   - Since there are no statistics provided for 2008, it cannot be claimed as his best year.\n\nThe claim that 2008 was Nathan Ablett's best year in terms of points scored with Geelong is therefore false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"behinds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
