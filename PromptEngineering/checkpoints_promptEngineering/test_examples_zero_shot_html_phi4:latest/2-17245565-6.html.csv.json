    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the scores for the first round of the golf tournament and compare them with the eventual winner's score in the same round.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Winner:**\n   - The table shows that Jim Simons (a) from the United States won the tournament with a total score of 207.\n   - His scores for each round are given as \"71 + 71 + 65 = 207\", which means his scores for the rounds were:\n     - Round 1: 71\n     - Round 2: 71\n     - Round 3: 65\n\n2. **Extract First Round Scores:**\n   - We need to extract and compare the first-round scores of all players with Jim Simons' first-round score (71).\n\n3. **Compare Scores:**\n   - Check each player's first round score:\n     - Jack Nicklaus: 69\n     - Bobby Nichols: 69\n     - Lee Trevino: 70\n     - George Archer: 71\n     - Jim Colbert: 69\n     - Bob Erickson: 67\n     - Ken Still: 71\n     - Larry Hinson: 71\n     - Bruce Devlin: 72\n\n4. **Count Players with Better First Round Scores:**\n   - A better score than 71 is any score less than 71.\n   - The players who scored better than 71 in the first round are:\n     - Jack Nicklaus: 69\n     - Bobby Nichols: 69\n     - Lee Trevino: 70\n     - Jim Colbert: 69\n     - Bob Erickson: 67\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that more than 4 players scored better in the first round than the eventual winner.\n   - We have identified 5 players who scored better (Jack Nicklaus, Bobby Nichols, Lee Trevino, Jim Colbert, and Bob Erickson).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are indeed more than 4 players who scored better than Jim Simons in the first round.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nWe need to identify the relevant cells for these comparisons:\n\n- Jim Simons' first-round score: Row 0, Column \"score\"\n- Jack Nicklaus' first-round score: Row 1, Column \"score\"\n- Bobby Nichols' first-round score: Row 2, Column \"score\"\n- Lee Trevino's first-round score: Row 3, Column \"score\"\n- George Archer's first-round score: Row 4, Column \"score\" (not better)\n- Jim Colbert's first-round score: Row 5, Column \"score\"\n- Bob Erickson's first-round score: Row 6, Column \"score\"\n- Ken Still's first-round score: Row 7, Column \"score\" (not better)\n- Larry Hinson's first-round score: Row 8, Column \"score\" (not better)\n- Bruce Devlin's first-round score: Row 9, Column \"score\" (not better)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"more than 3 golfers scored under par on three separate rounds,\" we need to analyze the scores and determine how many golfers achieved this.\n\nA score is considered under par if the \"to par\" value is negative. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Golfers with Negative 'To Par':**\n   - A score of \"under par\" means the golfer's total score was less than the course's par, which results in a negative \"to par\" value.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - Row 1 (Jim Simons): \n     - Score: 71 + 71 + 65 = 207\n     - To Par: -3\n     - Jim Simons scored under par on the three rounds combined.\n   \n   - Rows 2-10:\n     - Jack Nicklaus, Bobby Nichols, Lee Trevino, George Archer, Jim Colbert, Bob Erickson, Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin all have \"to par\" values of -1, E (even), or +1/+2. None of these indicate scoring under par on each round individually.\n\n3. **Check Individual Rounds for Under Par:**\n   - Jim Simons:\n     - Round 1: 71\n     - Round 2: 71\n     - Round 3: 65\n     - Course par per round is not given, but since the total \"to par\" is -3, we can deduce:\n       - If par per round is assumed to be 70 (a common standard), then:\n         - Round 1: +1 (71-70)\n         - Round 2: +1 (71-70)\n         - Round 3: -5 (65-70)\n     - Jim Simons scored under par only in Round 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Jim Simons scored under par on one of the three rounds.\n   - No golfer scored under par on all three rounds.\n   - Therefore, no golfer scored under par on more than one round.\n\nSince no golfer scored under par on three separate rounds, and only one golfer did so on one round, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are those containing the \"to par\" values and individual round scores for Jim Simons:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
