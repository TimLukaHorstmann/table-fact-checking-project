    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there is exactly one entry in the table where the number of laps is 104 and the \"time / retired\" value is \"+ 6.18\". \n\nLet's go through each row and check these conditions:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Laps: 105\n   - Time/Retired: 2:06:18.23\n   - Does not match.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Laps: 105\n   - Time/Retired: + 6.18\n   - Does not match (laps are not 104).\n\n3. **Rows 2 to 15**: \n   - None of these rows have 104 laps.\n   \n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no row with exactly 104 laps and a \"time / retired\" value of \"+ 6.18\". Therefore, the condition is not met even once in the table.\n\nSince there are zero entries that satisfy both conditions (laps = 104 and time/retired = + 6.18), the claim stating there should be one such entry is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this are those corresponding to laps and \"time / retired\" for each row. However, since no rows meet the criteria, we don't need specific cell indices beyond confirming none match.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells include the first two rows where either condition could potentially be met (laps or time/retired), but no row satisfies both conditions simultaneously.",
