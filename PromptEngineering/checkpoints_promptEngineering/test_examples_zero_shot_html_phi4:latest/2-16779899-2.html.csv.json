    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding week 15's game on December 14, 1986, we need to verify two main aspects from the provided table: the date and result of the game in question.\n\n1. **Identifying Week 15:**\n   - The table is organized by weeks, with each row representing a different week.\n   - Locate row corresponding to \"week\" column value 15.\n\n2. **Checking Date for Week 15:**\n   - In row 15 (index 14 if zero-indexed), under the \"date\" column, we see \"december 14 , 1986\".\n   - This matches the date mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Verifying Result of Game in Week 15:**\n   - Check the \"result\" column for row 15.\n   - The value is \"l 34 - 3\", indicating a loss (denoted by 'l') with the score 34-3.\n   - This contradicts the claim which states it was a win (\"w 34 - 3\").\n\nBased on these checks, the claim that week 15th's game on December 14, 1986, was a win with a score of 34-3 is incorrect.
