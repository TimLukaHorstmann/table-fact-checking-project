There should not be another game with this score occurring after the date \"may 10\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the table:\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - Date: May 10\n  - Score: 5 - 4 (ot)\n  - Location / Attendance: Montreal Forum\n\nThis row confirms that there is a game with the score \"5 - 4 (ot)\" played at the \"montreal forum\" on May 10.\n\nNext, we need to check if there are any other rows after May 10:\n\n- There are no rows after May 10 in the table.\n\nSince there are no games listed after May 10, there is no possibility of another game with the score \"5 - 4 (ot)\" occurring after this date.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- Row 6: Date\n- Row 6: Score\n- Row 6: Location / Attendance\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
