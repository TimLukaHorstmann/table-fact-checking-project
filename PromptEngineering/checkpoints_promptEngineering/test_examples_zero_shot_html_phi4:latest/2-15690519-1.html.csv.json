    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rob burke band have 76 point\" is true or false, we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. The performer name should be \"rob burke band\".\n2. The points associated with this performer should be 76.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the information provided in the table:\n\n- We first identify the row where \"rob burke band\" is listed as a performer.\n- In the given table, we see that \"rob burke band\" appears in the first row (index 0) under the column labeled \"performer\".\n- Next, we need to check if this performer has 76 points.\n- In the same row (index 0), the \"points\" column indicates a value of 76.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied: \n\n1. The performer name is indeed \"rob burke band\".\n2. The points assigned to them are 76.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells:\n\n- Cell at row index 0 and column name \"performer\" contains the value \"rob burke band\".\n- Cell at row index 0 and column name \"points\" contains the value 76.\n\nGiven this analysis, we conclude that the claim is true.
