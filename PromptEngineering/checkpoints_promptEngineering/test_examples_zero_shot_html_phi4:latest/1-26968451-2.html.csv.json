    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Michael Lembeck directed series number 39, Fly Solo,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The episode with `series` number 39 has the title \"Fly Solo.\"\n2. Michael Lembeck is listed as the director for that episode.\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells in the table based on these conditions:\n\n- **Row Index and Series Number**: \n  - We need to find the row where `series` is equal to 39.\n  \n- **Column Names**:\n  - For the first condition, we look at the column \"title\" (or whatever it's named for episode titles) and check if its value is \"Fly Solo.\"\n  - For the second condition, we look at the column \"directed by\" (or similar) to verify that Michael Lembeck directed this episode.\n\nNow, let's locate these cells in the table:\n\n- The row with `series` number 39 corresponds to:\n  - Row Index: 15\n\nFor this specific row, we check:\n- **Title**: It should be \"Fly Solo.\"\n- **Directed By**: It should be \"Michael Lembeck.\"\n\nFrom the data provided in the table for series number 39:\n\n- **Row Index 15**:\n  - The title is indeed \"Fly Solo.\"\n  - Michael Lembeck is listed as the director.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"series number 39 be write by michael lembeck,\" we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Check if series number 39 is directed by Michael Lembeck.\n2. Confirm that Michael Lembeck is not listed as a writer for series number 39.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: The row corresponding to series number 39 is at index 14 (as counting starts from 0).\n  \n- **Column Check**:\n  - \"Directed by\" Column: \n    - For series number 39, located in row index 14 and under the column \"Directed by,\" we find \"Michael Lembeck.\"\n  - \"Written by\" Column:\n    - For series number 39, located in row index 14 and under the column \"Written by,\" it shows \"Leslie Rieder.\" Michael Lembeck is not listed here.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim states that the series was written by Michael Lembeck. However, from the table data for series number 39, we find that Leslie Rieder wrote it, not Michael Lembeck.\n- Although Michael Lembeck directed the episode, which is true according to the table, this information alone does not fulfill the condition of him being the writer.\n\nGiven these points, the claim is incorrect because the condition regarding writing by Michael Lembeck is not satisfied. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting the relevant cells used for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
