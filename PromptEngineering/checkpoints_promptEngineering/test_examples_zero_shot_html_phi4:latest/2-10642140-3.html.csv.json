    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"angola and senegal win 3 gold medal between them\" is true or false, we need to extract and verify the relevant data from the table regarding the number of gold medals won by Angola and Senegal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to locate the rows for \"angola\" and \"senegal\".\n   \n2. **Extract Gold Medal Counts:**\n   - For each identified row, extract the value in the \"gold\" column which indicates the number of gold medals won by that nation.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Gold Medals:**\n   - Sum the gold medal counts for Angola and Senegal to see if they total 3.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row for Angola (5th row):**\n  - Nation: \"angola\"\n  - Gold Medals: The value in the \"gold\" column is `1`.\n\n- **Row for Senegal (4th row):**\n  - Nation: \"senegal\"\n  - Gold Medals: The value in the \"gold\" column is `1`.\n\n### Calculation:\n- Total gold medals between Angola and Senegal = 1 (Angola) + 1 (Senegal) = 2.\n\nThe claim states that together they won 3 gold medals, but our calculation shows they won only 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo verify this information, we focused on:\n- Row index 5 for Angola's \"gold\" column.\n- Row index 4 for Senegal's \"gold\" column.\n\nHere is the JSON response encapsulating the result of our verification process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
