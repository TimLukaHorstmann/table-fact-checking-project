However, upon reviewing the table, there is an entry for \"10 years of hits\" by Ronan Keating.\n2. **Artist**: The artist mentioned in both the claim and the data is Ronan Keating, which matches correctly.\n3. **Position**: The claim asserts that this album has a position of 1.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n- Identify the row where \"10 years of hits\" by Ronan Keating appears.\n- Check the position column for this entry to ensure it is indeed 1.\n\n### Verification from Table:\n1. **Row Identification**:\n   - The row with the album \"10 years of hits\" and artist \"Ronan Keating\" is found at row index 28 (starting from zero).\n   \n2. **Position Check**:\n   - In this row, under the column \"Rank\", the value is indeed 1.\n\nSince both conditions (correct album name adjusted for minor discrepancy in wording, correct artist, and position of 1) are satisfied, we can conclude that the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is true.
