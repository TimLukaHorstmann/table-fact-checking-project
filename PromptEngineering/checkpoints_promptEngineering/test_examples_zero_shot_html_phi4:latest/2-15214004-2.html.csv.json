    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"joe germanese be the 27th pick\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions based on the table:\n\n1. Check if there is a player named \"Joe Germanese\".\n2. Verify that this player was picked as the 27th pick.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The relevant columns for this verification are \"pick\" and \"player\".\n- We need to locate the row where the player is \"joe germanese\" (case insensitive) and check if the \"pick\" value in that row is 27.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n- In row with index 11 (counting starts from 0), we find:\n  - The \"player\" column contains \"joe germanese\".\n  - The \"pick\" column contains the number 27.\n  \nBoth conditions match, confirming that Joe Germanese was indeed the 27th pick.\n\nThus, the claim is true. Now, let's construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"jonathan leather be pick 25th\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we need to analyze and verify each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Player Name**: The claim mentions \"jonathan leather\". We should look for a row in the table with the player name containing either \"jonathan leather\" or similar variations.\n\n2. **Pick Number**: The claim specifies that this player was the 25th pick. Therefore, we need to verify if there is a row where the 'pick' value is 25 and matches the correct player name condition from step 1.\n\n3. **Checking the Table**:\n   - We will iterate over each row of the table and check for a row with \"jonathan leather\" in the 'player' column.\n   - Simultaneously, we need to ensure that the corresponding 'pick' value is 25.\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows:\n\n- The 25th pick (row index 10) corresponds to:\n  - `pick`: 25\n  - `mls team`: kansas city wizards\n  - `player`: jonathan leathers\n  - `position`: d\n  - `affiliation`: furman atlanta silverbacks u23 's\n\nThe player name is \"jonathan leathers\", which closely matches the claim's \"jonathan leather\" with a minor spelling variation. The pick number is indeed 25, matching the claim.\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\n- The claim is considered TRUE as it sufficiently describes the relevant row in the table despite a slight spelling difference.\n  \nHere is the JSON response reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The player named \"Joe Germanese\" should appear in a row where the \"pick\" column value is 24.\n2. There should not be another player associated with the \"pick\" number 24.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Find Joe Germanese's Row:**\n   - Search through the table for the player named \"Joe Germanese\".\n   - Identify the row index where this name appears and note the value in the \"pick\" column.\n\n2. **Check Pick Number 24:**\n   - Look for the row with the pick number 24.\n   - Note the player associated with this pick number.\n\n3. **Compare Results:**\n   - Verify if Joe Germanese is indeed listed as the player for pick number 24.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Locate Joe Germanese:**\n   - Joe Germanese appears in row index 26, and the \"pick\" value for this row is 27.\n   \n2. **Check Pick Number 24:**\n   - The player associated with pick number 24 is Andrew Jacobson from DC United.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Joe Germanese is not the player with pick number 24; instead, he has pick number 27.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n  - Row index 26, \"pick\" column (Joe Germanese's pick number).\n  - Row index 11, \"pick\" column (Player with pick number 24).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
