    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each against the table:\n\n1. **Industrial and Commercial Panel Greater Than 1**: We look for rows where the \"industrial and commercial panel\" value is greater than 1.\n\n2. **Nominated by the Taoiseach Less Than 11**: For those rows identified in step 1, we check if the \"nominated by the taoiseach\" value is less than 11.\n\n3. **Cultural and Educational Panel Smaller Than 0**: Finally, for rows that satisfy both conditions above, we verify if the \"cultural and educational panel\" value is smaller than 0.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- **Fianna F\u00e1il**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel: 3 (greater than 1)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach: 9 (less than 11)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel: 3 (not less than 0)\n\n- **Fine Gael**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel: 1 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Labour Party**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel: 0 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Clann na Talmhan**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel: 0 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Clann na Poblachta**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel: 0 (not greater than 1)\n\n- **Independent**:\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel: 3 (greater than 1)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach: 0 (less than 11)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel: 0 (less than 0)\n\nThe only row that satisfies all conditions is \"Independent\". Therefore, there exists at least one such row, making the claim false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- For \"Fianna F\u00e1il\": \n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel (row index 0)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach (row index 0)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel (row index 0)\n\n- For \"Independent\":\n  - Industrial and Commercial Panel (row index 5)\n  - Nominated by the Taoiseach (row index 5)\n  - Cultural and Educational Panel (row index 5)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
