    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"more than half of the members of the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860,\" we need to evaluate each institution's founding year from the table.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The relevant column for this claim is the \"founded\" column since it contains the founding years of the institutions listed in the Great Midwest Conference (as mentioned by their joining and leaving years).\n\n2. **Extract Founding Years**:\n   - University of Cincinnati: 1819\n   - University of Dayton: 1850\n   - Depaul University: 1898\n   - Marquette University: 1881\n   - University of Memphis: 1912\n   - Saint Louis University: 1818\n\n3. **Count Institutions Founded Before 1860**:\n   - University of Cincinnati (1819) is before 1860.\n   - University of Dayton (1850) is before 1860.\n   - Depaul University (1898) is after 1860.\n   - Marquette University (1881) is after 1860.\n   - University of Memphis (1912) is after 1860.\n   - Saint Louis University (1818) is before 1860.\n\n4. **Calculate Proportion**:\n   - Total institutions: 6\n   - Institutions founded before 1860: 3 (University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, and Saint Louis University)\n   - More than half would require at least 4 out of the 6 institutions to be founded before 1860.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Only 3 out of 6 institutions were founded before 1860, which is not more than half.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n- University of Cincinnati (Row 0, \"founded\")\n- University of Dayton (Row 1, \"founded\")\n- Depaul University (Row 2, \"founded\")\n- Marquette University (Row 3, \"founded\")\n- University of Memphis (Row 4, \"founded\")\n- Saint Louis University (Row 5, \"founded\")\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
