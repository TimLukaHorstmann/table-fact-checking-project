    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two parts of the statement: \n\n1. **\"There be 8 games at the Boston Garden.\"**\n\n   We'll check each row in the table for entries where \"location / attendance\" equals \"boston garden.\"\n\n2. **\"All before December 17.\"**\n\n   For those games identified as being played at the Boston Garden, we will verify that their dates are all on or before December 17.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows from the table:\n\n- Row 0: \n  - Date: December 3\n  - Location / Attendance: boston garden\n\n- Row 4:\n  - Date: December 8\n  - Location / Attendance: boston garden\n\n- Row 5:\n  - Date: December 11\n  - Location / Attendance: boston garden\n\n- Row 6:\n  - Date: December 15\n  - Location / Attendance: boston garden\n  \n- Row 7:\n  - Date: December 17\n  - Location / Attendance: Not Boston Garden\n\n- Row 8:\n  - Date: December 22\n  - Location / Attendance: boston garden\n\nAt this point, we've already identified four games at the Boston Garden occurring on or before December 17. Let's continue:\n\n- Row 9:\n  - Date: December 25\n  - Location / Attendance: Not Boston Garden\n  \n- Row 10:\n  - Date: December 26\n  - Location / Attendance: Not Boston Garden\n\n- Row 11:\n  - Date: December 28\n  - Location / Attendance: Not Boston Garden\n\n- Row 12:\n  - Date: December 29\n  - Location / Attendance: Not Boston Garden\n  \n- Row 13:\n  - Date: December 30\n  - Location / Attendance: Not Boston Garden\n\nOnly four games at the Boston Garden occur on or before December 17, and another two after that date. Therefore, we do not have eight games meeting both criteria.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because there are only four games at the Boston Garden before December 17, not eight. \n\nHere's the relevant JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
