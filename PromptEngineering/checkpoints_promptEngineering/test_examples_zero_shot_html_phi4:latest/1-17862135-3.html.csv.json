    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Warren Kym perform 16 dance\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table, we need to verify two key aspects of the claim using the relevant columns in the table:\n\n1. **Couples' Names:** The claim refers to \"warren kym.\" From the table, there is a couple named \"Warren & Kym,\" which matches the claim.\n\n2. **Number of Dances Performed:** We need to check whether this couple performed 16 dances. This information can be found in the \"number of dances\" column.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant row and columns:\n\n- From the table, we see that \"Warren & Kym\" are listed at row index 1.\n- In the same row (row index 1), the value in the \"number of dances\" column is 16.\n\nSince both conditions from the claim match with the data in the table, the claim is fully supported and therefore true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim include:\n- The cell containing the couple's name at row index 1, \"place\" column.\n- The cell indicating the number of dances performed by the couple at row index 1, \"number of dances\" column.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim using the provided HTML table, we need to examine and verify each condition stated in the claim against the data.\n\nThe claim is: \"rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance, for an average of 17.8\"\n\nBreaking down this claim into specific conditions:\n1. The couple's name should be \"rocco & karina\".\n2. They should have scored a total of 89 points.\n3. They should have participated in 5 dances.\n4. Their average score per dance should be 17.8.\n\nNow, let's find these details within the HTML table:\n\n- **Couple Name**: The table has an entry for \"rocco & karina\" at row index 10 (since indexing typically starts from zero in programming).\n  \n- **Total Points**: In row index 10, under the column \"total points\", it shows a value of 89.\n\n- **Number of Dances**: Also in row index 10, under the column \"number of dances\", it displays a value of 5.\n\n- **Average Score**: Lastly, for row index 10, in the column labeled \"average\", the value is 17.8.\n\nAll conditions mentioned in the claim align perfectly with the data found in the table at row index 10. Therefore, each part of the claim is verified as true based on this data.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table used to verify the claim:\n\n- Row index: 10\n- Column names: \"couple\", \"total points\", \"number of dances\", \"average\"\n\nThe JSON response reflecting these findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

They are positioned at row index 1 (since HTML tables typically start with a header as row 0).\n- Check the value under the **Number of Dances** column for \"Warren & Kym\". The data shows they have participated in 16 dances.\n\n### Evaluating the Claim:\nThe claim states that Warren & Kym have done more than 20 dances together.
