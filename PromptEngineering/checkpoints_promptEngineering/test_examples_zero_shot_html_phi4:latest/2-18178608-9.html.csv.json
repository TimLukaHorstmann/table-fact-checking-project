The lowest is 3.\n- Scotland's score is 6.\n\nSince the claim specifies \"against england\" for Ireland, but no such match is listed, we cannot verify this part of the claim with the given data. However, based on the available scores:\n- Ireland has a score of 3 (lowest among their matches).\n- Scotland has a score of 6 (only match listed).\n\nThus, if we assume \"against england\" refers to the lowest score by Ireland in general, then Ireland's score of 3 is indeed the least, and Scotland's score of 6 is the second least.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data and assuming the claim refers to general scoring without specific matches:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Additionally, they do not mention England as an opposing team.\n\n### Determining the Validity:\n\nThe table indicates that:\n- England played against Scotland on 05/03/1988.\n- England played against Ireland on 19/03/1988.\n\nBoth matches occurred in March 1988, supporting the claim.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"England compete against both Scotland and Ireland 2 times in 1988,\" we need to examine each row of the table for matches involving England with either Scotland or Ireland. Specifically, we need to:\n\n1. Identify rows where \"against\" column indicates a match between England and another team.\n2. Count how many such matches involve Scotland and Ireland separately.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant part of the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: Opposing team is France, not related to the claim.\n- **Row 1**: Opposing team is Wales, not related to the claim.\n- **Row 2**: Opposing team is Scotland. This row suggests a match between England and Scotland on \"05 / 03 / 1988\".\n- **Row 3**: Opposing team is Ireland. This row indicates a match between England and Ireland on \"19 / 03 / 1988\".\n- **Row 4**: Opposing team is Ireland again, but the status is \"millennium trophy match\", indicating it's not part of the Five Nations matches.\n- **Rows 5 to 9**: These rows involve Australia, Fiji, or other statuses unrelated to England.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- England played against Scotland once (Row 2).\n- England played against Ireland once within the context of the Five Nations tournament (Row 3).\n\nSince neither Scotland nor Ireland were faced by England two times in 1988 based on the table provided, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- Row 2: Columns \"opposing teams\" and \"against\".\n- Row 3: Columns \"opposing teams\" and \"against\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opposing teams\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
