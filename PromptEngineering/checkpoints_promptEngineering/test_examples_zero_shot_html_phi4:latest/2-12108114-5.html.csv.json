We will interpret the task as verifying their match results on these dates to see if they won, drew, or lost.\n\n**Table Analysis:**\n\nWe need to extract information related to Chelsea FC's performance specifically on May 7, 2005, and May 10, 2005:\n\n1. **May 7, 2005:**\n   - Opponent: Charlton Athletic\n   - Result: 1-0 (Chelsea won)\n\n2. **May 10, 2005:**\n   - Opponent: Manchester United\n   - Result: 3-1 (Chelsea won)\n\n**Verification of Claim:**\n\nThe claim implies an assessment of Chelsea's form during this period. Based on the match results:\n- On May 7, 2005, Chelsea defeated Charlton Athletic.\n- On May 10, 2005, Chelsea defeated Manchester United.\n\nBoth matches resulted in victories for Chelsea FC, indicating they were indeed \"in form\" or performing well over these two dates.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as Chelsea won both games during this period.
