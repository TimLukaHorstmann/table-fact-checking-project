    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to examine the specific details in the table regarding Oleksandr Vorobiov's total score.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - The claim pertains to the \"total\" score of Oleksandr Vorobiov.\n   - We should locate Oleksandr Vorobiov within the table and check his corresponding \"total\" score.\n\n2. **Locate in Table**:\n   - The gymnast named \"oleksandr vorobiov ( ukr )\" is listed at position 3.\n\n3. **Verify Total Score**:\n   - In row 3, under the column labeled \"total\", the recorded value is \"16.250\".\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Oleksandr Vorobiov has a total score of \"16.25\".\n   - This matches the table's entry (considering \"16.250\" and \"16.25\" are equivalent, as trailing zeros in decimal numbers do not change their value).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells to verify the claim include row 3 under the columns for the gymnast's name and total score.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of Relevant Cells:\n- `{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gymnast\"}`: This checks the name to ensure we are referencing Oleksandr Vorobiov.\n- `{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}`: This verifies his total score as given in the claim.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table, we need to carefully evaluate each condition outlined in the claim:\n\n1. **Condition 1**: \"a score\" must be equal to 6.800.\n2. **Condition 2**: \"b score\" must be more than 9.225.\n3. **Condition 3**: \"total\" must be less than 15.975.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table and check if there is any row where all three conditions are satisfied:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - a score = 7.3\n  - b score = 9.225\n  - total = 16.525\n  - Conditions not met.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - a score = 7.3\n  - b score = 8.975\n  - total = 16.275\n  - Conditions not met.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - a score = 7.2\n  - b score = 9.050\n  - total = 16.250\n  - Conditions not met.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - a score = 7.3\n  - b score = 8.925\n  - total = 16.225\n  - Conditions not met.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - a score = 7.1\n  - b score = 8.925\n  - total = 16.025\n  - Conditions not met.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - a score = 6.8\n  - b score = 9.175\n  - total = 15.975\n  - The \"a score\" is correct, but the \"b score\" must be more than 9.225 (not just equal), and the \"total\" must be less than 15.975 (here it's exactly 15.975). Thus, conditions are not fully met.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - a score = 7.2\n  - b score = 8.600\n  - total = 15.800\n  - Conditions not met.\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - a score = 7.0\n  - b score = 8.750\n  - total = 15.750\n  - Conditions not met.\n\nNone of the rows satisfy all three conditions simultaneously: having \"a score\" as 6.800, \"b score\" more than 9.225, and \"total\" less than 15.975.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**. The only row that comes close (row 6) fails because the \"b score\" isn't greater than 9.225 and the \"total\" isn't strictly less than 15.975.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are from row 6:\n\n- a score: Row 6, Column 'a score'\n- b score: Row 6, Column 'b score'\n- total: Row 6, Column 'total'\n\nHere is the JSON object with our conclusion and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"a score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"b score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
