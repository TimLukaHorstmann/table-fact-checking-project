First, let's identify all rows that are within the relevant year range (1997 to 2012):\n   - The years given in the table for this range are: 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\n2. Next, let's extract the 'mens singles' winners for each of these years:\n   - **1997:** jan-o ve waldner\n   - **2000:** wang liqin\n   - **2001:** chiang peng-lung\n   - **2002:** kalinikos kreanga\n   - **2003:** timo boll\n   - **2004:** chen qi\n   - **2005:** timo boll\n   - **2006:** wang liqin\n   - **2009:** oh sang-eun\n   - **2010:** timo boll\n   - **2011:** seiya kishikawa\n   - **2012:** jun mizutani\n\n3. Now, let's count the number of times \"Timo Boll\" appears in these results:\n   - Timo Boll won in 2003, 2005, and 2010.\n\n4. Therefore, according to the data provided, Timo Boll has indeed won the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles three times between 1997 and 2012.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nFinally, let's compile the relevant cells from the table:\n- **2003:** Timo Boll (row index: 11)\n- **2005:** Timo Boll (row index: 14)\n- **2010:** Timo Boll (row index: 9)\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, we will focus on these specific years in the table.\n   \n2. **Examine each row within this range**:\n   - For each year between 2004 and 2009, check if \"Kobe\" is listed as the location.\n\n3. **List of relevant rows (years from 2004 to 2009)**:\n   - 2004: Kobe\n   - 2003: Kobe\n   - 2002: Kobe\n   - 2001: Yokohama\n   - 2000: Kobe\n   - 1999: Kobe\n\n4. **Count the occurrences of \"Kobe\"**:\n   - From the list above, \"Kobe\" appears as a location in 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Within the specified range (2004 to 2009), Kobe is listed as the host for four events: 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2000.\n   - In contrast, Wakayama appears once in this range (in 2009).\n\nTherefore, \"Kobe\" does host the most ITTF Pro Tour events between 2004 and 2009.\n\n6. **Relevant cells**:\n   - We will include rows that mention \"Kobe\" as a location within the specified time frame.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if there were two ITTF Pro Tour events hosted in Yokohama between 1997 and 2012 based on the table provided.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify the Time Frame**: The time frame specified is from 1997 to 2012.\n   \n2. **Locate Relevant Entries**: We need to find entries in the table where the \"year location\" includes Yokohama within this timeframe.\n\n3. **Count the Events**: Check how many such events occurred and ensure there are exactly two as claimed.\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n\n- **1997 Chiba**: This does not meet the criteria as it is neither in Yokohama nor between 2000 and 2012.\n  \n- **1998 Wakayama**: This also does not meet the criteria.\n\n- **2000 Kobe**: Not Yokohama.\n\n- **2001 Yokohama**: Meets both location (Yokohama) and time frame (between 1997 and 2012).\n\n- **2005 Yokohama**: Also meets both location and time frame.\n\n- **2006 Yokohama**: Again, meets both criteria.\n\nFrom the analysis, we identify three events in Yokohama within the specified timeframe: 2001, 2005, and 2006. The claim mentions two events, but there are actually three according to the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because there were three ITTF Pro Tour events hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012, not two as stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"year location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
