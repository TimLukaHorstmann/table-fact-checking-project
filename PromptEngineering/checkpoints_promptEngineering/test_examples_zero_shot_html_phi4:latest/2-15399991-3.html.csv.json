    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the houston texans lose all the game play in october\" is true, we need to examine each relevant row for games played in October and verify their outcomes.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Games in October**:\n   - Look at the \"date\" column to find entries corresponding to October 2003.\n   \n2. **Verify Outcomes of Each Game in October**:\n   - Check the \"result\" column for these rows to see if they indicate a loss (\"L\").\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Row Index 9**: Date is November 9, 2003 \u2014 not relevant as it's not in October.\n- **Row Index 8 (October 21, 2003)**: \n  - Result is \"l 27 - 34\" which indicates a loss for the Houston Texans.\n\n- **Row Index 7 (October 14, 2003)**:\n  - Result is \"w 12 - 10\", indicating a win, not a loss. Therefore, this row disproves the claim since there is at least one game won in October.\n  \n- **Row Index 6 (October 7, 2003)**: \n  - There's no entry for this date in October; hence irrelevant to the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that all games played by the Houston Texans in October were losses.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim that \"the Houston Texans scored more points on November 16, 2003 than on September 28, 2003,\" we need to examine specific data in the table related to scores for both dates.\n\nFirstly, identify the relevant rows in the table:\n- **November 16, 2003** is found at **row index 10**, under the \"Result\" column which contains the score.\n- **September 28, 2003** is located at **row index 7**, again under the \"Result\" column.\n\nNow, we need to extract and compare the scores:\n1. For November 16, 2003 (row index 10), the result is **\"12 - 10\"**, meaning Houston Texans scored **12 points**.\n2. For September 28, 2003 (row index 7), the result is **\"0 - 27\"**, indicating that Houston Texans scored **0 points**.\n\nUpon comparison:\n- On November 16, 2003, the score was 12 points.\n- On September 28, 2003, the score was 0 points.\n\nThe claim states that the Texans scored more on November 16 than on September 28. Since 12 (points scored on Nov 16) is greater than 0 (points scored on Sept 28), the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
