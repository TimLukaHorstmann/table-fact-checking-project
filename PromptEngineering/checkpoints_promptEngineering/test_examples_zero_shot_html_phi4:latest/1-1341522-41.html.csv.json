    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"pennsylvania17 be the only district that have someone first elect in the 1980s,\" we need to focus on the \"first elected\" column for each row of data provided in the table.\n\nHere is a breakdown of our verification process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** We are interested in the \"first elected\" column because it contains information about when incumbents were first elected, which allows us to determine if they were elected in the 1980s.\n\n2. **Check Each Row:**\n   - Row 0 (pennsylvania4): \"1992\"\n   - Row 1 (pennsylvania5): \"1978\"\n   - Row 2 (pennsylvania7): \"1986\"\n   - Row 3 (pennsylvania9): \"1972\"\n   - Row 4 (pennsylvania12): \"1974\"\n   - **Row 5 (pennsylvania17): \"1982\"**\n   - Row 6 (pennsylvania18): \"1990\"\n   - Row 7 (pennsylvania19): \"1974\"\n\n3. **Identify Rows with Incumbents First Elected in the 1980s:**\n   - From our check, we find:\n     - Row 2: \"1986\" (curt weldon)\n     - Row 5: \"1982\" (george gekas)\n\nThus, there are two districts where incumbents were first elected in the 1980s: pennsylvania7 and pennsylvania17.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim states that \"pennsylvania17 be the only district,\" which is not true because pennsylvania7 also has an incumbent who was first elected in the 1980s (in fact, both rows 2 and 5 meet this criterion). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are those from row indices 2 and 5 of the \"first elected\" column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
