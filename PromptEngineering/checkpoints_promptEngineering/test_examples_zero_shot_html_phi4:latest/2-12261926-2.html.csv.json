    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"after the fourteenth stage, Fabrizio Guidi was 2nd in the point classification,\" we need to examine the relevant portions of the table for stages up to and including the fourteenth stage, focusing on the column associated with the point classification.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The fourth column in each row appears to represent the individual who is currently leading or has some significance in terms of the point classification (since Fabrizio Guidi is mentioned as being 2nd).\n\n2. **Examine Rows from 0 to 14:**\n   - Check each stage's entry up to and including the fourteenth stage.\n   - Specifically, look at who appears in the fourth column of these rows.\n\n3. **Determine Position After Fourteenth Stage:**\n   - The row labeled \"final\" represents the conclusion after all stages have been completed. This row shows Fabrizio Guidi as \"2,\" indicating he was second in point classification overall.\n   - We need to check if this status is reflected after the fourteenth stage.\n\n4. **Relevant Observations:**\n   - From rows 0 to 14, Fabrizio Guidi consistently appears in the fourth column starting from row 13 (fourteenth stage). This implies he was already second by the end of that stage.\n   - No other individual is mentioned as being first during these stages, which supports his position as second.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is supported because Fabrizio Guidi is listed in the fourth column starting from the fourteenth stage and confirmed as 2nd in the final row.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant cells are those from rows 0 to 14 (inclusive) in the fourth column where Fabrizio Guidi appears or where the point classification is mentioned.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": \"final\", \"column_name\": \"2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thus, the condition in the claim cannot be fulfilled because it requires a second occurrence that does not exist in the data provided.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim cannot be true due to insufficient instances of Pascal Herv\u00e9 winning multiple stages.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The answer is \"FALSE.\"\n- Relevant rows for verification are:\n  - Row 2 (first instance of Pascal Herv\u00e9)\n  - Rows 1, 6, and 18 (instances where Mario Cipollini wins)\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Stage Winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Stage Winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Stage Winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Stage Winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
