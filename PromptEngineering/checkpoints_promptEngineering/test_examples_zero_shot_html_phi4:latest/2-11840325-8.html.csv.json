    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the Oakland Raiders' game against the Kansas City Chiefs in 2012 at Arrowhead Stadium, we need to verify each condition stated in the claim using the provided table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Year**: The event occurred in \"2012\".\n2. **Teams Involved**:\n   - Winner: \"oakland raiders\"\n   - Loser: \"kansas city chiefs\"\n3. **Location**: \"arrowhead stadium\"\n4. **Result**: \"15 - 0\" with the Raiders losing.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Year Verification**:\n   - Check for rows in the table where the `year` is \"2012\".\n\n2. **Teams and Result Verification**:\n   - For each row identified as occurring in 2012, check if:\n     - The `winner` is \"oakland raiders\".\n     - The `loser` is \"kansas city chiefs\".\n     - The `result` matches \"15 - 0\".\n\n3. **Location Verification**:\n   - Ensure that the game with the specified conditions (Raiders losing to Chiefs with a score of 15-0) took place at \"arrowhead stadium\".\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Year: 2012\n  - Winner: oakland raiders\n  - Result: 26 - 16\n  - Loser: kansas city chiefs\n  - Location: arrowhead stadium\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Year: 2012\n  - Winner: oakland raiders\n  - Result: 15 - 0\n  - Loser: kansas city chiefs\n  - Location: oco coliseum\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the Oakland Raiders lost to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0 in 2012. However, based on the table:\n- The game where the Raiders won against the Chiefs with a score of 15-0 occurred at OCO Coliseum (Row 6), not Arrowhead Stadium.\n- There is no instance in the table where the Raiders lost to the Chiefs with that score at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**. The relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- Row 5: `year`, `winner`, `result`, `loser`, and `location` (for checking the game details).\n- Row 6: `year`, `winner`, `result`, `loser`, and `location` (to confirm the Raiders did not lose at Arrowhead Stadium).\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
