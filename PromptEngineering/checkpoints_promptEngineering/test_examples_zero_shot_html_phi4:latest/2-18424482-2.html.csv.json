The column \"original release\" indicates the release year of each song.\n\nHere are the release years for all songs:\n\n1. Why Baby Why - 1955\n2. The Pain of Loving You - 1971\n3. He Thinks I Still Care - 1962\n4. Sleepless Nights (Featuring Vince Gill) - 1960\n5. Crazy Arms - 1956\n6. There Stands the Glass - 1953\n7. That's All It Took (Featuring Jedd Hughes) - 1966\n8. Color of the Blues - 1958\n9. I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know - 1953\n10. Next in Line - 1968\n11. Don't Let Me Cross Over - 1962\n12. Please Help Me I'm Falling - 1960\n13. There Goes My Everything - 1966\n14. Cold, Cold Heart - 1951\n15. We'll Sweep Out the Ashes in the Morning - 1969\n16. If Teardrops Were Pennies - 1951\n\nNow, identify the most recent year among these:\n\n- The latest release year is 1971 for \"The Pain of Loving You.\"\n- Both \"Cold, Cold Heart\" and \"If Teardrops Were Pennies\" have a release year of 1951.\n\nSince 1951 is not the most recent year, the claim that these two songs have the most recent release year is FALSE. \n\nRelevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n- The cell containing \"The Pain of Loving You\" with its release year (1971) as it has the most recent release year.\n- Cells for \"Cold, Cold Heart\" and \"If Teardrops Were Pennies\" to confirm their release years are 1951.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original release\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"original release\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"original release\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
