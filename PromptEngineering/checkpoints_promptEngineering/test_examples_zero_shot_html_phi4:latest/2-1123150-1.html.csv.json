    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"only 4 drivers were unable to complete 0 lap,\" we need to examine the table for entries where the number of laps completed is `0`. Specifically, this involves checking each row in the \"laps\" column for a value of `0` and identifying those rows.\n\nHere's how we verify the claim step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with 0 Laps**: We scan through the \"laps\" column to find entries that indicate drivers completed `0` laps.\n2. **Count Such Entries**: Count how many drivers have `0` in their \"laps\" column.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n- Michele Alboreto, Pierluigi Martini, and Olivier Grouillard all finished with `0` laps (rows 16, 18, and 19 respectively).\n- No other driver has `0` laps. Therefore, only three drivers were unable to complete any lap.\n\nSince the claim states \"only 4 drivers,\" but we found only 3 drivers who completed `0` laps, the statement is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n- Row 16, Column: \"laps\" (Michele Alboreto)\n- Row 18, Column: \"laps\" (Pierluigi Martini)\n- Row 19, Column: \"laps\" (Olivier Grouillard)\n\nHere is the JSON output reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
