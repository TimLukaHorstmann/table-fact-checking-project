    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"knight in retreat be the title with the lowest no in series\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant cells in the table concerning the \"no in series\" column and identify which entry corresponds to the title \"knight in retreat.\"\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the row for the title \"knight in retreat\":**\n   - From the table, locate the row where the title is \"knight in retreat.\" This occurs at `row_index 65`.\n\n2. **Determine the value of \"no in series\" for this entry:**\n   - In `row_index 65`, under the column \"no in series,\" the value is `66`.\n\n3. **Compare with other entries' \"no in series\":**\n   - We need to compare this value against all other entries in the \"no in series\" column to determine if it is indeed the lowest.\n   - The \"no in series\" values range from 67 down to 59 (based on the table provided):\n     - Check each entry's \"no in series\":\n       - Entries have no in series ranging from 59 up to 67.\n\n4. **Determine the lowest value:**\n   - From the entries listed, the lowest value in the \"no in series\" column is `59`, corresponding to the title \"knight by a nose.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"knight in retreat\" has a \"no in series\" of 66 and not the lowest (which is 59), the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells for verification:**\n   - The cells in question are all entries under the \"no in series\" column to compare values.\n   - Additionally, specifically the cell corresponding to \"knight in retreat\" needs to be checked, which is at `row_index 65`.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying this claim include:\n\n- All rows with their respective \"no in series\" values (for comparison).\n- Specifically, the row containing \"knight in retreat\" and its \"no in series\" value.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 58, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 59, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 61, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Only the relevant entries necessary for comparison were included in `relevant_cells` to keep it concise.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The episode titled \"The Rotten Apples\" should be directed by Bob Bralver.\n2. It should have the latest original air date among episodes directed by Bob Bralver.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step using the relevant columns and rows:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Episodes Directed by Bob Bralver\n- Look for entries in the \"Directed By\" column where the director is listed as \"Bob Bralver.\"\n\n#### Relevant Rows:\n- Row Index 14: \n  - Title: \"The Rotten Apples\"\n  - Directed By: \"Bob Bralver\"\n  - Original Air Date: March 24, 1985\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Latest Air Date\n- Among all episodes directed by Bob Bralver, check if \"The Rotten Apples\" has the latest original air date.\n\n#### Comparison:\n- From Row Index 14 (The Rotten Apples), the air date is March 24, 1985.\n- There are no other entries for Bob Bralver in the table. Hence, by default, this must be the latest since it's the only one listed.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied:\n1. \"The Rotten Apples\" is directed by Bob Bralver (satisfied from Row Index 14).\n2. Since it's the only episode directed by him, its air date of March 24, 1985, is the latest (satisfied).\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Original Air Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
