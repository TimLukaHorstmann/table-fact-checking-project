Identify the row corresponding to the year 2009.\n   - From the HTML table, we can see that each row represents data for one racing season. The relevant column here is \"season.\"\n   - The row where `season` equals \"2009\" will give us the necessary information.\n\n2. Check the class of motorcycles in that specific year (2009).\n   - The relevant column for this check is \"class.\" We need to see if this value is \"moto2.\"\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- The row corresponding to the season 2009 is the ninth row (keeping in mind that indexing typically starts from zero).\n- In the ninth row, the \"class\" value is \"125cc,\" not \"moto2.\"\n\nSince the class for the year 2009 is \"125cc,\" and not \"moto2,\" the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The cell containing the season \"2009.\"\n- The cell containing the class information for that row, which shows \"125cc.\"\n\nPutting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This will allow us to determine whether all entries have a value greater than 10.\n\nLet's review each relevant cell:\n\n1. **Row Index 0 (2002):** The value under \"races\" is 1, which is not more than 10.\n2. **Row Index 1 (2003):** The value under \"races\" is 14, which is greater than 10.\n3. **Row Index 2 (2004):** The value under \"races\" is 16, which is greater than 10.\n4. **Row Index 3 (2005):** The value under \"races\" is 16, which is greater than 10.\n5. **Row Index 4 (2006):** The value under \"races\" is 14, which is greater than 10.\n6. **Row Index 5 (2007):** The value under \"races\" is 17, which is greater than 10.\n7. **Row Index 6 (2008):** The value under \"races\" is 17, which is greater than 10.\n8. **Row Index 7 (2009):** The value under \"races\" is 16, which is greater than 10.\n9. **Row Index 8 (2010):** The value under \"races\" is 17, which is greater than 10.\n10. **Row Index 9 (2011):** The value under \"races\" is 17, which is greater than 10.\n11. **Row Index 10 (2012):** The value under \"races\" is 17, which is greater than 10.\n12. **Row Index 11 (2013):** The value under \"races\" is 16, which is greater than 10.\n\nThe claim requires all entries to have more than 10 races, but Row Index 0 has only 1 race, violating the condition.
