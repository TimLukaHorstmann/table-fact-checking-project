For game number 10, it shows: \"lebron james , mo williams (21)\".\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that LeBron James and Mo Williams together have 21 high points on November 14.\n   - According to the table, in game 10 (\"November 14\"), the entry for \"high points\" is indeed \"lebron james , mo williams (21)\", which matches the claim exactly.\n\nBased on this verification:\n\n- The claim is supported by the data in the relevant row and column of the table.\n- Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\".\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this check are those containing the date (to verify the correct game) and high points information for that specific game.\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need to find the row that corresponds to November 14 and check the \"high points\" column to determine if LeBron James scored more than 34 points alone on that date.\n\n1. **Identify the Row:**\n   - The table lists each game with its corresponding date in chronological order.\n   - Locate the row where the date is November 14. According to the table, this corresponds to the game number 10.\n\n2. **Check \"High Points\":**\n   - In the identified row (game 10), examine the \"high points\" column:\n     ```\n     <td>lebron james , mo williams (21)</td>\n     ```\n   - This indicates that both LeBron James and Mo Williams scored, with each contributing 21 points.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Points:**\n   - The claim states that LeBron James alone had more than 34 points.\n   - However, in game 10, LeBron James scored only 21 points, which is less than 34.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The condition of LeBron James scoring more than 34 points on November 14 is not met.
