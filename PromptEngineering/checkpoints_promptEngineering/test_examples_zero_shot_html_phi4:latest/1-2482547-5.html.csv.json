The claim states: \"john hearne have the lowest average of any player, with an average of 15.40.\" \n\n1. **Identify John Hearne's Average**: \n   - Locate John Hearne in the table and note his bowling average.\n   - From the first row (index 0), we find that John Hearne has an average of 16.47.\n\n2. **Compare with Other Players' Averages**:\n   - Look at the averages for all players listed in the table to see if any player has a lower average than John Hearne's 16.47.\n   - Tom Richardson (index 1) has an average of 15.40, which is indeed lower than John Hearne's.\n   - Johnny Briggs (index 2) has an average of 15.89.\n   - Arthur Mold (index 3) has an average of 16.96.\n   - Bill Lockwood (index 4) has an average of 16.78.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Tom Richardson's average of 15.40 is lower than John Hearne\u2019s 16.47, thus contradicting the claim that John Hearne has the lowest average.\n   - Therefore, the statement \"john hearne have the lowest average of any player, with an average of 15.40\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing the averages for all players:\n\n- Row index 0, column \"average\" for John Hearne's average (16.47).\n- Row index 1, column \"average\" for Tom Richardson's average (15.40), which is lower than John Hearne\u2019s.\n- Additional relevant cells to ensure completeness are the averages of other players:\n  - Row index 2, column \"average\"\n  - Row index 3, column \"average\"\n  - Row index 4, column \"average\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"tom richardson have the highest number of wicket take of any player,\" we need to examine the column related to \"wickets taken\" across all rows in the table.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for checking the number of wickets taken is labeled as \"wickets taken.\"\n\n2. **Extract Data from Table:**\n   - For each player, we will extract the value under the \"wickets taken\" column:\n     - John Hearne: 212 wickets\n     - Tom Richardson: 174 wickets\n     - Johnny Briggs: 166 wickets\n     - Arthur Mold: 166 wickets\n     - Bill Lockwood: 150 wickets\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Value:**\n   - We compare all values in the \"wickets taken\" column to find the highest number of wickets.\n   - The highest value is 212 wickets, which belongs to John Hearne.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Tom Richardson has taken 174 wickets, which is not the highest value (John Hearne has more).\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"tom richardson have the highest number of wicket take of any player\" is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to identify cells containing information on wickets taken for all players:\n     - Row index 0 (John Hearne): 212 wickets\n     - Row index 1 (Tom Richardson): 174 wickets\n     - Row index 2 (Johnny Briggs): 166 wickets\n     - Row index 3 (Arthur Mold): 166 wickets\n     - Row index 4 (Bill Lockwood): 150 wickets\n\nBased on the analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wickets taken\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
