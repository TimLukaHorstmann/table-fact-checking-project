    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Stage 1 be the only stage where a mountain classification wasn't awarded,\" we need to check each row in the table for evidence related to this statement. The relevant column here is likely about the awards or classifications given on each stage, which isn't explicitly named but can be inferred from the context of who received recognition or awards on each stage.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Column names: It looks like these columns represent various stages and their respective outcomes.\n  - \"not awarded\" is mentioned in this row, which suggests no mountain classification was awarded in Stage 1. This directly supports part of the claim regarding stage 1.\n\n- Subsequent rows (2 to 21) should be checked for any mention of a mountain classification being awarded or not. We look for any indication that other stages did not have a mountain classification award if present, as this would invalidate the claim if found.\n\nUpon reviewing each row:\n\n- **Rows 2 to 21**: \n  - There are no explicit mentions of \"not awarded\" for mountain classifications in these rows.\n  - Each stage appears to have outcomes listed without any indication that the mountain classification was omitted.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude:\n\n1. Stage 1 is indeed identified as having no mountain classification award (\"not awarded\").\n2. No other stages are explicitly indicated as lacking a mountain classification award.\n\nThus, the claim \"Stage 1 be the only stage where a mountain classification wasn't awarded\" holds true based on the table provided.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row 0: The mention of \"not awarded\" in this row is crucial to verify that Stage 1 did not have a mountain classification.\n- Rows 2 to 21 do not contain any indication of other stages lacking a mountain classification, supporting the exclusivity part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Stage 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Stage 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Stage 3\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Stage 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Stage 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Stage 6\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Stage 7\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Stage 8\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Stage 9\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Stage 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Stage 11\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Stage 12\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Stage 13\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Stage 14\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Stage 15\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Stage 16\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Stage 17\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Stage 18\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Stage 19\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Stage 20\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Stage 21\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
