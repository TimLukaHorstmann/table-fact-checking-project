    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to check the relevant entries in the provided table for both \"paddock\" and \"red squirrel.\" The claim states:\n\n- Paddock's last appearance is in \"blood is thicker than water.\"\n- Red squirrel's last appearance is in \"a hero's welcome.\"\n\nWe will examine each part of the claim by identifying the row associated with each character and checking their first and last appearances.\n\n### Step 1: Verify Paddock's Appearances\n\n- **Row for Paddock**: Row index 6\n  - Character: Paddock\n  - Species: Badger\n  - First appearance: Not applicable (column is \"n/a\")\n  - Last appearance: Blood is thicker than water\n\nFrom the table, Paddock\u2019s last appearance is indeed in \"blood is thicker than water.\" Therefore, this part of the claim holds true.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Red Squirrel's Appearances\n\n- **Row for White Deer Park Squirrels (Red squirrels)**: Row index 19\n  - Character: The white deer park squirrels\n  - Species: Squirrel (abbreviated as \"s squirrel\")\n  - First appearance: The missing fox's friend\n  - Last appearance: Scared by silly snake's\n\nThe claim states that red squirrel\u2019s last appearance is in \"a hero's welcome.\" However, the table shows their last appearance is in \"scared by silly snake's,\" not \"a hero's welcome.\" Thus, this part of the claim does not hold true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince one part of the claim regarding Paddock is correct and another part concerning red squirrel is incorrect, the entire claim cannot be fully supported. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, we will specify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- For Paddock: Row index 6, columns \"Character,\" \"Species,\" and \"Last appearance.\"\n- For Red Squirrel (White Deer Park Squirrels): Row index 19, columns \"Character,\" \"Species,\" \"First appearance,\" and \"Last appearance.\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Character\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Species\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Last appearance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Character\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Species\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"First appearance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Last appearance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the male bounder book be no\", we need to interpret this as checking for entries in the table where:\n\n1. The \"Name\" includes or refers to \"Bounder\".\n2. The \"Gender\" is \"male\".\n3. Whether \"Appearances in Series 1, 2 & 3\" is marked \"no\".\n\nLet's go through each relevant column and their contents:\n- **Name**: We need to find if there\u2019s any character named \"Bounder\". None of the entries have \"Bounder\" as part of their name.\n- **Gender**: If \"Bounder\" were present, we would check for a \"male\".\n- **Appearances in Series 1, 2 & 3**: For those found with \"Bounder\", verify if it says \"no\".\n\nSince there is no entry with \"Bounder\" as part of the name in any row, this claim is trivially supported because there's no instance to contradict it. There are no relevant cells to check as per these criteria since \"Bounder\" doesn't appear at all.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should indicate that the statement is true due to lack of contradiction:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
