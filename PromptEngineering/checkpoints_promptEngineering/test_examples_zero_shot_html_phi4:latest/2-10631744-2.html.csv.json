According to the data:\n\n- Walter Meanwell's first tenure from 1898 - 1904 holds the highest overall win percentage at 91%.\n- Stu Jackson has an overall win percentage of 56%, which is not the highest.\n\nSince Walter Meanwell's 91% exceeds Stu Jackson's 56%, the claim that \"Stu Jackson does not have the highest overall win percentage\" is true.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- Walter Meanwell (1898 - 1904): row index 3, column name \"overall win percentage\"\n- Stu Jackson: row index 11, column name \"overall win percentage\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"Stu Jackson has the second highest overall win percentage,\" we need to identify the relevant data in the table concerning overall win percentages for each coach and compare them.\n\n1. **Identify Overall Win Percentages:**\n   - From the table, locate the column labeled \"overall win percentage\" since this is what we are comparing.\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - The table lists several coaches along with their respective overall win percentages:\n     - James C Elsom: 64%\n     - Emmett Angell: 74%\n     - Haskell Noyes: 63%\n     - Walter Meanwell (first tenure): 91%\n     - Guy Lowman: 64%\n     - Walter Meanwell (second tenure): 63%\n     - Bud Foster: 49%\n     - John E Erickson: 46%\n     - John Powless: 44%\n     - Bill Cofield: 38%\n     - Steve Yoder: 43%\n     - Stu Jackson: 56%\n     - Stan Van Gundy: 48%\n     - Dick Bennett: 57%\n     - Brad Soderberg: 61%\n     - Bo Ryan: 72%\n\n3. **Rank the Overall Win Percentages:**\n   - Sort these percentages in descending order:\n     - Walter Meanwell (first tenure): 91%\n     - Emmett Angell: 74%\n     - Bo Ryan: 72%\n     - James C Elsom, Guy Lowman: 64%\n     - Dick Bennett: 57%\n     - Brad Soderberg: 61%\n     - Haskell Noyes, Walter Meanwell (second tenure): 63%\n     - Stu Jackson: 56%\n     - Steve Yoder: 43%\n     - Stan Van Gundy: 48%\n     - Bud Foster: 49%\n     - John Powless: 44%\n     - John E Erickson: 46%\n     - Bill Cofield: 38%\n\n4. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Stu Jackson has the second-highest overall win percentage.\n   - From our ranking, Walter Meanwell (first tenure) has the highest at 91%, and Emmett Angell is second with 74%.\n   - Stu Jackson ranks eighth in the list of coaches by overall win percentage with 56%.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on this analysis, the claim that \"Stu Jackson has the second-highest overall win percentage\" is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are those containing each coach's overall win percentage:\n     - Row 0, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 1, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 2, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 3, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 4, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 5, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 6, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 7, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 8, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 9, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 10, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 11, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 12, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 13, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 14, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n     - Row 15, Column: \"overall win percentage\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"overall win percentage\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
