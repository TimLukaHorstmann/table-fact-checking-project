This matches our condition.\n  \n- Check for the competition \"summer olympics\":\n  - The same row (first row in tbody) lists the competition as **\"summer olympics\"**, which aligns with our condition.\n\n- Check for the position \"7th (heats)\":\n  - In this row, under the \"position\" column, we find **\"7th (heats)\"**. This also meets our specified condition.\n\nHaving reviewed all conditions against the table data in the first relevant row:\n\n- The year is 2008.\n- The competition is summer olympics.\n- The position is 7th (heats).\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in this specific row of the table.
