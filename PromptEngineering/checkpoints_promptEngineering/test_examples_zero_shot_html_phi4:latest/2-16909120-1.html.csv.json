    "resp": "To verify the claim \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville,\" we need to check two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **LBS Number is 217**: We need to find rows where the LBS Number column contains '217'.\n2. **LBS Name is 'granville'**: For these rows, verify that the LBS Name matches 'granville'.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"lowest,\" which suggests we should ensure there are no lower LBS Numbers with the name 'granville'. Therefore, we need to check if any row has an LBS Number less than 217 and also contains the name 'granville'.\n\nLet's evaluate:\n\n- **Row Index 17**: \n  - LBS Number: 217\n  - LBS Name: granville\n\nWe found a match for both conditions in Row 17. Now, we need to ensure there are no other rows with an LBS Number less than 217 and the name 'granville'. \n\n- **Checking all rows**: \n  - No row has an LBS Number less than 217.\n  - Row 16 (LBS Number: 216) does not have the name 'granville'.\n  - Other rows either do not match the LBS Name or have a higher LBS Number.\n\nSince no other rows satisfy both conditions with a lower LBS Number, the claim is verified as true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Lbs number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Lbs name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
