Toland is indeed listed as an incumbent in row 3.\n- However, his result is \"re-elected,\" not \"new seat republican gain.\"\n- The result \"new seat republican gain\" appears only in row 7 and does not relate to John H. Toland.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because although John H. Toland is listed as an incumbent, he did not have the result of \"new seat republican gain.\"\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- **Row 3, Column: \"incumbent\"**\n- **Row 3, Column: \"result\"**\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
