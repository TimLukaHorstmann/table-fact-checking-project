    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"datia's constituency number be lower than gohad's by 10\" is true or false, we need to identify and compare the relevant data points from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Constituency Numbers:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to the constituency \"gohad\".\n   - Find the row corresponding to any of the constituencies in the district \"datia\".\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\n   - From the \"gohad\" row, extract the \"constituency number\".\n   - From one of the \"datia\" rows (e.g., \"sewda\", \"bhander\", or \"datia\"), extract the \"constituency number\".\n\n3. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - Subtract the constituency number of a \"datia\" constituency from that of \"gohad\".\n   - Check if the difference is 10.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - For \"gohad\", the row index is 4 and the \"constituency number\" is 13.\n   - For \"sewda\" (one of the \"datia\" constituencies), the row index is 6 and the \"constituency number\" is 20.\n\n5. **Calculation:**\n   - Constituency number for \"gohad\": 13\n   - Constituency number for \"sewda\": 20\n   - Difference: 20 - 13 = 7\n\nSince the difference is not 10, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row index 4, column name \"constituency number\" (for \"gohad\").\n- Row index 6, column name \"constituency number\" (for \"sewda\").\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constituency number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"constituency number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
