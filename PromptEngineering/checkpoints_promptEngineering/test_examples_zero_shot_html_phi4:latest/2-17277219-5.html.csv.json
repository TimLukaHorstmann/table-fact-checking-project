He is found in row 5.\n  \n- **Country Verification**:\n  - In row 5, column \"country\" should confirm that Gary Player is from South Africa.\n\n- **Place Verification**:\n  - In the same row (row 5), column \"place\" should be checked to see if it indicates a place of \"t4.\"\n\n### Table Verification:\n\n1. **Row 5**: The table's fifth row corresponds to Gary Player.\n   - Column \"country\": This cell contains \"south africa.\"\n   - Column \"place\": This cell contains \"t4.\"\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied by this row:\n- Gary Player is indeed listed as being from South Africa.\n- He has a place of \"t4\" in the table.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, the claim is verified to be true.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
