We need to find a row where the artist name is \"maggie toal\".\n\n2. **Draw Number**: The claim mentions \"have draw 7\". This means we are looking for an entry with a draw number of 7.\n\n3. **Song Name**: The claim states \"for the song fee him with love\". We need to ensure that the song name is \"feed him with love\" (noticing the typo in the claim).\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- Row index 6 has:\n  - Draw: 7\n  - Artist: maggie toal\n  - Song: feed him with love\n\nAll conditions of the claim match this row. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells are from row index 6 in the columns \"draw\", \"artist\", and \"song\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
