    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"more players have the position of gk than any other position,\" we need to evaluate each player's position from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Extract the Position Data**: \n   We will extract data related to the 'pos' column since it contains the information about each player's position.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences of Each Position**:\n   - Count how many players are listed under each unique position.\n   \n3. **Identify the Position with Maximum Frequency**:\n   - Determine which position appears most frequently in the list.\n\n4. **Compare 'gk' Frequency to Other Positions**: \n   - Specifically check if 'gk' (goalkeeper) has a higher count than any other position.\n\n### Data Extraction:\n\nFrom the given HTML table, we have the following positions for each player:\n- Row 0: gk\n- Row 1: d\n- Row 2: cb\n- Row 3: cf\n- Row 4: d\n- Row 5: d\n- Row 6: d\n- Row 7: d\n- Row 8: cf\n- Row 9: cb\n- Row 10: cb\n- Row 11: cf\n- Row 12: gk\n\n### Count of Each Position:\n- **gk**: Appears 2 times (Rows 0, 12)\n- **d**: Appears 5 times (Rows 1, 4, 5, 6, 7)\n- **cb**: Appears 3 times (Rows 2, 9, 10)\n- **cf**: Appears 3 times (Rows 3, 8, 11)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe position 'd' appears most frequently with a count of 5. The position 'gk' only appears twice, which is less frequent than the 'd' position.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"more players have the position of gk than any other position\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- We focus on all cells under the 'pos' column since they directly relate to verifying the claim about positions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
