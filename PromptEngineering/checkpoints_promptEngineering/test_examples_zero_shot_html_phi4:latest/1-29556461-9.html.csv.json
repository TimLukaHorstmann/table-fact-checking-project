    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the most point score by the owl in 1 game be 74\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are interested in the `high points` column because it shows the highest number of points scored by any player (referred to as \"the owl\") in each game.\n\n2. **Extract and Analyze**:\n   - For each row, extract the value from the `high points` column.\n   - Convert these values into integers for comparison, noting that some entries may have multiple players tied with the same score (e.g., \"moore / fernandez - 23\").\n\n3. **Compare Against Claim**:\n   - Check if any of the extracted point scores are equal to or exceed 74.\n\n### Data Extraction:\n\n- **Row 0**: `high points` = \"fernandez - 19\"\n  - Maximum points = 19\n\n- **Row 1**: `high points` = \"allen - 24\"\n  - Maximum points = 24\n\n- **Row 2**: `high points` = \"moore - 23\"\n  - Maximum points = 23\n\n- **Row 3**: `high points` = \"wyatt - 15\"\n  - Maximum points = 15\n\n- **Row 4**: `high points` = \"moore / fernandez - 23\"\n  - Maximum points = 23\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe highest score recorded in any game is 24 points (in Row 1).
