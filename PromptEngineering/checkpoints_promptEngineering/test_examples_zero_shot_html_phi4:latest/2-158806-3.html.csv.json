It weighs 0.55 g.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n#### Step 1: Locate the row with the value \"1 \u20a7\"\n- We look through each row in the table under the \"value\" column to find where it equals \"1 \u20a7\".\n- The first row contains this information:\n  ```html\n  <td>1 \u20a7</td>\n  ```\n\n#### Step 2: Verify the diameter for \"1 \u20a7\"\n- In the same row as \"1 \u20a7\", check the \"diameter\" column:\n  ```html\n  <td>14 mm</td>\n  ```\n- The cell confirms that the diameter is indeed 14 mm.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the weight for \"1 \u20a7\"\n- Again, in the same row as \"1 \u20a7\", check the \"weight\" column:\n  ```html\n  <td>0.55 g</td>\n  ```\n- The cell confirms that the weight is indeed 0.55 g.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are found in row index 0 (considering 0-based indexing) under the columns \"value\", \"diameter\", and \"weight\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"value\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"diameter\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weight\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the table data, let's analyze each part of the claim step by step:\n\n### Claim Analysis\n\n1. **Equivalence Check:**\n   - The claim states that the equivalence is 0.60.\n   \n2. **Diameter Verification:**\n   - It specifies that for this equivalence (0.60), the diameter should be 24.5 mm.\n\n3. **Value Condition:**\n   - Finally, it claims that the coin's value should be less than 100 \u20a7 for these conditions to hold true.\n\n### Table Examination\n\nNow let's verify each condition against the table:\n\n1. **Find a Coin with Equivalence of 0.60:**\n\n   - Looking at the column \"equiv\", we find:\n     - Row 6 (index 5): The equivalence is 0.60 for the coin with value 100 \u20a7.\n\n2. **Verify Diameter for Equivalence of 0.60:**\n\n   - In row 6 (index 5), under the \"diameter\" column, we find:\n     - The diameter is indeed 24.5 mm, matching the claim.\n\n3. **Check Coin Value Condition:**\n\n   - The value associated with this equivalence (0.60) and diameter (24.5 mm) is 100 \u20a7.\n   - The claim states that the coin's value should be less than 100 \u20a7. However, it is exactly 100 \u20a7.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conditions for equivalence and diameter match perfectly. However, the condition regarding the value being \"less than 100 \u20a7\" does not hold true as the actual value is 100 \u20a7, which is not less than 100 \u20a7.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo support this conclusion, we consider these cells from the table:\n\n- Row index 5, column \"equiv\": checks the equivalence.\n- Row index 5, column \"diameter\": verifies the diameter.\n- Row index 5, column \"value\": confirms the value condition fails.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"equiv\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"diameter\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"value\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
