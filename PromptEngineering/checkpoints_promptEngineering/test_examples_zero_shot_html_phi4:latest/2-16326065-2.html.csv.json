We look at the column labeled \"completions\" to find the number of completions.\n\n2. \"on Iowa\" - This part of the statement indicates that these completions were while playing for the team Iowa. We check the column labeled \"team\" to confirm this information.\n\n3. \"when his yard be 45\" - This portion suggests that during this performance, James Vandenberg gained a total of 45 yards. We will validate this by looking at the \"yards\" column in the table.\n\nNow let's review the rows in the table for relevant data:\n\n- The first row is not applicable because it contains \"redshirt\" in all columns and represents the year 2008, which doesn't align with the claim.\n- The second row shows that in 2009, there were 42 completions and 470 yards, not matching the claim's specifications of 8 completions or 45 yards.\n- The third row corresponds to the year 2010 and indicates 5 completions and 45 yards. This does not match the claimed 8 completions but matches the yardage stated in the claim.\n- The fourth and fifth rows represent other years with more completions and higher yardage, which are irrelevant to this specific claim.\n\nThe only row that partially supports the claim is the third one for the year 2010.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249,\" we need to break it down into verifiable components based on the table provided:\n\n1. **\"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa\":** This part of the claim suggests that there is a row with 404 attempts and it involves someone named \"vanderberg.\" The table shows attempts under the column labeled \"attempts,\" but it does not mention any names such as \"vanderberg.\" Therefore, without additional context or data outside the provided table about who made those attempts, we cannot verify this part of the claim.\n\n2. **\"when the record yard be 2249\":** This component refers to a row where the yards are recorded as 2249. We need to check if there is a row with \"yards\" equal to 2249 in the table.\n\nLet's examine the relevant columns and rows:\n\n- The column \"attempts\" contains the value \"404\" for the year 2011.\n- The column \"yards\" contains the value \"2249\" for the year 2012.\n  \nThere is no single row where both conditions (attempts = 404 and yards = 2249) are true simultaneously. Therefore, based on this analysis, the claim cannot be fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
