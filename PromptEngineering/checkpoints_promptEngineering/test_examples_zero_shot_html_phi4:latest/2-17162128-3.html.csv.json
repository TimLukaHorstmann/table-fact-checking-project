    "resp": "To determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Condition 1:** Steve Jones should be the only player from the United States.\n2. **Condition 2:** Steve Jones should have a total score of 154 and be the only player with this score.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition using relevant cells from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Only Player from the United States\n\n- Check the \"country\" column to identify players from the United States.\n  \nRelevant rows for this condition are:\n- Row index 1: Fuzzy Zoeller (Country: United States)\n- Row index 2: Curtis Strange (Country: United States)\n- Row index 3: Jack Nicklaus (Country: United States)\n- Row index 4: Steve Jones (Country: United States)\n- Row index 5: Hale Irwin (Country: United States)\n\nSteve Jones is not the only player from the United States. There are other players such as Fuzzy Zoeller, Curtis Strange, Jack Nicklaus, and Hale Irwin from the United States.\n\n### Condition 2: Only Player with a Total Score of 154\n\n- Check the \"total\" column to find players with a total score of 154.\n  \nRelevant row for this condition:\n- Row index 4: Steve Jones (Total: 154)\n\nSteve Jones indeed has a total score of 154, and he is the only player listed with that specific score. No other rows have a \"total\" value of 154.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the first condition fails (Steve Jones is not the only player from the United States), the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify the conditions:\n\n- For Condition 1: Rows where the \"country\" is \"united states\":\n  - Row index 1, column \"country\"\n  - Row index 2, column \"country\"\n  - Row index 3, column \"country\"\n  - Row index 4, column \"country\"\n  - Row index 5, column \"country\"\n\n- For Condition 2: Row where the \"total\" is 154:\n  - Row index 4, column \"total\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table with respect to the claim: \"Hale Irwin be the only player from the United States to win multiple years.\"\n\n**Steps for Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify U.S. Players:** We need to find all players in the table who are from the United States.\n2. **Check for Multiple Wins:** For each U.S. player, check if they have won more than one year as indicated by multiple entries in the \"year (s) won\" column.\n\n**Relevant Information from Table:**\n\n- Players from the United States:\n  - Fuzzy Zoeller\n  - Curtis Strange\n  - Jack Nicklaus\n  - Steve Jones\n  - Hale Irwin\n\n- Analysis of U.S. players with multiple wins:\n  - **Fuzzy Zoeller:** Won in \"1984\" (1 year)\n  - **Curtis Strange:** Won in \"1988, 1989\" (2 years)\n  - **Jack Nicklaus:** Won in \"1962, 1967, 1972, 1980\" (4 years)\n  - **Steve Jones:** Won in \"1996\" (1 year)\n  - **Hale Irwin:** Won in \"1974, 1979, 1990\" (3 years)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Hale Irwin is not the only player from the United States to win multiple years.
