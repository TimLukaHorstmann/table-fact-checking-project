    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"David Burke have 3 more total apps than Malcolm Brown,\" we need to examine the data related to their total applications in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**:\n   - The last column of each row represents the total applications (\"Total Apps\").\n\n2. **Locate the rows for David Burke and Malcolm Brown**:\n   - David Burke is in the third row (index 2).\n   - Malcolm Brown is in the sixth row (index 5).\n\n3. **Extract the \"Total Apps\" values**:\n   - For David Burke: The total apps are 51.\n   - For Malcolm Brown: The total apps are 56.\n\n4. **Compare the values**:\n   - We need to check if David Burke's total apps (51) is 3 more than Malcolm Brown's total apps (56).\n   - Mathematically, this would mean \\(51 = 56 + 3\\), which simplifies to \\(51 = 59\\). This statement is false.\n\n5. **Determine the correctness of the claim**:\n   - The claim states that David Burke has 3 more total apps than Malcolm Brown, but our calculation shows otherwise.\n   - Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n\n6. **Compile relevant cells for verification**:\n   - Relevant cells are those containing the \"Total Apps\" values for both players.\n   - For David Burke: Row index 2, column \"Total Apps\".\n   - For Malcolm Brown: Row index 5, column \"Total Apps\".\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Total Apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Total Apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
