    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table based on the conditions specified in the claim.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Condition 1**: \"more than 0 touchdowns\"\n2. **Condition 2**: \"more than 135 yards\"\n3. **Claim**: The average (\"avg\") for players meeting both conditions should be 5.3.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Players with More Than 0 Touchdowns:**\n   - Rob Turner: 4 touchdowns\n   - Kevin Ingram: 1 touchdown\n   - Robert Quiroga: 2 touchdowns\n   - Josh Jeffries: 3 touchdowns\n\n2. **From the Above, Identify Those Also With More Than 135 Yards:**\n   - Rob Turner: 171 yards\n   - Kevin Ingram: 135 yards (does not meet \"more than\" condition)\n   - Robert Quiroga: 16 yards\n   - Josh Jeffries: 58 yards\n\n3. **Relevant Players for Calculation:**\n   - Only Rob Turner meets both conditions (more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards).\n\n4. **Calculate the Average for These Players:**\n   - Since only Rob Turner qualifies, his average is directly considered: 10.6.\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Average:**\n   - The claim states that the average should be 5.3.\n   - The calculated average from the relevant players is 10.6.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because the only player who meets both conditions has an average of 10.6, not 5.3.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- Rob Turner's row (index 0) for touchdowns and yards:\n  - Touchdowns: \"td 's\" column\n  - Yards: \"yards\" column\n- Rob Turner's row (index 0) for average:\n  - Average: \"avg\" column\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"td 's\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
