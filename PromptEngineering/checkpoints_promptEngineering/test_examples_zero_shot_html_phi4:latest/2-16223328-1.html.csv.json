    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to examine the relevant information in the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"survey usa be administer between october 30 november 2 , 2008\". This means we are looking for a row where:\n1. The poll source is \"survey usa\".\n2. The date administered is \"october 30 - november 2, 2008\".\n\nLet's break down the relevant information from the table:\n\n- **Row Index and Content:**\n  - Row index 4 (0-based indexing):\n    - **Poll Source:** \"survey usa\"\n    - **Date Administered:** \"october 30 - november 2 , 2008\"\n\nThe claim is fully supported by this row since it matches both conditions specified in the claim.\n\nThus, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.
