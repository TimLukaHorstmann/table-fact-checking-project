Identify the row where Hawthorn is listed as the home team.\n2. In that row, find the 'away team score' column and check its value.\n3. Verify if this score matches \"17.10 (112)\".\n\nLet's analyze each relevant part of the table:\n\n- The table includes rows with data about football matches played on 6 July 1968.\n- We need to locate the row where Hawthorn is listed as the home team.\n\nBy examining the HTML table:\n- In Row 3, Hawthorn is listed as the home team.\n- In that same row (Row 3), the 'away team' is Essendon, and the 'away team score' is 17.10 (112).\n\nThe relevant information from the table for verifying this claim includes:\n\n1. The row where Hawthorn is the home team (Row 3).\n2.
