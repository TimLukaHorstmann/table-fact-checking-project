This does not include the full period of 1998 - 1999.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The table contains only one player with the position 'center', and their playing years do not cover both 1998 and 1999.\n- Therefore, the claim that \"the 2 players who played center played from 1998 - 1999\" is false because:\n  1. There is only one center listed, not two.\n  2. The years in Orlando for Jason Lawson do not cover both 1998 and 1999.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"position\": Confirms the position as 'center'.\n- Row 0, Column \"years in orlando\": Shows the years 1997 - 1998.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
