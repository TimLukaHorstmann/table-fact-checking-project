We need to locate this date in the \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Match Result**: The claim states the result was \"2 - 1\". This should be verified against both the \"score\" and \"result\" columns for the corresponding match.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - \"date\": January 26, 2006\n  - \"score\": 2 - 1\n  - \"result\": 2 - 1\n\nThe claim is supported by this row as it matches both the date and the result.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from Row 7 in the \"date\", \"score\", and \"result\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
