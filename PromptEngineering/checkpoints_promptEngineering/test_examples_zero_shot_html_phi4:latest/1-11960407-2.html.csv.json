    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on November 20 in Dallas is true or false, we need to verify specific information from the table:\n\n1. **Date and Opponent**: We check if there is a game listed for \"November 20\" against the \"Dallas\" team.\n\n2. **Game Result**: We verify the result of that particular game to see if it matches the claim.\n\nHere's how we can analyze each part of the claim using the table:\n\n- The row where `Date` is \"November 20\" and `Opponent` is \"Dallas\" is identified. This corresponds to:\n  - **Row Index**: 10\n  - **Relevant Columns**:\n    - `Date`: November 20 (to verify the date of the game)\n    - `Opponent`: Dallas (to confirm the opponent)\n    - `Result`: l 99 - 105 (ot) (to compare with the claimed result \"w 110 - 101 (ot)\")\n\nBased on this analysis, here is what we find:\n\n- The date and opponent match: November 20 against Dallas.\n- However, the actual game result was a loss (\"l\") with a score of 99 - 105 in overtime, not a win (\"w\") as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the result of the game on November 20 in Dallas be w 110 - 101 (ot)\" is false because both the outcome and the scores do not match what's recorded in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine specific conditions presented in it and compare them with the corresponding data from the table:\n\n1. **Date Check**: The claim states \"on November 24.\" We must locate the row with the date specified as \"November 24.\"\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: The claim involves a game against \"Cleveland.\" We need to ensure that the team Toronto played on this date is indeed Cleveland.\n\n3. **Result Check**: The claim says \"Toronto lose,\" so we should confirm whether the result indicates a loss for Toronto.\n\n4. **Score Check**: Finally, the claim specifies the score as \"108 - 111 (OT).\" This must match the score provided in the table for that game.\n\nLet's verify these conditions with the data from the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: \n  - The row with \"November 24\" is at `row_index` 12.\n  \n- **Date Verification**:\n  - In this row, the date is listed as \"November 24,\" which matches the claim.\n\n- **Opponent Verification**:\n  - The opponent column lists \"cleveland.\" This matches the team mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Result Verification**:\n  - The score is given as \"108 - 111 (ot),\" indicating Toronto scored 108, and Cleveland scored 111. Since Toronto's score is lower, they lost this game.\n\n- **Score Verification**:\n  - The scores are correctly specified as \"108 - 111 (OT)\" in the table, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nSince all conditions from the claim align with the corresponding data in the table, we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\nThus, the JSON object should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
