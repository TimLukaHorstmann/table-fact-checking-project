Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells that support this verification:\n\n- The player name (\"tony lorick\") corresponds to column \"player\" at row index 7.\n- The position (\"rb\") corresponds to column \"position\" at row index 7.\n- The team (\"oakland\") corresponds to column \"team\" at row index 7.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n1.
