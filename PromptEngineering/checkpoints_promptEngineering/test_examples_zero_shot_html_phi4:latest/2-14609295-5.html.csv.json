    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"in 1996 they be the 2 seed of the southeast region,\" we need to check two main conditions in the table for the year 1996:\n\n1. The year should be 1996.\n2. The \"seed\" should be 2 and the \"region\" should be \"southeast.\"\n\nLet's examine each relevant cell from the table:\n\n- **Row corresponding to 1996**:\n  - Check if the \"year\" is indeed 1996: \n    - Relevant cell: Row index 5, Column name \"year\"\n  - Check if the \"seed\" is 2:\n    - Relevant cell: Row index 5, Column name \"seed\"\n  - Check if the \"region\" is \"southeast\":\n    - Relevant cell: Row index 5, Column name \"region\"\n\nNow, let's verify each condition against the data from the table:\n\n- The \"year\" at row index 5 is indeed 1996.\n- The \"seed\" at row index 5 is 12, not 2.\n- The \"region\" at row index 5 is \"southeast,\" which matches.\n\nSince one of the conditions (the seed being 2) does not hold true, we conclude that the claim is FALSE. \n\nHere's the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"seed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"region\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
