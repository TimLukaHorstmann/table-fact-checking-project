    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim using the given table, we must break down the statement and verify each part against the data.\n\nThe claim is: \"Dave Stockton earned less money than Lee Trevino in 2002, but have 15 more wins.\"\n\n1. **Earnings Comparison**: \n   - The first part of the claim states that Dave Stockton earned less money than Lee Trevino.\n     - From the table:\n       - Dave Stockton's earnings: $9,735,814 (row index 3)\n       - Lee Trevino's earnings: $9,616,404 (row index 4)\n   - Comparing these figures shows that Dave Stockton actually earned more than Lee Trevino. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Wins Comparison**:\n   - The second part of the claim states that Dave Stockton has 15 more wins than Lee Trevino.\n     - From the table:\n       - Dave Stockton's wins: 14 (row index 3)\n       - Lee Trevino's wins: 29 (row index 4)\n   - Calculating the difference, Lee Trevino has 15 more wins than Dave Stockton, not the other way around. Hence, this part of the claim is also false.\n\nSince neither condition in the claim holds true based on the table data, the entire statement is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- To verify earnings: \"earnings\" column for both Lee Trevino (row index 4) and Dave Stockton (row index 3).\n- To verify wins: \"wins\" column for both Lee Trevino (row index 4) and Dave Stockton (row index 3).\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row index 3, Column \"earnings\"\n- Row index 4, Column \"earnings\"\n- Row index 3, Column \"wins\"\n- Row index 4, Column \"wins\"\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
