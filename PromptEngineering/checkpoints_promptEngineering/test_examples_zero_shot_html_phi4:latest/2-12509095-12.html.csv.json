The relevant cells from the table are located at row index 0 for both \"surface\" and \"partner\".\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
