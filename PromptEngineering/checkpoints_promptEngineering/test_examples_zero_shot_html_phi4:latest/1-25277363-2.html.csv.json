    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Fast Friend originally aired on October 12, 1993,\" we must verify two components based on the table: the title of the episode and its original air date.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We are interested in rows that contain information about episodes directed by John Tracy since he is mentioned as a director for the show \"Fast Friend.\"\n   - Specifically, we need to find an episode with the exact title \"Fast Friend\" and check if its original air date corresponds to October 12, 1993.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - The table lists several episodes directed by John Tracy. We should focus on these rows to find a match for both the title and air date.\n   - From our inspection of the table:\n     - In row with `no in series` = 149, titled \"Fast Friends,\" we see it was directed by John Tracy and aired on October 12, 1993.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The title of the episode is \"Fast Friends,\" not \"Fast Friend.\" Although the air date matches (October 12, 1993), the discrepancy in the title means the claim as stated (\"Fast Friend\") does not fully match.\n   - Therefore, based on the data provided, the exact claim that \"Fast Friend\" aired on October 12, 1993 is incorrect.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this information are from row index 8 (in zero-based indexing), under columns \"title\" and \"original air date.\"\n\nBased on these observations, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
