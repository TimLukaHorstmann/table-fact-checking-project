    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the episode title and air date in the provided HTML table, we need to verify two specific conditions:\n\n1. The episode must have aired on \"March 31, 2008\".\n2. The title of this episode should be \"new york : secret societies\".\n\nLet's systematically check these conditions against the data in the table.\n\n### Table Data Review\nThe relevant columns for this task are:\n- `episode no`\n- `original airdate`\n- `episode title`\n\n### Verification Process\n\n1. **Find the Episode with Air Date March 31, 2008**:\n   - We search each row to find where the `original airdate` is \"march 31 , 2008\".\n   - This condition is satisfied in row index 9 (keeping in mind that HTML table rows typically start at index 0).\n\n2. **Check Episode Title for this Date**:\n   - For the row with the air date \"march 31 , 2008\", we need to verify if the `episode title` matches \"new york : secret societies\".\n   - In row index 9, the `episode title` is indeed \"new york : secret societies\".\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are met: the episode aired on March 31, 2008, and its title was \"new york : secret societies\". Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- The cells that need to be checked are:\n  - Row index 9 for `original airdate`.\n  - Row index 9 for `episode title`.\n\nHere's the JSON output with the relevant details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The host should be Don Wildman.\n\nWe will verify each part of this claim with the relevant cells from the table.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n- **Air Date:** \n  - The claimed air date is January 28, 2008.\n  - From the table, the row corresponding to January 28, 2008, has an episode title \"Underground Apocalypse\".\n  \n- **Episode Title:**\n  - The claimed title is \"Vietnam\".\n  - According to the table, the episode with the title \"Vietnam\" aired on February 4, 2008.\n\n- **Host:**\n  - The host mentioned in the claim is Don Wildman.\n  - For both January 28 and February 4 episodes, the host listed is indeed Don Wildman.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that an episode with the title \"Vietnam\" aired on January 28, 2008.
