    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all episodes except the first be broadcast in the UK during the year of 1983\" is true or false, we need to verify if all episodes (from episode 2 onwards) have a 'UK Broadcast Date' within 1983.\n\nHere's how we can check this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - The relevant column for each row (except the first) is \"uk broadcast date\".\n   \n2. **Verify Each Row**:\n   - For episode 2: \"uk broadcast date\" is \"1983 - 02 - 22\". This falls in 1983.\n   - For episode 3: \"uk broadcast date\" is \"1983 - 03 - 01\". This falls in 1983.\n   - For episode 4: \"uk broadcast date\" is \"1983 - 03 - 08\". This falls in 1983.\n   - For episode 5: \"uk broadcast date\" is \"1983 - 03 - 15\". This falls in 1983.\n   - For episode 6: \"uk broadcast date\" is \"1983 - 03 - 22\". This falls in 1983.\n   - For episode 7: \"uk broadcast date\" is \"1983 - 03 - 29\". This falls in 1983.\n\nSince all the episodes from episode 2 to episode 7 have their 'UK Broadcast Date' within the year 1983, the claim is true. We then identify the relevant cells for these checks:\n\n- Episode 2: Row index 1, column \"uk broadcast date\"\n- Episode 3: Row index 2, column \"uk broadcast date\"\n- Episode 4: Row index 3, column \"uk broadcast date\"\n- Episode 5: Row index 4, column \"uk broadcast date\"\n- Episode 6: Row index 5, column \"uk broadcast date\"\n- Episode 7: Row index 6, column \"uk broadcast date\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object is constructed as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"uk broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"uk broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"uk broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"uk broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"uk broadcast date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"uk broadcast date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
