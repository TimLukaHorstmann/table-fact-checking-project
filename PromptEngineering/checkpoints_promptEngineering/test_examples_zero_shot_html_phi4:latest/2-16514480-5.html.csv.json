    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the United States have the most players with -4 to par\" (or equivalently, tied for fourth place), we need to analyze the table and focus on two columns: \"country\" and \"to par\". Specifically, we are looking for entries where the \"country\" is \"united states\" and the \"to par\" value is \"- 4\".\n\nLet's examine each row of the table:\n\n1. **Row Index 0**: \n   - Player: Nick Faldo\n   - Country: England\n   - To Par: -12\n   - This does not match the criteria.\n\n2. **Row Index 1**:\n   - Player: Greg Norman\n   - Country: Australia\n   - To Par: -7\n   - This does not match the criteria.\n\n3. **Row Index 2**:\n   - Player: Phil Mickelson\n   - Country: United States\n   - To Par: -6\n   - This does not match the criteria.\n\n4. **Row Index 3**: \n   - Player: Frank Nobilo\n   - Country: New Zealand\n   - To Par: -5\n   - This does not match the criteria.\n\n5. **Row Index 4**:\n   - Player: Scott Hoch\n   - Country: United States\n   - To Par: -4\n   - This matches the criteria.\n\n6. **Row Index 5**: \n   - Player: Duffy Waldorf\n   - Country: United States\n   - To Par: -4\n   - This matches the criteria.\n\n7. **Row Index 6**:\n   - Player: Davis Love III\n   - Country: United States\n   - To Par: -3\n   - This does not match the criteria.\n\n8. **Row Index 7**:\n   - Player: Jeff Maggert\n   - Country: United States\n   - To Par: -3\n   - This does not match the criteria.\n\n9. **Row Index 8**:\n   - Player: Corey Pavin\n   - Country: United States\n   - To Par: -3\n   - This does not match the criteria.\n\n10. **Row Index 9**: \n    - Player: David Frost\n    - Country: South Africa\n    - To Par: -2\n    - This does not match the criteria.\n\n11. **Row Index 10**:\n    - Player: Scott McCarron\n    - Country: United States\n    - To Par: -2\n    - This does not match the criteria.\n\nNow, let's verify if any other country has players with a \"to par\" value of \"-4\". \n\n- The only other player tied for fourth place (with to par of -4) is Scott Hoch and Duffy Waldorf from the United States. No other country listed in the table has players with a \"to par\" of -4.\n\nThus, the United States have 2 players with \"to par\" of \"-4\", which is indeed the most among all countries represented in this dataset for that score category.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify and list down the relevant rows and their respective \"money\" values:\n   - Row 0 (Nick Faldo): 450,000\n   - Row 1 (Greg Norman): 270,000\n   - Row 2 (Phil Mickelson): 170,000\n   - Row 3 (Frank Nobilo): 120,000\n   - Row 4 (Scott Hoch): 95,000\n   - Row 5 (Duffy Waldorf): 95,000\n   - Row 6 (Davis Love III): 77,933\n   - Row 7 (Jeff Maggert): 77,933\n   - Row 8 (Corey Pavin): 77,933\n   - Row 9 (David Frost): 65,000\n   - Row 10 (Scott McCarron): 65,000\n\n2.
