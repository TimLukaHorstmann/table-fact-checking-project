    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Lessburg high school\" is true or false, we need to verify two conditions based on the provided table:\n\n1. The player must be a linebacker.\n2. The player's college must be Stanford.\n3. The player's high school must be Lessburg High School.\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows in the table and check these conditions:\n\n- **Row 7**: \n  - Player: Noor Davis\n  - Position: Linebacker\n  - High School: Lessburg High School\n  - College: Stanford\n\nThe conditions for the claim are satisfied by this row. Noor Davis is a linebacker from Lessburg High School, and his college is Stanford.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School,\" we need to examine each part of the statement against the table provided:\n\n1. **Position Verification**:\n   - The position in question is \"linebacker.\"\n\n2. **School Verification**:\n   - We are looking for someone who attended \"Norco High School.\"\n\n3. **College Verification**:\n   - Finally, we need to check if this player attends \"Stanford.\"\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- For each row with a position of \"linebacker,\" examine both the school and college columns.\n  \n  - Row 6: Player is Vince Biegel from Lincoln High School attending Wisconsin. This does not match Norco or Stanford.\n\n  - Row 7: Player is Scott Starr from Norco High School, which matches part of our criteria (school). However, Scott Starr attends Southern California, not Stanford, so this row does not fully satisfy the claim.\n\n  - Row 8: Player is Noor Davis from Lessburg High School attending Stanford. Although the college matches, the school does not match Norco High School.\n\nNone of the players who are linebackers fit all three conditions simultaneously (linebacker position, attended Norco High School, and currently attend Stanford).\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim is **FALSE** because there is no player listed as a linebacker from Norco High School attending Stanford.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim pertain to row 7 for school verification and college verification. Here are those details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells include the position from row 6 to ensure it's a linebacker, and the school and college details of row 7 and 8 to check if any matches occur.",
