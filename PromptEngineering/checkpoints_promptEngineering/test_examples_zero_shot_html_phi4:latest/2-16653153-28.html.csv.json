Hence, we examine the rows where the `date` column is \"7 february\".\n\n2. **Examine matches involving New Zealand Breakers:**\n   - Within these rows, identify any match that involves the team \"new zealand breakers\". \n\n3. **Check if New Zealand Breakers were the away team:**\n   - For each relevant row, verify whether \"new zealand breakers\" is listed under the `away team` column.\n\n**Detailed Evaluation:**\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Date: 7 February\n  - Home Team: adelaide 36ers\n  - Score: 102 - 91\n  - Away Team: new zealand breakers\n  - Venue, Crowd, Box Score, and Report columns are irrelevant for this claim verification.\n  \nIn row 5, the match on February 7th includes \"new zealand breakers\" as the away team. This matches the condition described in the claim.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that on February 7th, the New Zealand Breakers were the away team for a particular game according to the box score.
