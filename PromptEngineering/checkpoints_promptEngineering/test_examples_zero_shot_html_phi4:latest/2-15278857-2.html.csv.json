    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the column `avge` in the provided table, as this represents the average goals per game for each player.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the `avge` column since it directly pertains to the claim about the difference between the highest and lowest averages.\n   \n2. **Identify Maximum and Minimum Values:**\n   - Scan through the `avge` values to identify the maximum and minimum averages.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Compute the difference between the maximum and minimum average values.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Check if the calculated difference is less than 2.\n\n### Data Extraction:\n\nHere are the `avge` values from each row (row_index starting from 0):\n\n- Row 0: 0.44\n- Row 1: 0.46\n- Row 2: 0.35\n- Row 3: 0.45\n- Row 4: 0.25\n- Row 5: 0.37\n- Row 6: 0.34\n- Row 7: 0.30\n- Row 8: 0.48\n- Row 9: 0.15\n- Row 10: 0.24\n- Row 11: 0.29\n- Row 12: 0.20\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Maximum Value:** \n   - The highest average is 0.48 (Row 8).\n\n2. **Minimum Value:** \n   - The lowest average is 0.15 (Row 9).\n\n3. **Calculate Difference:** \n   - Difference = 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe difference between the highest and lowest averages is 0.33, which is indeed less than 2.\n\nThus, the claim \"there be less than 2 difference between the highest and lowest average\" is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells for this analysis are those in the `avge` column, specifically at row indices where the maximum and minimum values were found:\n  - Row 8 (maximum value)\n  - Row 9 (minimum value)\n\nHere's the JSON output with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"avge\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"avge\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
