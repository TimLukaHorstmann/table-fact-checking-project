These columns indicate if a song appeared on any chart (the presence of a number indicates a position, and `-` means it did not make it onto that particular chart).\n\n- **Check Each Row**:\n  - For the year 1981: \n    - Single: \"don't stop the train\"\n      - Chart positions: US Hot 100 = `-`, US Dance = `20`, US R&B = `-`\n    - Conclusion: Appeared on the US Dance chart, so it did make it to a chart.\n  \n  - For the year 1985:\n    - Single: \"move closer\"\n      - Chart positions: US Hot 100 = `-`, US Dance = `-`, US R&B = `-`\n    - Conclusion: Did not appear on any charts.\n    \n    - Single: \"i don't know\"\n      - Chart positions: US Hot 100 = `61`, US Dance = `1`, US R&B = `65`\n    - Conclusion: Appeared on all three charts.\n      \n    - Single: \"i like you\"\n      - Chart positions: US Hot 100 = `61`, US Dance = `1`, US R&B = `65`\n    - Conclusion: Appeared on all three charts.\n\n  - For the year 1994:\n    - Single: \"move closer (re-issue)\"\n      - Chart positions: US Hot 100 = `-`, US Dance = `-`, US R&B = `-`\n    - Conclusion: Did not appear on any charts.\n\n### Summary of Analysis:\n\n- \"move closer\" from 1985 and \"move closer (re-issue)\" from 1994 did not make it onto any charts.\n- No other single in the table failed to make it onto all the charts. \n\nThus, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE: \"move closer\" and \"move closer (re-issue)\" are indeed the only singles that did not make it to any chart.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo verify this, we need to look at cells in the table where chart positions are provided for each single.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check if Phyllis Nelson had more than one song charting in 1985.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n\n- The claim states that Phyllis Nelson was able to chart two times with her songs in 1985.\n- We need to look at the year 1985 in the table and identify any entries where a single has charted (i.e., not marked as \"-\").\n\n**Table Examination:**\n\n1. **Row 2 (Year 1985):**\n   - \"Move closer\" is listed, but it does not chart on US Hot 100, US Dance, or US R&B.\n\n2. **Row 3 (Year 1985):**\n   - \"I don't know\" charts at position 61 on the US Hot 100, position 1 on US Dance, and position 65 on US R&B.\n   \n3. **Row 4 (Year 1985):**\n   - \"I like you\" charts at position 61 on the US Hot 100, position 1 on US Dance, and position 65 on US R&B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- In 1985, Phyllis Nelson had two songs that charted:\n  - \"I don't know\"\n  - \"I like you\"\n\nThese two entries confirm that she charted twice in 1985.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row 3 (Index 2), Columns: \"single\", \"us hot 100\", \"us dance\", \"us r&b\"\n- Row 4 (Index 3), Columns: \"single\", \"us hot 100\", \"us dance\", \"us r&b\"\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in these cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
