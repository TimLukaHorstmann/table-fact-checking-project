The claim states: \"fc nantes and olympique lyonnaise tie on aggregate with a score of 4 - 4 , require the match to be decide by the away goal rule.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: \n   - We need to locate the row in the table where FC Nantes (d1) faces Olympique Lyonnais (d2). This corresponds to the fifth row in the HTML table.\n\n2. **Check Aggregate Score**:\n   - The claim mentions an aggregate score of 4 - 4.\n   - In the relevant row, we find that the \"score\" column shows \"4 - 4,\" confirming this part of the claim.\n\n3. **Check Away Goal Rule**:\n   - According to football rules, if a match is tied on aggregate after two legs and both teams are still tied in away goals, it goes to extra time or penalty shootouts (if applicable), but not decided by away goals.\n   - The \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" columns show the results of each leg:\n     - First Round: FC Nantes 0 - Olympique Lyonnais 0\n     - Second Round: FC Nantes 4 - Olympique Lyonnais 4\n\n   - For the away goal rule to apply, we need more goals scored by one team in the opponent's stadium than the other. Here:\n     - Away goals for FC Nantes (d1) at Olympique Lyonnais (d2): 0\n     - Away goals for Olympique Lyonnais (d2) at FC Nantes (d1): 4\n\n   - Since Olympique Lyonnais scored more away goals, they would win based on the away goal rule. The claim that both teams \"tie\" and require deciding by the away goal is incorrect because Olympique Lyonnais would already be declared winners based on their greater number of away goals.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if AS Monaco scored the most goals in the first round of the Coupe de France during the specified year based on the data provided.\n\nThe relevant column for this verification is \"score\", which shows the total number of goals scored by both teams combined. We also need to look at each team's respective scores per round, as well as their overall performance across both rounds to ensure they are indeed the highest scorers in one round specifically.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how many goals AS Monaco scored:\n\n- In the \"score\" column (total goals), AS Monaco is listed with 6 - 1, meaning they scored 6 goals.\n- Looking at the rounds:\n  - 1st round: AS Monaco vs. AS Nancy: 2 - 0\n  - 2nd round: AS Monaco vs. AS Nancy: 4 - 1\n\nAS Monaco scored a total of 6 goals across both rounds.\n\nNow, we compare this with other teams' performance in the first round to find out if any team has scored more than AS Monaco:\n\n- RC Lens (D1) vs. RC Strasbourg (D1): 1st round: 1 - 0\n- FC Rouen (D1) vs. Stade Lavallois (D1): 1st round: 1 - 0\n- Girondins de Bordeaux (D1) vs. FC Mulhouse (D2): 1st round: 0 - 1\n- FC Nantes (D1) vs. Olympique Lyonnais (D2): 1st round: 0 - 0\n- AS Cannes (D2) vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard (D1): 1st round: 3 - 0\n- Sporting Toulon Var (D1) vs. En Avant Guingamp (D2): 1st round: 2 - 0\n- FC Metz (D1) vs. Besan\u00e7on RC (D2): 1st round: 4 - 0\n\nThe maximum number of goals scored by any team in the first round is 4, which was by FC Metz.\n\nAS Monaco, however, scored 6 total goals across both rounds combined but not more than any other team in a single round. Therefore, while they scored the most overall goals (6), we need to focus on the highest number of goals scored in a single round:\n\n- AS Cannes scored 3 goals in their first round.\n\nThus, no team scored more goals than AS Monaco did in either round by themselves in that specific round; however, AS Monaco's score was not exclusively concentrated in one round but split between two rounds. The focus is on \"first round\" scoring, and while they didn't score the most in a single first-round game compared to FC Metz's 4 goals against Besan\u00e7on RC, they had the highest overall contribution (6 goals) when considering both rounds.\n\nThe claim specifies that AS Monaco scored the most in the *round of 16* for the year 1983-84 Coupe de France, which is not directly verifiable from just this table but rather implies looking at first round scoring within a single game context. Since no team scored more than 4 goals by themselves in any first round match:\n\nThe claim that \"AS Monaco score[d] the most goal[s] in the round of 16\" cannot be confirmed as true based on first-round performance alone from this table.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the statement is FALSE because another team (FC Metz) scored more than AS Monaco did individually in a single game during the first round.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions:\n1. Identify the highest scoring leg (individual match).\n2. Determine if the highest aggregate score for a match totals 8 goals.\n\nThe claim specifies \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc\" as having an 8-goal total in both legs combined. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- **Identifying Highest Scoring Leg:**\n  - The matches and their scores are as follows:\n    - RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: 1st round (1 - 0), 2nd round (0 - 0)\n    - FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois: 1st round (1 - 0), 2nd round (1 - 3)\n    - AS Monaco vs AS Nancy: 1st round (2 - 0), 2nd round (4 - 1)\n    - Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse: 1st round (0 - 1), 2nd round (2 - 2)\n    - FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: 1st round (0 - 0), 2nd round (4 - 4)\n    - AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: 1st round (3 - 0), 2nd round (1 - 1)\n    - Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp: 1st round (2 - 0), 2nd round (0 - 1)\n    - FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC: 1st round (4 - 0), 2nd round (1 - 1)\n\n  The highest scoring individual leg is \"FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC\" with a score of 4-0 in the first round.\n\n- **Identifying Highest Aggregate Score:**\n  - Calculating total goals for each match:\n    - RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: Total = 1 + 0 = 1\n    - FC Rouen vs Stade Lavallois: Total = 1 + 3 = 4\n    - AS Monaco vs AS Nancy: Total = 2 + 4 = 6\n    - Girondins de Bordeaux vs FC Mulhouse: Total = 1 + 2 = 3\n    - FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: Total = 0 + 4 = 4\n    - AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard: Total = 3 + 1 = 4\n    - Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp: Total = 2 + 1 = 3\n    - FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC: Total = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nThe highest aggregate score is 6 goals, for \"AS Monaco vs AS Nancy\". None of the matches total 8 goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim about \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc\" having an 8-goal total is incorrect.
