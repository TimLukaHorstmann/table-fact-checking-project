    "resp": "To verify the claim about the Warrington Town team, we need to check two conditions: \n\n1. Whether the Warrington Town team is indeed in the 4th position.\n2. If they have exactly 45 goals against.\n\nLet's examine these conditions one by one based on the provided HTML table:\n\n### Condition 1: Position\n\n- Look at the \"position\" column to identify the rank of the Warrington Town team.\n- In row index 3, under the \"position\" column, it is shown that the position is 4. \n- In the same row (index 3), under the \"team\" column, the team name is listed as \"warrington town\".\n\n### Condition 2: Goals Against\n\n- Again in row index 3, under the \"goals against\" column, it shows 45 goals against.\n\nBoth conditions are verified to be true based on the table:\n\n1. Warrington Town is indeed in position 4.\n2. They have 45 goals against.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data from the relevant cells.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the verification result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
