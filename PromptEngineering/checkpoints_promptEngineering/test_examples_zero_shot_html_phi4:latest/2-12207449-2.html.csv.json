Specifically, we should focus on identifying each pitcher's win-loss record from the \"loss\" column and compare these records.\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data**: The claim states that Stieb has the worst record with 0-3.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data in the table concerning the Blue Jays' game outcomes and losing streaks for April 1986.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- **Claim**: \"The Blue Jay's in April 1986's shortest streak was a 0 - 1 game losing streak.\"\n\n### Relevant Information from Table:\n1. The \"loss\" column indicates which games were losses and by which player.\n2. The \"record\" column shows the win-loss record after each game, where we can track consecutive losses to identify streaks.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify All Losing Streaks**:\n   - We need to look at the sequence of losses in the \"loss\" column and corresponding changes in the \"record\".\n\n2. **Determine Length of Each Losing Streak**:\n   - A losing streak is a series of consecutive games where the Blue Jays lost.\n   - We will track when the record indicates an increase in losses without any wins in between.\n\n3. **Find the Shortest Streak**:\n   - Calculate the length of each losing streak and find the shortest one.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Games with Losses**:\n  - April 8: stieb (0 - 1), Record: 0 - 1\n  - April 9: correa (0 - 1), Record: 1 - 1\n  - April 10: harris (0 - 1), Record: 2 - 1\n  - April 11: gubicza (0 - 1), Record: 3 - 1\n  - April 12: acker (0 - 1), Record: 3 - 2\n  - April 13: stieb (0 - 2), Record: 3 - 3\n  - April 22: clancy (1 - 1), Record: 6 - 8\n  - April 23: lamp (0 - 1), Record: 6 - 9\n  - April 25: aase (1 - 2), Record: 7 - 9\n  - April 26: henke (2 - 1), Record: 7 - 10\n  - April 27: dixon (2 - 1), Record: 8 - 10\n  - April 29: eichhorn (2 - 1), Record: 8 - 11\n  - April 30: moore (1 - 1), Record: 9 - 11\n\n- **Losing Streaks**:\n  - April 8 to April 12: 5 consecutive losses (0 - 1, 0 - 2, 0 - 3, 0 - 4, 0 - 5)\n  - April 22 to April 23: 2 consecutive losses\n  - April 25 to April 30: 6 consecutive losses\n\n- **Shortest Streak**:\n  - The shortest losing streak is from April 22 to April 23 (2 games).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states the shortest streak was a \"0 - 1 game losing streak.\" However, the actual shortest streak found is of length 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- Record changes and losses from April 8 to April 30.\n- Specifically focus on records showing consecutive increases in losses without intervening wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
