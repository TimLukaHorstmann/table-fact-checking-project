The partnering player is \"Marcel Granollers.\"\n2. Flavio Cipolla's involvement, which implies checking if the tournament data rows are related to or associated with him.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of Flavio Cipolla in the table columns (only names involved in specific matches are listed), we infer that Flavio Cipolla is likely the main player associated with these results. This assumption is based on typical tournament reporting where a player\u2019s victories and partnerships in doubles would be linked to them.\n\nWe'll identify rows where \"Marcel Granollers\" appears in the \"partnering\" column, assuming each row reflects a match Flavio Cipolla participated in as one of the players:\n\n1. **Row 3**: \n   - Date: 24 April 2008\n   - Partnering: Marcel Granollers\n\n2. **Row 11**:\n   - Date: 27 May 2008\n   - Partnering: Simone Vagnozzi (This row is not relevant to the claim)\n\n3. **Row 15**: \n   - Date: 19 September 2010\n   - Partnering: Alessio di Mauro (This row is not relevant to the claim)\n\n4. **Row 6**:\n   - Date: 28 February 2010\n   - Partnering: Pablo Andujar (This row is not relevant to the claim)\n\n5. **Row 9**: \n   - Date: 24 April 2008\n   - Again, Marcel Granollers is listed as a partner.\n\n6. **Row 13**:\n   - Date: 28 February 2010\n   - Partnering: Pablo Andujar (This row is not relevant to the claim)\n\nWe find that \"Marcel Granollers\" appears twice in the \"partnering\" column, specifically in rows 3 and 9.

Therefore, this claim cannot be directly verified from the information provided.\n\n2. **Analyzing Matches by Location and Date**:\n   - For Uzbekistan: The match occurred on 13 October 2008.\n     - Row index: 12\n     - Columns relevant: \"date\", \"tournament\" (because it mentions Tashkent, Uzbekistan).\n   \n   - For Morocco: The match occurred on 28 February 2010.\n     - Row index: 14\n     - Columns relevant: \"date\", \"tournament\" (because it mentions Meknes, Morocco).\n\n3. **Verifying the Chronological Order**:\n   - Check if the Uzbekistan match date (13 October 2008) is before the Morocco match date (28 February 2010).
