    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"on April 16, the opponent be the new york ranger,\" we need to verify if the relevant cell in the table matches the given information. Specifically, we'll focus on the row corresponding to the date \"April 16\" and check the 'opponent' column.\n\n1. Locate the row where the date is \"April 16.\" In the provided HTML table, this corresponds to `row_index` 5.\n2. Check the value in the 'opponent' column for this row. According to the table:\n   - For `row_index` 5, the 'date' is \"april 16\" and the 'opponent' is \"new york rangers.\"\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied (the date matches April 16 and the opponent is indeed the New York Rangers), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 5, Column name 'date': value \"april 16\"\n- Row index 5, Column name 'opponent': value \"new york rangers\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"game 6 be hold on april 11,\" we need to verify two pieces of information from the table: \n1. The date when Game 6 is held.\n2. The game number associated with April 11.\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- **Row Index 5** (Game 6):  \n  - `game`: 6  \n  - `date`: April 16  \n  - This row shows that Game 6 was actually held on April 16, not April 11. \n\n- **Row Index 2** (April 11):  \n  - `game`: 3  \n  - `opponent`: New York Rangers  \n  - `score`: 3 - 0  \n  - This row shows that the game held on April 11 was Game 3.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see:\n- Game 6 is not associated with April 11. Instead, it's linked to April 16.\n- The game held on April 11 is Game 3, not Game 6.\n\nThus, the claim \"game 6 be hold on april 11\" is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verifying this:\n- Row index 5, column \"date\" (to check when Game 6 was held).\n- Row index 2, column \"date\" and \"game\" (to verify which game was held on April 11).\n\nThe final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
