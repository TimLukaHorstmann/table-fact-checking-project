    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the just ratio of 16:13 have the size (steps) of 12\" is true or false based on the provided table data, we need to analyze relevant rows and columns in the context of musical intervals.\n\nThe claim involves two specific aspects:\n1. The interval represented by the ratio 16:13.\n2. Whether this interval corresponds to a size or steps value of 12.\n\n**Steps to verify the claim:**\n\n1. **Identify the row where \"just ratio\" is 16:13**: \n   - Scan through the rows in the table under the column labeled \"just ratio\".\n   - Find any entry that matches the ratio 16:13.\n\n2. **Check if the corresponding \"size (steps)\" for this ratio is 12**:\n   - Once we locate the row with a just ratio of 16:13, examine the cell in the \"size (steps)\" column.\n   - Verify whether its value is 12.\n\nLet's apply these steps to analyze the table:\n\n- Locate the entry where \"just ratio\" is 16:13. According to the data:\n  - Row with index 5 has a just ratio of 16:15, which does not match our requirement.\n  - Row with index 4 has a just ratio of 15:14, which again does not match.\n\n- Proceeding further down:\n  - Row with index 3 has a just ratio of 256:243 and row 2 has 21:20; neither matches.\n  - Finally, row with index 1 has the \"just ratio\" as **16:13**.\n\nNow that we have identified the correct row (index 5):\n- Check the corresponding \"size (steps)\" value in this row. It is noted to be 12.\n\nSince both conditions are met, namely the presence of a just ratio of 16:13 and its size (steps) being 12, the claim holds true based on the table data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe answer to the claim is \"TRUE\". The relevant cells that verify this include:\n- The row where the just ratio matches 16:13.\n- The cell in that same row for the \"size (steps)\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"just ratio\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"size (steps)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
