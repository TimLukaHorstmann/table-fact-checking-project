    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two parts:\n\n1. The venue should be Kardinia Park for all entries except in 1924.\n2. In 1924, the venue should specifically be MCG.\n\nLet's analyze the table based on these conditions:\n\n- **Row 0:** This row contains headers and is not relevant for checking the claim.\n  \n- **Row 1 (Year: 1922):**\n  - Venue: \"mcg\"\n  - This does not satisfy the condition of being Kardinia Park.\n\n- **Row 2 (Year: 1924):**\n  - Venue: \"kardinia park\"\n  - The claim states that in 1924, the venue should be MCG. This contradicts the claim.\n\n- **Rows 3 to 9 (Years: 1932 to 1981):**\n  - All venues are \"mcg\", which do not satisfy the condition of being Kardinia Park except for 1924.\n\n- **Row 10 (Year: 1996) and Row 11 (Year: 1998):**\n  - Venues are \"mcg\", which again do not satisfy the condition of being Kardinia Park.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE because:\n\n- The venue is not Kardinia Park for most entries.\n- In 1924, the venue is listed as Kardinia Park instead of MCG.\n\nThe relevant rows and columns to verify these conditions are:\n\n- Row 1 (Year: 1922), Column \"venue\"\n- Row 2 (Year: 1924), Column \"venue\"\n- Rows 3 to 11, Column \"venue\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
