The number of carries (indicated by the column labeled \"car\").\n2. The longest run or play (\"long\").\n\nWe will find these details by locating James Lynch's entry in the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: James Lynch is listed in the third row of the table.\n  \n- **Column Verification**:\n  - For the number of carries, we check the column labeled \"car\".\n  - For the longest run, we examine the column labeled \"long\".\n\nLet's verify these against the claim:\n\n1. The cell under the \"player\" column for James Lynch (row index 2) confirms he is indeed James Lynch.\n   \n2. In row 2, column \"car\":\n   - The value is **26**, which matches the claim of having 26 carries.\n\n3. In row 2, column \"long\":\n   - The value is **15**, which corresponds to the claim of a long of 15.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied: James Lynch has 26 carries and a longest run of 15.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells that were used to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 2 (third row in zero-based indexing) from column \"car\".\n- Row index 2 from column \"long\".\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"car\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"long\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
