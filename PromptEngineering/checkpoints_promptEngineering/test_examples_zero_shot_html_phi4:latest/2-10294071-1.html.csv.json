    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"dragutin miti\u0107 category have 29.0 tie debut in 1936\", we need to analyze specific aspects of the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Player**: The claim mentions \"dragutin miti\u0107\". We locate him in the table and note his data.\n\n2. **Check Ties Played**: The claim includes a specific number, \"29.0 ties played.\" This corresponds to the column \"ties played\" for dragutin miti\u0107. According to the table, he has 29 ties played.\n\n3. **Verify Debut Year**: The claim states that his debut was in 1936. We check the \"debut\" column for dragutin miti\u0107 and confirm it is indeed 1936.\n\n4. **Relevance of Information**: Both pieces of information (ties played and debut year) are necessary to validate the complete statement within the claim.\n\nBy examining these specific data points, we find that:\n- Dragutin Mitic has exactly 29 ties played.\n- His debut year matches 1936 as stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data for dragutin miti\u0107. The relevant cells from the table are those corresponding to \"ties played\" and \"debut\" for this player's row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"debut\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n1. The number of ties played should be 29.\n2. The debut year for this record should be 1930.\n\nLet's examine each player in the table and check these two conditions:\n\n- **Row Index 0 (\u017eeljko franulovi\u0107):**\n  - Ties Played: 22\n  - Debut Year: 1967\n\n- **Row Index 1 (boro jovanovi\u0107):**\n  - Ties Played: 25\n  - Debut Year: 1959\n\n- **Row Index 2 (franjo kukuljevi\u0107):**\n  - Ties Played: 18\n  - Debut Year: 1930\n  \n- **Row Index 3 (dragutin miti\u0107):**\n  - Ties Played: 29\n  - Debut Year: 1936\n\n- **Row Index 4 (josip palada):**\n  - Ties Played: 37\n  - Debut Year: 1933\n\n- **Row Index 5 (ilija panajotovi\u0107):**\n  - Ties Played: 11\n  - Debut Year: 1953\n\n- **Row Index 6 (nikola pili\u0107):**\n  - Ties Played: 23\n  - Debut Year: 1961\n\n- **Row Index 7 (franjo pun\u010dec):**\n  - Ties Played: 26\n  - Debut Year: 1933\n\n- **Row Index 8 (slobodan \u017eivojinovi\u0107):**\n  - Ties Played: 24\n  - Debut Year: 1981\n\nFrom this examination, we can see that:\n\n- The only player with 29 ties played is dragutin miti\u0107 at row index 3.\n- However, the debut year for dragutin miti\u0107 is 1936, not 1930.\n\nAdditionally, franjo kukuljevi\u0107 has a debut year of 1930 but only played 18 ties. Therefore, no player satisfies both conditions simultaneously: having 29 ties and a debut year of 1930.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- The \"ties played\" column across all rows (to find who has 29 ties).\n- The \"debut\" column corresponding to row index 3 (since it's where the 29 ties were found).\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"debut\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
