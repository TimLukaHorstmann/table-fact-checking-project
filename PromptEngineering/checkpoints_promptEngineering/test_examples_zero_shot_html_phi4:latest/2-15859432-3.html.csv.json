    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about Gilberto Godoy Filho's height being 192 inches, we must first identify which part of the table is relevant and compare it against the claim.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information in the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"gilberto godoy filho be 192 inch tall\".\n   - We need to verify two parts:\n     - The person's name matches \"gilberto godoy filho.\"\n     - His height is listed as \"192 inches.\"\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data in the Table:**\n   - **Row Identification:** \n     - Look for the row where the \"name\" column contains \"gilberto godoy filho\". \n   - **Height Verification:**\n     - Once located, check the \"height\" column in that specific row to see if it matches 192.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Cells from the Table:**\n   - From examining the table:\n     - The player \"gilberto godoy filho\" is listed in the fourth row (index 3, considering zero-based indexing).\n     - In this row, under the \"height\" column, the value is indeed 192.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Data Verification:**\n   - The name matches perfectly.\n   - The height of 192 inches is correctly recorded for him.\n\nGiven that both conditions are satisfied by the data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify this are:\n- Row index 3 (fourth row) and column \"name\" containing \"gilberto godoy filho\".\n- Row index 3 and column \"height\" containing \"192\".\n\nThus, the JSON response reflecting this verification process is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
