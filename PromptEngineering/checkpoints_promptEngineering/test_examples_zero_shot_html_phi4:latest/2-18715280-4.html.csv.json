    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Rumania have same number of gold with east germany,\" we need to compare the values in the 'gold' column for both Romania and East Germany from the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"romania\" (Row Index 2) in the table.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"east germany\" (Row Index 3) in the table.\n\n2. **Extract Gold Medal Counts:**\n   - For Romania, extract the value from the 'gold' column.\n     - From Row 2, 'romania': The number of gold medals is 3.\n   - For East Germany, extract the value from the 'gold' column.\n     - From Row 3, 'east germany': The number of gold medals is 2.\n\n3. **Compare Gold Medal Counts:**\n   - Romania has 3 gold medals.\n   - East Germany has 2 gold medals.\n   - Since these values are not equal (3 \u2260 2), the claim that \"Rumania have same number of gold with east germany\" is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells Identification:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n     - For Romania ('romania'), in the 'gold' column, located at Row Index 2.\n     - For East Germany ('east germany'), in the 'gold' column, located at Row Index 3.\n\nThus, the final determination is that the claim is FALSE, and the relevant cells involved are identified below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
