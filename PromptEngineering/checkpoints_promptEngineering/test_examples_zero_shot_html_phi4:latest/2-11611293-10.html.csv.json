    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"jp maher have a date of 19 - 02 - 2003,\" we need to analyze the table and verify whether the player \"jp maher\" is associated with the specified date.\n\n1. Identify the column related to players: The relevant column in the table for identifying players is labeled as \"player.\"\n\n2. Locate all occurrences of \"jp maher\":\n   - Look through each row under the \"player\" column.\n   - We find that \"jp maher\" appears in one specific row.\n\n3. Find the corresponding date:\n   - Once we locate \"jp maher,\" identify the associated date from the same row under the \"date\" column.\n   - The row containing \"jp maher\" has the following entries: \n     - Player: jp maher\n     - Date: 20 - 02 - 2003\n\n4. Compare the extracted date with the claimed date:\n   - The claim states that \"jp maher\" has a date of 19 - 02 - 2003.\n   - The actual date in the table for \"jp maher\" is 20 - 02 - 2003.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Since the date provided in the table does not match the date specified in the claim, the claim is false.\n\n6. Identify relevant cells:\n   - Row index where \"jp maher\" appears: This is row 3 (considering zero-based indexing).\n   - Relevant columns for verification are \"player\" and \"date.\"\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting the analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
