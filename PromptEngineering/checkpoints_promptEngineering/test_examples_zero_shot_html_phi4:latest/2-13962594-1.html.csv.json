    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze each game listed in the table to identify which games were played at Veterans Stadium and how many times it hosted a game.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that \"the most game be play at the veteran stadium\". This implies that Veterans Stadium was the location for the highest number of games among all the stadiums mentioned.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the column labeled \"game site\" and look for entries corresponding to \"veterans stadium\".\n\n3. **Scan the Table**:\n   - Week 1: Game Site is \"milwaukee county stadium\"\n   - Week 2: Game Site is \"memorial stadium\"\n   - Week 3: Game Site is \"rich stadium\"\n   - Week 4: Game Site is \"miami orange bowl\"\n   - Week 5: Game Site is \"schafer stadium\"\n   - Week 6: Game Site is \"three rivers stadium\"\n   - Week 7: Game Site is \"shea stadium\"\n   - Week 8: Game Site is \"shea stadium\"\n   - Week 9: Game Site is \"shea stadium\"\n   - Week 10: Game Site is \"riverfront stadium\"\n   - Week 11: Game Site is \"shea stadium\"\n   - Week 12: Game Site is \"shea stadium\"\n   - Week 13: Game Site is \"veterans stadium\" (1st occurrence)\n   - Week 14: Game Site is \"shea stadium\"\n\n4. **Counting the Occurrences**:\n   - Veterans Stadium appears once in week 13.\n   - Shea Stadium appears six times (weeks 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Veterans Stadium hosted only one game while Shea Stadium hosted more games than any other stadium listed, the claim that \"the most game be play at the veteran stadium\" is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for verifying this is in row index 12 (week 13) under the column \"game site\".\n\nThus, the correct JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
