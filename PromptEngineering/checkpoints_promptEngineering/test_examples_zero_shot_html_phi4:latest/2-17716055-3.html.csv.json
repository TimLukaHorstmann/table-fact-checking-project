    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table data:\n\n### Breakdown of Claim Components:\n1. **\"no player drawn with 1 of 51 point\":** \n   - This implies we need to check if there is any team that has \"drawn = 1\" and \"points 1 \u2260 51\".\n   \n2. **\"a number of loss larger than 5\":**\n   - Check if the same team (if it exists) also meets this condition, i.e., \"lost > 5\".\n\n### Analysis:\n- Let's go through each row to check for teams with exactly 1 draw (\"drawn = 1\"):\n\n  | Row Index | Team             | Drawn | Points |\n  |-----------|------------------|-------|--------|\n  | 0         | colne dynamoes   | 5     | 55     |\n  | 1         | warrington town  | 6     | 54     |\n  | 2         | cl               | 5     | 51     |\n  | 3         | bolton st        | 6     | 24     |\n  \n- Upon inspection, only \"colne dynamoes\", \"warrington town\", and \"cl\" have a number of draws that are close to one, but none have exactly 1 draw.\n- Since no team has exactly 1 draw (\"drawn = 1\"), the claim is inherently satisfied as it states there should be **no** such player.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe first condition of having a team with exactly 1 draw and not 51 points automatically fulfills the claim because no team meets this criterion. Therefore, we don't need to check further for \"a number of loss larger than 5\" since the primary part of the claim is already satisfied by absence.\n\n### JSON Result:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object shows that the relevant rows for verifying the conditions were primarily focused on checking if any team has exactly one draw and does not have 51 points. The verification concludes that no such condition exists in the table, thus making the claim true.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be no drawn that have point 1 of 49 and a lost larger than 3,\" we need to analyze the table data carefully by examining each row for the relevant conditions:\n\n1. **Points Condition**: We need to identify rows where the \"points 1\" column has the value 49.\n2. **Drawn Condition**: For those identified rows, check if the \"drawn\" column is greater than zero (indicating at least one drawn game).\n3. **Lost Condition**: Finally, for these rows, verify that the \"lost\" column is larger than 3.\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n- Row 0: Points = 55, Drawn = 5, Lost = 4\n- Row 1: Points = 54, Drawn = 6, Lost = 4\n- Row 2: Points = 51, Drawn = 7, Lost = 5\n- Row 3: Points = 47, Drawn = 11, Lost = 12\n- Row 4: Points = 48, Drawn = 0, Lost = 22\n- Row 5: Points = 29, Drawn = 9, Lost = 15\n- Row 6: Points = 29, Drawn = 5, Lost = 17\n- Row 7: Points = 28, Drawn = 12, Lost = 14\n- Row 8: Points = 28, Drawn = 8, Lost = 16\n- Row 9: Points = 24, Drawn = 6, Lost = 19\n- Row 10: Points = 17, Drawn = 7, Lost = 22\n- Row 11: Points = 14, Drawn = 8, Lost = 23\n\nUpon reviewing all rows:\n- No row has \"points 1\" equal to 49.\n- Since there is no such row with points of 49, it automatically satisfies the condition that there are no drawn games with points of 49 and losses greater than 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **TRUE**.
