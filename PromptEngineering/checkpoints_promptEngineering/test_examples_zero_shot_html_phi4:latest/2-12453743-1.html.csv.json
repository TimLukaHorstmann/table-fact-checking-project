    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim: \"the inegi code for mexicali , which have an area of 12,700 km be 2.0,\" we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. The INEGI code for Mexicali.\n2. The area of Mexicali and whether it matches 12,700 km\u00b2.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n- For **Municipality \"mexicali\"** (second row):\n  - The INEGI code is `2`.\n  - The area listed is `13700.00` km\u00b2.\n\nNow let's break down the claim:\n- The claim states that Mexicali should have an area of 12,700 km\u00b2. However, according to the table, its actual area is 13,700 km\u00b2.\n- Despite the incorrect area in the claim, it does correctly state the INEGI code for Mexicali as `2`.\n\nSince one part of the claim (the area) is incorrect while another part (INEGI code) is correct, the overall claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The cell with the INEGI code for Mexicali.\n- The cell with the area for Mexicali.\n\nLet's provide these details in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"inegi code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"area (km2)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
