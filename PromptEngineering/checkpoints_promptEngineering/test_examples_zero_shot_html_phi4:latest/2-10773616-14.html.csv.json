    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"the size of the crowd when essendon be the away team be 25158,\" we need to check two aspects in the provided table:\n\n1. Identify whether Essendon is listed as the away team.\n2. Verify if the crowd size associated with that match is 25,158.\n\nLet's examine the relevant information from the table:\n\n- The column \"away team\" contains names of teams playing as the visitors.\n- The column \"crowd\" indicates the number of attendees for each match on the respective date.\n- We are interested in finding a row where Essendon appears in the \"away team\" column.\n\nUpon reviewing the rows:\n- **Row 5** shows that Essendon is indeed listed as the away team. \n- In the same row, the \"crowd\" value is provided as 28,158.\n\nThus, the claim specifies a crowd size of 25,158 when Essendon is the away team, but the actual recorded crowd size in Row 5 for this match is 28,158. Therefore, the claim does not hold true according to the table's data.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- \"away team\" and \"crowd\" in **Row 5**.\n\nBased on this examination, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The away team's score when Hawthorn was the home team.\n2. Specific away team score being \"9.11 (65)\".\n\n**Step-by-Step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Identify the row where Hawthorn is the home team:**\n   - Look through the table to find where \"hawthorn\" appears in the \"home team\" column.\n   - In this case, it's on the third row:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>melbourne</td>\n       <td>16.14 (110)</td>\n       <td>hawthorn</td>\n       <td>5.3 (33)</td>\n       <td>mcg</td>\n       <td>26708</td>\n       <td>31 july 1954</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the away team's score in that row:**\n   - The \"away team\" column for this row shows \"hawthorn\".\n   - The corresponding \"away team score\" is \"5.3 (33)\".\n\n3. **Compare the identified score with the claimed score:**\n   - The claim states the away team's score should be \"9.11 (65)\".\n   - From our table inspection, we found it to be \"5.3 (33)\" instead.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual away team's score (\"5.3 (33)\") does not match the claimed score (\"9.11 (65)\"), the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells from the Table:**\n\n- The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n  - Row index 2, \"home team\" column to identify Hawthorn as the home team.\n  - Row index 2, \"away team score\" column to verify the actual away team's score.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
