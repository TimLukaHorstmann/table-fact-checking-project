The table does not provide specific data about the number of goals per year, so this part of verification isn't directly possible with the given data.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Locate Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107 in the Table**:\n   - From the table, we find that Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107 is listed as a player with rank 6, and his details are: \n     - Name: \"mirko vu\u010dini\u0107\"\n     - Debut Year: 2000\n     - Goals: 95\n     - Apps: 298\n\n2. **Check His Debut Year**:\n   - Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107's debut year is given as 2000.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107 \"didn't score any goal in a debut year later than 2008.\"\n   - Since his debut year was 2000, which is not later than 2008, this condition is inherently satisfied.\n   - There's no need to check for goals scored specifically in the debut year because he didn\u2019t have a debut year after 2008.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is technically true because Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107 never had a debut year beyond 2008, making it impossible for him to score (or not) in such a scenario.
