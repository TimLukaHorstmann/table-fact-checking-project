    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Greg Monroe be the most recent player to be draft\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to compare the NBA draft years of all players listed.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"nba draft\" column as it provides information about when each player was drafted.\n   \n2. **Extract Information:**\n   - For each player, extract their draft year from the \"nba draft\" column.\n\n3. **Compare Draft Years:**\n   - Compare the draft years of all players to identify which is the most recent.\n\n### Extracted Data:\n\n- **Scotty Hopson:** Undrafted in 2011\n- **Greg Monroe:** 1st round - 7th pick of 2009 draft (Pistons)\n- **Willie Warren:** 2nd round - 54th pick of 2010 draft (Clippers)\n- **Michael Dunigan:** Undrafted in 2011\n- **Tyler Zeller:** 1st round - 17th pick of 2012 draft (Mavericks)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- Greg Monroe was drafted in 2009.\n- Willie Warren was drafted in 2010.\n- Scotty Hopson and Michael Dunigan were undrafted in 2011, but being undrafted means they did not participate in the draft that year.\n- Tyler Zeller was drafted in 2012.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTyler Zeller has the most recent draft year (2012) compared to Greg Monroe's (2009). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
