This is a relevant row because it matches the aggregate score mentioned in the claim.\n6. **Eighth Row:** First qualifying round: MTZ - Ripo Minsk vs \u017dilina with agg 2 - 3.\n7. **Ninth to Eleventh Rows:** Header information for the UEFA Champions League, not match data.\n8. **Twelfth Row:** First qualifying round: BATE Borisov vs Valur with agg 3 - 0.\n9. **Thirteenth Row:** Second qualifying round: Anderlecht vs BATE Borisov with agg 3 - 4.\n10. **Fourteenth Row:** Third qualifying round (note the typo \"thind\" which should be \"third\"): Levski Sofia vs BATE Borisov with agg 1 - 2.\n11. **Fifteenth Row:** Group stage: Real Madrid vs BATE Borisov with agg 3 - 0.\n12. **Sixteenth Row:** Group stage: BATE Borisov vs Juventus with agg 2 - 2.\n13. **Seventeenth Row:** Group stage: Zenit St Petersburg vs BATE Borisov with agg 3 - 1.\n\nFrom this analysis, only the match in the seventh row (Legia Warszawa vs Gomel) has an aggregate score of 4 - 1. No other matches have this aggregate score.\n\nThe claim states there is \"only 1 match in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League with the agg of 4 - 1.\" However, the table does not provide any context that ties these results to the Belarusian Premier League specifically; it only lists UEFA Cup and Champions League qualifiers. Therefore, based on the given table data alone, we cannot confirm or deny the league association for the match in question.\n\nGiven this, if we strictly evaluate whether there is \"only 1\" match with an agg of 4 - 1 in the table, that part is true. However, the claim's additional context about the Belarusian Premier League is unsupported by the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim as it stands (\"there be only 1 match in the 2008 Belarusian Premier League with the agg of 4 - 1\") must be FALSE because there is no evidence connecting this match result to the Belarusian Premier League within the table's scope.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. Shakhtyor Soligorsk was eliminated in the first round of the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\n2. Shakhtyor Soligorsk scored no goals during that elimination.\n\nLet's examine these conditions with respect to the table provided:\n\n### Condition 1: Elimination in the First Round\n- The claim refers to \"the first round of 2008 uefa intertoto cup.\" In the table, we find a row labeled as \"first round\" under the column \"round.\"\n- Shakhtyor Soligorsk is listed as \"team 2\" in this particular match.\n  \n### Condition 2: Scoring No Goals\n- For the same first round entry where Shakhtyor Soligorsk is mentioned as team 2, we see the following:\n  - The aggregate score (\"agg\") for the matchup is \"1 - 5.\"\n  - Individual leg scores are listed as \"1st leg\": \"1 - 2\" and \"2nd leg\": \"0 - 3.\"\n\nFrom these observations:\n- Shakhtyor Soligorsk was indeed eliminated in the first round, as they lost with an aggregate score of 1 to 5.\n- They scored a total of 1 goal (in the first leg) and 0 goals in the second leg. Therefore, the statement that they \"score no goal\" is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that \"Shakhtyor Soligorsk be eliminate and score no goal\" is FALSE because while they were eliminated, they did score a goal in the first leg.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- The relevant cells to verify these conditions are found in row 1 (indexing from zero) of the table under the columns \"round,\" \"team 2,\" \"agg,\" \"1st leg,\" and \"2nd leg.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table provided, we need to break it down into specific components and verify them against the relevant data in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Event**: \"first qualifying round of the 2008 - 09 uefa champions league\"\n2. **Outcome for Valur**: \"be able to win\"\n3. **Progression**: \"proceed to 3 more qualifying rounds\"\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section**:\n   - The claim refers to the \"first qualifying round of the 2008 - 09 uefa champions league\". \n   - In the table, this corresponds to the row where both \"round\" and \"team 1\" are related to this event.\n\n2. **Find Valur's Performance**:\n   - Locate the team \"valur\" in the table.\n   - The relevant row is:  \n     ```\n     <tr>\n       <td>first qualifying round</td>\n       <td>bate borisov</td>\n       <td>3 - 0</td>\n       <td>valur</td>\n       <td>2 - 0</td>\n       <td>1 - 0</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n   - In this row, Valur lost to Bate Borisov with an aggregate score of 3 - 0.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"valor be able to win\". However, the table shows that Valur was defeated by Bate Borisov.\n   - Therefore, Valur did not win in the first qualifying round.\n\n4. **Check for Further Progression**:\n   - Since Valur did not win the first qualifying round, they could not proceed to any further rounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is entirely false based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells from the table that verify this are from the row where \"first qualifying round\" and \"valur\" appear.
