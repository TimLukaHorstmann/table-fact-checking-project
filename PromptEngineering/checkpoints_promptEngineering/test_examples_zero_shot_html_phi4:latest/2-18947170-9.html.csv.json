    "resp": "To verify the claim regarding the \"col (m)\" column of the table, we need to check two specific conditions:\n\n1. The second lowest value in the \"col (m)\" column should be 10.\n2. The second highest value in the \"col (m)\" column should be 1642.\n\nFirst, let's extract and sort all values from the \"col (m)\" column to identify these positions correctly.\n\n### Extracted Values for \"col (m)\"\n- Mount Kilimanjaro: 10\n- Mount Kenya: 1374\n- Mount Meru: 1395\n- Mount Elgon: 1863\n- Mulanje Massif: 683\n- Kimhandu: 532\n- Mount Satima: 1920\n- Mount Hanang: 1370\n- Loolmalassin: 1642\n- Gelai Peak: 1018\n- Mount Moroto: 1265\n- Kitumbeine Hill: 1088\n- Chepunyal Hills: 1575\n- Mount Namuli: 662\n- Shengena: 714\n- Sungwi: 570\n- Mount Kadam: 1373\n- Mtorwi: 1292\n- Mount Kulal: 743\n- Karenga: 750\n- Mount Ng'iro: 1347\n\n### Sorted Values for \"col (m)\"\n1. 10 (Mount Kilimanjaro)\n2. 562 (Sungwi)\n3. 662 (Mount Namuli)\n4. 714 (Shengena)\n5. 743 (Mount Kulal)\n6. 750 (Karenga)\n7. 532 (Kimhandu)\n8. 683 (Mulanje Massif)\n9. 1018 (Gelai Peak)\n10. 1088 (Kitumbeine Hill)\n11. 1265 (Mount Moroto)\n12. 1292 (Mtorwi)\n13. 1347 (Mount Ng'iro)\n14. 1370 (Mount Hanang)\n15. 1373 (Mount Kadam)\n16. 1374 (Mount Kenya)\n17. 1395 (Mount Meru)\n18. 1575 (Cepunyal Hills)\n19. 1863 (Mount Elgon)\n20. 1920 (Mount Satima)\n\n### Evaluating the Claim\n\n1. **Second Lowest Value**: From the sorted list, the second lowest value is 562, which corresponds to Sungwi. However, in the table, the actual value for Sungwi is 570. This discrepancy means that the listed values were not initially correctly ordered by the extracted data. Correcting this gives:\n   - Second Lowest: 532 (Kimhandu)\n\n2. **Second Highest Value**: From the sorted list, the second highest value is 1863, which corresponds to Mount Elgon. The actual second highest value in the table is indeed 1642, corresponding to Loolmalassin.\n\nThe claim states that the second lowest should be 10 and the second highest should be 1642. Based on our analysis:\n- Second Lowest: 532 (not 10)\n- Second Highest: 1642 (correct)\n\nSince the condition for the second lowest value is not met, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are those corresponding to the second lowest and second highest values in the \"col (m)\" column:\n- Row index 1 (\"col (m)\": 532) for Kimhandu.\n- Row index 8 (\"col (m)\": 1642) for Loolmalassin.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"col (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Uganda's peaks and prominence, we need to check two specific conditions from the provided HTML table:\n\n1. Determine if there are more than three peaks listed for Uganda.\n2. Verify if the highest prominence recorded for a peak in Uganda is 2458 meters.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows of the table concerning Uganda:\n\n- **Mount Elgon**\n  - Country: Uganda\n  - Elevation (m): 4321\n  - Prominence (m): 2458\n  - Col (m): 1863\n\n- **Mount Moroto**\n  - Country: Uganda\n  - Elevation (m): 3083\n  - Prominence (m): 1818\n  - Col (m): 1265\n\n- **Mount Kadam**\n  - Country: Uganda\n  - Elevation (m): 3063\n  - Prominence (m): 1690\n  - Col (m): 1373\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Number of Peaks for Uganda:** \n   - The table lists three peaks associated with Uganda:\n     - Mount Elgon\n     - Mount Moroto\n     - Mount Kadam\n\n2. **Highest Prominence in Uganda:**\n   - For Mount Elgon, the prominence is 2458 meters.\n   - For Mount Moroto, the prominence is 1818 meters.\n   - For Mount Kadam, the prominence is 1690 meters.\n\nThe highest recorded prominence for a peak in Uganda according to the table is indeed 2458 meters (Mount Elgon).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim states that Uganda has more than three peaks listed. However, only three peaks are listed for Uganda.\n- The claim also correctly states that the highest prominence for a peak in Uganda is 2458 meters.\n\nSince one part of the claim (having more than three peaks) is false, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nFor the analysis, we focused on:\n- Rows corresponding to Mount Elgon, Mount Moroto, and Mount Kadam.\n- The \"country\" column to confirm they are from Uganda.\n- The \"prominence (m)\" column to determine prominence values.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prominence (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"prominence (m)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"prominence (m)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
