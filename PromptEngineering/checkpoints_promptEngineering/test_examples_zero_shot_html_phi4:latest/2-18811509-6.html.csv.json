    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about Tom Watson's score, we need to verify if his total score is indeed 206 as stated in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We locate Tom Watson in the table by looking at the \"player\" column.\n   - The row where Tom Watson is mentioned is Row 0 (since table rows typically start from index 0).\n\n2. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - In Row 0, under the \"score\" column, it shows: \"65 + 70 + 71 = 206\".\n   - This calculation confirms that his total score is indeed 206.\n\n3. **Additional Verification**:\n   - Although not necessary for verifying the claim directly, we can also look at the \"to par\" column in Row 0 to ensure consistency with typical tournament scoring. It shows a value of \"4\", which aligns with common golf scoring conventions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table confirms that Tom Watson's score is 206.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Row index 0 and column name \"score\" are relevant to verify the total score of Tom Watson.\n   - Optionally, row index 0 and column name \"to par\" can be considered for additional context.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
