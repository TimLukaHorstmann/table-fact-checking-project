The row with \"rank\" equal to 1 should have \"country\" as \"portugal.\"\n2. There are no other ranks or countries that contradict this condition.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows and columns in the table:\n\n- **Row 0 (Rank = 1):**\n  - Check the \"country\" column: It contains \"portugal,\" which matches the claim.\n  - Verify the \"rank\" column: The rank is indeed 1, supporting the claim.\n\nThe claim does not require us to check other rows for this particular statement since it only involves confirming that Portugal's rowers are ranked number 1. However, let's ensure no discrepancies:\n\n- **Other Rows (Rank = 2 to 6):**\n  - None of these should have \"portugal\" in the \"country\" column if the claim is true.\n  - In all other rows, the \"country\" values do not match \"portugal,\" confirming that only Portugal's rowers are ranked number 1.\n\nGiven this analysis, both conditions for the claim are satisfied.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check each relevant condition specified in it against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. \"when rank be more than 4\"\n   - This means we should consider rows where `rank > 4`. These are ranks 5 and 6.\n   \n2. \"and country be japan\"\n   - This condition requires that the `country` column must have the value \"japan\".\n   \n3. \"for note show sc / d\"\n   - The `notes` column should have the value \"sc / d\".\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **Row with Rank 5:**\n  - `rank`: 5\n  - `rowers`: Devender kumar khandwal, manjeet singh\n  - `country`: india\n  - `time`: 7:02.06\n  - `notes`: sc / d\n\n  The country is \"india\", not \"japan\". This row does not satisfy the second condition.\n\n- **Row with Rank 6:**\n  - `rank`: 6\n  - `rowers`: Jang kang-eun, Kim hong-kyun\n  - `country`: south korea\n  - `time`: 7:12.17\n  - `notes`: sc / d\n\n  The country is \"south korea\", not \"japan\". This row does not satisfy the second condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim requires that for ranks greater than 4, there should be a row where both the country is \"japan\" and notes are \"sc / d\". There are no such rows meeting all these conditions. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this, we consider the cells in columns `rank`, `country`, and `notes` for rows 5 and 6:\n\n- Row index 4 (Rank 5):\n  - `row_index`: 4\n  - `column_name`: \"rank\", \"country\", \"notes\"\n  \n- Row index 5 (Rank 6):\n  - `row_index`: 5\n  - `column_name`: \"rank\", \"country\", \"notes\"\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"notes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"notes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
