The games are listed with their respective dates, and all entries fall within March based on the date column.\n\n2. **Extract High Points Information**:\n   - Game 61 (March 1): Chris Bosh (28)\n   - Game 62 (March 3): Andrea Bargnani, Chris Bosh (25)\n   - Game 63 (March 6): Chris Bosh (34)\n   - Game 64 (March 8): Chris Bosh (30)\n   - Game 65 (March 11): Andrea Bargnani (21)\n   - Game 66 (March 13): Chris Bosh (27)\n   - Game 67 (March 15): Not specified\n   - Game 68 (March 20): Chris Bosh (35)\n   - Game 69 (March 22): Chris Bosh (16)\n   - Game 70 (March 25): Andrea Bargnani (23)\n   - Game 71 (March 27): Chris Bosh (21)\n   - Game 72 (March 29): Chris Bosh (31)\n\n3. **Analyze High Points**:\n   - For each game, check if Chris Bosh has the highest points or shares the highest points with another player.\n   - Compare the high points values for games where Chris Bosh is mentioned.\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum High Points**:\n   - The maximum high points achieved by any player in March is 35 (Game 68).\n   - Chris Bosh achieves this score in Game 68.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Chris Bosh has the highest individual score of 35 points, which no other player surpasses.\n   - In cases where he shares the high point total with another player (e.g., Game 62), his contribution is still significant and often equals or exceeds others' contributions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"Chris Bosh has the most high points in March\" is true.

The key column to look at is \"score\", as it indicates whether the Raptors won (denoted by 'w') or lost (denoted by 'l'). We also need to verify that these games occurred within the specified date range.\n\nLet's examine each relevant game in the table:\n\n1. **March 1**: \n   - Team: Dallas\n   - Score: l 98 - 109 (ot)\n   - Result: Loss\n\n2. **March 3**:\n   - Team: Houston\n   - Score: l 97 - 107 (ot)\n   - Result: Loss\n\n3. **March 6**:\n   - Team: Miami\n   - Score: l 102 - 108 (ot)\n   - Result: Loss\n\n4. **March 8**: \n   - There is no game on March 8 in the table.\n\n5. **March 9**: \n   - There is no game on March 9 in the table.\n\n6. **March 10**: \n   - There is no game on March 10 in the table.\n\n7. **March 11**: \n   - There is no game on March 11 in the table.\n\n8. **March 12**: \n   - There is no game on March 12 in the table.\n\n9. **March 13**:\n   - There is no game on March 13 in the table.\n\nBy examining these entries, we can confirm that during the first 13 days of March (from March 1 to March 13), the Raptors played and lost all three listed games without any wins or missing dates within this range affecting the outcome.

We will then count the number of wins within this period.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: \n   - The rows that fall between March 1st and March 13th are:\n     - Row index 0 (March 1)\n     - Row index 1 (March 3)\n     - Row index 2 (March 6)\n     - Row index 3 (March 8)\n     - Row index 4 (March 11)\n     - Row index 5 (March 13)\n\n2. **Examine the 'score' Column**:\n   - For each of these rows, check if the game was a win or loss.\n   - The score format \"W-L\" indicates a win with \"W\" and a loss with \"L\".\n\n3. **Count Wins**:\n   - Row index 0: Score is \"L\", indicating a loss.\n   - Row index 1: Score is \"L\", indicating a loss.\n   - Row index 2: Score is \"L\", indicating a loss.\n   - Row index 3: Score is \"L\", indicating a loss.\n   - Row index 4: Score is \"L\", indicating a loss.\n   - Row index 5: Score is \"W\", indicating a win.\n\nThus, there is only one win (Row index 5) from March 1st to March 13th.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the Raptors won only once during this period. Based on our analysis of the table, this statement is true. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells are in the 'score' column for rows corresponding to the dates from March 1st through March 13th.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Toronto play Charlotte only 1 time,\" we need to identify all instances in the table where Toronto played against Charlotte and count them.\n\n**Steps to Verify:**\n\n1. Identify the relevant column for checking games played by Toronto:\n   - The \"team\" column indicates which team Toronto is playing against or is mentioned as playing. \n   - In this context, a game entry will include either \"Charlotte\" in the \"team\" column if Toronto is at home or \"Toronto\" in the \"score\" column if they are away.\n\n2. Examine each row to find matches involving Charlotte:\n   - Go through each row and check both the \"team\" column and the \"score\" column for mentions of \"Charlotte.\"\n\n**Relevant Rows:**\n\n- **Row 7 (Game 68):**\n  - Date: March 16\n  - Team: Charlotte\n  - Score: l 86 - 112 (ot)\n  - This entry indicates a game against Charlotte.\n\n- **Row 8 (Game 69):**\n  - Date: March 20\n  - Team: Charlotte\n  - Score: l 89 - 102 (ot)\n  - Another match against Charlotte is indicated here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nToronto played against Charlotte twice according to the table, as identified in rows 7 and 8.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the raptor record remain above 500 for the month of March\" is true or false, we need to analyze the \"record\" column in the table for all entries corresponding to games played in March. The relevant data points are:\n\n1. A team's \"record\" is expressed as \"wins-losses.\" We need to calculate the total number of wins (the first value) and check if this number remains above 500 during any game listed.\n\n2. The claim specifies the month of March, so we focus on games played from March 1st through March 31st.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table with a date in March:\n\n- **Row 0 (March 1):** \n  - Record: \"23 - 38\"\n  - Wins = 23\n\n- **Row 1 (March 3):**\n  - Record: \"23 - 39\"\n  - Wins = 23\n\n- **Row 2 (March 20):**\n  - Record: \"24 - 44\"\n  - Wins = 24\n\n- **Row 3 (March 22):**\n  - Record: \"25 - 45\"\n  - Wins = 25\n\n- **Row 4 (March 25):**\n  - Record: \"26 - 45\"\n  - Wins = 26\n\n- **Row 5 (March 27):**\n  - Record: \"27 - 45\"\n  - Wins = 27\n\n- **Row 6 (March 29):**\n  - Record: \"28 - 45\"\n  - Wins = 28\n\nFrom this examination, we can see that the number of wins for the Raptors in March does not exceed 28 at any point.
