Identify all rows that represent entries in the contest.\n2. Check the \"language\" column to see which entries are in French.\n3. Count how many entries are in French.\n\nNow, let's examine each row:\n\n- Row index 0: The language is Italian (Domenico Modugno).\n- Row index 1: The language is Dutch (Corry Brokken).\n- Row index 2: The language is French (Andr\u00e9 Claveau).\n- Row index 3: The language is French (Solange Berry).\n- Row index 4: The language is Swedish (Alice Babs).\n- Row index 5: The language is Danish (Raquel Rastenni).\n- Row index 6: The language is French (Fud Leclerc).\n- Row index 7: The language is German (Margot Hielscher).\n- Row index 8: The language is German (Liane Auguin).\n- Row index 9: The languages are German and Italian (Lys Assia).\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- Entries in French:\n  - Row index 2\n  - Row index 3\n  - Row index 6\n\nThere are exactly three entries that are in French.\n\nAccording to the claim, there should be \"more than 3\" entries in French.
