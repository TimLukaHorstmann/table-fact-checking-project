The number of tries scored by \"caerau ely rfc\" should be 21.\n2. Their total points should be 22.\n\nLet's examine the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- **Row**: \"caerau ely rfc\"\n  - **Column \"tries for\"**: This column contains the number of tries scored by each team. For \"caerau ely rfc\", this value is listed as 21.\n  - **Column \"points\"**: This column shows the total points accumulated by each team. For \"caerau ely rfc\", the total points are 22.\n\nNow, let's match these details with the claim:\n\n- The claim states that \"caerau ely rfc score 21 try,\" which matches the information in the table where they scored 21 tries.\n- It also states they have a point total of 22, which is consistent with the points listed as 22.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n1. Row corresponding to \"caerau ely rfc\" (row index 7), column \"tries for\".\n2. Row corresponding to \"caerau ely rfc\" (row index 7), column \"points\".\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tries for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim about \"caerau ely rfc,\" we must check two parts of it: their losing bonus and the number of drawn games they have.\n\n1. **Losing Bonus**: The claim states that \"caerau ely rfc\" has a losing point (bonus) of 4. We need to identify which column in the table corresponds to this information. In the provided table, the relevant column is labeled as \"losing bonus.\"\n\n2. **Drawn Games**: The claim also mentions that they have drawn 12 games. We must find the number of drawn games for \"caerau ely rfc\" from the table. The corresponding column here is labeled as \"drawn.\"\n\nNow we locate \"caerau ely rfc\" in the table:\n\n- The club's name appears on the last row (index 8) before the headers repeat, which indicates that the actual data starts at index 1.\n- For \"caerau ely rfc,\" located at row index 8, we check:\n  - **Column**: \"losing bonus\" should have a value of 4. The cell indeed shows 4.\n  - **Column**: \"drawn\" should have a value of 12, but the table indicates 0 drawn games for \"caerau ely rfc.\"\n\nThe first condition (losing bonus of 4) is satisfied, while the second one (12 drawn games) is not. Therefore, since both conditions must be true for the entire claim to be correct and only one part fails, the overall claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For \"losing bonus\" of 4: Row index 8, Column name \"losing bonus\"\n- For drawn games: Row index 8, Column name \"drawn\"\n\nNow we return the result in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losing bonus\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
