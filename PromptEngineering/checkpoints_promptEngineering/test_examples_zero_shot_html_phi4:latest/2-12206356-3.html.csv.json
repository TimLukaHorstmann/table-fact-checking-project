This is found at `row_index` 8.\n\n2. **Record Verification**:\n   - Check the \"Record\" column for `row_index` 8 to see if it matches \"28 - 29\". It does match.\n\n3. **Loss Verification**:\n   - Look at the \"Win/Loss\" column for `row_index` 8 to confirm that Mulholland (5 - 6) is listed as a loss. This condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Opponent Verification**:\n   - Verify the \"Opponent\" column for `row_index` 8 to ensure it lists the Yankees. The opponent is indeed the Yankees.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are met based on the table data, so the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Win/Loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
