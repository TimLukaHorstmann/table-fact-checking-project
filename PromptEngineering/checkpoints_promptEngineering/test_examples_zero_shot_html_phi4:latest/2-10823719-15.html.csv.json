From the table, rows with indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 have this date.\n  \n- **Venue Check**: Among these rows, we look for the venue \"VFL Park\". Only row index 4 has \"VFL Park\".\n\n- **Away Team Check**: In row index 4, check if the away team is \"Geelong\". It matches.\n\n- **Away Team Score Check**: Finally, in row index 4, verify that the away team score is \"11.12 (78)\". This also matches.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by row index 4. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 4, column \"away team\"\n- Row index 4, column \"away team score\"\n- Row index 4, column \"venue\"\n- Row index 4, column \"date\"\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
