Identify if there is an episode written by Elaine Ko.\n2. Confirm if Michael Spiller directed that particular episode.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Identify Episode Written by Elaine Ko:**\n   - We look for entries in the column \"Written By\" where the name \"Elaine ko\" appears.\n   - From the table, we find this occurs in row 38 (considering the first valid index as 0), for episode 15 titled \"princess party.\"\n\n2. **Check Director of the Episode Written by Elaine Ko:**\n   - Now that we know Elaine Ko wrote episode 15, we check the column \"Directed By\" for the same row.\n   - In row 38, \"Directed By\" is listed as Michael Spiller.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n- Elaine Ko wrote episode 15 (\"princess party\").\n- Michael Spiller directed this episode.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data. The relevant cells to verify this information correspond to row 38 (index 38 when starting from zero) in both the \"Written By\" and \"Directed By\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"Written By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
