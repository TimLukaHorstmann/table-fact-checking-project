    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Kazakhstan have 0 gold,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the provided table.\n\nThe table is structured with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total. We focus on two aspects of the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Kazakhstan's Entry**: We need to locate the row where the \"nation\" column specifies \"Kazakhstan (kaz).\" This corresponds to row 5 in the table.\n\n2. **Check the Gold Count for Kazakhstan**: Once we have identified Kazakhstan's entry, we look at the value under the \"gold\" column for that row. According to the table, Kazakhstan has a gold count of 0.\n\nThus, both conditions needed to verify the claim are met:\n- The nation is correctly identified as \"Kazakhstan (kaz).\"\n- The gold count for Kazakhstan is indeed 0.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table for this verification are:\n- Row index 5, Column \"nation\" with value \"Kazakhstan (kaz)\"\n- Row index 5, Column \"gold\" with value 0\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze it step by step:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n- **\"gold be not smaller than zero for the nation of kazakhstan (kaz)\"**: This part of the claim states that the gold medal count for Kazakhstan should be at least 0. We need to check the \"gold\" column in the row corresponding to Kazakhstan.\n  \n- **\"so the total be more than zero\"**: This implies a logical connection where if Kazakhstan's gold count is not smaller than zero, it contributes positively (at least zero) to the total count of medals.\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Kazakhstan's Gold Count**:\n   - Find Kazakhstan in the table: Row 5 has \"kazakhstan (kaz)\".\n   - Check the value under the \"gold\" column for Kazakhstan: It is 0.\n   - Since 0 is not smaller than zero, this condition is satisfied.\n\n2. **Impact on Total**:\n   - The total row at the bottom shows that the overall count of gold medals is 14.\n   - Each nation's contribution to the total \"gold\" column adds up to this number.\n   - Kazakhstan contributes 0 gold medals, which does not reduce the total below zero.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Both conditions in the claim are satisfied: Kazakhstan has a non-negative gold count (0), and the overall total is greater than zero (14).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell for verifying Kazakhstan's gold count is at row index 5, column \"gold\".\n- The relevant cells for verifying the total medals are in the last row under columns \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\", and \"total\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
