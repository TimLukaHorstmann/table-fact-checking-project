    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Jakob Hlasek has only played in 4 tennis tournaments in the 1990s,\" we need to analyze the table for entries where Jakob Hlasek is involved, specifically looking at the dates of the tournaments to confirm they fall within the 1990s. The relevant column here is the \"Date\" column, as it provides the necessary information about when each tournament took place.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n1. **Row Index 0**: Date - 10/94, Jakob Hlasek involved (column: Date)\n2. **Row Index 5**: Date - 03/95, Jakob Hlasek involved (column: Date)\n3. **Row Index 8**: Date - 04/96, Jakob Hlasek involved (column: Date)\n4. **Row Index 11**: Date - 05/96, Jakob Hlasek involved (column: Date)\n\nThese are the only rows where Jakob Hlasek is associated with a tournament date within the decade from 1990 to 1999.\n\nThus, Jakob Hlasek participated in exactly four tournaments during the 1990s according to the data provided. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the evidence.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
