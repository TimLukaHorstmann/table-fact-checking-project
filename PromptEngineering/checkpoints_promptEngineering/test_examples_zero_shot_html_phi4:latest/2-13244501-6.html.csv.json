    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions based on the table data:\n\n1. The lowest attendance of 9115 occurs when the record is \"25 - 21 - 8\".\n2. The highest attendance of 15154 occurs when the record is \"25 - 20 - 8\".\n\nLet's break down each condition and check against the relevant rows in the table.\n\n### Condition 1: Lowest Attendance\n\n- **Claimed lowest attendance**: 9115\n- **Record for this attendance**: \"25 - 21 - 8\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The row with an attendance of 9115 is:\n  - Date: February 21\n  - Record: 25 - 23 - 9\n\nThis does not match the claimed record of \"25 - 21 - 8\". Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Condition 2: Highest Attendance\n\n- **Claimed highest attendance**: 15154\n- **Record for this attendance**: \"25 - 20 - 8\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The row with an attendance of 15154 is:\n  - Date: February 11\n  - Record: 25 - 20 - 8\n\nThis matches the claimed record. Therefore, this part of the claim is true.\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the entire claim to be considered true and one condition is false, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- For the lowest attendance check:\n  - Row with date \"February 21\" (index 10): Attendance = 9115, Record = \"25 - 23 - 9\"\n  \n- For the highest attendance check:\n  - Row with date \"February 11\" (index 5): Attendance = 15154, Record = \"25 - 20 - 8\"\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
