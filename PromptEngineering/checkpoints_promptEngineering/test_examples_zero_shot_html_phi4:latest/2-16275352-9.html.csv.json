    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding the record against the Atlanta Hawks, we need to identify and analyze specific entries in the table related to games played against this team.\n\nThe claim states: \"the record for all game play against the atlanta hawk be 13 - 63\". This means we are looking for games where the opponent is \"atlanta hawks\" and verifying that their record should be 13 wins and 63 losses, which equates to a total of 76 games (13 + 63).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We need to look for any row where the opponent is \"atlanta hawks\".\n\n2. **Examine Identified Row(s)**:\n   - Check the \"record\" column in these rows to verify if it matches the claim.\n\n3. **Check Game Count Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that the game count and record are consistent with a total of 76 games, i.e., 13 wins and 63 losses.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Row 4**: This row lists \"atlanta hawks\" as the opponent.\n  - Date: March 12\n  - Home/Away/Neutral (H/A/N): H\n  - Score: 107 - 119\n  - Record: 13 - 63\n\n### Verification:\n\n- There is only one game against the Atlanta Hawks in this table, on March 12, with a record of 13 wins and 63 losses.\n- The claim suggests that after all games played against them, the record should be 13 - 63. Since there's only one entry for \"atlanta hawks\", it is consistent with having played enough games to reach such a record.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table as there is one entry where the opponent is \"atlanta hawks\" and the record is indeed 13 - 63. Therefore, the claim is TRUE based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
