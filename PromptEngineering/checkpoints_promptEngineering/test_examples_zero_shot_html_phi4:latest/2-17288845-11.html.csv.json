    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"game 4.0 , series 1 - 4 be on april 25\", we need to check the specific details provided in the table against each part of the claim.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n\n1. **Game Identifier**: The claim specifies \"game 4.0\". In the table, games are identified by integers (1 through 5) without any decimal point. Therefore, \"game 4.0\" should be understood as game number 4.\n\n2. **Series Status**: The claim mentions a series score of \"1 - 4\". This means that after game 4, the series should have one win for Dallas and four wins for their opponent.\n\n3. **Date**: The claim states the event occurs on \"april 25\".\n\n### Verification Against Table:\n\n- **Game Identifier**:\n  - Locate row with `game` equal to 4.\n  - Relevant cell: `row_index = 3`, `column_name = game`.\n\n- **Series Status**:\n  - Check if the `series` column in row 4 is \"1 - 4\".\n  - Relevant cell: `row_index = 3`, `column_name = series`.\n\n- **Date**:\n  - Verify that the `date` column in row 4 is \"april 25\".\n  - Relevant cell: `row_index = 3`, `column_name = date`.\n\n### Checking Each Condition:\n\n- **Game Number**: The fourth game (game number 4) corresponds to `row_index = 3`.\n  \n- **Series Score**: In `row_index = 3`, the series column shows \"1 - 3\", not \"1 - 4\".\n\n- **Date**: In `row_index = 3`, the date is indeed \"april 25\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is partially correct regarding game number and date, but incorrect about the series score. Therefore, the claim as a whole is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
