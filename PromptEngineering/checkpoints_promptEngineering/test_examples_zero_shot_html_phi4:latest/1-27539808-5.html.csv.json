    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, we need to verify if both conditions mentioned in the claim match with the data from a specific row of the table.\n\n**Claim:** \"wells fargo center (19684) be the location and attendance total from the game on december 1\"\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n1. The game took place at \"Wells Fargo Center\".\n2. The attendance for this game was \"19684\".\n3. This occurred in \"December\" with a date matching December 1.\n\nNow, let's go through the table to verify these details:\n\n- **Column Relevance:**\n  - \"game\": Not directly needed to identify the specific match but helps confirm it's unique.\n  - \"december\": We need this column to find games played on December 1st.\n  - \"location / attendance\": This is where we'll check both location and attendance.\n\n- **Row Analysis:**\n  - Row 0 (Game ID = 26):\n    - \"December\" value is 1, indicating it was the first game in December.\n    - \"Location / Attendance\" is \"Wells Fargo Center (19684)\" which matches both conditions of being held at Wells Fargo Center and having an attendance of 19684.\n\nSince row 0 satisfies all conditions laid out by the claim:\n- The location and date match exactly with what's stated in the claim.\n- Thus, the entire claim is verified as TRUE based on this row alone.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- From Row 0, we need to extract information from two specific columns: \"december\" for the date condition and \"location / attendance\" for both location and number of attendees.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object representing our conclusion would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "game 32 have the highest number of point , which be 45",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of the claim:\n\n1. Identify if game 32 indeed has a points value of 45.\n2. Check if this is the highest number of points across all games listed in the table.\n\nLet's evaluate these claims using the data from the table provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation\n\n#### Checking Points for Game 32\n- Locate row with `game` value \"32\".\n- In that row, check the `points` column to confirm it has a value of \"45\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row index 7 corresponds to game 32.\n- The points for this game are listed as 45.\n\n#### Verifying If This Is the Highest Number of Points\n- Examine all rows in the `points` column to find the maximum value.\n  \nThe points for each game are as follows:\n\n1. Game 26: 34\n2. Game 27: 36\n3. Game 28: 38\n4. Game 29: 39\n5. Game 30: 41\n6. Game 31: 43\n7. **Game 32: 45** (our focus)\n8. Game 33: 47\n9. Game 34: 49\n10. Game 35: 49\n11. Game 36: 49\n12. Game 37: 51\n\nFrom this list, it is evident that game 37 has the highest points value of 51.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that game 32 has the highest number of points at 45, which is not true as game 37 has more points (51).\n\nTherefore, the correct evaluation of the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\nNow let's specify the relevant cells:\n\n- The cell for game 32 and its points value to verify it matches the claim.\n- All points values to determine if game 32 indeed has the highest.\n\nThus, the JSON response should include:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
