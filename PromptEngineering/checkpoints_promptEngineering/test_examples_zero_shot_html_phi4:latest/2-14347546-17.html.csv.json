    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Dov Grumet-Morris was the 3rd American pick in the 2002 draft,\" we need to analyze specific information from the provided table regarding the round number, player name, nationality, and the sequence of picks.\n\nThe relevant conditions are:\n1. The player must be \"Dov Grumet-Morris.\"\n2. The player's nationality should be \"United States\" (implied by being an American).\n3. We need to determine if he was indeed the 3rd American pick in the draft order.\n\nFirst, let's locate Dov Grumet-Morris in the table:\n\n- Row index 4 contains:\n  - `round`: 5\n  - `player`: \"dov grumet - morris\"\n  - `nationality`: \"united states\"\n\nNow we verify if there are any other American players picked before him, and how many total American players were selected up to his pick:\n\n1. **Checking all players in earlier rounds**:\n   - Row index 0 (`round` 1): Joni Pitkanen, `nationality`: Finland\n   - Row index 1 (`round` 4): Rosario Ruggeri, `nationality`: Canada\n   - Row index 2 (`round` 4): Konstantin Baranov, `nationality`: Russia\n\nNo American players are mentioned in rounds 1 and 4. Dov Grumet-Morris is the first American player picked according to this table.\n\nSince there were no other American picks before him, Dov Grumet-Morris was not the 3rd but rather the 1st American pick in this draft sequence as per the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
