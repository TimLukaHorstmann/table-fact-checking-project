    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"78 - 84 be not the highest record in September\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided:\n\n1. The column of interest for this task is the last one labeled with records like \"71 - 83\", \"72 - 84\", etc., which represents the win-loss record at various points throughout September.\n\n2. Our goal is to find out if there exists any row in September where the win-loss record exceeds \"78 - 84\".\n\n3. Starting from the top of the table, we will examine each entry in this specific column for dates falling within September:\n\n   - **September 1**: Record = \"71 - 83\"\n   - **September 2**: Record = \"72 - 84\"\n   - **September 3**: Record = \"73 - 84\"\n   - **September 4**: Record = \"74 - 84\"\n   - **September 5**: Record = \"75 - 84\"\n   - **September 6**: Record = \"76 - 84\"\n   - **September 7**: Record = \"77 - 84\"\n   - **September 8**: Record = \"78 - 84\"\n\n4. After the row for September 8 (row index 9), no subsequent rows in September have a win-loss record higher than \"78 - 84\":\n\n   - **September 9**: Record = \"79 - 84\"\n   - **September 10**: Record = \"80 - 84\"\n   - **September 11**: Record = \"81 - 84\"\n   - **September 12**: Record = \"82 - 84\"\n   - **September 13**: Record = \"83 - 84\"\n\n5. Since no record surpasses \"78 - 84\" in September, the statement \"78 - 84 be not the highest record in September\" is indeed true.\n\n6. The relevant rows for this evaluation are those from September 1 to September 13 (row indices 0 through 12) in the win-loss column.\n\nHere's the JSON object containing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"last\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"last\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
