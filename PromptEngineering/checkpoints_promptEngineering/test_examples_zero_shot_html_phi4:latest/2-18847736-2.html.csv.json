    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Baltimore Colt score more on Nov 11 against the Miami Dolphins than on Nov 25,\" we need to examine two specific parts of the table:\n\n1. The opponent's points for the game on November 11.\n2. The opponent's points for the game on November 25.\n\nThe table provides these values in the \"opponents\" column, which indicates the points scored by the opposing team in each game. Let's find and compare these specific cells:\n\n- **November 11 Game:**\n  - Row corresponding to this date is row index 10 (as per the order of games listed).\n  - The opponent on this date was \"Baltimore Colts.\"\n  - From the table, under column \"opponents,\" Baltimore scored 0 points against Miami Dolphins on November 11.\n\n- **November 25 Game:**\n  - Row corresponding to this date is row index 12.\n  - The opponent on this date was again \"Baltimore Colts.\"\n  - From the table, under column \"opponents,\" Baltimore scored 24 points against Miami Dolphins on November 25.\n\nNow that we have the relevant data:\n- On Nov 11, the Baltimore Colts scored 0 points.\n- On Nov 25, the Baltimore Colts scored 24 points.\n\nThe claim states that the Baltimore Colt scored more on Nov 11 than on Nov 25. Since they actually scored fewer points (0) on Nov 11 compared to Nov 25 (24), this statement is false.\n\nWe need to include these relevant cells in our JSON response:\n\n- For November 11: Row index 10, column \"opponents.\"\n- For November 25: Row index 12, column \"opponents.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
