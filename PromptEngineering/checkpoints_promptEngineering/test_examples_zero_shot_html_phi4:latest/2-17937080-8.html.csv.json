    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on two main aspects: identifying the player at rank 11 and examining their \"goals per match\" value.\n\n1. **Identify Player at Rank 11**: \n   - The table indicates that the player at rank 11 is \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\".\n\n2. **Check \"Goals per Match\" for this Player**:\n   - Locate the row with rank 11, which corresponds to \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\".\n   - Check the \"goals per match\" value for this player.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - The claim states that the player at rank 11 has fewer than 1.237 goals per match.\n   - From the table, we see that \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\" has a \"goals per match\" of 1.000.\n   - Compare this value to 1.237: \\(1.000 < 1.237\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The condition in the claim is satisfied as 1.000 is indeed less than 1.237.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification include:\n- The row where \"alfredo di st\u00e9fano\" appears (rank 11), specifically checking his \"goals per match\".\n- Additionally, the value 1.237 from the claim itself needs to be considered in context.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
