    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant portions of the table concerning Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy's rebounds against Miami.\n\n**Steps for Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We are looking for games played against \"miami\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 5 (game 77) corresponds to a game against miami with a loss score of 83-89.\n     - Row 10 (game 81) also corresponds to a game against miami with a loss score of 99-103.\n\n2. **Extract Rebound Information:**\n   - For each relevant row, we check the \"high rebounds\" column:\n     - In row 5 (game 77), Michael Bradley is noted as having 8 rebounds.\n     - In row 10 (game 81), Jerome Williams has 17 rebounds; no mention of either Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy.\n\n3. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\".\n   - We see in row 5, Michael Bradley has a high rebound count of 8 and Jelani McCoy is not mentioned.\n   - In row 10, Jerome Williams has a higher count of 17 rebounds than any mention for either Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim incorrectly attributes the highest rebound count against Miami to Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy when Jerome Williams had a higher count in one game.\n   - Thus, the claim is false as it does not align with the data.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
