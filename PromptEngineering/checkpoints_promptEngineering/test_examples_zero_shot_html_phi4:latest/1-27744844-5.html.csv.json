    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. **Tyreke Evans scored 30 points on November 6**: \n   - We will check the \"date\" column for entries matching \"November 6.\"\n   - Then, confirm if the \"high points\" entry indicates that Tyreke Evans scored 30 points on this date.\n\n2. **Tyreke Evans scored the most points overall on November 6**:\n   - For all game records in the table, we need to ensure no other player scored more than 30 points on any other date.\n   \nLet's analyze these conditions step-by-step with the relevant data from the HTML table:\n\n1. **Finding Tyreke Evans' score on November 6:**\n   - The entry for \"November 6\" is in row 2 of the table (index 6 considering 0-based indexing).\n   - The \"high points\" column shows \"tyreke evans (30)\", confirming he scored 30 points.\n\n2. **Checking if Tyreke Evans had the highest score on any other date:**\n   - We will review the \"high points\" column for each row to ensure no player scored more than 30 points on another game day.\n   - From reviewing all rows:\n     - Row 0: Dont\u00e9 Greene (27)\n     - Row 1: DeMarcus Cousins (32) \n     - Rows 2-13: The maximum score in the \"high points\" column is 18, achieved by Demarcus Cousins on November 22 and Carl Landry on November 25.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- Tyreke Evans did indeed score 30 points on November 6.\n- No other player scored more than 30 points on any day, confirming that his score of 30 was the highest for that period.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met, making the claim true. The relevant cells in our table to verify this are:\n\n- \"Date\" column for row index 2 (confirming November 6).\n- \"High points\" column for row index 2 (verifying Tyreke Evans' score of 30).\n- All other entries in the \"high points\" column, ensuring no other score exceeds 30.\n\nHere's the JSON representation with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points on November 5 in an epic game,\" we need to examine the relevant data from the provided table.\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The date specified in the claim is November 5. We should locate this date within the table.\n\n2. **Player Performance Check**: Once we have located the correct row for November 5, we will check the \"high points\" column to see how many points Tyreke Evans scored on that specific game day.\n\n3. **Verification of Game Outcome**: Although not explicitly required by the claim, noting if the game went into overtime could help confirm it as an \"epic game.\"\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions step-by-step using the table:\n\n- The row with \"November 5\" is row index `1`.\n- In this row:\n  - Under the \"high points\" column: It lists \"Tyreke Evans (21)\" indicating he scored 21 points.\n  \nThe claim that Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points on November 5 is not supported by the data since he only scored 21 points.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
