Identify the row where the \"away team\" is St Kilda.\n2. Compare the \"home team score\" across all rows to determine if it's the highest in the scenario where the \"away team\" is St Kilda.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Row with Away Team as St Kilda\n\n- Look at each row under the \"away team\" column.\n- We find that in the first row, the \"away team\" is St Kilda.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Home Team Scores from All Rows\n\n- From the table:\n  - Row 0: home team score = 9.11 (65)\n  - Row 1: home team score = 6.11 (47)\n  - Row 2: home team score = 15.14 (104)\n  - Row 3: home team score = 8.11 (59)\n  - Row 4: home team score = 11.22 (88)\n  - Row 5: home team score = 14.17 (101)\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Highest Home Team Score\n\n- Convert each \"home team score\" from its standard notation (e.g., 9.11) into a numeric total:\n  - Row 0: 65\n  - Row 1: 47\n  - Row 2: 104\n  - Row 3: 59\n  - Row 4: 88\n  - Row 5: 101\n\n- The highest home team score is 104 from row 2.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with St Kilda Condition\n\n- In the row where \"away team\" is St Kilda (row 0), the \"home team score\" is 65.\n- Since 65 is not the highest score compared to all other rows, particularly it's less than 104 in row 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"the home team score be highest when the away team be st kilda\" is FALSE because the highest home team score (104) does not occur when St Kilda is the away team.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- All rows are relevant to check scores, but specifically:\n  - Row 0 for determining where St. Kilda is the away team.\n  - The \"home team score\" column in all rows to compare values.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
