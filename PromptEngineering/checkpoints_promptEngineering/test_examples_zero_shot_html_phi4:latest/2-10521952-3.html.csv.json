We need to find a row where the \"result\" column is \"1 - 1\".\n\n2. **Date Check**: For the row with \"result\" as \"1 - 1\", the claim specifies the date should be \"8 october 2010\".\n\n3. **Score Check**: In the same row, the score should be \"3 - 1\".\n\n4. **Venue Check**: The venue should be \"pusk\u00e1s stadium, budapest\".\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Result: \"2 - 1\" (not \"1 - 1\")\n  \n- **Row 1**:\n  - Result: \"8 - 0\" (not \"1 - 1\")\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Result: \"3 - 0\" (not \"1 - 1\")\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Result: \"4 - 0\" (not \"1 - 1\")\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Result: \"5 - 0\" (not \"1 - 1\")\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Result: \"5 - 0\" (not \"1 - 1\")\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Result: \"3 - 1\" (matches the required result)\n  - Date: \"16 october 2012\" (does not match \"8 october 2010\")\n  - Score: \"1 - 1\" (matches the required score)\n  - Venue: \"pusk\u00e1s stadium, budapest\" (matches the required venue)\n\nThe row with a result of \"1 - 1\" is Row 6. However, the date does not match \"8 october 2010\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the claim:\n- Row 6, columns: \"result\", \"date\", \"score\", \"venue\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
