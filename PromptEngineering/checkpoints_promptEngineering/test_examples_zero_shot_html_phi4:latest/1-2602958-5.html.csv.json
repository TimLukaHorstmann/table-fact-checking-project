Identify the row indices for each episode:\n   - Episode 67 corresponds to row index 66.\n   - Episode 69 corresponds to row index 68.\n\n2. Retrieve the viewership numbers from these rows:\n   - For \"the lorelais' first day at yale\" (row index 66), the viewers are listed as 5.50 million.\n   - For \"chicken or beef\" (row index 68), the viewers are listed as 4.97 million.\n\n3. Compare the viewership numbers:\n   - Episode 67 (\"the lorelais' first day at yale\") has 5.50 million viewers.\n   - Episode 69 (\"chicken or beef\") has 4.97 million viewers.\n\nSince 5.50 is greater than 4.97, episode 67 does indeed have more viewers than episode 69.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"Viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 68, \"column_name\": \"Viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
