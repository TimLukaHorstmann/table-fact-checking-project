Ritchie and the aircraft tail number matches \"f - 4d 66 - 7463.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Weapon Systems Officer as Capt R. Ritchie:**\n   - We need to find rows where the \"weapon systems officer\" column contains \"capt r s ritchie,\" \"capt rs ritchie,\" or any variation that clearly refers to Captain R. Ritchie.\n\n2. **Check Aircraft Tail Number for Each Identified Row:**\n   - For each row identified in step 1, check if the \"aircraft\" column matches \"f - 4d 66 - 7463.\"\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Weapon Systems Officer: \"capt charles b debellevue\"\n  - Aircraft: \"f - 4d 66 - 7463\"\n  - Capt R. Ritchie is not the weapon systems officer here.\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Weapon Systems Officer: \"capt cb debellevue\"\n  - Aircraft: \"f - 4e 67 - 0362\"\n  - Capt R. Ritchie is not the weapon systems officer here.\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Weapon Systems Officer: \"capt cb debellevue\"\n  - Aircraft: \"f - 4d 66 - 7463\"\n  - Capt R. Ritchie is not the weapon systems officer here.\n\n- **Row 3 and Row 4:**\n  - Weapon Systems Officer: \"capt cb debellevue\"\n  - Aircraft: \"f - 4d 66 - 0267\"\n  - Capt R. Ritchie is not involved in these rows as a pilot or weapon systems officer.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere are no instances in the table where Captain R. Ritchie is listed as the weapon systems officer for the aircraft with tail number \"f - 4d 66 - 7463.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"weapon systems officer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"aircraft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
