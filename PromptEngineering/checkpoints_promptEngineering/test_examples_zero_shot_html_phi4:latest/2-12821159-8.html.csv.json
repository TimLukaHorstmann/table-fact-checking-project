A margin of victory of \"10 strokes\" for this particular entry.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Identify the Runner-Up**: We need to find where \"Rick Huiskamp\" is listed as a runner-up.\n  \n  From the table:\n  - Row index 2 has \"runner - up\": Rick huiskamp\n\n- **Check Margin of Victory**: For this row, we should verify that the margin of victory is indeed \"10 strokes.\"\n\n  Again from the table:\n  - Row index 2 has \"margin of victory\": 10 strokes\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied by row index 2. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given HTML table, we need to break down and verify each part of the claim:\n\n1. **\"rick huiskamp be a runner - up\":** We need to check if \"Rick Huiskamp\" appears in any row under the \"runner-up\" column.\n\n2. **\"finish up with a single - digit margin of victory\":** After verifying that Rick Huiskamp is indeed listed as a runner-up, we then need to confirm whether the corresponding \"margin of victory\" for that entry is a single-digit number (i.e., between 1 and 9).\n\nNow, let's examine each row in the table relevant to these conditions:\n\n- **Row Index 0:** \n  - Date: 14 jun 2005\n  - Runner-up: Wolfgang Huguet\n  - Margin of Victory: 5 strokes\n\n- **Row Index 1:** \n  - Date: 1 jun 2006\n  - Runner-up: Mark Grabow Schytter\n  - Margin of Victory: 7 strokes\n\n- **Row Index 2:** \n  - Date: 22 jun 2006\n  - Runner-up: Rick Huiskamp\n  - Margin of Victory: 10 strokes\n\n- **Row Index 3:** \n  - Date: 4 jul 2006\n  - Runner-up: Lasse Jensen\n  - Margin of Victory: 4 strokes\n\n- **Row Index 4:** \n  - Date: 12 jul 2006\n  - Runner-up: Richard Treis\n  - Margin of Victory: 1 stroke\n\n- **Row Index 5:** \n  - Date: 17 aug 2006\n  - Runner-up: Christoph G\u00fcnther\n  - Margin of Victory: 7 strokes\n\nFrom this examination, Rick Huiskamp appears as a runner-up in Row Index 2. However, the margin of victory for that entry is \"10 strokes,\" which is not a single-digit number.\n\nSince the claim states that Rick Huiskamp should have finished with a \"single-digit margin of victory,\" and we found that his actual margin was 10 (not a single digit), this condition is not met. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- The cell in Row Index 2, Column \"runner - up\" where Rick Huiskamp's name appears.\n- The cell in Row Index 2, Column \"margin of victory\" which shows a margin of 10 strokes.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
