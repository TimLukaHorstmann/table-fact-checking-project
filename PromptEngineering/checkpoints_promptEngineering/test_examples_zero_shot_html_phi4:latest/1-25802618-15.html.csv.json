    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the latest stage win by mikhail ignatiev be stage 6\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two main points:\n\n1. Mikhail Ignatiev won a stage.\n2. The latest (most recent) stage he won was Stage 6.\n\nLet's evaluate these against the given table data:\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - \"stage\": 6\n  - \"winner\": mikhail ignatiev\n\nThis confirms that Mikhail Ignatiev won Stage 6. Now, we need to verify if this is indeed his latest win.\n\nBy checking all rows in the \"winner\" column for other occurrences of Mikhail Ignatiev, we see:\n\n- Only Row 6 lists him as the winner.\n  \nSince there are no later stages (e.g., Stage 7) with Mikhail Ignatiev listed as the winner, Stage 6 is indeed his latest win.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied: he won a stage and Stage 6 was his last win. The relevant data cells for verifying this claim are found in Row 6 of the table:\n\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - \"stage\" column\n  - \"winner\" column\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"stage\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the latest stage win by daniele bennati be 6\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table and identify where Daniele Bennati won a stage.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We focus on the \"winner\" column since it indicates who won each stage.\n2. **Find Stages Won by Daniele Bennati**:\n   - Stage 3: The winner is Daniele Bennati.\n3. **Determine the Latest Stage Win**: \n   - Daniele Bennati's latest win, according to the table, is at stage 3.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that his \"latest stage win\" should be at stage 6, which contradicts our finding that it was actually stage 3.\n   \nThus, the claim is FALSE based on the data provided in the table.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Only the row where Daniele Bennati won a stage needs to be considered for verifying this part of the claim.
