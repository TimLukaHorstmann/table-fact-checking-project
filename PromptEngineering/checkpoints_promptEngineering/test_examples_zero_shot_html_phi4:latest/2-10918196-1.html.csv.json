The claim states: \"6 games have an attendance of over 7000 during the 1993 New York Jets season.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** \n   - We need to focus on the \"attendance\" column because it contains information about how many people attended each game.\n\n2. **Determine Threshold:**\n   - The threshold for the claim is an attendance of over 7000 (note that this means greater than 70000, since attendance figures are typically given in hundreds).\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Row:**\n   - We need to check each row under the \"attendance\" column to see if it exceeds 70000.\n\n4. **Count Rows Meeting Criteria:**\n   - Count how many rows have an attendance figure greater than 70000.\n\n5. **Determine Validity of Claim:**\n   - If exactly 6 games meet this criterion, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow let's evaluate each row:\n\n- Row 1 (Week 1): Attendance = 68130\n- Row 2 (Week 2): Attendance = 70314\n- Row 4 (Week 4): Attendance = 64836\n- Row 5 (Week 5): Attendance = 72593\n- Row 6 (Week 6): Attendance = 41627\n- Row 8 (Week 8): Attendance = 71541\n- Row 9 (Week 9): Attendance = 71659\n- Row 10 (Week 10): Attendance = 71306\n- Row 12 (Week 12): Attendance = 64264\n- Row 14 (Week 14): Attendance = 45799\n- Row 15 (Week 15): Attendance = 47970\n- Row 16 (Week 16): Attendance = 73233\n\nFrom this evaluation, the games with attendance greater than 70000 are in rows: 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 16.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table for the number of wins and losses by the New York Jets during the 1993 season.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We look at each row in the \"result\" column to see if it indicates a win (\"w\") or a loss (\"l\").\n\n2. **Count Wins and Losses**:\n   - Week 1: Loser (L)\n   - Week 2: Winner (W)\n   - Week 4: Winner (W)\n   - Week 5: Loser (L)\n   - Week 6: Loser (L)\n   - Week 8: Loser (L)\n   - Week 9: Winner (W)\n   - Week 10: Winner (W)\n   - Week 11: Winner (W)\n   - Week 12: Winner (W)\n   - Week 13: Winner (W)\n   - Week 14: Loser (L)\n   - Week 15: Winner (W)\n   - Week 16: Loser (L)\n   - Week 17: Loser (L)\n   - Week 18: Loser (L)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Wins and Losses**:\n   - Total Wins = 8 (Weeks 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15)\n   - Total Losses = 9 (Weeks 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, 16, 17, 18)\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that \"the new york jet take 3 more win over loss during the 1993 season\". This implies that wins should be three more than losses.\n\n   - Difference = Wins - Losses = 8 - 9 = -1\n\nSince the number of wins is not three more than the number of losses, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells are those in the \"result\" column for each week, as they indicate whether the game was a win or loss.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
