    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Denny Hulme be the driver at Anderstorp in 1973\" is true or false, we need to verify two key components from the table: the driver and the location for the year 1973.\n\n1. **Locate the Year 1973 in the Table**:\n   - We look through the rows of the table to find an entry with \"year\" as 1973.\n   - The row corresponding to the year 1973 has the following information:\n     - Driver: Denny Hulme\n     - Location: Anderstorp\n\n2. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Denny Hulme was the driver at Anderstorp in 1973.\n   - From our examination of the table, we see that both conditions (driver and location) match exactly what is listed for the year 1973.\n\nThus, based on the data provided in the table, the claim is fully supported by the relevant entries. Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\".\n\nThe relevant cells from the table necessary to verify this claim are:\n- The cell under the column \"driver\" for the row with year 1973.\n- The cell under the column \"location\" for the same row.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
