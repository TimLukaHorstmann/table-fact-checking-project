    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and verify if there is an entry where the driver's constructor is \"williams - bmw\" with a time/retire of \"+ 37.311\". Let\u2019s break down this process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant columns for this claim are:\n   - `constructor`: To check the team name.\n   - `time / retired`: To verify the specific time or retirement reason.\n\n2. **Review the Table Rows**:\n   - We need to inspect each row and see if both conditions match: the constructor is \"williams - bmw\" and the time/retire value is \"+ 37.311\".\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - `constructor`: \"mclaren - mercedes\"\n     - This does not match \"williams - bmw\", so we move to the next row.\n\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - `constructor`: \"mclaren - mercedes\"\n     - Again, this does not match, continue checking.\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - `constructor`: \"ferrari\"\n     - This is still not a match. Continue to the next row.\n\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - `constructor`: \"williams - bmw\"\n     - `time / retired`: \"+ 37.311\"\n     - Both conditions are satisfied in this row.\n\n   - Since we have found a matching entry, further checking is unnecessary for determining truthfulness of the claim. However, to ensure completeness, let\u2019s check other rows briefly:\n\n   - **Rows 4-17**:\n     - These either do not match the constructor or the time/retire criteria based on quick inspection (they either have different constructors or different times).\n\n   - **Row 18** and beyond:\n     - The remaining rows have non-matching conditions for both constructor and time, confirming that only row 3 matches the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The entry in row 3 confirms that \"williams - bmw\" has a time/retire of \"+ 37.311\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row index for this match: `3`\n   - Relevant columns: `\"constructor\"` and `\"time / retired\"`\n\nThus, we compile the answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
