    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table in relation to the claim:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\"\n\nThis implies two main conditions for verification:\n1. The song \"under the influence\" must have a US chart position of 56.\n2. This must be true for both the years 1985 and 1986.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Year: 1984**\n  - Title: pretty mess\n  - US: 75\n\n- **Year: 1985**\n  - Title: mechanical emotion\n  - US: 107\n\n- **Year: 1986 (first row)**\n  - Title: under the influence\n  - US: 56\n\n- **Year: 1986 (second row)**\n  - Title: animals\n  - US: -\n\n- **Year: 1988**\n  - Title: undress\n  - US: -\n\n### Verification:\n1. For \"under the influence\" to chart at 56 in the US, we look for the title \"under the influence\" with a US value of 56.\n   - In the table, this is found in the row with year 1986 (first row).\n\n2. The claim requires it to be true for both 1985 and 1986:\n   - For 1985: There is no entry for \"under the influence\" at all, hence it did not chart.\n   - For 1986: It does appear with a US value of 56.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe conditions are only met for the year 1986. The claim fails because there is no record of \"under the influence\" charting in 1985.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify this, we focus on cells containing the title and US values for relevant years:\n\n- **Row index 2** (Year: 1986, Title: under the influence)\n  - Column \"year\": 1986\n  - Column \"title\": under the influence\n  - Column \"us\": 56\n\nThese are the relevant cells needed to verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
