    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the largest attendance was on September 16, 1973,\" we need to examine the \"attendance\" column for each row in the table and identify which entry has the highest value.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The claim is about the largest attendance, so the relevant column is \"attendance.\"\n\n2. **Extract all attendance values**:\n   - Week 1 (September 16, 1973): 44818\n   - Week 2: 52035\n   - Week 3: 48176\n   - Week 4: 49549\n   - Week 5: 56438\n   - Week 6: 47478\n   - Week 7: 47787\n   - Week 8: 46722\n   - Week 9: 47911\n   - Week 10: 56519\n   - Week 11: 46430\n   - Week 12: 57859\n   - Week 13: 53830\n   - Week 14: 70041\n\n3. **Identify the largest attendance**:\n   - The highest value among these is 70041, which occurs in Week 14 (December 16, 1973).\n\n4. **Compare with September 16, 1973**:\n   - For Week 1 (September 16, 1973), the attendance was 44818.\n   - Since 70041 (Week 14) is greater than 44818 (Week 1), the claim that the largest attendance was on September 16, 1973, is false.\n\n5. **List relevant cells**:\n   - The row index for Week 1 is 0, and the column name is \"attendance.\"\n   - Additionally, we should note the row with the largest attendance for completeness: Row index 12, \"attendance\" (70041).\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
