    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we must determine if all three of the most recent tallest structures (in terms of height in feet) before 1950 were at least 200 feet taller than every structure after 1950.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Relevant Structures**\n\nFirst, identify the structures before and after 1950:\n\n- **Before 1950:**\n  - St. Paul's Cathedral (1710-1939): Height = 365 ft\n  - Battersea Power Station (1939-1950): Height = 370 ft\n\n- **After 1950:**\n  - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station (1950-1991): Height = 720 ft\n  - One Canada Square (1991-2010): Height = 771 ft\n  - The Shard London Bridge (2010-): Height = 1004 ft\n\n**Step 2: Compare Heights**\n\nNext, we need to check if the three most recent tallest structures before 1950 were at least 200 feet taller than every structure after 1950:\n\n- **St. Paul's Cathedral:** \n  - 365 ft (before 1950)\n  - Difference with Crystal Palace Transmitting Station: 720 - 365 = 355 ft\n  - Difference with One Canada Square: 771 - 365 = 406 ft\n  - Difference with The Shard London Bridge: 1004 - 365 = 639 ft\n\n- **Battersea Power Station:** \n  - 370 ft (before 1950)\n  - Difference with Crystal Palace Transmitting Station: 720 - 370 = 350 ft\n  - Difference with One Canada Square: 771 - 370 = 401 ft\n  - Difference with The Shard London Bridge: 1004 - 370 = 634 ft\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Claim**\n\nThe claim requires all three of the most recent tallest structures before 1950 to be at least 200 feet taller than any structure after 1950. However, there are only two such structures before 1950 (St. Paul's Cathedral and Battersea Power Station). Both fail the condition since neither is 200 feet taller than the Crystal Palace Transmitting Station.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe claim is FALSE because not all three of the most recent tallest structures before 1950 were at least 200 feet taller than every structure after 1950 (in fact, there are only two such structures).\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- St. Paul's Cathedral Height in Feet\n- Battersea Power Station Height in Feet\n- Crystal Palace Transmitting Station Height in Feet\n- One Canada Square Height in Feet\n- The Shard London Bridge Height in Feet\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the following parts of it:\n\n1. **Identifying \"old st paul 's cathedral\"**: The table includes a row where the name is \"Old St Paul 's Cathedral\". This corresponds to `row_index` 1.\n\n2. **Tallest building status for two periods**: We need to check if \"Old St Paul 's Cathedral\" was the tallest building in London during the second longest period of time, according to the data given in the table.\n\n3. **Evaluating the \"years as tallest\" column**: For each entry in this column, we compute the duration (in years) for which the structure remained the tallest building:\n   - White Tower: 1310 - 1098 = 212 years\n   - Old St Paul's Cathedral: 1666 - 1310 = 356 years\n   - Southwark Cathedral: 1677 - 1666 = 11 years\n   - Monument to the Great Fire of London: 1683 - 1677 = 6 years\n   - St Mary-le-Bow: 1710 - 1683 = 27 years\n   - St Paul's Cathedral: 1939 - 1710 = 229 years\n   - Battersea Power Station: 1950 - 1939 = 11 years\n   - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station: 1991 - 1950 = 41 years\n   - One Canada Square: 2010 - 1991 = 19 years\n   - Shard London Bridge: 2010- (assuming it continues to be the tallest, this period is indefinite but started in 2010)\n\n4. **Ranking periods by length**: We order these durations from longest to shortest:\n   - Old St Paul's Cathedral: 356 years\n   - St Paul's Cathedral: 229 years\n   - White Tower: 212 years\n   - Shard London Bridge: (ongoing, started in 2010)\n   - Crystal Palace Transmitting Station: 41 years\n   - One Canada Square: 19 years\n   - Southwark Cathedral: 11 years\n   - Battersea Power Station: 11 years\n   - St Mary-le-Bow: 27 years\n   - Monument to the Great Fire of London: 6 years\n\n5. **Determining the second longest period**: From the rankings, \"St Paul's Cathedral\" has the second longest period at 229 years.\n\nThe claim states that \"Old St Paul 's Cathedral be the tallest building in london for the second long period of time\".
