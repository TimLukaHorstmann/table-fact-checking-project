Identify the row with \"week 8\":\n   - The table lists weeks sequentially from 2 to 17 in the first column labeled \"week.\"\n   - Locate the row where the week number is 8.\n\n2. Check the attendance for this row:\n   - Once we locate the correct row (the one corresponding to \"week 8\"), we need to find the value under the \"attendance\" column.\n   - The relevant cell will have the actual recorded attendance for that specific week.\n\n3. Compare the attendance value with the claimed value of 61603:\n   - If the value in the table matches the claim, then the statement is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- In the table, row with \"week\" number 8 has the following data:\n  - `week`: 8\n  - `date`: october 22 , 2000\n  - `opponent`: denver broncos\n  - `result`: w 31 - 21\n  - `attendance`: 61603\n\n- The attendance value in this row is indeed 61603, which matches the claimed total attendance for week 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the total attendance for week 8 be 61603\" is true.\n\nHere's the JSON response with the relevant cell:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index is 7 because rows are typically zero-indexed in such contexts (starting from week 2 at index 0).",
