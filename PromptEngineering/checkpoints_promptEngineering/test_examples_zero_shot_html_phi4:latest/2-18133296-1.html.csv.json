    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Government 31 have the Kadima party,\" we need to examine the table and identify whether government number 31 is associated with the Kadima party.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The relevant row for the claim involves looking at each entry where the 'governments' column includes '31'. \n\n2. **Examine Rows Individually:**\n   - Go through the rows of the table to find where government number 31 is listed in the 'governments' column.\n   - We see that row index 30 has \"governments\" as \"31\".\n\n3. **Check Party for Government 31:**\n   - Once we identify row index 30, we check the corresponding 'party' entry under the 'party' or equivalent label to see if it lists Kadima.\n   - In this case, the 'party' column in row index 30 states \"kodima\" (which appears to be a typographical error for \"Kadima\").\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Since government number 31 is indeed associated with the Kadima party in the table, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cell information includes:\n     - 'governments' column of row index 30 indicating \"31\".\n     - 'party' column of row index 30 indicating \"kodima\" (Kadima).\n\nThus, based on the analysis above, the claim is verified as true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"governments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if government 31 started before January 18, 2006.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant entry in the table:**\n   - The relevant row for government 31 can be found by looking at the \"governments\" column and matching it with \"31\".\n   - In the provided HTML table, government 31 is associated with Tzipi Livni, as indicated in the row:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>tzipi livni</td>\n       <td>kadima</td>\n       <td>31</td>\n       <td>18 january 2006</td>\n       <td>1 april 2009</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify the start date for government 31:**\n   - The \"Term Start\" column shows that government 31 started on January 18, 2006.\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"government 31 start before 18 january 2006.\"\n   - Since the actual start date is exactly January 18, 2006, it does not start before this date.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because government 31 started on January 18, 2006, not before.\n\n5. **Relevant cells for verification:**\n   - Row index for Tzipi Livni (government 31): 19\n   - Relevant column names are \"governments\" and \"Term Start\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"governments\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Term Start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
