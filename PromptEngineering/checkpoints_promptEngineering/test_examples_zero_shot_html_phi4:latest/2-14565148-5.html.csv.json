    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the data in the table regarding the coach for the Ohio Valley conference in the year 1953.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**: The claim states \"Guy R Strong was the coach of the Ohio Valley conference in 1953.\"\n   \n2. **Relevant Columns and Rows**:\n   - We need to check the row where the `year` is 1953.\n   - Within that row, we must verify the value in the `coach` column.\n\n3. **Extraction from Table**:\n   - Locate the row with `year = 1953`.\n   - Check the corresponding value in the `coach` column for this year.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - In the table, the row for the year 1953 is:\n     ```html\n     <tr>\n       <td>1953</td>\n       <td>ohio valley</td>\n       <td>16 - 9</td>\n       <td>9 - 1</td>\n       <td>paul s mcbrayer</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n   - The coach listed for the year 1953 is \"paul s mcbrayer,\" not \"Guy R Strong.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the coach for 1953 is Paul S McBryer, not Guy R Strong, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell to verify this information is located at row index 0 (considering 0-based indexing) in both the `year` and `coach` columns.\n\nThus, the final JSON response indicating the outcome of the verification is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"coach\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
