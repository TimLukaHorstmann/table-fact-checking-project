    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"the highest number of crowd attendance was in week 7,\" we need to examine the \"attendance\" column for all weeks and identify if week 7 indeed has the highest value.\n\nThe table provides data on several columns, but the only relevant one for this claim is the \"attendance\" column. We will extract the attendance numbers for each row (week) and compare them:\n\n1. Week 1: 44773\n2. Week 2: 46460\n3. Week 3: 59983\n4. Week 4: 80291\n5. Week 5: 47583\n6.

Week 16: 51064\n\nNow, let's identify the highest attendance number:\n\n- The highest attendance in the table is 80291, which occurs in week 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the highest number of crowd attendance was in week 7 (44487) is false. The actual highest attendance occurred in week 4 with a count of 80291.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis include all rows under the \"attendance\" column since we need to compare all values:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance = 44773\n- Week 2: Attendance = 46460\n- Week 3: Attendance = 59983\n- **Week 4**: Attendance = 80291 (Highest)\n- Week 5: Attendance = 47583\n- Week 6: Attendance = 46751\n- **Week 7**: Attendance = 44487 (Claimed highest, but not actually highest)\n- Week 8: Attendance = 56191\n- Week 9: Attendance = 52060\n- Week 10: Attendance = 46264\n- Week 11: Attendance = 46032\n- Week 12: Attendance = 47234\n- Week 13: Attendance = 30936\n- Week 14: Attendance = 65649\n- Week 15: Attendance = 42202\n- Week 16: Attendance = 51064\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
