    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the statement against the table:\n\n1. **Opponent**: The claim states \"the game against washington redskins\". We need to find a row where the 'opponent' column has \"washington redskins\".\n\n2. **Result**: The claim mentions \"result in l 30 - 27\". We need to verify that the 'result' column contains this exact result for the same opponent.\n\n3. **Date**: The claim states \"happen in december 7, 1975\". This means we must check if the 'date' column corresponds to \"december 7 , 1975\" for the same row where the opponent and result match the earlier conditions.\n\nNow, let's verify these details:\n\n- From the table:\n  - **Row 12** has the following relevant information:\n    - `opponent`: \"washington redskins\"\n    - `result`: \"l 30 - 27\"\n    - `date`: \"december 7 , 1975\"\n\nAll parts of the claim match perfectly with row 12 in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.

Check if this particular game's attendance is indeed the highest.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps:\n\n- **Identify the Relevant Game:**\n  - The claim mentions a game against the \"St. Louis Cardinal\" resulting in \"L 23 - 20\".\n  - In the table, row 0 matches these criteria:\n    - `week`: 1\n    - `date`: September 21, 1975\n    - `opponent`: St. Louis Cardinals (note: the claim has a typo with an extra space; however, it still refers to the correct team)\n    - `result`: L 23 - 20\n    - `attendance`: 42172\n\n- **Check for Highest Attendance:**\n  - We need to check if the attendance of this game is the highest among all games listed in the table.\n  - Scanning through the 'attendance' column:\n    - Row 0: 42172\n    - Row 1: 45218\n    - Row 2: 29444\n    - Row 3: 44043\n    - Row 4: 64843 (highest attendance)\n    - Row 5: 45811\n    - Row 6: 49342\n    - Row 7: 43751\n    - Row 8: 44595\n    - Row 9: 28686\n    - Row 10: 28586\n    - Row 11: 50860\n    - Row 12: 52809\n    - Row 13: 38501\n    - Row 14: 56267\n\nThe highest attendance in the table is 64843 (row 4), which occurs in a game against the Los Angeles Rams.
