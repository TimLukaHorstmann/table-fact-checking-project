The column labeled 'total wins' indicates that Australia has 5 total wins.\n- **England** is located in the third row. Similarly, the column labeled 'total wins' shows that England also has 5 total wins.\n\nBased on this examination, both Australia and England have exactly 5 total wins each.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this claim are:\n1.

This information will allow us to compare the number of individual wins between England and South Africa.\n\nNext, locate the rows for England and South Africa in the table:\n\n1. **England's Row**:\n   - Nation: England\n   - Individual Wins: 4\n\n2. **South Africa's Row**:\n   - Nation: South Africa\n   - Individual Wins: 2\n\nNow calculate the difference in individual wins between England and South Africa:\n- England has 4 individual wins.\n- South Africa has 2 individual wins.\n\nDifference = England's individual wins - South Africa's individual wins = 4 - 2 = 2.\n\nThe calculated difference matches the claim that \"England have 2 more individual win than South Africa.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Northern Ireland have as many individual winners as the United States do,\" we need to examine the relevant data in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The row for \"United States\" is needed to find out how many individual winners they have.\n   - The row for \"Northern Ireland\" is required to compare their number of individual winners with that of the United States.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Column:**\n   - We need the column labeled \"individual winners\" because this directly provides information on the count of individual winners for each nation listed in the table.\n\n3. **Extract Data from Table:**\n\n   - For the \"United States\":\n     - Locate the row where `nation` is \"united states\".\n     - Check the value in the \"individual winners\" column.\n     - According to the table, this value is 12.\n\n   - For \"Northern Ireland\":\n     - Locate the row where `nation` is \"northern ireland\".\n     - Check the value in the \"individual winners\" column.\n     - According to the table, this value is 1.\n\n4. **Compare Values:**\n   - Compare the number of individual winners for both nations:\n     - United States: 12 individual winners\n     - Northern Ireland: 1 individual winner\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Northern Ireland have as many individual winners as the United States do.\"\n   - From the comparison, it is clear that Northern Ireland (1) does not have the same number of individual winners as the United States (12).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since 1 is not equal to 12, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For \"United States\" in the \"individual winners\" column:\n  - `row_index`: 0\n  - `column_name`: \"individual winners\"\n\n- For \"Northern Ireland\" in the \"individual winners\" column:\n  - `row_index`: 4\n  - `column_name`: \"individual winners\"\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"individual winners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
