Whether in such a case, if the corresponding age is more than 45 years.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant part of the table:\n\n- **Row with `year = 2013`:**\n  - Performance is \"60.73 m\"\n  - Age is 45\n\nGiven this row, we see that there is indeed a year (2013) where the performance matches \"60.73 m.\" Now, let's check if the age for this particular row is more than 45:\n\n- The age in 2013 is exactly 45.\n\nSince the age is not more than 45, it satisfies the claim's condition that there should be no year with a performance of \"60.73 m\" and an age greater than 45.\n\nWe can conclude that the claim holds true as there are no instances where both conditions (performance = \"60.73 m\" and age > 45) are simultaneously satisfied.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"performance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We examined the row where performance is \"60.73 m\" to ensure it does not have an age more than 45.\n- Only one row needed examination: Row index 0 corresponds to the year 2013 with a performance of \"60.73 m\" and an age of 45.\n- The relevant cells for this verification are in Row Index 0, specifically under the columns \"performance\" and \"age (years)\".",

The highest age should be 39.\n2. This age corresponds to a performance of 62.20 m with a first-place finish.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Check for the Highest Age:**\n   - From the table, find the maximum value in the \"age (years)\" column:\n     - The ages listed are: 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 22, 21, 20.\n     - The highest age is 45.\n\n2. **Check for Performance of 62.20 m:**\n   - Look for entries in the \"performance\" column with a value of \"62.20 m\":\n     - In row index 6 (corresponding to year 2007), the performance is \"62.20 m\".\n\n3. **Verify Age and Place for the Performance of 62.20 m:**\n   - For row index 6:\n     - The age is 39.\n     - The place is \"1st\".\n   - This matches one part of the claim but not the highest age.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The highest age (45) does not correspond to a performance of 62.20 m with a first-place finish.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Age cells for all rows to find the maximum age:  \n  Row indices and column \"age (years)\": 0, 1, 2, ..., 21.\n- Performance and place cells where performance is 62.20 m:  \n  Row index 6, columns \"performance\" and \"place\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"age (years)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"performance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
