    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding matches on specific dates\u2014April 14, 2001, and February 24, 2001\u2014we need to examine two specific rows in the table. The relevant criteria for evaluating \"victory\" would be based on the match outcomes recorded under the column named \"FTHG - FTAG.\" A victory is indicated when the first team's score (FTHG) is greater than the away team's score (FTAG).\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - For April 14, 2001: Locate this date in the \"Date\" column.\n   - For February 24, 2001: Similarly, locate this date.\n\n2. **Examine Match Outcomes**:\n   - **April 14, 2001**: \n     - Row Index: 32\n     - Date: April 14, 2001\n     - FTHG (Home Team Goals) = 4, FTAG (Away Team Goals) = 1\n     - Result: The home team won (FTHG > FTAG), which indicates a victory.\n\n   - **February 24, 2001**:\n     - Row Index: 22\n     - Date: February 24, 2001\n     - FTHG (Home Team Goals) = 0, FTAG (Away Team Goals) = 2\n     - Result: The home team lost (FTHG < FTAG), which does not indicate a victory.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe match on April 14, 2001, resulted in a victory for the home team. However, the match on February 24, 2001, did not result in a victory for the home team. Therefore, the claim that both matches are victories is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"FTHG - FTAG\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"FTHG - FTAG\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
