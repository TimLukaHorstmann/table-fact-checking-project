    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the two games that the Buccaneers lost were in Tampa Stadium\" is true or false, we need to verify if all the games they lost were played at Tampa Stadium based on the data provided in the table.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Lost Games**: The column labeled \"result\" shows whether a game was won (\"w\") or lost (\"l\"). We must extract the rows where the result is \"l\".\n\n2. **Check Game Sites for Losses**: For each of these losses, we will check the corresponding entry in the \"column_name\" that states \"Tampa Stadium\". If all such losses occurred at Tampa Stadium, then the claim is true.\n\n3. **Collect Relevant Data**:\n   - Rows with a loss are identified.\n   - Check if the game site for these rows is \"tampa stadium\".\n\nLet's go through each row and extract relevant information:\n\n- Row 0: Result = \"l\", Site = Soldier Field (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 1: Result = \"l\", Site = Soldier Field (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 2: Result = \"l\", Site = Soldier Field (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 3: Result = \"l\", Site = Soldier Field (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 4: Result = \"l\", Site = Soldier Field (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 5: Result = \"l\", Site = Soldier Field (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 6: Result = \"l\", Site = Giants Stadium (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 7: Result = \"w\", Site = Tampa Stadium\n- Row 8: Result = \"l\", Site = The Meadowlands (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 9: Result = \"w\", Site = Tampa Stadium\n- Row 10: Result = \"l\", Site = Lambeau Field (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 11: Result = \"l\", Site = Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome (Not Tampa Stadium)\n- Row 12: Result = \"l\", Site = Tampa Stadium\n- Row 13: Result = \"l\", Site = Tampa Stadium\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that losses occurred at locations other than Tampa Stadium. Specifically, losses were recorded at Soldier Field, Giants Stadium, The Meadowlands, Lambeau Field, and Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because not all of the Buccaneers' lost games were played in Tampa Stadium.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are those related to losses and their corresponding game sites:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"column_name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
