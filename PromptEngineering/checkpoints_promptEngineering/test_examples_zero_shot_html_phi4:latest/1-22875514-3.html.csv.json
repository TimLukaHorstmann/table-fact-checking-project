The number of successful field goals made by Cole.\n2. The total number of field goal attempts by Cole.\n\nThe claim states: \"Cole have 18 out of 50 field goal for a 360 average.\" This means we are looking for:\n- 18 successful field goals (first number in the field goals entry).\n- 50 total attempts (second number in the field goals entry).\n\nLet's examine the relevant row from the table:\n\n| player    | field goals |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| cole      | 18 - 50 360 |\n\nFrom this, we can see:\n- Cole made 18 successful field goals.\n- Cole attempted a total of 50 field goals.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim match the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is supported by the information provided.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cell from the table:\n\n- The row index for \"cole\" is 9 (since indexing starts at 0).\n- The column name for this data is \"field goals\".\n\nThe JSON object reflecting our findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"cole player have 6 - 19 316 field goal\" is true or false, we need to verify this information against the provided HTML table.\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to the player \"cole\". In this table, players are listed in a column with the header \"player\".\n\n2. Locate the \"field goals\" data for the player \"cole\":\n   - The first cell under the \"player\" header is \"lacey\", so we proceed down the rows until we find \"cole\".\n   - \"Cole\" is located at row index 9 (considering that indexing starts from 0).\n\n3. Check the value in the \"field goals\" column for this row:\n   - The \"field goals\" data for \"cole\" is listed as \"18 - 50 360\".\n\n4.
