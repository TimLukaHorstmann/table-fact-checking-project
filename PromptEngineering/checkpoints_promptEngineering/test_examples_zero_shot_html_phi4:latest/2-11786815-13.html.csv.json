    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table and verify whether the total attendance on May 28 is indeed 17132.\n\n1. The claim specifically mentions the date \"May 28.\" Thus, we need to locate this date in the table.\n2. Upon examining the table rows, we find that:\n   - In the first row, the date is \"may 24.\"\n   - In the second row, the date is \"may 26.\"\n   - In the third row, the date is \"may 28.\" This matches the date in question.\n   - The other rows have dates \"may 31,\" \"june 2,\" and \"june 4.\"\n\n3. Now that we've identified the correct row (third row) for May 28:\n   - We check the attendance value in this row, which is found under the \"attendance\" column.\n   - The value listed in the table for this row's \"attendance\" column is indeed 17132.\n\nGiven that all conditions specified in the claim align with the data from the third row of the table, we can conclude:\n\n- The total attendance on May 28 is correctly stated as 17132 in the table.\n  \nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell for this verification is the \"attendance\" column of the row corresponding to May 28.\n\nThe JSON response reflecting these findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
