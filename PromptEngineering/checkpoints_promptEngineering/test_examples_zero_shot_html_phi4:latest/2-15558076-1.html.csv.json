The relevant column for this analysis is \"television,\" which shows the broadcasting network for each game.\n\nHere's a step-by-step examination:\n\n1. **Inspect the 'television' column**: We need to check all entries in the \"television\" column of the table to identify the networks that have broadcasted the games.\n   \n2. **List of identified networks**:\n   - Fox: Appears in rows 0, 4, and 7.\n   - CBS: Appears in rows 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n   - \"tba\" (to be announced): Appears in rows 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n3. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The claim states that only Fox and CBS have broadcasted the series.\n   - From our inspection, we find entries with \"tba,\" which means those games' broadcasting networks are not specified in the table. These entries (rows 8-12) do not confirm any network other than Fox or CBS.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is supported by the data provided because all explicitly listed broadcasters in the table are either Fox or CBS.\n   - There is no evidence of any other network broadcasting these games as per the given information.\n\nThus, based on the analysis, the claim is TRUE.

Therefore, the claim that the \"Jacksonville Jaguars have been the designated visitor the greatest number of times\" is true because they appear exactly once, and no other team has appeared more frequently.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 8, Column: \"designated visitors\"\n\nThe final JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"designated visitors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's analyze:\n\n1. **2007**: New York Giants (visitors), Miami Dolphins (home)\n2. **2008**: San Diego Chargers (visitors), New Orleans Saints (home)\n3. **2009**: New England Patriots (visitors), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (home)\n4. **2010**: Denver Broncos (visitors), San Francisco 49ers (home)\n5. **2011**: Chicago Bears (visitors), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (home)\n6. **2012**: New England Patriots (visitors), St Louis Rams (home)\n7. **2013** (Sep): Pittsburgh Steelers (visitors), Minnesota Vikings (home)\n8. **2013** (Oct): San Francisco 49ers (visitors), Jacksonville Jaguars (home)\n9. **2014** (1st TBA): Detroit Lions (visitors), Atlanta Falcons (home)\n10. **2014** (2nd TBA): Dallas Cowboys (visitors), Jacksonville Jaguars (home)\n11. **2014** (3rd TBA): Miami Dolphins (visitors), Oakland Raiders (home)\n12. **2015**: TBA visitors, Jacksonville Jaguars (home)\n13. **2016**: TBA visitors, Jacksonville Jaguars (home)\n\nNow let's check for teams that appear as both the designated visitors and the designated home team:\n\n- **Tampa Bay Buccaneers** are listed as the visiting team in 2009 and as the home team in 2011.\n- **New England Patriots** are listed as the visiting team in 2009 and again in 2012, but not as a home team.\n- **Jacksonville Jaguars** are listed as the home team multiple times (in two entries of 2013, one entry of 2014, 2015, and 2016), but only once as a visitor in 2013.\n\nThe claim states that \"only 1 team have be both the home team and the visiting team.\" The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the only team that fulfills this condition based on our analysis.
