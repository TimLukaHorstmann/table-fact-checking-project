    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the two conditions specified:\n\n1. There be no defensive end pick.\n2. An overall smaller than 2.\n\nLet's go through each condition step by step using the data from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: \"There be no defensive end pick\"\n\n- We check the \"position\" column for any entry labeled \"defensive end.\"\n- In row 2, we find an entry with \"tony brackens\" as a \"defensive end.\"\n\nThis means there is at least one defensive end pick, so this condition is false.\n\n### Condition 2: \"An overall smaller than 2\"\n\n- We check the \"overall\" column for any number that is smaller than 2.\n- In row 1, we find an entry with the value \"2,\" which is not smaller than 2.\n\nThere are no entries in the \"overall\" column that are less than 2, so this condition is true.\n\nSince at least one of the conditions (the first one) is false, the claim as a whole is false. \n\nNow we identify the relevant cells for each part of the evaluation:\n\n- For Condition 1 (\"There be no defensive end pick\"), the relevant cell is:\n  - Row index 2 (1-based index), \"position\" column: \"defensive end\"\n\n- For Condition 2 (\"An overall smaller than 2\"), since there are no entries less than 2, we can reference any row that does not violate this condition. Let's consider row 1 as a counterexample:\n  - Row index 1 (1-based index), \"overall\" column: \"2\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that row indices are 0-based for JSON compatibility, as per standard convention in many programming contexts.",
