The date of the game mentioned in the claim matches the date recorded in the table.\n2. The record of the Chicago Black Hawks before and after this specific game aligns with what's described.\n\n**Steps to Verify the Claim:**\n\n- **Identify the Game Date:** \n  - According to the claim, we are looking for a game that took place on January 18.\n  \n- **Locate the Row with January 18 in the Table:**\n  - By examining the table data, find the row where the \"Date\" column indicates \"Jan 18\".\n\n- **Check the Records Before and After the Game:**\n  - Verify what the record was before this game. The record is given after each game as a sequence of wins-losses-ties.\n  - Ensure that the record stated in the claim for January 18 matches with the record recorded immediately after it.\n\n**Verification from Table Data:**\n\n1. **Locate Row:**\n   - We find \"Jan 18\" corresponds to row index 12 (considering zero-based indexing).\n   - The table data shows:\n     - Date: Jan 18\n     - Teams: BOS at CHI \n     - Score: 2-0 (BOS)\n     - Record After Game: 13-11-3\n\n2. **Check the Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"after the game on January 18, the record became 13 - 11 - 3\".\n   - According to row index 12:\n     - Before the game (from previous row with Jan 15), the record was 13-10-3.\n     - After the game on Jan 18, it became 13-11-3.\n\nThe claim is correct as it accurately reflects the change in record following the game on January 18.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The relevant cells include the record before the game (row index 11), the date of the game (row index 12), and the updated record after the game (row index 12).
