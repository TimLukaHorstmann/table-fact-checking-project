The relevant cells from the table that verify this claim are as follows:\n\n- Row index for \"Croatia\": 8 (since indexing starts at 0)\n- Columns:\n  - Total medals count (\"total\")\n  - Silver medals count (\"silver\")\n\nThese correspond to the following cell data in the table: \n- Croatia's total medal count is listed under column \"total\", row index 8.\n- Croatia's silver medal count is listed under column \"silver\", row index 8.\n\nThe JSON response with these relevant cells would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Australia do not receive any gold medal\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to locate the row corresponding to Australia and check the value in the \"gold\" column.\n\nHere's a step-by-step examination of the relevant parts of the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Australia**: \n   - We look through the rows of the table under the \"nation\" column to find the entry for \"Australia.\"\n   - Upon scanning, we locate that Australia is listed on row 17.\n\n2. **Check the Gold Medal Count**:\n   - In the same row (row 17) where \"Australia\" appears in the \"nation\" column, we check the value under the \"gold\" column.\n   - The table shows a value of `0` gold medals for Australia.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Since the number of gold medals awarded to Australia is `0`, this supports the claim that Australia did not receive any gold medal.\n\n4. **Determine Relevance**:\n   - The relevant cell for verifying this claim is in row 17 under the \"gold\" column.\n\nBased on these steps, we conclude that the claim is true. Here's the JSON representation of our answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
