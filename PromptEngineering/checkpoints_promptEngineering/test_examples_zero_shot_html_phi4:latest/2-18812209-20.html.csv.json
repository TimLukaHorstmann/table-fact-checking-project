Row index 1: The chassis is \"focus rs wrc 08 and 09\". Although this includes \"focus rs wrc 08\", it's combined with another model, so we will consider it separately.\n3.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the difference in points between all constructors in the table, we need to focus on the \"points\" column. The claim states that the maximum difference in points among all constructors is at most 11.\n\nHere's how to verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Extract the points for each constructor from the table:\n   - Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team: 456\n   - BP Ford World Rally Team: 337\n   - Citro\u00ebn Junior Team: 217\n   - Stobart M-Sport Ford Rally Team: 176\n   - Munchi's Ford World Rally Team: 58\n\n2. **Calculate Differences**: Compute the differences between each pair of constructors:\n   - Difference between highest (456) and lowest (58): \\(456 - 58 = 398\\)\n   - Other differences are less than this, but since 398 is already greater than 11, we can conclude without further calculations.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim is that the difference should be at most 11. However, we found a difference of 398, which exceeds 11.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim is false because there exists a pair of constructors with a points difference greater than 11.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**: Since the verification involves comparing all points values, all rows in the \"points\" column are relevant.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
