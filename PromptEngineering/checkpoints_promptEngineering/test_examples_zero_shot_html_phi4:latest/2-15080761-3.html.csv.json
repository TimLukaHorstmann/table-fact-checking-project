    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the wednesday only appear as an opponent 1 time, during the first game of the fc season,\" we need to analyze specific conditions related to the opponents and dates in the table.\n\n### Steps to Analyze:\n\n1. **Check for Opponent Appearances:**\n   - We need to determine how many times \"the wednesday\" appears as an opponent.\n   - Look at the \"opponents\" column for any occurrence of \"the wednesday.\"\n\n2. **Identify Date and Sequence in the Season:**\n   - Verify if this appearance is during the first game of the season.\n   - Check the \"date\" column to see which match occurs first chronologically.\n\n### Relevant Data from the Table:\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Opponent: \"the wednesday\"\n  - Date: \"20 february 1904\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Appearance Count:**\n   - \"The wednesday\" appears as an opponent only once in the table (Row 6).\n\n2. **Chronological Order:**\n   - The earliest date listed is \"12 december 1903\" (Row 0).\n   - \"20 february 1904\" (Row 6) is not the first game of the season.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"the wednesday\" appears as an opponent only once and during the first game of the season. While it is true that they appear only once, this appearance is not during the first game. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 6: \n  - \"opponents\": \"the wednesday\"\n  - \"date\": \"20 february 1904\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
