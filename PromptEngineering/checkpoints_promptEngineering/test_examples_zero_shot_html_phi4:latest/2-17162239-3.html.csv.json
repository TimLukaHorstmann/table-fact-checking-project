    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Scott Hoch with a score under 66 be not from the United States,\" we need to analyze relevant data points in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Scott Hoch's Row:**\n   - Locate the row where \"player\" is \"scott hoch.\" \n   - This is found at `row_index` 0.\n\n2. **Check Scott Hoch's Score:**\n   - In this row, check the \"score\" column.\n   - The score for Scott Hoch is 66, not under 66.\n\n3. **Relevance to the Claim:**\n   - Since Scott Hoch\u2019s score is exactly 66 and not under 66, there is no need to verify his country of origin in relation to this claim.\n   - Therefore, we do not need to check if he is from the United States for the purpose of evaluating the given condition.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The condition \"Scott Hoch with a score under 66\" is never met in the table since his score is exactly 66.\n   - Thus, there are no instances where Scott Hoch has a score under 66 to further evaluate if he could be from any country other than the United States.\n\nSince the premise of the claim does not hold true (Scott Hoch does not have a score under 66), the claim itself is irrelevantly supported by default as it never needs verification regarding his nationality for this condition. Hence, the answer to whether Scott Hoch with a score under 66 could be from any country other than the United States is trivially true.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
