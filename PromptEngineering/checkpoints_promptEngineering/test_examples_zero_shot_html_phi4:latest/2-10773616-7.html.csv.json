    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"essendon score fewer points than any other team listed\" is true or false, we need to examine the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns for each row in the table.\n\n1. Extract the scores from the table:\n\n   - Melbourne: Home score = 15.21 (111), Away score = N/A\n   - South Melbourne: Home score = N/A, Away score = 14.5 (89)\n   - Essendon: Home score = 22.13 (145), Away score = N/A\n   - Fitzroy: Home score = N/A, Away score = 7.12 (54)\n   - Collingwood: Home score = 11.8 (74), Away score = N/A\n   - Richmond: Home score = N/A, Away score = 14.13 (97)\n   - Carlton: Home score = 12.20 (92), Away score = N/A\n   - Geelong: Home score = N/A, Away score = 11.16 (82)\n   - St Kilda: Home score = 10.12 (72), Away score = N/A\n   - North Melbourne: Home score = N/A, Away score = 9.24 (78)\n   - Hawthorn: Home score = 10.9 (69), Away score = N/A\n   - Footscray: Home score = N/A, Away score = 11.12 (78)\n\n2. Convert each team's score to points:\n   - Melbourne: 111\n   - South Melbourne: 89\n   - Essendon: 145\n   - Fitzroy: 54\n   - Collingwood: 74\n   - Richmond: 97\n   - Carlton: 92\n   - Geelong: 82\n   - St Kilda: 72\n   - North Melbourne: 78\n   - Hawthorn: 69\n   - Footscray: 78\n\n3. Compare Essendon's score of 145 points against all other teams' scores:\n   - The lowest score is Fitzroy with 54 points.\n\nEssendon does not have the fewest points; Fitzroy has fewer points than any other team listed, including Essendon.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
