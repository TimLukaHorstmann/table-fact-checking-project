    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate it against the provided table:\n\n**Claim**: \"b\u00f6rje jansson from united kingdom have a speed of 90.57 mph\"\n\nThe claim has two main assertions:\n1. B\u00f6rje Jansson's country is listed as \"united kingdom.\"\n2. B\u00f6rje Jansson's speed is listed as \"90.57 mph.\"\n\nWe will verify these assertions against the table:\n\n1. **Find B\u00f6rje Jansson in the Table:**\n   - From the table, we locate B\u00f6rje Jansson in row 8:\n     - Place: 8\n     - Rider: B\u00f6rje Jansson\n     - Country: Sweden\n     - Machine: Yamaha\n     - Speed: 90.57 mph\n     - Time: 2:29.59.6\n     - Points: 3\n\n2. **Verify the Assertions:**\n   - The claim states that B\u00f6rje Jansson is from \"united kingdom.\" However, according to the table, his country is listed as \"Sweden.\"\n   - The claim about speed matches the data in the table, which lists B\u00f6rje Jansson's speed as 90.57 mph.\n\nSince one of the assertions (the rider's country) is incorrect according to the table, the entire claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n- Row 8, Column \"country\" - This cell contains the value \"Sweden,\" which contradicts the claim.\n- Row 8, Column \"speed\" - This cell contains the value \"90.57 mph,\" which supports part of the claim.\n\nThe JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that row indices are zero-based, so B\u00f6rje Jansson's data is in row index 7.",
