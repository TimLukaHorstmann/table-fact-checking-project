Specifically, there are ten such teams.\n\nThe claim states \"5 team score 10 point or higher,\" but in reality, eleven teams have scores of 10 or more points.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to break down the statement and verify it against the provided table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n- \"The Corinthian be 5 game away from being undefeated their entire season.\"\n\n**Key Components of the Claim:**\n1. **Team:** The team in question is \"corinthians.\"\n2. **Current Record:** We need to check how many games they have played, won, drawn, and lost.\n3. **Undefeated Status:** To be undefeated for the entire season, a team must not lose any game. Therefore, we need to know if there are any losses recorded for \"corinthians.\"\n4. **Games Remaining:** The claim states that \"corinthians\" is 5 games away from being undefeated. This implies they have played some games and lost at least one, but could potentially be undefeated if 5 more games were added.\n\n### Verification Against the Table:\n1. **Identify \"corinthians\" in the table:**\n   - Row index 0 corresponds to \"corinthians.\"\n\n2. **Check relevant columns for \"corinthians\":**\n   - **Played:** 20 games\n   - **Drawn:** 3 games\n   - **Lost:** 1 game\n\n3. **Calculate Total Games and Remaining Games:**\n   - Total games played by \"corinthians\" = Played + Drawn + Lost = 20.\n   - Since they have already lost 1 game, to be undefeated for the entire season, they must not lose any more games.\n   - The claim suggests that if there were 5 more games (total of 25 games), they could remain undefeated. This implies that currently, they are 5 games short of a hypothetical full season where they could still end up undefeated.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - \"Corinthians\" has lost 1 game out of the 20 played.\n   - If there were 5 more games (totaling 25), and they did not lose any of these, they would be undefeated for the entire season.\n   - The claim is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For \"corinthians,\" the relevant cells are:\n  - `played` (20 games)\n  - `drawn` (3 games)\n  - `lost` (1 game)\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE based on the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
