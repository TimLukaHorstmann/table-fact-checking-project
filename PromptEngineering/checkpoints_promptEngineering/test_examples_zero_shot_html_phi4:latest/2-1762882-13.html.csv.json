    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Scotland's football matches in the given table, we need to verify two main points from the data:\n\n1. Count how many times \"Easter Road, Edinburgh\" appears as a venue.\n2. Count how many times \"Hampden Park, Glasgow\" appears as a venue.\n\nThe claim states that during the Scottish football season, Scotland plays at \"Easter Road, Edinburgh\" 5 times more than they play at \"Hampden Park, Glasgow.\"\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Venues**:\n  - \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\" appears in rows with index: 1, 3, and 4.\n  - \"easter road , edinburgh (h)\" appears in row with index: 9.\n\nFrom this information:\n- Scotland plays at \"Hampden Park, Glasgow\" **3 times**.\n- Scotland plays at \"Easter Road, Edinburgh\" **1 time**.\n\nThe claim suggests that the number of matches at Easter Road is five more than those at Hampden Park. However, based on the data:\n- Difference = 1 (matches at Easter Road) - 3 (matches at Hampden Park) = -2\n\nSince Scotland plays at \"Easter Road, Edinburgh\" only once and not 5 times more frequently than they play at \"Hampden Park, Glasgow,\" the claim is false.\n\nWe identify relevant cells as follows:\n- Rows where the venue is \"hampden park , glasgow (h)\": index 1, 3, 4\n- Row where the venue is \"easter road , edinburgh (h)\": index 9\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
