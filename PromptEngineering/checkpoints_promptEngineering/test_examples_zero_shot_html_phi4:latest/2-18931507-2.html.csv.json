    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each part of the claim and verify it against the table.\n\n**Claim:**  \n\"The event WFF MMA: Pascua Yaqui Fight 4 be hold in Tucson, Arizona, United State, and 1 round last 1:25.\"\n\nLet's break down this claim into parts:\n1. Event Name: \"WFF MMA: Pascua Yaqui Fight 4\"\n2. Location: \"Tucson, Arizona, United States\"\n3. Number of Rounds: \"1\"\n4. Duration: \"1:25\"\n\n**Verification against the table:**\n\n- **Event Name:**  \n  - From the table, we find an event named \"WFF MMA: Pascua Yaqui Fights 4\" in the first row where \"Michael Poe\" is listed as the opponent.\n  - The claim uses \"Fight\" instead of \"Fights,\" which indicates a minor discrepancy. However, assuming this to be a typographical error and not affecting the overall meaning, we proceed with verification.\n\n- **Location:**  \n  - In the first row, the location is given as \"Tucson, Arizona, United States.\"\n  - This matches perfectly with the claim's specified location.\n\n- **Number of Rounds:**  \n  - The table shows that this event occurred in round 1.\n  - This matches the claim stating \"1 round.\"\n\n- **Duration:**  \n  - The time is listed as \"1:25\" in the first row.\n  - This matches the duration mentioned in the claim.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table, with a minor note on the plurality discrepancy which does not change the factual correctness. Therefore, the overall claim can be considered true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Row index 4 (since indexing starts from 0 and this is the first row after headers):\n  - Event name verification (\"WFF MMA: Pascua Yaqui Fights 4\")\n  - Location verification (\"Tucson, Arizona, United States\")\n  - Round verification (\"1\")\n  - Duration verification (\"1:25\")\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the gladiator challenge fight be shorter than the pascua yaqui fight\" is true or false, we need to analyze specific pieces of data from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The Gladiator Challenge events are found in rows 2 and 4.\n     - Row 2: Fight against Miguelito Marti ended at 1:43 (in round 1).\n     - Row 4: Fight against Sean Henry Barnett ended at 4:55 (in round 1).\n   - The Pascua Yaqui fight is found in row 5:\n     - Row 5: Fight against Michael Poe ended at 1:25 (in round 1).\n\n2. **Determine Fight Duration for Comparison:**\n   - From the Gladiator Challenge fights, we have two durations to consider: 1:43 and 4:55.\n   - The Pascua Yaqui fight duration is 1:25.\n\n3. **Comparison of Durations:**\n   - Compare each Gladiator Challenge fight duration with the Pascua Yaqui fight duration:\n     - For Row 2, 1:43 (Gladiator Challenge) vs. 1:25 (Pascua Yaqui): 1:43 is longer than 1:25.\n     - For Row 4, 4:55 (Gladiator Challenge) vs. 1:25 (Pascua Yaqui): 4:55 is longer than 1:25.\n\nBased on this analysis, both Gladiator Challenge fights in the table are longer than the Pascua Yaqui fight. Thus, the claim that \"the gladiator challenge fight be shorter than the pascua yaqui fight\" is not true for any of the instances listed.\n\n**JSON Object with Answer and Relevant Cells:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
