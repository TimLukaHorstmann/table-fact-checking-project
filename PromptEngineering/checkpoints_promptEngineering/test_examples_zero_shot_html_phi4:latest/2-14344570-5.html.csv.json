We must check if the opponent in that row is indeed the New York Rangers.\n\n3. **Score**: The claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers scored no points.

The team mentioned is the Philadelphia Flyers.\n2. They played against the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n3. The game took place on January 27.\n4. The result was a loss by 3 points.\n\nNow, let's verify each part using the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Date of Game**: \n   - We need to find an entry in the \"january\" column that matches January 27.\n   - Looking at the table:\n     - Row 8 has a value of `27` under the \"january\" column.\n\n2. **Opponent**:\n   - In row 8, check the \"opponent\" column for Pittsburgh Penguins.\n   - The opponent listed is indeed \"pittsburgh penguins\".\n\n3. **Score and Margin of Loss**:\n   - Look at the \"score\" column in row 8 to determine the game result.\n   - The score is `4 - 7`, indicating the Flyers scored 4 goals, and the Penguins scored 7.\n   - This means the Flyers lost by 3 points (7 - 4 = 3).\n\nGiven that all parts of the claim are verified with the information in row 8, we can conclude:\n\n- The Philadelphia Flyers did indeed lose to the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 27, with a score difference indicating a loss by 3 points.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo verify this claim, we used the following relevant cells from the table:\n- Row index: 7 (since HTML tables are typically zero-indexed)\n  - Column \"january\": `27`\n  - Column \"opponent\": `pittsburgh penguins`\n  - Column \"score\": `4 - 7`\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"january\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, since no discrepancy arises regarding years and assuming the context is consistent with known NHL seasons, we proceed.\n   \n   - **Team Verification**: We need to check if any game involves the Philadelphia Flyers. The table lists opponents as San Jose Sharks, Colorado Avalanche, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, St. Louis Blues, New York Rangers (twice), Dallas Stars, Florida Panthers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Washington Capitals. None of these are the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n   - **Game Number Verification**: We need to find if game 6 involves overtime. The table lists games by numbers starting from 40 up to 49. Game number 6 does not appear in this sequence.\n\n   - **Overtime Verification**: Games that go into overtime are indicated with \"ot\" in the \"score\" column. These games are:\n     - Row 2: Colorado Avalanche (Score: 2 - 2 ot)\n     - Row 3: Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (Score: 2 - 2 ot)\n     - Row 4: St. Louis Blues (Score: 4 - 4 ot)\n     - Row 7: Florida Panthers (Score: 1 - 1 ot)\n     - Row 8: New York Rangers (Second game, Score: 4 - 4 ot)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - There is no mention of the Philadelphia Flyers in any row.\n   - Game number 6 does not appear in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"the 1995-96 Philadelphia Flyer go into overtime in game 6\" cannot be supported by the data provided.\n\nThe answer is FALSE.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main aspects from the table: whether there is a game where the Philadelphia Flyers played against the Florida Panthers on January 15 and if they won by 5 points.\n\nLet's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Date Check**: The claim states \"on January 15\". We will look for a row where the column \"january\" equals 15.\n2. **Teams Involved**: The claim involves two teams: the Philadelphia Flyers (implied as the team in question) and the Florida Panthers. We need to check if the \"opponent\" column contains \"florida panthers\".\n3. **Score Check**: The claim states that the Philadelphia Flyers won by 5 points, which means their score should be 5 more than the Florida Panthers' score.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - \"january\": 15\n  - \"opponent\": \"dallas stars\" (not Florida Panthers)\n  - This row is irrelevant because the opponent is not the Florida Panthers.\n\nSince no row matches both January 15 and having the Florida Panthers as an opponent, the claim cannot be true based on the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"january\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
