The total attendance for week 5 should be 60,488.\n2. The result for that week should indicate a loss with a score of 24 - 20.\n\nTo validate these claims, we will examine the relevant data from row corresponding to week 5 (which is index 4, as indexing starts at 0) in the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: 4 (since it corresponds to \"week\" value 5)\n- **Column Names**:\n  - The column for attendance is named \"attendance\".\n  - The column for result is named \"result\".\n\nNow let's look into these cells:\n\n1. Check the attendance for week 5:\n   - The cell in row index 4 under the column \"attendance\" contains the value \"60488\".\n\n2. Check the result for week 5:\n   - The cell in row index 4 under the column \"result\" shows \"l 24 - 20\", indicating a loss.\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are met by the data in these cells.

Since all attendance figures in the table are significantly larger than 1, this part of the condition is universally satisfied for all weeks.\n\n   - **Opponent is \"Philadelphia Eagles\"**: We need to find the row(s) where the opponent is \"Philadelphia Eagles\". From the table:\n     - Row with `week = 15`, `opponent = Philadelphia Eagles`, and `attendance = 59218`.\n\n   - **Attendance of 59218 on week 16**: According to the table, in week 16, the attendance was indeed 59218.\n\n2. **Cross-Verification**:\n\n   - We need to confirm if there is any overlap or specific requirement that both conditions (opponent being \"Philadelphia Eagles\" and attendance being 59218) should be met simultaneously on a single week. The claim specifies these conditions as separate but linked by an implication (\"...with an opponent of Philadelphia Eagle be 59218 on week 16\").\n\n   - Since the condition about the opponent is satisfied in week 15, and the specific attendance value (59218) is indeed present in week 16, there is no overlap or conflict. The claim does not require these two conditions to occur in the same week but rather implies a sequence where one follows after another.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n\n   - The claim essentially states that if we consider weeks with attendance greater than 1 and find an opponent as \"Philadelphia Eagles\", then on week 16, the attendance should be 59218. This is true because:\n     - Week 15 has the Philadelphia Eagles with an attendance of 59218.\n     - Week 16 also has an attendance of 59218.\n\n   Therefore, the claim is logically consistent and supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- Row index 14 (week 15) with columns `opponent` (\"philadelphia eagles\") and `attendance` (59218).\n- Row index 15 (week 16) with column `attendance` (59218).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
