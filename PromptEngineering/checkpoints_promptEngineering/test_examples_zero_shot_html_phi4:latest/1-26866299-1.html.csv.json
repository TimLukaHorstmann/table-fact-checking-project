    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the title 'The Wind Beneath Our Wings' be 98 in the series,\" we need to identify if there is a TV episode titled \"The Wind Beneath Our Wings\" and verify its position in the sequence of episodes.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The claim pertains to the episode titles, so we should focus on the \"Title\" column.\n2. **Verify existence and exact title match**: We need to check if there's an entry with the title \"The Wind Beneath Our Wings.\" Upon inspection:\n   - The table contains a row with the title \"the wind beneath our wing.\"\n3. **Correct the capitalization**: The claim mentions \"The Wind Beneath Our Wings,\" while the table lists it as \"the wind beneath our wing\" (lowercase). This difference in case needs to be considered.\n4. **Determine the position**: If we assume the title is meant to refer to this entry despite case differences, we find its row index:\n   - The episode titled \"the wind beneath our wing\" appears at row 97 (since indexing starts from 0).\n5. **Check if it matches the claim number**: According to the claim, it should be the 98th in series.\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the entry is at row index 97 and assuming case insensitivity applies, this corresponds to the 98th position in a human-readable format (starting from 1).\n\nThus, the title \"The Wind Beneath Our Wings\" is indeed 98th in the series when accounting for typical indexing conventions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 97, \"column_name\": \"Title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
