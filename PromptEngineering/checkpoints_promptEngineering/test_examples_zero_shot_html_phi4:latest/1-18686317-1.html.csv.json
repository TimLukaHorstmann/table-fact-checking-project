We should focus on extracting this data for players who belong to the NFL. Additionally, we need to identify their league affiliations mentioned in the column \"League\".\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the \"League\" includes \"NFL\".\n2. Compare the \"Comp %\" values from these rows.\n3. Determine if the highest value among them is indeed greater than or equal to any other league.\n\nLet's extract and evaluate the necessary information from the table:\n\n- Row 21: Dan Fouts (NFL) - Comp % = 58.8\n- Row 22: Kerry Collins (NFL) - Comp % = 55.7\n- Row 23: Joe Montana (NFL) - Comp % = 63.2\n- Row 18: Drew Bledsoe (NFL) - Comp % = 57.2\n- Row 8: Jeff Garcia has affiliations with NFL and UFL, but his primary affiliation in this table is not solely NFL as it includes multiple leagues.\n  \nFrom the list above:\n- Joe Montana (Row 23) has the highest completion percentage at 63.2% among those listed under the NFL.\n\nWe also check other players from different leagues to ensure no one else surpasses this percentage:\n\n- Row 9: Dan Marino (NFL) - Comp % = 59.4\n- Row 10: Drew Henson (UFL, not solely NFL)\n- Row 11: Matt Simms (UFL, not solely NFL)\n- Rows for players like Doug Flutie, John Hadl, and others from the CFL have lower percentages compared to Montana's.\n\nFrom this analysis, Joe Montana indeed has the highest completion percentage in the table, and he is associated with the NFL league. Hence, the claim that \"the person with the highest comp percentage belongs to the NFL league\" is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row 23, Column \"Comp %\"\n- Row 23, Column \"League\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Comp %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"League\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON reflects that Joe Montana (Row 23 in zero-indexed terms) has the highest completion percentage and belongs to the NFL league.",
