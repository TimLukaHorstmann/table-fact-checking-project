    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"3 of the total game features have an attendance in the 3000s and 1 in the 12000s,\" we need to evaluate the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify all games with attendances in the 3000s:**\n   - Attendance is considered in the 3000s if it falls between 3000 and 3999.\n   - Check each game's attendance to count how many fall within this range.\n\n2. **Count the games with attendances in the specified range (3000s):**\n\n   | Row Index | Attendance |\n   |-----------|------------|\n   | 3         | 3144       |\n   | 8         | 3379       |\n   | 12        | 3245       |\n\n   These rows have attendance values of 3144, 3379, and 3245 respectively, which are all in the 3000s. Therefore, we have identified three games with attendances in this range.\n\n3. **Identify the game(s) with an attendance in the 12000s:**\n   - Attendance is considered in the 12000s if it falls between 12000 and 12999.\n   - Check each game's attendance to find any that fall within this range.\n\n4. **Count the games with attendances in the specified range (12000s):**\n\n   | Row Index | Attendance |\n   |-----------|------------|\n   | 0         | 12419      |\n   | 2         | 12483      |\n   | 5         | 12348      |\n   | 6         | 12586      |\n   | 7         | 12874      |\n   | 9         | 12601      |\n   | 10        | 12790      |\n   | 11        | 12440      |\n   | 14        | 12232      |\n   | 15        | 12653      |\n   | 16        | 12949      |\n   | 17        | 12855      |\n   | 18        | 12722      |\n   | 19        | 12465      |\n   | 21        | 12932      |\n\n   There are multiple games with attendances in the 12000s. However, since we only need one game to support the claim of having at least one attendance in this range, the presence of any such entry is sufficient.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim states that there should be \"3 of the total game features have an attendance in the 3000s and 1 in the 12000s.\"\n- We found exactly three games with attendance in the 3000s.\n- We found multiple games with attendances in the 12000s, satisfying the requirement for at least one.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data. The relevant cells are those with attendance values of 3144, 3379, and 3245 (for the 3000s) and any one from the list of values above 12000.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON includes the first game with an attendance in the 12000s for brevity, but any one from the list would suffice.",
