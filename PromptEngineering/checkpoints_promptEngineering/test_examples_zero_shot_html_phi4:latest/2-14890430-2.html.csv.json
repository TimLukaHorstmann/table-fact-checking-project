Identify the rows corresponding to Spain and France by checking the 'nation' column.\n2. Compare the number of gold medals for both nations using the 'gold' column.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Spain**: \n  - From the table, we find that Spain is listed in rows with a rank of 7 (four times listed), specifically in these rows: 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n  - The number of gold medals for Spain is given as 1 in each of these rows.\n\n- **France**: \n  - France is listed at rank 12.\n  - The number of gold medals for France is given as 0 in this row.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSpain has won 1 gold medal, while France has not won any gold medals. Therefore, they do not tie in the number of gold medals won.\n\nBased on these findings, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For Spain: \n  - Rows where Spain is listed (rank 7): rows 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n  - Column 'gold' with value 1 for each row.\n\n- For France:\n  - Row where France is listed (rank 12).\n  - Column 'gold' with value 0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
