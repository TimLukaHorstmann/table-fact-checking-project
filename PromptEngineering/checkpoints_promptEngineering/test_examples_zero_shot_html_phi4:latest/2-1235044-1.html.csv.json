    "resp": "To verify the claim \"3 lap be finish in 1976,\" we need to evaluate two specific conditions from the table for the year 1976:\n\n1. **Finish Position**: The claim implies a condition related to finishing, which is represented by the `finish` column. We are looking for whether this value corresponds to completing 3 laps.\n\n2. **Laps Completed**: The claim mentions \"3 lap be finish,\" indicating that exactly 3 laps should have been completed in 1976. This is directly linked to the `laps` column, where we expect a value of 3.\n\nLet's examine these conditions for the year 1976 in the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: From the table, the year 1976 corresponds to row index 15 (since indexing starts at 0).\n  \n- **Column \"finish\"**:\n  - The `finish` column for the year 1976 shows a value of 11. This does not directly relate to completing exactly 3 laps; it merely indicates the finishing position.\n\n- **Column \"laps\"**:\n  - The `laps` column for the year 1976 shows a value of 100. This confirms that more than 3 laps were completed, which contradicts the claim's requirement of exactly 3 laps being finished.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- The condition that exactly 3 laps must be finished is not satisfied (since only 100 laps were completed).\n  \nTherefore, based on the relevant cells and their values, the claim \"3 lap be finish in 1976\" is **FALSE**.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
