    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main points from the table:\n\n1. **Count of Cities**: The claim states there are races held in \"6 city\". We need to count distinct cities mentioned in the \"city / state\" column.\n\n2. **Number of Australian Provinces**: It also claims these cities are located in only \"3 australian province\". Therefore, we must identify how many unique provinces are represented.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n1. Extracting Cities:\n   - Melburne (Vic)\n   - Launceston (Tas)\n   - Perth (WA)\n   - Brisbane (QLD)\n   - Benalla (Vic)\n   - Sydney (NSW)\n   - Mallala (SA)\n\n   These are the distinct cities listed.\n\n2.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Mark Skaife won all of his last 4 race drives for Nissan\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. Identify Mark Skaife's wins for Nissan.\n2. Ensure these are his last four consecutive wins for Nissan.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 3:** Mark Skaife won at Wanneroo (12 - 14 Apr) for Nissan Motor Sport.\n- **Row 7:** Mark Skaife won at Mallala (21 - 23 Jun) for Nissan Motor Sport.\n- **Row 9:** Mark Skaife won at Oran Park (9 - 11 Aug) for Nissan Motor Sport.\n\nThese are the three instances where Mark Skaife is listed as a winner for Nissan. The claim mentions four wins, but only three are found in the table. Thus, the condition of having \"all of his last 4 race drives\" cannot be met since there aren't enough records to verify four consecutive wins.\n\nRelevant cells to check:\n- Row 3: Winner (Mark Skaife), Team (Nissan Motor Sport)\n- Row 7: Winner (Mark Skaife), Team (Nissan Motor Sport)\n- Row 9: Winner (Mark Skaife), Team (Nissan Motor Sport)\n\nSince Mark Skaife only has three recorded wins for Nissan, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
