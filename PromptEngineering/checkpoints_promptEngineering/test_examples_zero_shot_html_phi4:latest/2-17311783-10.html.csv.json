The attendance at the Verizon Center.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n- **Verification of Record:**\n  - We need to find the row where the \"team\" column indicates the game was played against \"Washington.\"\n  - In the third row (index 2), the team is listed as \"washington,\" and the result is \"w 118 - 104 (ot).\" The record following this match is given as \"41 - 36.\"\n\n- **Verification of Attendance:**\n  - We need to check if the attendance at Verizon Center for the game played in Washington matches \"20173.\"\n  - In the same row (index 2), the location attendance is listed as \"verizon center 20173,\" which exactly matches the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim match the corresponding data from the table:\n\n1. The record \"41 - 36\" for the game against Washington is correct.\n2. The attendance at Verizon Center, \"20173,\" is accurate.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are supported by the table's data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- For the record: Row index 2, column \"record.\"\n- For the location and attendance: Row index 2, column \"location attendance.\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
