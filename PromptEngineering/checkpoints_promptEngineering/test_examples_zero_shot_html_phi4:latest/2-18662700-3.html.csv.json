In this case, it's clearly marked at index 2 (considering a zero-based index).\n\n2. **Check the 'notes' Column**:\n   - Within the row identified in step 1, we examine the \"notes\" column to verify whether its value matches 'r'.\n\nLet's break down the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Index 2**: This corresponds to rank 2 as per the table structure.\n  \n- **Column Name 'rank'**: We confirm that this cell contains the value `2`.\n  \n- **Column Name 'notes'**: We check if this cell contains the value `'r'`.\n\nBy analyzing the data:\n- For row index 2, the \"rank\" column indeed shows `2`, and the \"notes\" column displays `r`. \n\nThus, the claim is supported by these observations.
