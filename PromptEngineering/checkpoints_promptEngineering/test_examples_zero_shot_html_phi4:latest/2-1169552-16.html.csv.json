    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 7 more i1 build than i3\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant entries in the table and compare them.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data for each class (i1 and i3):**\n   - For `i1`, look at the row where `class` is `i1`.\n     - The \"no built\" value for `i1` is 20.\n   - For `i3`, look at the row where `class` is `i3`.\n     - The \"no built\" value for `i3` is 27.\n\n2. **Calculate and compare the difference:**\n   - According to the claim, there should be 7 more units of `i1` built than `i3`.\n   - Calculate the actual difference in numbers built:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{i1 no built} - \\text{i3 no built} = 20 - 27 = -7\n     \\]\n   - This calculation shows that there are actually 7 fewer units of `i1` built compared to `i3`, not more.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that \"there be 7 more i1 build than i3,\" which contradicts the calculated result.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Identify the relevant cells in the table:**\n   - For class `i1`, the relevant cell for \"no built\" is at row index 2 (third row) under the column \"no built\".\n   - For class `i3`, the relevant cell for \"no built\" is at row index 4 (fifth row) under the column \"no built\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
