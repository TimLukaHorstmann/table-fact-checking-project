    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the information provided in the table and break down the claim into verifiable components:\n\n1. **Claim Breakdown:**\n   - \"james campbell be 2 pick ahead of rodney mccray\"\n   - \"in round 1\"\n\n2. **Verification Steps:**\n   - Identify the rows corresponding to \"james campbell\" and \"rodney mccray.\"\n   - Check their respective \"round\" values.\n   - Verify if both are in \"round 1.\"\n   - Compare their \"pick\" numbers to see if James Campbell's pick is exactly two places ahead of Rodney McCray's pick.\n\n3. **Relevant Data from the Table:**\n   - **Row for James Campbell:** \n     - Row Index: 8\n     - Columns: `round` = 9, `pick` = 185, `player` = \"james campbell\"\n   \n   - **Row for Rodney McCray:** \n     - Row Index: 1\n     - Columns: `round` = 1, `pick` = 3, `player` = \"rodney mccray\"\n\n4. **Analysis of the Claim:**\n   - Rodney McCray is indeed in round 1 with pick number 3.\n   - James Campbell is not in round 1; he is in round 9 with pick number 185.\n   - Therefore, it's impossible for James Campbell to be \"2 pick ahead\" of Rodney McCray in round 1 since they are in different rounds.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is FALSE because the conditions specified (both players being in round 1 and having a specific pick difference) are not met.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For James Campbell:\n     - Row Index: 8, Column Name: \"round\"\n     - Row Index: 8, Column Name: \"pick\"\n   - For Rodney McCray:\n     - Row Index: 1, Column Name: \"round\"\n     - Row Index: 1, Column Name: \"pick\"\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
