We need to check if Alexis Bwenge is indeed mentioned in the table.\n\n2. **Pick Number:** The claim specifies the pick number as 8th. We will verify if Alexis Bwenge's corresponding row indicates a pick of 8.\n\n3. **Team:** It states that the team making the pick should be \"the bc lion.\" Again, we need to ensure the column for \"cfl team\" in the table reflects \"bc lions.\"\n\nBy examining each relevant piece of information:\n\n- **Row Verification:**\n  - In row 7 (considering 0-based index), the table lists:\n    - **Pick:** The pick number is 8.\n    - **CFL Team:** The team listed is \"bc lions.\"\n    - **Player:** The player's name is \"alexis bwenge.\"\n\nEach part of the claim corresponds accurately with the data in row 7:\n\n- Pick number is correctly identified as 8th.\n- The team is indeed the BC Lions.\n- The player name matches exactly as Alexis Bwenge.\n\nGiven that all aspects of the claim are verified against the table and match perfectly, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.

We should identify if this player exists in the table.\n2. **Team and Trade Details**: The claim states that Nathan Hoffart plays for the Saskatchewan Roughriders (via Montreal). This implies he was traded to Saskatchewan from Montreal, so we need to verify both his team and any trade information.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Nathan Hoffart in the Table**:\n   - Scan the \"player\" column to find an entry named \"nathan hoffart\".\n   - We find him in row index 6 with a player name \"nathan hoffart\".\n\n2. **Verify Team Assignment and Trade Path**:\n   - Check the \"cfl team\" for Nathan Hoffart at row index 6.\n   - The entry shows \"saskatchewan roughriders (via montreal)\", which matches the claim that he plays for Saskatchewan Roughriders, having come via a trade from Montreal.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information are:\n- The player name in column \"player\" with row index 6.\n- The team and trade details in column \"cfl team\" with row index 6.\n\nBased on these checks, the claim is supported by the table.
