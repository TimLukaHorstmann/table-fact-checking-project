This row supports the claim.\n\n   - **Row Index 4**:\n     - Employed: 1970 - 2005\n     - Citation: it 's an honour\n     - The employment period partially overlaps with 1970 - 1996, but we need exact matching for the full range.\n     - Although this row has a citation match, the employed period does not exactly match 1970 - 1996.\n\n   - **Row Index 5**:\n     - Employed: 1966 - 1996\n     - Citation: it 's an honour\n     - The employment period partially overlaps with 1970 - 1996.\n     - Although this row has a citation match, the employed period does not exactly match 1970 - 1996.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Row Index 3 fully satisfies both conditions of the claim (employment period and citation).\n   - Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\", with relevant cells found in Row Index 3 for both columns \"employed\" and \"citation\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"employed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"citation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
