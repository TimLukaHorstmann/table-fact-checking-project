    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the team Ipatinga, we need to check two conditions mentioned in the claim: \n\n1. \"Ipatinga have lost more than 14 games.\"\n2. \"Ipatinga have drawn 8 games.\"\n\nWe will verify these conditions by examining the relevant cells from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n**Condition 1:** Check if Ipatinga have lost more than 14 games.\n- Look at the row corresponding to Ipatinga, which is in the 20th position (row index 19 because of zero-based indexing).\n- Identify the \"lost\" column and verify its value.\n\n**Relevant Cell for Condition 1:**\n- Row Index: 19\n- Column Name: lost\n\nUpon checking the table:\n- The value in the \"lost\" column for Ipatinga is 21.\n\nSince 21 is greater than 14, the first condition is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 2:** Check if Ipatinga have drawn 8 games.\n- Again, refer to the row corresponding to Ipatinga (row index 19).\n- Identify the \"drawn\" column and verify its value. Note that in this table, the number of drawn matches is represented under the \"drawn\" column.\n\n**Relevant Cell for Condition 2:**\n- Row Index: 19\n- Column Name: drawn\n\nUpon checking the table:\n- The value in the \"drawn\" column for Ipatinga is 8.\n\nSince 8 equals 8, the second condition is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are met based on the data from the table. Therefore, the entire claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"sport have a difference of 3 with 52 points,\" we need to verify two main pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. **Points for Sport**: The claim states that the team \"Sport\" has 52 points.\n2. **Difference for Sport**: The claim mentions a goal difference of 3 for the same team.\n\nWe will locate the row corresponding to \"Sport\" and check the relevant columns, namely \"points\" and \"difference.\"\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identifying the Row for Sport**:\n   - The table's rows are labeled by position numbers starting from 1 to 20.\n   - We need to find the team named \"sport.\" According to the table, \"Sport\" is listed at position number 11.\n\n2. **Checking Points and Difference for Sport**:\n   - In row 11 (position number), we check the \"points\" column: The value is 52.\n   - Next, in row 11, we examine the \"difference\" column: The value is 3.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied according to the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is supported by the information given.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- For \"points\": Row index is 10 (since indexing starts from zero) and the column name is \"points.\"\n- For \"difference\": Row index is also 10, and the column name is \"difference.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim can be confirmed as true.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"s\u00e3o paulo have no game draw\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant data for the team \"S\u00e3o Paulo.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Team**: The first step is to locate S\u00e3o Paulo in the table. According to the table, S\u00e3o Paulo is listed at position 1.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Column**: We are interested in the number of games drawn by S\u00e3o Paulo. In the context of a football league table:\n   - \"Drawn\" refers to matches that ended in a draw (neither team winning).\n\n3. **Check the Data**:\n   - For S\u00e3o Paulo, located at row index 0 (the first row after headers), look at the column labeled \"drawn.\"\n   - The value in this cell is 12.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that S\u00e3o Paulo has no games drawn.\n   - However, the table indicates they have drawn 12 games.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are 12 drawn games for S\u00e3o Paulo, the claim \"s\u00e3o paulo have no game draw\" is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**: \n   - The only relevant cell for verifying this claim is the one containing the number of draws for S\u00e3o Paulo, which is in row index 0 and column name \"drawn.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze it step by step against the provided table data.\n\nThe claim states:\n\"ipitanga get 75 point with less than 30 game play , 17 of them lost.\"\n\nLet's break down the components of this claim and check each condition:\n\n1. **Team Name**: The claim refers to \"ipitanga.\" We need to find \"ipitanga\" in the table under the \"team\" column.\n\n2. **Points**: According to the claim, \"ipitanga\" has 75 points. We need to verify if any row with \"ipitanga\" as a team name shows 75 points.\n\n3. **Games Played**: The claim states that \"ipitanga\" played less than 30 games. We must check if the number of games played (the \"played\" column) is fewer than 30 for the \"ipitanga\" row.\n\n4. **Games Lost**: Finally, the claim mentions that \"ipitanga\" lost 17 games. We need to confirm if the \"lost\" column value for \"ipitanga\" is 17.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- Searching for \"ipitanga\" in the \"team\" column:\n  - The team with name \"ipatinga\" appears on row index 19.\n  \n- Checking the points for \"ipatinga\":\n  - Row 19 shows that \"ipatinga\" has 35 points, not 75.\n\n- Checking games played by \"ipatinga\":\n  - Row 19 indicates that \"ipatinga\" played 38 games, which is more than 30.\n\n- Checking the number of losses for \"ipatinga\":\n  - Row 19 shows that \"ipatinga\" lost 21 games, not 17.\n\nSince none of the conditions in the claim are satisfied by any row in the table (particularly the one related to \"ipitanga\"), the claim is false. Furthermore, there's a discrepancy in team name (\"ipatanga\" vs. \"ipatinga\"), which further invalidates the claim.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this:\n- Team name verification: Row 19, Column \"team\"\n- Points verification: Row 19, Column \"points\"\n- Games played verification: Row 19, Column \"played\"\n- Games lost verification: Row 19, Column \"lost\"\n\nThus, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
