Count the total number of games and how many of these had scores greater than 100 by the team.\n\nThe table consists of 8 games (rows):\n\n- Game 75: Score is L 101 - 109 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 101, which is over 100\n- Game 76: Score is L 87 - 116 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 87, which is not over 100\n- Game 77: Score is W 101 - 81 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 101, which is over 100\n- Game 78: Score is W 98 - 86 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 98, which is not over 100\n- Game 79: Score is W 102 - 92 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 102, which is over 100\n- Game 80: Score is W 107 - 76 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 107, which is over 100\n- Game 81: Score is W 117 - 109 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 117, which is over 100\n- Game 82: Score is L 110 - 111 (OT) \u2192 Team scored 110, which is over 100\n\nNow, count the games where the team scored more than 100 points:\n\n- Games with scores > 100: 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82\n- Total such games = 6 out of 8\n\nCalculate the percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of games with score over 100}}{\\text{Total number of games}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{6}{8} \\right) \\times 100 = 75\\% \\]\n\nThe claim states that the team scored over 100 points in \"75%\" or more of their games, which matches our calculation.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.

Out of these, only Game 78 had a winning score under 100 points.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table, we need to examine specific aspects related to assists and their associated players in each game.\n\nThe claim states:\n1. The highest number of assists per game is 11.\n2. The lowest number of assists per game is 4.\n3. Both these numbers (11 and 4) are scores by Darnell Jackson.\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Highest Number of Assists\nWe need to find which game has the highest number of assists:\n- Game 75: Delonte West with 7 assists.\n- Game 76: LeBron James with 5 assists.\n- Game 77: LeBron James with 6 assists.\n- Game 78: LeBron James with 7 assists.\n- Game 79: LeBron James with 10 assists.\n- Game 80: LeBron James with 7 assists.\n- Game 81: Maurice Williams with 8 assists.\n- Game 82: Wally Szczerbiak with 8 assists.\n\nThe highest number of assists in a game is 10 by LeBron James in Game 79. The claim states the highest should be 11, which does not match any record in the table.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Lowest Number of Assists\nWe need to find which game has the lowest number of assists:\n- Game 75: Delonte West with 7 assists.\n- Game 76: LeBron James with 5 assists.\n- Game 77: LeBron James with 6 assists.\n- Game 78: LeBron James with 7 assists.\n- Game 79: LeBron James with 10 assists.\n- Game 80: LeBron James with 7 assists.\n- Game 81: Maurice Williams with 8 assists.\n- Game 82: Wally Szczerbiak with 8 assists.\n\nThe lowest number of assists is 5 by LeBron James in Game 76. The claim states the lowest should be 4, which does not match any record in the table.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Darnell Jackson's Assists\nWe need to check if Darnell Jackson scored either 11 or 4 assists:\n- In all games, Darnell Jackson is only listed with rebounds (8 rebounds in Game 82) and nowhere with assists.\n\nDarnell Jackson has not recorded any assists as per the table data. Therefore, he did not score 11 or 4 assists in any game.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll parts of the claim are incorrect based on the data:\n- The highest number of assists is 10 (not 11), scored by LeBron James.\n- The lowest number of assists is 5 (not 4).\n- Darnell Jackson has not recorded either 11 or 4 assists in any game.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells include those providing information on assists for each game and players involved:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
