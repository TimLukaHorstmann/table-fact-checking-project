    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about table entry \"no 37413\" is true or false, we need to verify specific conditions from the claim against the relevant cells in the provided HTML table:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The claim states that \"no 37413 have a description of 'br co - co class 37' and a livery of ew\".\n\n2. **Relevant Table Information**:\n   - Locate the row where the \"number & name\" is \"no 37413\". According to the table, this is located at `row_index` 11.\n   - For \"description\", check if it matches 'br co - co class 37'.\n   - For \"livery\", check if it matches 'ew'.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - From row 11 in the table:\n     - The \"number & name\" is indeed \"no 37413\".\n     - The \"description\" column contains 'br co - co class 37', which matches the claim.\n     - The \"livery\" column contains 'ews', not just 'ew'. This does not fully match the claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the livery mentioned in the table ('ews') does not exactly match the claimed 'ew', the conditions of the claim are not entirely satisfied.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE\". The relevant cells that were checked against the claim are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"number & name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"description\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"livery\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down:\n\n1. **\"description of liveriy\"**: This means we need to look at the \"livery\" column in the table.\n2. **\"of scotrail\"**: We should find a row where the livery is described as \"scotrail\".\n3. **\"be br bo - bo class 20\"**: We then check if the description of that particular row's \"number & name\" and \"description\" corresponds to \"br bo - bo class 20\".\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- The livery \"scotrail\" is found in the row with:\n  - **Row Index**: 11\n  - **Livery Column**: \"scotrail\"\n  - **Number & Name**: \"no 47643\"\n  - **Description**: \"br co - co class 47\"\n\nThe description and number do not match \"br bo - bo class 20\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 11 for the column \"livery\" (where it says \"scotrail\").\n- Row index 11 for the columns \"number & name\" and \"description\" to confirm they do not match \"br bo - bo class 20\".\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"livery\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"number & name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"description\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
