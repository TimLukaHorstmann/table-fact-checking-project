    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the following conditions in the context of the given table:\n\n1. **Bronze Medal Count More Than 1:** We look for rows where the \"bronze\" column value is greater than 1.\n2. **Silver Medal Count Fewer Than 1:** For those rows identified above, check if the \"silver\" column value is less than 1.\n3. **Rank of 8:** Finally, confirm that the row with these conditions has a rank of 8.\n\nLet's evaluate each condition step-by-step:\n\n- **Rows with Bronze > 1:**\n  - Bahamas: bronze = 10\n  - Puerto Rico: bronze = 10\n  - Colombia: bronze = 5\n\n- **From these, check Silver < 1:**\n  - Bahamas: silver = 3 (does not satisfy)\n  - Puerto Rico: silver = 1 (does not satisfy)\n  - Colombia: silver = 2 (does not satisfy)\n\nNone of the rows with more than one bronze medal have fewer than one silver medal.\n\n- **Check for Rank 8:** This step is unnecessary since no row satisfies both the bronze and silver conditions. However, for completeness:\n  - The rank 8 belongs to Bermuda, which has bronze = 2, so it doesn't meet the \"bronze > 1 and silver < 1\" condition.\n\nSince there are no rows that satisfy all three conditions (bronze medal count more than 1, silver medal count fewer than 1, and a rank of 8), the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim include those for bronze, silver, and rank for all potential candidates:\n\n- Bahamas:\n  - Bronze: row index 2\n  - Silver: row index 2\n  - Rank: row index 2\n\n- Puerto Rico:\n  - Bronze: row index 4\n  - Silver: row index 4\n  - Rank: row index 4\n\n- Colombia:\n  - Bronze: row index 6\n  - Silver: row index 6\n  - Rank: row index 6\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
