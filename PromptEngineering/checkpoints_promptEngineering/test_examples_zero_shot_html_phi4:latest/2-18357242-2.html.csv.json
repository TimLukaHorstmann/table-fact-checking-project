    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of it with respect to the provided table:\n\n1. **Claim Breakdown:**\n   - \"The player on the Patrick Racing team...\"\n     - We need to identify drivers associated with \"Patrick Racing.\"\n\n2. \"...with fewer than 2 points...\"\n   - Check for drivers from \"Patrick Racing\" who have less than 2 points.\n\n3. \"...and grid larger than 4...\"\n   - Ensure those drivers also started (had a grid position) greater than 4.\n\n4. \"...be Ryan Hunter-Reay and Oriol Servi\u00e0.\"\n   - Verify if the drivers meeting all above conditions are indeed \"Ryan Hunter-Reay\" and \"Oriol Servi\u00e0.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Patrick Racing Team Members:**\n   - From the table, look for entries with the team name as \"Patrick Racing\":\n     - Row 11: Oriol Servi\u00e0\n\n2. **Check Points Condition (< 2 points):**\n   - For Oriol Servi\u00e0 (Row 11), check his points:\n     - Points = 0 (which is less than 2).\n\n3. **Check Grid Position (> 4):**\n   - For Oriol Servi\u00e0 (Row 11), check the grid position:\n     - Grid = 4 (not greater than 4). This does not meet the condition.\n\n4. **Verify if it includes Ryan Hunter-Reay:**\n   - Check the team for Ryan Hunter-Reay:\n     - Row 12: American Spirit Team Johansson, so not on Patrick Racing.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Oriol Servi\u00e0 is the only driver from Patrick Racing but doesn't meet the grid condition (>4).\n   - Ryan Hunter-Reay does not belong to Patrick Racing at all.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conditions of the claim are not satisfied as stated because no drivers on the \"Patrick Racing\" team have fewer than 2 points and a starting position larger than 4.
