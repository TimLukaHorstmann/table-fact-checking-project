    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the statement against the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"essendon, the away team, play at yarraville oval.\"\n\nWe need to break down this claim into two main parts:\n1. Essendon is the away team.\n2. The venue for this game is Yarraville Oval.\n\nLet's examine these points:\n\n### 1. Checking if Essendon is the Away Team\n- We will look at each row in the table and check both the \"away team\" column to see if Essendon is listed there, as well as the \"home team\" column to confirm they are not playing at home.\n\n### 2. Checking if Yarraville Oval is the Venue\n- Once we identify the row where Essendon is the away team, we need to check the \"venue\" column to see if it lists Yarraville Oval.\n\nNow, let's go through each relevant row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Home Team: Melbourne\n   - Away Team: Richmond\n   - Venue: Punt Road Oval\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Home Team: Carlton\n   - Away Team: South Melbourne\n   - Venue: Princes Park\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Home Team: St Kilda\n   - Away Team: Hawthorn\n   - Venue: Toorak Park\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Home Team: North Melbourne\n   - Away Team: Fitzroy\n   - Venue: Arden Street Oval\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Home Team: Footscray\n   - Away Team: Essendon\n   - Venue: Yarraville Oval\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- In Row 4, Essendon is listed as the away team.\n- The venue for this match is indeed Yarraville Oval.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Hence, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's provide the relevant cells:\n\n- Row Index: 4\n  - Column Name: \"away team\" (Essendon)\n  - Column Name: \"venue\" (Yarraville Oval)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
