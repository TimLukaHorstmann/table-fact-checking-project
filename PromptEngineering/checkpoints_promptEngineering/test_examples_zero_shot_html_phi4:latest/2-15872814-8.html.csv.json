    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table data, we need to verify three conditions from the table:\n\n1. The game was played in Atlanta.\n2. The score was \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\".\n3. Rafer Alston had 8 high assists.\n\nLet's examine these conditions row by row based on the relevant columns (\"team\", \"score\", and \"high assists\") from the table:\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - **Team**: Atlanta\n  - **Score**: w 109 - 101 (ot)\n  - **High Assists**: Rafer Alston (8)\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are met in Row 4. Let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- \"team\" column with value \"atlanta\" at row index 4.\n- \"score\" column with value \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" at row index 4.\n- \"high assists\" column mentioning \"rafer alston (8)\" at row index 4.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in Row 4. The relevant cells are:\n\n1. Column: \"team\", Row Index: 4\n2. Column: \"score\", Row Index: 4\n3.

The score should be \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" for that particular game.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row and columns from the table:\n\n- **Row Index:** We need to identify the row where the date is \"april 8.\" Scanning through the table, we find this information in the second column labeled \"date.\"\n\n- **Date Verification:**\n  - Row index 4 has \"april 8\" under the \"date\" column.\n\n- **Score Verification:**\n  - In the same row (index 4), check the \"score\" column to see if it matches \"w 109 - 101 (ot).\"\n\nAfter checking these conditions:\n\n- The date in row index 4 is indeed \"april 8.\"\n- The score in the same row is \"w 109 - 101 (ot).\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"April 18 have the score higher than w 109 - 101 (ot)\", we need to examine the table for any game played on April 18 and compare its score with the score mentioned in the claim (\"w 109 - 101 (ot)\").\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Date:**\n   - The claim specifies \"April 18\". We need to check if there is a game listed on this date in the table.\n   \n2. **Search for April 18 Entry:**\n   - As we go through each row, we look at the \"date\" column to find any entry corresponding to \"april 18\".\n\n3. **Verify Game Entries:**\n   - Upon reviewing the table rows:\n     - Row 1: Date is \"april 1\"\n     - Row 2: Date is \"april 3\"\n     - Row 3: Date is \"april 6\"\n     - Row 4: Date is \"april 8\"\n     - Row 5: Date is \"april 9\"\n     - Row 6: Date is \"april 11\"\n     - Row 7: Date is \"april 12\"\n     - Row 8: Date is \"april 15\"\n     - Row 9: Date is \"april 17\"\n     - Row 10: Date is \"april 19\"\n\n   - There is no row with the date \"april 18\". Therefore, there is no game entry for April 18 in the table.\n\n4. **Compare Scores (if applicable):**\n   - Since there is no game on April 18, we cannot compare any score to \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\" because such a score does not exist in the table for that date.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim specifies a condition involving an event (a game with a certain score) on April 18, which is absent from the data provided.\n   - Thus, it cannot be true that \"April 18 have the score higher than w 109 - 101 (ot)\" because there is no game or score recorded for April 18.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. The relevant cell to verify this would have been in the \"date\" column for any potential entry corresponding to April 18, but such an entry does not exist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
