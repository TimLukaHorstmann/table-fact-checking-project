    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table provided:\n\nThe claim states: \"the green party lose a percentage of the popular vote from 2004 to 2006.\"\n\nWe will focus on the \"% of popular vote\" column for the years 2004 and 2006.\n\n1. **For the year 2004:**\n   - Row Index: 5\n   - Column: `% of popular vote`\n   - Value: `4.32%`\n\n2. **For the year 2006:**\n   - Row Index: 6\n   - Column: `% of popular vote`\n   - Value: `4.48%`\n\nBy comparing these values, we observe that the percentage of the popular vote increased from 4.32% in 2004 to 4.48% in 2006.\n\nSince there is an increase rather than a decrease in the percentage of the popular vote from 2004 to 2006, the claim that \"the green party lose a percentage of the popular vote\" is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying this are:\n- Row Index 5, Column \"% of popular vote\"\n- Row Index 6, Column \"% of popular vote\"\n\nThe JSON object reflecting these findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"% of popular vote\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
