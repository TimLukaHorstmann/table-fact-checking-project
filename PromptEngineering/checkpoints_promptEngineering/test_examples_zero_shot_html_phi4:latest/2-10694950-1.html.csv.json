The year 1962.\n2. Whether there were 12 stages.\n3. Whether the total distance was 1870.23 kilometers.\n\nNow, let's verify these points with the table data:\n\n- **Year:** Look for the row corresponding to 1962. The table has a row labeled \"1962\".\n- **Stages:** For the year 1962, check the value in the \"stages\" column. It shows there are 12 stages.\n- **Distance:** Check the \"distance\" column for the 1962 row. It lists the distance as \"1870.23 km\".\n\nBased on these checks:\n- The row index for the year 1962 is 10 (considering a zero-based index).\n- The relevant columns are \"stages\" and \"distance\".\n- Both conditions of having 12 stages and a total distance of 1870.23 kilometers match the table data.\n\nSince all parts of the claim align perfectly with the information in the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's format this conclusion into the required JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"stages\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"distance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"less than 1648 km be achieve in stage 9\" is true or false, we need to focus on two specific columns from the table: \"stages\" and \"distance\". The relevant condition involves checking if there are any entries where the number of stages equals 9, and for those entries, verifying whether the corresponding distance is less than 1648 km.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n1. **Row Index 0**: \n   - Stages: 4\n   - Distance: 418 km\n\n2. **Row Index 1**: \n   - Stages: 5\n   - Distance: 1057 km\n\n3. **Row Index 2**: \n   - Stages: 6\n   - Distance: 1155 km\n\n4. **Row Index 3**: \n   - Stages: 7\n   - Distance: 1517 km\n\n5. **Row Index 4**: \n   - Stages: 8\n   - Distance: 1634 km\n\n6. **Row Index 5**: \n   - Stages: 9\n   - Distance: 1648 km\n\n7. **Row Index 6**: \n   - Stages: 12\n   - Distance: 2167 km\n\n8. **Row Index 7**: \n   - Stages: 12\n   - Distance: 1870.23 km\n\n9. **Row Index 8**: \n   - Stages: 14\n   - Distance: 2334.38 km\n\n10. **Row Index 9**: \n    - Stages: 14\n    - Distance: 1967.60 km\n\n11. **Row Index 10**: \n    - Stages: 14\n    - Distance: 2049.31 km\n\n12. **Row Index 11**: \n    - Stages: 15\n    - Distance: 1999.82 km\n\n13. **Row Index 12**: \n    - Stages: 8\n    - Distance: 1634 km\n\n14. **Row Index 13**:\n    - Cancelled (No relevant data)\n\n15. **Row Index 14**:\n    - Cancelled (No relevant data)\n\n16. **Row Index 15**:\n    - Cancelled (No relevant data)\n\n17. **Row Index 16**: \n    - Stages: 10\n    - Distance: 1214 km\n\n18. **Row Index 17**: \n    - Stages: 18\n    - Distance: 2540.95 km\n\n19. **Row Index 18**: \n    - Stages: 15\n    - Distance: 2207.87 km\n\n20. **Row Index 19**: \n    - Stages: 6\n    - Distance: 2200 km\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that in Row Index 5 (the only row where the number of stages is exactly 9), the distance is exactly 1648 km, not less than 1648 km.\n\nTherefore, there is no entry in the table where a stage 9 race achieves less than 1648 km. The claim \"less than 1648 km be achieve in stage 9\" is thus false.\n\nRelevant cells for this verification are from Row Index 5:\n\n- \"stages\": row_index = 5\n- \"distance\": row_index = 5\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"stages\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"distance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
