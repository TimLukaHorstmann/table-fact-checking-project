    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify several key aspects of the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Date and Opponent**: The claim states an event occurred on August 1st against the Lions.\n2. **Location**: The claim mentions Ivor Wynne Stadium as the location for this game.\n3. **Score and Outcome**: According to the claim, the team lost with a score of 41 - 52 in overtime.\n4. **Record**: The claim asserts that after this game, their record was 3 - 3.\n\nLet's go through these points using the table:\n\n- **Date and Opponent**: \n  - In row 4, we have a date \"August 1\" and opponent \"Lions\", matching the first part of the claim.\n  \n- **Location**:\n  - The same row indicates that the location was \"bc place stadium\", not Ivor Wynne Stadium as claimed. This immediately contradicts the location aspect of the claim.\n\n- **Score and Outcome**:\n  - Row 4 shows a final score of \"l 52 - 41 (ot)\" which means they lost with the scores mentioned, but at bc place stadium, not Ivor Wynne Stadium.\n  \n- **Record**: \n  - The record after this game in row 4 is given as \"3 - 1\", not \"3 - 3\" as stated in the claim.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The location of the game is incorrect according to the table (bc place stadium instead of Ivor Wynne Stadium).\n- The resulting record from the game doesn't match the claimed record.\n\nTherefore, based on discrepancies in the location and resulting record, the claim is false.
