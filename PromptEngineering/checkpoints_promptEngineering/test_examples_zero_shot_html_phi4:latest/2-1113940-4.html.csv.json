    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The period during which Terry Butcher managed.\n2. Terry Butcher's win percentage.\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n- **Identify Terry Butcher's Management Period**: \n  - From the table, Terry Butcher's management period is listed as \"july 2006 - february 2007\". This can be found in the first column (\"name\") and second column (\"period\") of row index 1.\n\n- **Check Terry Butcher's Win Percentage**:\n  - In the same row (row index 1), the win percentage for Terry Butcher is \"39%\".\n\n- **Verify the Claimed Period and Win Percentage**:\n  - The claim states that Terry Butcher had a win percentage of \"50%\" during \"october 2007 - march 2009\".\n  - According to the table, another manager (John Kosmina) managed during \"october 2007 - march 2009\", not Terry Butcher.\n  - Furthermore, Terry Butcher's actual win percentage is \"39%\", not \"50%\".\n\nGiven these observations, the claim does not match any data in the table regarding either the period or the win percentage for Terry Butcher.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\". The relevant cells are those that provide information about Terry Butcher\u2019s management period and his win percentage:\n\n- Row index 1, Column name: \"period\"\n- Row index 1, Column name: \"win %\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"period\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on the relevant period specified in it: \"may 2012 - 11 november 2012.\" According to the table:\n\n1. **Ian Crook** managed matches from May 2012 to November 11, 2012.\n   - Matches Managed: 6\n   - Matches Lost: 4\n\nThe claim states that no match was lost when the number of matches managed was over 2 during this period.
