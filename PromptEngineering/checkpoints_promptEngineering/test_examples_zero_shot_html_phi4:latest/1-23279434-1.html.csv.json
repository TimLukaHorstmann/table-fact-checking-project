According to the table, the column that contains the season information is labeled \"season\".\n   \n2. **Check Production Code for Season 1:**\n   - For each row corresponding to season 1, examine the value in the \"production code\" column to verify if it matches `am01`.\n\n### Examination of Relevant Rows:\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - \"season\": 1\n  - \"production code\": am01\n\nThis is the only row where the season is specified as 1 and the production code is indeed `am01`. Thus, this supports the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe information from row index 2 in columns \"season\" and \"production code\" confirms that the production code for season 1 is `am01`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify several conditions using the table provided:\n\n1. The episode title must be \"forbidden fruits.\"\n2. The director of this episode should be Jeremy Kagan.\n3. The first air date for this episode should be March 2, 1998.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions by examining relevant rows in the table:\n\n- **Episode Title:**\n  - The claim states \"the forbidden fruit episode.\" In the table, the title is spelled as \"forbidden fruits\" (row with index 15). Despite a slight difference in wording (\"fruits\" vs. \"fruit\"), it's reasonable to interpret them as referring to the same episode.\n\n- **Director:**\n  - According to the claim, Jeremy Kagan directed the episode. In row 16 of the table, Jeremy Kagan is listed as the director for the episode with title \"forbidden fruits.\" This condition matches.\n\n- **Air Date:**\n  - The claim specifies that the first air date should be March 2, 1998. In row 16, the air date is indeed listed as March 2, 1998. This condition also matches.\n\nSince all conditions are verified and match the information in the table:\n\n- Row index 15 (corresponding to \"forbidden fruits\" title).\n- Column names: \"Title,\" \"Directed by,\" and \"First aired.\"\n\nAll relevant cells confirm the claim is true.

The key aspects to verify include identifying which rows correspond to \"season 1\" and checking their associated production codes.\n\n**Steps for Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows for Season 1**: \n   - From the table, each row represents an episode with specific attributes such as \"row_index\", \"column_name\" values including \"season number\" (under column \"Season\"), \"production code\" (under column \"Production Code\").\n\n2. **Check Production Codes for Season 1**:\n   - Look at all rows where the \"Season\" value is \"1\".\n   - Examine the corresponding production codes in these rows to see if any of them are \"am11\".\n\n3. **Relevant Data Points from Table**:\n\n- Row with row_index: 0, and season number column is missing.\n- Row with row_index: 1: Season = 1, Production Code = am01\n- Row with row_index: 2: Season = 1, Production Code = am02\n- Row with row_index: 3: Season = 1, Production Code = am03\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - None of the episodes in season 1 have a production code \"am11\". All identified codes for this season are am01, am02, and am03.\n   - The production code \"am11\" corresponds to a different row (row_index: 11) where the Season is 2.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- **Conclusion**: The claim \"season 1 use production code am11\" is not supported by the data. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE\".\n\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row indices that are relevant for checking season 1's production codes are 1, 2, and 3 (with respect to the Season and Production Code columns).\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Production Code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
