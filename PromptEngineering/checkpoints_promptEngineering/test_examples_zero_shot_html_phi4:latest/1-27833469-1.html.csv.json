Series number is `105` at row index 12.\n2. US viewers are `15.8 million` at row index 12.\n\nTherefore, both pieces of information required to verify the claim are found and confirmed as correct.\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"US viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
