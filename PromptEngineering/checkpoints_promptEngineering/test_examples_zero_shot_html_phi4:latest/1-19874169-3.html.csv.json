    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz,\" we need to verify if there is an entry in the table indicating a broadcasting frequency of 101.1 MHz by Yes! FM.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim specifically mentions a frequency of 101.1 MHz, so we need to focus on the \"frequency\" column and any related rows where this value is present.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - The table has multiple columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location.\n   - We are particularly interested in the \"frequency\" column for checking if 101.1 MHz appears.\n\n3. **Check Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Frequency is listed as \"101.1 mhz.\"\n     - This matches the claim's frequency exactly.\n     - The branding in this row is \"yes! fm 101.1,\" which confirms that Yes! FM is indeed broadcasting at this frequency.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a matching entry for both the frequency (101.1 MHz) and the brand (Yes! FM), the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell is in row 0 of the \"frequency\" column.\n   - Additionally, the branding confirms Yes! FM's involvement, so the cell from the \"branding\" column in the same row is also relevant.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true. Here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"branding\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
