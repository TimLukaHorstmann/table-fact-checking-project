    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"justin rose be from the united state\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table where information about Justin Rose's player details is given. Specifically, we should focus on his country.\n\n1. **Locate Justin Rose in the Table:**\n   - By examining the provided table, identify the row that lists \"justin rose (a)\" under the \"player\" column.\n   \n2. **Check Country for Justin Rose:**\n   - Look at the corresponding cell in the \"country\" column for this row to see which country Justin Rose is associated with.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that Justin Rose is from the United States, so we need to verify whether the \"country\" column indicates \"united states\" for his entry.\n\n4. **Determine Result:**\n   - If the country listed for Justin Rose is indeed \"united states,\" then the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.\n\nLet's apply these steps using the table data:\n\n- From the table, we identify the row where Justin Rose appears:\n  ```\n  <tr>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>justin rose (a)</td>\n    <td>england</td>\n    <td>72 + 66 + 75 = 213</td>\n    <td>+ 3</td>\n  </tr>\n  ```\n- The relevant cells for this row are:\n  - \"player\" column: contains \"justin rose (a)\"\n  - \"country\" column: contains \"england\"\n\nGiven that the country listed for Justin Rose is \"england,\" and not \"united states,\" the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant cells to verify this are in row index 5, specifically under the columns:\n  - \"player\"\n  - \"country\"\n\nThe JSON response based on this evaluation would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index starts from 0 in Python indexing; hence Justin Rose is at index 4.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods,\" we need to compare their positions as listed in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Thomas Bj\u00f8rn is listed on row 6 with a ranking of \"t6\" (tied for 6th place).\n   - Tiger Woods is also listed on row 9, sharing the same rank of \"t6\" (tied for 6th place).\n\n2. **Analyze Their Rankings:**\n   - Both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods are tied at the same position (\"t6\"), meaning they have an identical ranking in terms of placement.\n\n3. **Determine the Truth Value of the Claim:**\n   - Since both players share the same rank, it is incorrect to state that one ranks lower than the other.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For Thomas Bj\u00f8rn:\n     - Row index 6, column \"place\": \"t6\"\n     - Row index 6, column \"player\": \"thomas bj\u00e3rn\" (note the special character encoding which should be \"bj\u00f8rn\")\n   - For Tiger Woods:\n     - Row index 9, column \"place\": \"t6\"\n     - Row index 9, column \"player\": \"tiger woods\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.
