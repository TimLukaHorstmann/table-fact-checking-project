The position listed is \"right wing\", which matches the claim.\n2. The pick number is 146, which also matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"right wing, rene lampert, be pick 145th,\" we need to verify three components against the provided table:\n\n1. **Position**: Check if Rene Lambert is listed as a \"Right Wing.\"\n2. **Player Name**: Confirm that Rene Lambert's name appears in the correct row.\n3. **Pick Number**: Ensure Rene Lambert is associated with pick number 145.\n\nLet's analyze these one by one using the table data provided:\n\n- **Row Index 144**:\n  - `player`: Garry Howatt\n  - `position`: Left Wing\n  - Since this player and position do not match, it\u2019s not relevant for verifying Rene Lambert.\n\n- **Row Index 145**:\n  - `player`: Steve Lyon\n  - `position`: Defence\n  - The claim mentions pick number 145, but the name \"Rene Lambert\" does not appear here. Therefore, this row is irrelevant to checking if Rene Lambert is picked 145th or has the right wing position.\n\n- **Row Index 146**:\n  - `player`: Rene Lambert\n  - `position`: Right Wing\n  - This matches both the player name and position specified in the claim.\n  - However, Rene Lambert\u2019s pick number here is 146, not 145 as stated in the claim. Hence, this row confirms the name and position but contradicts the pick number.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n- Row Index 146, `player`: \"rene lambert\"\n- Row Index 146, `position`: \"right wing\"\n- Row Index 146, `pick`: This is where we find that Rene Lambert's actual pick number is 146, not 145.\n\nGiven these observations, while the position and player name match the claim when considering row index 146, the pick number does not. Therefore, the entire claim is false because it inaccurately states the pick number for Rene Lambert as being 145th.\n\nThe JSON object with this evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 146, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 146, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 146, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
