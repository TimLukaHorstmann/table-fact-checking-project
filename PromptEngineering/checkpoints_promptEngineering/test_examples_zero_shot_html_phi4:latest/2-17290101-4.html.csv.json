    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"there be 10 golfer tie for place at the end of the 1959 US Open,\" we need to analyze the provided table and count how many golfers share the same finishing position.\n\n### Analyzing the Table\n\n1. **Positioning:**\n   - The column `place` gives the rankings.\n   - Positions are denoted as \"tX\" for ties, where X is the number of players tied for that place.\n\n2. **Identifying Ties:**\n   - \"t2\": Three golfers (Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Ben Hogan) are tied for 2nd place.\n   - \"t5\": Two golfers (Mike Souchak, Doug Ford) are tied for 5th place.\n   - \"t7\": Two golfers (Ernie Vossler, Dow Finsterwald) are tied for 7th place.\n   - \"t9\": Three golfers (Jay Hebert, Claude Harmon, Gene Littler) are tied for 9th place.\n\n3. **Counting Total Golfers:**\n   - Position 1: Billy Casper is in 1st place.\n   - Tied positions:\n     - t2: 3 golfers\n     - t5: 2 golfers\n     - t7: 2 golfers\n     - t9: 3 golfers\n\n4. **Total Number of Golfers:**\n   - Total = 1 (from place 1) + 3 (t2) + 2 (t5) + 2 (t7) + 3 (t9) = 11 golfers.\n\n### Evaluating the Claim\n\nThe claim states there are \"10 golfer tie for place.\" However, from our analysis:\n- There are 4 distinct tied groups.\n- The total number of golfers is 11, not 10.\n- Not all players are in a tied position; only 9 out of 11 are tied.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is incorrect because it suggests all 10 golfers are tied for the same place, which is not supported by the table. Additionally, there are 11 golfers listed, not 10.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify this conclusion, we need to examine:\n- The `place` column for each row to identify ties.\n- All rows since they collectively describe all golfers and their positions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
