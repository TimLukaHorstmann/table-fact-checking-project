    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the language for villa alcal\u00e1 municipality 1167 be quechua,\" we need to analyze the given HTML table and identify relevant cells related to this statement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim is about a specific number (1167) being associated with the Quechua language in the context of the Villa Alcal\u00e1 municipality.\n   - We need to verify if 1167 corresponds to the Quechua language for the Villa Alcal\u00e1 municipality.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Cells**:\n   - The table is structured with languages as rows and municipalities as columns.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"quechua\" to find the relevant data for this language.\n   - Identify the column associated with \"villa alcal\u00e1 municipality\" to verify if it contains the number 1167.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - From the table, locate the \"quechua\" row: \n     ```\n     <tr>\n       <td>quechua</td>\n       <td>2181</td>\n       <td>7831</td>\n       <td>6261</td>\n       <td>1167</td>\n       <td>1264</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n   - Check the cell under \"villa alcal\u00e1 municipality\" for the Quechua row. The value is indeed 1167.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is true because the number 1167 corresponds to the Quechua language in the Villa Alcal\u00e1 municipality column.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell is found at the intersection of the \"quechua\" row and the \"villa alcal\u00e1 municipality\" column.\n   - In terms of indices, the \"quechua\" row is the first row of data (index 0 if we consider only data rows), and the \"villa alcal\u00e1 municipality\" column is the fourth column.\n\nThus, the JSON object representing this verification is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"villa alcal\u00e1 municipality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
