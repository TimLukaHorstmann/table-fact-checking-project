    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"there be 6 driver that couldn't finish the 1998 monaco grand prix race,\" we need to determine which drivers did not complete all 78 laps. Drivers who finished fewer than 78 laps or were classified as 'did not qualify' (DNQ) are considered as not finishing.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table to find relevant entries:\n\n1. **Row 4**: Jacques Villeneuve, Arrows - Finished 77 laps (+1 lap).\n2. **Row 5**: Pedro Diniz, Arrows - Finished 77 laps (+1 lap).\n3. **Row 6**: Johnny Herbert, Sauber - Petronas - Finished 77 laps (+1 lap).\n4. **Row 7**: Damon Hill, Jordan - Mugen - Honda - Finished 76 laps (+2 laps).\n5. **Row 8**: Shinji Nakano, Minardi - Ford - Finished 76 laps (+2 laps).\n6. **Row 9**: Michael Schumacher, Ferrari - Finished 76 laps (+2 laps).\n7. **Row 10**: Toranosuke Takagi, Tyrrell - Ford - Finished 76 laps (+2 laps).\n8. **Rows 11 to 17**: These rows contain drivers with fewer than 78 laps due to technical issues or accidents (gearbox, suspension, etc.).\n9. **Row 18**: David Coulthard, McLaren - Mercedes - Finished 17 laps (engine failure).\n10. **Row 19**: Rubens Barrichello, Stewart - Ford - Finished 11 laps (suspension issue).\n11. **Row 20**: Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Williams - Mecachrome - Finished 9 laps (collision).\n12. **Row 21**: Esteban Tuero, Minardi - Ford - Completed 0 laps (spun off).\n13. **Row 22**: Riccardo Rosset, Tyrrell - Ford - Did not qualify (DNQ).\n\nNow, let's identify the drivers who didn't finish the race:\n\n- Jacques Villeneuve\n- Pedro Diniz\n- Johnny Herbert\n- Damon Hill\n- Shinji Nakano\n- Michael Schumacher\n- Toranosuke Takagi\n- Jarno Trulli (Row 14)\n- Jan Magnussen (Row 15)\n- David Coulthard\n- Rubens Barrichello\n- Heinz-Harald Frentzen\n- Esteban Tuero\n- Riccardo Rosset\n\nCounting these, we find there are more than six drivers who did not finish the race.
