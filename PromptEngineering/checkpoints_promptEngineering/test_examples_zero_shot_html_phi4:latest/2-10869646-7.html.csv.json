This event occurred in March 1974.\n3. It was the match with the most significant crowd for that date.\n\nLet's verify these points:\n\n1. **Venue and Crowd Size:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - The row where \"lake oval\" is listed has a \"crowd\" value of 10,239.\n   - This supports the first part of the claim about the venue and crowd size.\n\n2. **Date of the Event:**\n   - The same row indicates the date as \"18 May 1974.\"\n   - The claim states that this occurred in March 1974, which is incorrect according to the table data.\n   - Therefore, the second part of the claim about the date is false.\n\n3. **Most Significant Crowd Size:**\n   - We need to compare the crowd size for \"lake oval\" with all other matches on the same date (18 May 1974).\n     - geelong vs north melbourne at kardinia park had a crowd of 24,685.\n     - essendon vs richmond at windy hill had a crowd of 24,376.\n     - south melbourne vs melbourne at lake oval had a crowd of 10,239 (this is the relevant match).\n     - st kilda vs collingwood at moorabbin oval had a crowd of 27,876.\n     - hawthorn vs carlton at princes park had a crowd of 21,202.\n     - footscray vs fitzroy at vfl park had a crowd of 19,450.\n\n   - The largest crowds were at moorabbin oval (27,876) and kardinia park (24,685).\n   - Hence, the match at lake oval did not have the most significant crowd; it actually had one of the smallest.\n   - Therefore, the third part of the claim about having the most significant crowd is false.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- The claim about \"lake oval\" holding a crowd of 10,239 on March 1974 and that being the highest for a match is entirely incorrect due to errors in both date and crowd size comparison.\n  \nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim about teams scoring over 100 points in the given table from the 1974 season:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. The claim states there are three teams that scored over 100 points: Footscray, Hawthorn, and St Kilda.\n2. It also asserts all other teams scored only 50 or fewer points.\n\n### Table Examination:\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Home Team: Geelong (59 points)\n  - Away Team: North Melbourne (90 points)\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team: Essendon (105 points)\n  - Away Team: Richmond (115 points)\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team: South Melbourne (94 points)\n  - Away Team: Melbourne (76 points)\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Home Team: St Kilda (82 points)\n  - Away Team: Collingwood (88 points)\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Home Team: Hawthorn (100 points)\n  - Away Team: Carlton (60 points)\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team: Footscray (87 points)\n  - Away Team: Fitzroy (60 points)\n\n### Verifying the Claim:\n\n1. **Teams Scoring Over 100 Points**:\n   - Essendon scored 105 points.\n   - Richmond scored 115 points.\n   - Hawthorn scored exactly 100 points.\n\n2. **Footscray's Score**:\n   - Footscray scored 87 points, not over 100.\n\n3. **St Kilda's Score**:\n   - St Kilda scored 82 points, not over 100.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Only Essendon and Richmond have scores over 100.\n- Hawthorn exactly reached 100, but did not exceed it.\n- Footscray and St Kilda did not score over 100.\n- The claim about the teams scoring over 100 is incorrect as only two teams (not three) exceeded 100 points.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo support this conclusion, we examine the scores from all rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
