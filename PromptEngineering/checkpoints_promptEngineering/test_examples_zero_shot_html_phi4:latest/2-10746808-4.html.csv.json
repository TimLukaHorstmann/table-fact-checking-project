This matches the teams mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **Result of the Game**: According to the claim, Collingwood lost to Melbourne by 5 points.\n   - The scores provided are:\n     - Home team (Collingwood): 12.12 (84)\n     - Away team (Melbourne): 12.7 (79)\n   - To verify the result, calculate the point difference: \n     \\[\n     84 \\text{ (Collingwood score)} - 79 \\text{ (Melbourne score)} = 5\n     \\]\n   - Collingwood actually won by 5 points, not lost. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n3. **Attendance**: The claim states there were 15,000 spectators.\n   - In the first row under \"crowd\", it lists 15000, which matches the claim.\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n- The team matchup and crowd size are correct according to the table.\n- However, the result mentioned in the claim (Collingwood losing by 5 points) is incorrect because Collingwood won instead.\n\nThe relevant data for verifying this claim is found in the first row of the table. Specifically, the columns \"home team\", \"away team\", \"home team score\", \"away team score\", and \"crowd\" are relevant to check all parts of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
