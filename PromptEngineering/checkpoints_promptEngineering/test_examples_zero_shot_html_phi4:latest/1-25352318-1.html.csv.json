Identify which rows (or entries) correspond to a team achieving exactly one win.\n2. Count how many unique teams are associated with these wins.\n\n### Relevant Data from the Table:\n\nFrom the table, let's focus on the columns \"team\" and \"wins\" since these will help us determine the number of wins per team.\n\n- **Identify entries with 1 win:**\n\n  - Row 2:  \n    - Team: epsilon euskadi\n    - Wins: 1\n\n  - Row 3:  \n    - Team: epsilon euskadi\n    - Wins: 1\n  \n  - Row 4:\n    - Team: international dracoracing\n    - Wins: 1\n    \n- **Unique Teams with Exactly One Win:**\n\n  - **epsilon euskadi** (Row 2 and 3)\n  - **international dracoracing** (Row 4)\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that there are exactly two unique teams that have achieved one win.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that only 2 teams have 1 win in all the games.
