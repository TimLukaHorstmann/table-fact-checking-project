Hawthorn's away team score is indeed 9.6 (or 60).\n2. Geelong\u2019s score should be such that the difference between their score and Hawthorn\u2019s score is 1.5.\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. **Hawthorn's Away Team Score:**\n   - From row 0, we have:\n     - Column \"away team\" has \"hawthorn\".\n     - Column \"away team score\" has \"9.6 (60)\".\n   - This confirms Hawthorn's away team score is 9.6.\n\n2. **Geelong\u2019s Score:**\n   - From row 1, we have:\n     - Column \"home team\" has \"richmond\".\n     - Column \"away team\" has \"geelong\".\n     - Column \"away team score\" has \"10.11 (71)\".\n   - Geelong's score is 10.11.\n\nNow, calculate the difference between Geelong\u2019s and Hawthorn\u2019s scores:\n\n- Convert the scores to a common format:\n  - Hawthorn's score: 9.6\n  - Geelong's score: 10.11\n\n- Calculate the difference:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Difference} = 10.11 - 9.6 = 0.51\n  \\]\n\nThe claim states that Hawthorn\u2019s score should be lower by 1.5 compared to Geelong\u2019s score, but we calculated a difference of only 0.51.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 0, Column \"away team score\" for Hawthorn's score.\n- Row index 1, Column \"away team score\" for Geelong's score.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table provided in HTML format, we need to break down the statement into its components and verify each part against the data.\n\nThe claim is: \"4 games be held on 3 June 1933 and none of it be in arden punt road oval.\"\n\nLet's dissect this:\n\n1. **\"4 games be held on 3 June 1933\"**:\n   - We need to check how many rows (games) have the date \"3 june 1933\".\n   - From the table, examine the 'date' column for each row.\n\n2. **\"none of it be in arden punt road oval\"**:\n   - For those games identified on \"3 June 1933\", check if any took place at either \"arden street oval\" or \"punt road oval\".\n   - Examine the 'venue' column for these rows.\n\nNow, let's verify each part using the table data:\n\n- **Rows with date \"3 june 1933\":**\n  - Row 0: Date is \"3 june 1933\", Venue is \"lake oval\"\n  - Row 1: Date is \"3 june 1933\", Venue is \"punt road oval\"\n  - Row 2: Date is \"3 june 1933\", Venue is \"brunswick street oval\"\n\nThere are 3 games on \"3 June 1933\". The claim mentions 4 games, so this part of the statement is already false.\n\n- **Venues for these dates:**\n  - Row 0: Venue is \"lake oval\"\n  - Row 1: Venue is \"punt road oval\" (this contradicts the second part of the claim)\n  - Row 2: Venue is \"brunswick street oval\"\n\nThe venue \"punt road oval\" appears in row 1, which corresponds to a game held on \"3 June 1933\". This directly contradicts the statement that none were at \"arden punt road oval\".\n\nSince both parts of the claim are not fully supported by the table data, the overall claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For checking games on \"3 june 1933\":\n  - Row 0, Column: 'date'\n  - Row 1, Column: 'date'\n  - Row 2, Column: 'date'\n\n- For checking venues of these games:\n  - Row 0, Column: 'venue'\n  - Row 1, Column: 'venue' (since this venue is \"punt road oval\")\n  - Row 2, Column: 'venue'\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
