In the year 1963, the network \"abc 's wwos\" should have Bill Flemming as the \"lap - by - lap\".\n2. In the same year and for the same network, Chris Economaki should be listed as a \"pit reporter\".\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps to verify these conditions:\n\n1. **Identify the Row Corresponding to 1963**:\n   - We locate the row where the 'year' is 1963.\n\n2. **Verify the Network for 1963**:\n   - Check if the 'network' in this row matches \"abc 's wwos\".\n\n3. **Check the Lap-by-Lap Column**:\n   - Ensure that the value in the 'lap - by - lap' column is \"bill flemming\" for this row.\n\n4. **Verify the Pit Reporter Column**:\n   - Confirm that the value in the 'pit reporters' column includes \"chris economaki\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the provided table:\n\n- The row index corresponding to the year 1963 is 2 (considering a zero-based index).\n- In this row:\n  - The 'network' is indeed \"abc 's wwos\".\n  - The 'lap - by - lap' column has \"bill flemming\" as its value.\n  - The 'pit reporters' column includes \"chris economaki\".\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim are met.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify three conditions for Bill Flemming from the given table:\n\n1. **Host**: Bill Flemming should be listed as the host for 5 different years.\n2. **Lap-by-Lap**: Bill Flemming should be listed in the \"lap - by - lap\" column for 5 different years.\n3. **Pit Announcer**: Bill Flemming should be listed in the \"pit reporters\" column for 5 different years.\n\nLet's go through each condition using the table data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Host\nWe look at the \"host\" column to count how many times Bill Flemming is mentioned:\n- **1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1975**: These are the years when Bill Flemming is listed as host. This gives us a total of 6 years.\n\n#### Lap-by-Lap\nWe check the \"lap - by - lap\" column for mentions of Bill Flemming:\n- **1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1976**: These are the years when Bill Flemming is listed in this role. This gives us a total of 6 years.\n\n#### Pit Announcer\nWe examine the \"pit reporters\" column for mentions of Bill Flemming:\n- **1964, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1975**: These are the years when Bill Flemming is listed as pit reporter. This gives us a total of 5 years.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our verification:\n\n1. Bill Flemming appears as host for 6 years.\n2. He appears in the lap-by-lap role for 6 years.\n3. He serves as pit announcer for 5 years.\n\nThe claim states that Bill Flemming has been a host, lap-by-lap, and pit announcer for **5 total years** in each category. While he meets the criteria for at least 5 years in each individual role, the phrasing of the claim implies these roles must all coincide within the same set of 5 years, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because while Bill Flemming appears in all three roles, it is not specifically true that he holds all three roles concurrently for exactly 5 separate years. He exceeds this number in some categories (6 instead of 5).\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- **Host**:\n  - Row 2: \"host\"\n  - Row 3: \"host\"\n  - Row 4: \"host\"\n  - Row 5: \"host\"\n  - Row 7: \"host\"\n  - Row 8: \"host\"\n\n- **Lap-by-Lap**:\n  - Row 2: \"lap - by - lap\"\n  - Row 3: \"lap - by - lap\"\n  - Row 4: \"lap - by - lap\"\n  - Row 5: \"lap - by - lap\"\n  - Row 7: \"lap - by - lap\"\n  - Row 8: \"lap - by - lap\"\n\n- **Pit Announcer**:\n  - Row 3: \"pit reporters\"\n  - Row 4: \"pit reporters\"\n  - Row 5: \"pit reporters\"\n  - Row 7: \"pit reporters\"\n  - Row 8: \"pit reporters\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lap - by - lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lap - by - lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lap - by - lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lap - by - lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lap - by - lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lap - by - lap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pit reporters\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pit reporters\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pit reporters\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pit reporters\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pit reporters\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
