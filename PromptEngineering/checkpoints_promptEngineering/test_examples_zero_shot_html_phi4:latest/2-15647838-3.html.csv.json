Therefore, there are 20 games listed.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Gator Bowl Games:**\n   - We need to count how many times \"Gator Bowl\" appears in the \"Game\" column.\n   - From the table:\n     - 1995: Gator Bowl\n     - 1996: Gator Bowl\n     - 1997: Gator Bowl\n     - 1998: Gator Bowl\n     - 1999: Gator Bowl\n     - 2000: Gator Bowl\n     - 2005: Gator Bowl\n     - 2008: Gator Bowl\n\n   - Total Gator Bowl games = 8\n\n3. **Check the First Year of Gator Bowl Appearance:**\n   - The first appearance in the table is in 1995, not 1994.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The claim that \"6 out of 20\" games were the Gator Bowl is incorrect; it should be \"8 out of 20.\"\n- The claim that the first Gator Bowl game was in 1994 is also incorrect; it was in 1995.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\"\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- All rows where the \"Game\" column is \"Gator Bowl\" (rows: 3 to 8 and row 15).\n- The first occurrence of \"Gator Bowl\" to verify the year (row 3).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"the 4 sugar bowl games have a combined attendance of 491424,\" we need to identify and sum up the attendance figures from the relevant Sugar Bowl games listed in the table.\n\nLet's examine each row where \"sugar bowl\" appears in the event name:\n\n1. **2005**: The attendance for the \"2005 sugar bowl\" game is **77349**.\n2. **2011**: The attendance for the \"2012 sugar bowl\" game is **64512**.\n\nThese are the two Sugar Bowl games mentioned in the table, not four as claimed.
