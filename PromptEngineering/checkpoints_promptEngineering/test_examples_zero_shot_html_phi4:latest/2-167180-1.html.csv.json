    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table, we need to verify each part of the statement using the data provided in the HTML table.\n\nThe claim states: \"when m night shyamalan be the director , the rank be 7\". We will break this down into two parts:\n\n1. **Director Verification**: Identify if M. Night Shyamalan is listed as a director for any film.\n2. **Rank Verification**: Check if the film directed by M. Night Shyamalan has a rank of 7.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n1. **Locate M. Night Shyamalan in the \"director (s)\" column:**\n   - Look through each row to find where M. Night Shyamalan is mentioned as a director.\n   - In the table, we find that M. Night Shyamalan is listed as the director for the film \"Signs\" under the 7th row.\n\n2. **Check the rank for the film directed by M. Night Shyamalan:**\n   - The corresponding rank in the same row (row index 6) for \"Signs\" is indeed 7.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- M. Night Shyamalan is indeed a director for the film listed.\n- This film has a rank of 7 as stated.\n\nThus, the relevant cells from the table are those in row index 6 under columns \"title\", \"director (s)\", and \"rank\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Check the value in the \"director(s)\" column for that particular row.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Row\n- We need to find the row where the \"title\" is \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones.\" Looking at the table:\n  - In the row with `rank` value 4, we have the title as \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones.\"\n\n### Step 2: Check the Director\n- For the identified row (rank 4), look at the value in the \"director(s)\" column.\n- The director listed for this movie is \"george lucas.\"\n\n### Verification\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied:\n- The title matches: \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones.\"\n- The director is indeed \"george lucas.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 4, column name \"title\"\n- Row index 4, column name \"director (s)\"\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `row_index` is adjusted to a zero-based index, which means the row with rank 4 corresponds to `row_index` 3.",
