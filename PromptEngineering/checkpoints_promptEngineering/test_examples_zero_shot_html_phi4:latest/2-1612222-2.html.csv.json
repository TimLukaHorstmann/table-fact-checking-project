    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be 5 less ace in 2013 than there be be 2006,\" we need to focus on two specific columns from the table: \"aces\" and \"year.\" The goal is to compare the total number of aces for matches played in the years 2013 and 2006. \n\nFirst, identify all rows corresponding to each year:\n- **Year 2013**: Look for entries where the \"year\" column equals 2013.\n- **Year 2006**: Look for entries where the \"year\" column equals 2006.\n\nNext, sum up the number of aces for these years separately and compare them:\n\n1. **Entries from 2013**:\n   - Row with index 0: The value in the \"aces\" column is 25.\n   - There are no other entries for the year 2013 in this table.\n\n2. **Total aces for 2013**: \n   \\[\n   25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Entries from 2006**:\n   - Row with index 15: The value in the \"aces\" column is 20.\n   - There are no other entries for the year 2006 in this table.\n\n4. **Total aces for 2006**: \n   \\[\n   20\n   \\]\n\nNow, compare the totals:\n- Total aces in 2013: 25\n- Total aces in 2006: 20\n\nCalculate the difference:\n\\[\n25 - 20 = 5\n\\]\n\nThe claim states there are \"5 less ace in 2013 than there be be 2006,\" which implies that 2013 should have fewer aces.
