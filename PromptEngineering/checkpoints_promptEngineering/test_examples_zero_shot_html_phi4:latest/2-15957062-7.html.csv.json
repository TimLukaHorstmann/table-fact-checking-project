    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table provided, we need to analyze specific cells within it and compare them according to the details in the claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"istanbul paten be rank 2 spot higher than kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t club.\"\n\nThis means that, if true, the club \"istanbul paten\" should be ranked 2 positions higher on the list compared to the club \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\". We will use the 'rank' column for this purpose.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate the row containing \"istanbul paten\":\n     - It is in Row 2 (third row when counting from 0).\n     - Check the rank: This club has a rank of \"4th\".\n   \n   - Locate the row containing \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\":\n     - It is in Row 3 (fourth row when counting from 0).\n     - Check the rank: This club has a rank of \"1st\".\n\n2. **Analyze the Ranks:**\n   - The rank for \"istanbul paten\" is \"4th\".\n   - The rank for \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\" is \"1st\".\n\n3. **Evaluate Rank Difference:**\n   - To be 2 spots higher, \"istanbul paten\" should have a rank of \"3rd\", given that \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\" is at \"1st\".\n   - However, \"istanbul paten\" has a rank of \"4th\", which is actually one spot lower than the required position for being 2 spots higher.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because \"istanbul paten\" is not ranked 2 positions higher than \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\"; in fact, it's ranked lower.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are from the 'rank' column of both clubs mentioned in the claim.\n  - For \"istanbul paten\" (Row 2), Column: rank\n  - For \"kocaeli bb ka\u011f\u0131t\" (Row 3), Column: rank\n\nHere is the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
