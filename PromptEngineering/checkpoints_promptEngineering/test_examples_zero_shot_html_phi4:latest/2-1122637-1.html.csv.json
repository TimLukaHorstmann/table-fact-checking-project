The driver name corresponding to \"Ronnie Peterson\".\n2. The number of laps completed by this driver.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant piece:\n\n- **Driver Name**: We locate \"Ronnie Peterson\" in the table by checking the 'driver' column for his full name.\n  \n- **Laps Completed**: Once we have identified Ronnie Peterson's row, we look at the value in the 'laps' column for that row to see how many laps he completed.\n\nBy scanning through the table:\n\n1. We find \"Ronnie Peterson\" under the 'driver' column in the 12th row.\n2. In this same row (index 11 if starting from 0), we check the 'laps' column and find a value of 23.\n\nThus, Ronnie Peterson drove exactly 23 laps. The claim accurately reflects the data from the table.\n\nHere's how the relevant cells can be identified in terms of JSON format:\n\n- **Row Index**: Since we start counting rows at index 0, \"Ronnie Peterson\" appears on row index 11.\n- **Column Names**: We need the 'driver' column to verify the driver and the 'laps' column for the number of laps driven.\n\nHere is the resulting JSON with these relevant details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We look through the rows to find an entry with the driver \"ronnie peterson\". This corresponds to row 12.\n\n2. **Laps Completed**:\n   - In row 12, under the \"laps\" column, it is stated that Ronnie Peterson completed 23 laps. This matches the claim of doing \"23.0 lap\", which can be interpreted as completing 23 laps.\n\n3. **Constructor Verification**: \n   - The claim states that he did this in a \"ford ensign\". However, looking at row 12 under the \"constructor\" column, it shows \"lotus - ford\", not \"ensign - ford\". This part of the claim is incorrect.\n\n4. **Summary**:\n   - While Ronnie Peterson did complete 23 laps (matching the lap count in the claim), he did so with Lotus-Ford, not Ensign-Ford as claimed.
