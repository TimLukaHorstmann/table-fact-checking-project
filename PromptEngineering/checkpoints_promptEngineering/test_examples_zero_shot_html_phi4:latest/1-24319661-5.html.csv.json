Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Episode Number**: The claim specifically refers to \"episode no 53\". We need to locate row 7 (considering zero-based indexing) as it corresponds to episode number 53 in the series.\n\n2. **Check Directed by Column for Episode 53**:\n   - In row 7, check the column labeled \"directed by\" to see if the name listed is Paul Holahan.\n   - According to the table, the value under the \"directed by\" column for episode no 53 (row index 7) is indeed \"Paul Holahan\".\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The relevant cells we need to examine are:\n     - Row index 7, Column: \"no in series\" should have a value of 53.\n     - Row index 7, Column: \"directed by\" should list \"Paul Holahan\".\n   - Both these conditions confirm the claim is true.\n\nThus, based on the analysis above, the claim that episode no 53 in the series was directed by Paul Holahan is supported by the data in the table.
