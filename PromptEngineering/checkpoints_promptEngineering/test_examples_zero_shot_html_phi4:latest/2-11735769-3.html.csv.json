Jerry Traino (who voiced characters in \"iCarly\") was nominated for 2 awards in each of the years 2010 and 2011.\n2. He won only 1 award in each of those years.\n\nLet's break it down by year:\n\n### Year 2010:\n- **Nominations:**\n  - Award: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Category: Big Kid Award, Work: iCarly, Result: Nominated\n  - Award: 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Category: LOL Award (shared with ensemble), Work: iCarly, Result: Won\n\n  **Relevant Cells for 2010:**\n  - Row Index 1, Column \"Result\": Nominated\n  - Row Index 2, Column \"Result\": Won\n\n  From this, we see there are 2 award entries in 2010 and he was nominated once (Big Kid Award) and won once (LOL Award).\n\n### Year 2011:\n- **Nominations:**\n  - Award: 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards, Category: Nick UK's Funniest Person, Work: iCarly, Result: Won\n  - Award: Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil, Category: Funniest Character, Work: iCarly, Result: Nominated\n\n  **Relevant Cells for 2011:**\n  - Row Index 3, Column \"Result\": Won\n  - Row Index 4, Column \"Result\": Nominated\n\n  In 2011, there are also 2 award entries.

    "resp": "To verify the claim about Jerry Trainor's nominations and wins in awards for the years 2010 and 2011, we need to examine each entry in the table related to \"icarly,\" which is the work associated with his role.\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n- **\"JERRY TRAINOR BE NOMINATE FOR 2 AWARDS IN 2010 AND 2 AWARD IN 2011 WIN BOTH IN EACH YEAR\":**\n  - In 2010, he should be nominated for two awards.\n  - In 2011, he should win both of his nominations.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Year 2010:\n- **Row 1 (Index 1):** \n  - Year: 2009\n  - Not relevant to the claim about 2010.\n\n- **Row 2 (Index 2):**\n  - Year: 2010\n  - Category: Big Kid Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Relevant for 2010 nomination count.\n\n- **Row 3 (Index 3):**\n  - Year: 2010\n  - Category: LOL Award (shared with ensemble)\n  - Result: Won\n  - This is a win, not a nomination, but relevant to the year's total awards.\n\n**Conclusion for 2010:** There is one \"nominated\" entry and one \"won\" entry. Thus, he was nominated once in 2010.\n\n#### Year 2011:\n- **Row 4 (Index 4):**\n  - Year: 2011\n  - Category: Nick UK's Funniest Person\n  - Result: Won\n  - Relevant for 2011 win count.\n\n- **Row 5 (Index 5):**\n  - Year: 2011\n  - Category: Funniest Character\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - This is a nomination, not a win. However, it's relevant to the year's total awards.\n\n**Conclusion for 2011:** There is one \"won\" entry and one \"nominated\" entry. Thus, he won only once in 2011.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n- In 2010, Jerry Trainor was nominated once, not twice.\n- In 2011, he won only one award, not both nominations.\n\nThe claim is therefore **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For 2010: \n  - Row 2, \"result\" (nominated)\n  - Row 3, \"result\" (won)\n\n- For 2011:\n  - Row 4, \"result\" (won)\n  - Row 5, \"result\" (nominated)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
