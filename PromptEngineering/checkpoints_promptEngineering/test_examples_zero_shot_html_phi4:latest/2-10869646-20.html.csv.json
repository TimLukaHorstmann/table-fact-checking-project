The team Geelong.\n2. The date of the match: August 17, 1974.\n\nIn the provided HTML table, each row represents a match with details about both teams and the date. We will check each row for matches involving \"Geelong\" as either home or away team on the specified date.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Home Team: essendon\n  - Away Team: north melbourne\n  - Date: 17 August 1974\n  - Geelong is not involved in this match.\n  \n- **Row 1**: \n  - Home Team: collingwood\n  - Away Team: richmond\n  - Date: 17 August 1974\n  - Geelong is not involved in this match.\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Home Team: carlton\n  - Away Team: fitzroy\n  - Date: 17 August 1974\n  - Geelong is not involved in this match.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Home Team: south melbourne\n  - Away Team: geelong\n  - Date: 17 August 1974\n  - Here, \"geelong\" is the away team on this date.\n  \n- **Row 4**: \n  - Home Team: melbourne\n  - Away Team: footscray\n  - Date: 17 August 1974\n  - Geelong is not involved in this match.\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Home Team: hawthorn\n  - Away Team: st kilda\n  - Date: 17 August 1974\n  - Geelong is not involved in this match.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that Geelong played on August 17, 1974, as the away team against South Melbourne.
