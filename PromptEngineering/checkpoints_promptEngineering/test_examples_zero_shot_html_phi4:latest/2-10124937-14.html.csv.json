For this row, the score of the first leg must be \"3 - 1\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the table:\n\n- **Row 7** (0-indexed):\n  - \"team 1\" column: \"marseille\"\n  - \"1st leg\" column: \"3 - 1\"\n\nThe conditions specified in the claim are met by row 7. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- The cell with \"marseille\" in the \"team 1\" column at row index 6.\n- The cell with \"3 - 1\" in the \"1st leg\" column at row index 6.\n\nHere is the JSON response based on our analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the scores for the match involving Bolton Wanderers in both legs of their encounter as presented in the table.\n\nThe relevant row for \"bolton wanderers\" shows:\n\n- **1st leg score**: 1 - 1\n- **2nd leg score**: 0 - 1\n\nAccording to the claim, the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score should be the same. Clearly, they are not:\n\n- The 1st leg score of \"bolton wanderers\" versus their opponent is 1 - 1.\n- The 2nd leg score for the same teams is 0 - 1.\n\nSince these scores differ between the two legs, the claim that the \"1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer\" is false. \n\nWe need to identify the relevant cells from the table to verify this:\n\n- The row index for \"bolton wanderers\" is 2 (since it's zero-indexed, starting at Anderlecht which is row 0).\n- The column name for \"1st leg\" is \"1st leg\".\n- The column name for \"2nd leg\" is \"2nd leg\".\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this claim are from row index 2 with the columns \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\".\n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing the verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
