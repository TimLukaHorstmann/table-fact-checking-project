    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"1971 French Open used clay as the court surface\" is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The year should be 1971.\n2. The championship should be the French Open with a clay surface.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the table:\n\n- Look for the row where the \"year\" column is \"1971\".\n- Ensure that this same row has \"french open\" in the \"championship\" column and \"clay\" in the \"surface\" column.\n\n### Analyzing the Table\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - \"outcome\": winner\n  - \"year\": 1971\n  - \"championship\": french open\n  - \"surface\": clay\n  - \"partner\": jean - claude barclay\n  - \"opponents in the final\": winnie shaw thomas lejus\n  - \"score in the final\": 6 - 2 , 6 - 4\n\nThe conditions for the claim are satisfied in row 4.
