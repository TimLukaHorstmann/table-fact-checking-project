This matches the claim.\n\n3. **Draft Round**:\n   - The claim specifies that Brandon Sutter was drafted in \"round 1\".\n   - From the table, we see that the \"round\" for \"Brandon Sutter\" is indeed 1.\n\nAll parts of the claim are verified against the relevant data in the table:\n\n- The player's name matches.\n- The position listed matches \"C or W\".\n- The draft round is correctly stated as 1.\n\nThus, all conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the information in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 0 (the first row of the body), column \"player\" for verifying the player's name.\n- Row index 0, column \"position\" for verifying the position.\n- Row index 0, column \"round\" for verifying the draft round.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to analyze the specific information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim:\n\"The position for round 3 is LW.\"\n\nThis claim specifies two conditions:\n1. The \"round\" must be equal to 3.\n2. The corresponding \"position\" for this round should be \"LW\".\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions against the data in the table:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify the row with `round = 3`:**\n   - According to the table, the relevant entry is:\n     ```\n     <tr>\n       <td>3</td>\n       <td>drayson bowman</td>\n       <td>c / rw</td>\n       <td>united states</td>\n       <td>spokane chiefs (whl)</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the \"position\" for `round = 3`:**\n   - In this row, the value in the \"position\" column is \"c / rw\".\n\n3. **Compare with the claim:**\n   - The claim states that the position should be \"LW\", but the actual value from the table is \"c / rw\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe data does not support the claim because the position for round 3 is \"c / rw\", not \"LW\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell to check for `round = 3` is in row index 2 (considering zero-based indexing) under the column \"position\".\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
