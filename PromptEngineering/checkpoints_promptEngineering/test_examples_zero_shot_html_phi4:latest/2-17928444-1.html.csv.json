    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to evaluate the attendance figures for all games listed in the table and compare them to identify the game with the lowest attendance.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- The claim states that during Week 16 of the 1982 Denver Broncos season, the attendance was the least among all nine games. It specifies an attendance figure of \"74192\" as being the least.\n  \nLet's verify this by examining the attendance numbers for each game in the table:\n\n1. **Week 1:** Attendance = 73564\n2. **Week 2:** Attendance = 73899\n3. **Week 10:** Attendance = 73996\n4. **Week 11:** Attendance = 47629\n5. **Week 12:** Attendance = 73984\n6. **Week 13:** Attendance = 48112\n7. **Week 14:** Attendance = 74192\n8. **Week 15:** Attendance = 44160\n9. **Week 16:** Attendance = 43145\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The lowest attendance figure in the table is 43145, which occurs during Week 16.\n- Week 14 has an attendance of 74192, not Week 16.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Week 16 had the least attendance at 74192 is FALSE. Instead, Week 16 actually had a lower attendance than all others at 43145.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nTo verify this conclusion, we specifically examine the \"attendance\" column for each row in the table to compare attendance figures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
