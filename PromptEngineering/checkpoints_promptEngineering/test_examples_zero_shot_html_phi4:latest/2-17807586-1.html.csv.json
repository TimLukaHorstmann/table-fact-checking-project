    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Matthew Silver and Thomas Bao both win the championship 2 times from 2003 to 2013,\" we need to verify two key components for each individual: the number of wins and the years in which these wins occurred.\n\n1. **Check for Matthew Silver**:\n   - Identify rows where Matthew Silver is listed as a winner.\n   - Count the number of such occurrences within the given timeframe (2003-2013).\n   - Relevant column: \"winners\"\n   - The relevant row indices are determined by matching the names in the \"winners\" column.\n\n2. **Check for Thomas Bao**:\n   - Identify rows where Thomas Bao is listed as a winner.\n   - Count the number of such occurrences within the given timeframe (2003-2013).\n   - Relevant column: \"winners\"\n   - The relevant row indices are determined by matching the names in the \"winners\" column.\n\nNow, let's extract the necessary information from the table:\n\n### For Matthew Silver:\n- **Row 7**: Aune Mitchell & Matthew Silver (2007)\n- **Row 6**: Aaron Jacobs & Nathan Mendelsohn (2006) - No mention of Matthew Silver\n- **Row 2**: Andy Hoang & Erik Salgado (2012) - No mention of Matthew Silver\n- **Row 1**: Kevin Bowerman & Raymond Gao (2013) - No mention of Matthew Silver\n\nMatthew Silver appears as a winner in 2007.\n\n### For Thomas Bao:\n- **Row 11**: Nick Amphlett & John Zekowitz (2003) - No mention of Thomas Bao\n- **Row 10**: Thomas Bao & Eric Johnston (2004)\n- **Row 9**: Scott Cardone & Asif Rahman (2005) - No mention of Thomas Bao\n- **Row 8**: Aaron Jacobs & Nathan Mendelsohn (2006) - No mention of Thomas Bao\n\nThomas Bao appears as a winner in 2004.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Matthew Silver wins once (in 2007).\n- Thomas Bao wins once (in 2004).\n\nNeither Matthew Silver nor Thomas Bao win the championship twice from 2003 to 2013. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are those in the \"winners\" column where their names appear:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winners\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winners\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
