The claim states \"the total be 2 for bronze.\"\n2. We look at the column labeled \"bronze\" to identify the individual medal counts.\n3. Next, we check the row labeled \"total\" to verify the aggregate count of bronze medals.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the relevant data:\n\n- **Bronze Medal Counts per Row:**\n  - United States (USA): 0\n  - Poland (POL): 0\n  - Sweden (SWE): 0\n  - Finland (FIN): 1\n  - Soviet Union (URS): 1\n\n- **Total Bronze Medals:**\n  - The row labeled \"total\" shows a count of 2 in the \"bronze\" column.\n\nBy adding up the bronze medals from each country:\n\\[ 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \\]\n\nThis matches the total shown in the table. Therefore, the claim that the total is 2 for bronze is accurate.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row indices of individual countries' bronze counts: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n- The \"total\" row's bronze count at index 5.\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this verification is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the soviet union (urs) score 2 bronze,\" we need to analyze the table and verify the relevant data:\n\n1. Identify the row associated with the Soviet Union.\n   - In the table, the Soviet Union is listed under the nation column as \"soviet union (urs)\" in rows indexed from 3 onwards.\n\n2. Check the \"bronze\" column for the Soviet Union's entry to see how many bronze medals were scored.\n   - According to row 4, the value under the \"bronze\" column for the Soviet Union is `0`.\n\n3. Evaluate whether this data supports the claim that the Soviet Union scored 2 bronze medals.\n   - The table indicates they scored 1 bronze medal (not 2), which directly contradicts the claim.\n\nThus, based on the analysis of the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Row index for \"soviet union (urs)\" is `3`.\n- Column name to verify bronze score is `\"bronze\"`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE\" since the Soviet Union did not score 2 bronze medals but only 1. The relevant cell to check this information is at row index 3 in the \"bronze\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
