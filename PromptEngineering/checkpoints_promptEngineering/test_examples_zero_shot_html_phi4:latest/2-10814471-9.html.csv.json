    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Tevita Vaikona score 100 points on 25 tries,\" we need to verify two conditions using the table:\n\n1. **Points scored by Tevita Vaikona**: The claim states that he scored 100 points.\n2. **Number of tries made by Tevita Vaikona**: The claim states that these points were achieved through 25 tries.\n\nLet's identify and check these relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Look for the row corresponding to \"Tevita Vaikona.\"\n- Check the \"points\" column in this row to verify if he scored 100 points.\n- Check the \"tries\" column in the same row to confirm if he made 25 tries.\n\nFrom the HTML table provided, we find Tevita Vaikona's data:\n\n- **Row Index**: 1 (considering zero-based indexing)\n- **Column Name for Points**: \"points\"\n- **Column Name for Tries**: \"tries\"\n\nChecking these cells:\n- The value in the \"points\" column is 100.\n- The value in the \"tries\" column is 25.\n\nBoth conditions match the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to analyze it step by step using the provided table:\n\n1. **Claim Breakdown**:\n   - The player in question is \"Tevita Vaikona.\"\n   - The conditions to check for \"Tevita Vaikona\" are:\n     - Scored at least 100 points.\n     - Made more than 23 tries.\n\n2. **Checking Conditions for Tevita Vaikona**:\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"Tevita Vaikona.\"\n     - From the table, we find him in the second row (index 1).\n   - Check his \"points\" and \"tries\":\n     - Points: 100 (Condition: At least 100 points is satisfied)\n     - Tries: 25 (Condition: More than 23 tries is satisfied)\n\n3. **Checking Other Players**:\n   - We need to ensure no other player meets both conditions.\n   - For each player, check the \"points\" and \"tries\":\n     - The relevant columns are \"tries\" and \"points.\"\n     - Iterate through all rows:\n       - Row 0: Robbie Paul (Tries = 23, Points = 92) -> Doesn't satisfy either condition.\n       - Row 2: Leon Pryce (Tries = 16, Points = 64) -> Doesn't satisfy either condition.\n       - Row 3: Nathan McAvoy (Tries = 4, Points = 16) -> Doesn't satisfy either condition.\n       - Row 4: Michael Withers (Tries = 31, Points = 124) -> Satisfies both conditions.\n       - Remaining rows do not meet the criteria for both tries and points.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - \"Michael Withers\" also meets both conditions (31 tries, 124 points), thus disproving the claim that \"Tevita Vaikona\" is the only player to do so.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For Tevita Vaikona: \n     - Row index = 1, Column names = \"tries\", \"points\"\n   - For Michael Withers (since he disqualifies the claim):\n     - Row index = 4, Column names = \"tries\", \"points\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
