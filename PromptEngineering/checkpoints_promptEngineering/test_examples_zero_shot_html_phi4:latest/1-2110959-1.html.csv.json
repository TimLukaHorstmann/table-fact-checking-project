According to the table structure, each row represents a season starting with the header, which implies that:\n   - Row index 0 corresponds to the 1947 - 48 season.\n   - Row index 1 corresponds to the 1948 - 49 season.\n\n2. **Win Percentage Verification**: The claim states that the win percentage (pct %) for the 1948 - 49 season is 0.552. We need to find this value in the row corresponding to the 1948 - 49 season and verify its accuracy.\n\n3. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - **Row Index**: The relevant row index for the 1948 - 49 season is 1.\n   - **Column Name**: To check the win percentage, we need the column labeled \"pct %\".\n\n4. **Data Extraction**: In the table:\n   - For the 1948 - 49 season (row index 1), under the \"pct %\" column, the value listed is indeed 0.552.\n\nGiven that the data extracted from the table matches the claim made about the win percentage for the 1948 - 49 season, we can conclude:\n\n- The claim is supported by the data in the table.\n- Therefore, the answer to whether the claim \"the 1948 - 49 season have a win % of 0.552\" is true or false is: TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the verification process:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pct %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
