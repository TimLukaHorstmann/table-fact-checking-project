Identify the row corresponding to \"Svetlana Fedorenko\".\n2. Check if her rank is indeed 8.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the provided table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify Svetlana Fedorenko in the Table:**\n   - We search for \"svetlana fedorenko\" in the `name` column.\n   - From the table, we see that she is listed in row 7 (0-indexed) with the name exactly matching \"svetlana fedorenko\".\n\n2. **Check Her Rank:**\n   - Once located at row index 7, we need to verify her rank.\n   - In the `rank` column of row 7, the value is 8.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n- Svetlana Fedorenko is indeed in row 7.\n- Her rank is 8, as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim \"svetlana fedorenko be rank 8\" is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe cells relevant to this verification include:\n- The `name` cell at row index 7 to confirm identity.\n- The `rank` cell at row index 7 to confirm the rank.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
