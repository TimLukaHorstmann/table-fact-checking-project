    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about Brandi Love's award nominations in 2013, we need to analyze each entry within the table provided.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"big titty milfs be the only work name brandi love receive an award nomination for in 2013.\"\n\nKey points from this claim are:\n1. We are looking specifically at awards where Brandi Love was nominated.\n2. The work associated with those nominations must include \"big titty milfs\".\n3. This should be the only work associated with a nomination.\n\n### Table Examination:\nLet's go through each row of the table and examine if it supports or contradicts this claim:\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: AVN Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: MILF / Cougar Performer of the Year\n  - Work: N/A\n\n  This row shows a nomination without any work mentioned. Therefore, it does not contradict or support the claim regarding \"big titty milfs\".\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: AVN Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n  - Work: Big Titty Milfs\n\n  This row supports the claim because it involves a nomination specifically associated with \"big titty milfs\".\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n  - Result: Won\n  - Award: Best Cougar / MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice)\n  - Work: N/A\n\n  This row shows a win, not a nomination. It does not contradict the claim regarding nominations.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: Best Ass\n  - Work: N/A\n\n  This is another nomination with no work specified, so it doesn't contradict or support the claim about \"big titty milfs\".\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Year: 2013\n  - Ceremony: XBIZ Award\n  - Result: Nominated\n  - Award: Web Star of the Year\n  - Work: N/A\n\n  Again, a nomination with no work specified. It does not contradict or support the claim regarding \"big titty milfs\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table contains exactly one nomination associated with \"big titty milfs\" (Row 2). All other nominations do not specify any work, thus not contradicting the claim that \"big titty milfs\" is the only work mentioned in a nomination.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
