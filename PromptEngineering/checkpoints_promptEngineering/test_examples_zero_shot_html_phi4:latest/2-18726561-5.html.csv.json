However, this does not meet the condition of having the score as \"2 - 1\".\n- Therefore, there is no instance where \"Norwich City\" is the home team when the score is \"2 - 1\".\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are false based on the analysis of the table. Thus, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells that contribute to this determination:\n\n- **For Condition 1**:\n  - We check all rows where the score is \"0 - 0\":\n    - Row index 2: Columns `score` (\"0 - 0\") and `away team` (\"Bolton Wanderers\").\n    - Row index 7: Columns `score` (\"0 - 0\") and `away team` (\"Stoke City\").\n\n- **For Condition 2**:\n  - We check all rows where the home team is \"Norwich City\":\n    - Row index 6: Columns `home team` (\"Norwich City\") and `score` (\"1 - 2\").\n  - We also consider where score is \"2 - 1\" to verify Norwich City as the home team:\n    - Row indices 0 and 5 are checked but do not match.\n\nThe JSON object summarizing these findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
