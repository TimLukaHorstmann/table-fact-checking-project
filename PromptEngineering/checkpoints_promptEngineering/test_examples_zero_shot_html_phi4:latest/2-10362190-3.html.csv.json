Upon examination:\n     - The table shows that the entry with date \"November 12, 1995\" is in row index 10 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n   - For this specific row, we check both the date and attendance columns.\n     - **Date:** It indeed matches \"November 12, 1995\".\n     - **Attendance:** The value listed is \"51,342\", which matches exactly with the claim.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Both conditions (correct date and correct attendance figure) are met in row index 10 of the table.\n   \nThus, based on this analysis, the claim is fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 10, Date column\n- Row index 10, Attendance column\n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
