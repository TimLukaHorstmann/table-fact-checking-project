    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the class of Undine be withdraw in year 1884 - 1886,\" we need to focus on checking the table for entries related to the \"Undine\" locomotive, specifically examining the years it was withdrawn.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are interested in rows mentioning \"Undine.\"\n   - The relevant columns include any that might indicate withdrawal years for locomotives, typically named similar to \"Withdrawn\" or containing year ranges for operation.\n\n2. **Locate the Row and Columns:**\n   - Find the row where \"Undine\" is mentioned.\n   - Check the column indicating withdrawal years (likely labeled as \"Years in Service,\" \"Withdrawn,\" or a similar term, which contains year ranges).\n\n3. **Check Consistency with Claim:**\n   - Confirm that the withdrawal range for \"Undine\" matches or overlaps with 1884-1886.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. Locate the row containing \"Undine\":\n   - Row index is 12 (the entry for \"gem\").\n\n2. Identify relevant columns:\n   - The column with year ranges for when locomotives were withdrawn is at index 5, which contains values like \"1884 - 1885\" for other entries.\n\n3. Check the withdrawal years for \"Undine\":\n   - For \"Undine,\" the table shows a withdrawal range of \"1884 - 1886.\"\n\n4. Compare to Claim:\n   - The claim states that \"the class of Undine be withdraw in year 1884 - 1886.\"\n   - The table entry for \"Undine\" confirms this exact period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in the table supports the claim as stated.

The quantity made for this particular class and wheel arrangement.\n2. The quantity preserved (if any) for this same class and wheel arrangement.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- **Identify the Class**: We are looking for entries in the table where the \"Class\" is \"vesuvius\".\n- **Check Wheel Arrangement**: For these identified entries, we need to ensure that the \"Wheel Arrangement\" matches \"2 - 4 - 0\".\n- **Verify Quantity Made**: Check if the quantity made (under the column labeled \"Quantity Made\") for this class and wheel arrangement is indeed 32.\n- **Verify Quantity Preserved**: Ensure that the quantity preserved (under the column labeled \"Quantity Preserved\") for this class and wheel arrangement is 0.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n1. **Locate the Class \"vesuvius\"**:\n   - The row with \"Class\" as \"vesuvius\" appears in the last entry of the table.\n   \n2. **Check the Wheel Arrangement**:\n   - In this row, the \"Wheel Arrangement\" is listed as \"2 - 4 - 0\", which matches our requirement.\n\n3. **Verify Quantity Made**:\n   - The \"Quantity Made\" for this row is 32, which satisfies the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Quantity Preserved**:\n   - The \"Quantity Preserved\" for this row is 0, which also satisfies the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are met (quantity made is 32 and quantity preserved is 0), we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Wheel Arrangement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Quantity Made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Quantity Preserved\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
