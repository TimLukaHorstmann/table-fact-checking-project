    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Chris Wyles be the only player with drop during his time on the rugby team\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the provided table for the \"drop\" column and identify any entries other than zero.\n\nThe relevant cell in question pertains to players having a non-zero value in the \"drop\" column. We will analyze each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Vaea Anitoni - drop = 0\n2. **Row 1**: Paul Emerick - drop = 0\n3. **Row 2**: Todd Clever - drop = 0\n4. **Row 3**: Philip Eloff - drop = 0\n5. **Row 4**: Takudzwa Ngwenya - drop = 0\n6. **Row 5**: Chris Wyles - drop = 1\n7. **Row 6**: David Fee - drop = 0\n8. **Row 7**: Mike Hercus - drop = 4\n9. **Row 8**: Riaan van Zyl - drop = 0\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that Chris Wyles and Mike Hercus have non-zero values in the \"drop\" column.\n\nThe claim states that only Chris Wyles should have a non-zero drop value, but since Mike Hercus also has a non-zero drop (4), the claim is false.\n\nWe identify the relevant cells for verifying this claim:\n\n- **Row 5**: Chris Wyles - drop = 1\n- **Row 7**: Mike Hercus - drop = 4\n\nThus, the JSON response would be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to break it down into two parts and verify each against the table:\n\n1. **\"Riaan van Zyl have the longest time span on the United States national rugby union team\":**\n   - We must identify the player with the longest span of years from the \"span\" column.\n   - Looking at the spans:\n     - Vaea Anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n     - Paul Emerick: 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n     - Todd Clever: 2003 - present (ongoing, but not a complete span in terms of years given)\n     - Philip Eloff: 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n     - Takudzwa Ngwenya: 2007 - present (ongoing, but not a complete span in terms of years given)\n     - Chris Wyles: 2007 - present (ongoing, but not a complete span in terms of years given)\n     - David Fee: 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n     - Mike Hercus: 2002 - 2009 (7 years)\n     - Riaan van Zyl: 2003 - 2004 (1 year)\n\n   From this, Paul Emerick has the longest complete time span of 9 years.\n\n2. **\"Riaan van Zyl ties with only one other player for the greatest number of tries\":**\n   - We need to find players with the highest \"tries\" and verify if Riaan van Zyl is tied with exactly one other player.\n   - Checking the \"tries\" column:\n     - Vaea Anitoni: 26\n     - Paul Emerick: 17\n     - Todd Clever: 11\n     - Philip Eloff: 10\n     - Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10\n     - Chris Wyles: 10\n     - David Fee: 9\n     - Mike Hercus: 9\n     - Riaan van Zyl: 9\n\n   Vaea Anitoni has the highest number of tries (26). The next highest is 17 by Paul Emerick. Then, there are three players tied for third place with 10 tries each (Philip Eloff, Takudzwa Ngwenya, Chris Wyles), and two players with 9 tries (David Fee, Riaan van Zyl).\n\n   Therefore, Riaan van Zyl is not tied with only one other player; he is actually tied with David Fee for the third lowest number of tries.\n\nGiven these analyses, both parts of the claim are false. Thus, the entire claim is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- For checking spans: \n  - Riaan van Zyl (row_index 8)\n  - All players' span rows\n\n- For checking ties in \"tries\":\n  - Riaan van Zyl's tries row\n  - Other players' tries rows, especially those with equal or greater tries than Riaan van Zyl.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
