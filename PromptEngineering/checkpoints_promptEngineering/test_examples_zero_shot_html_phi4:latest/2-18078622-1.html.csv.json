Additionally, we should verify whether it was released by Caribou Records (though this specific detail about \"Caribou Record\" is not directly found in the table; hence, the focus remains on the date).\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- **Row 12**: \n  - Artist: Dennis Wilson\n  - Album: Pacific Ocean Blue\n  - Year: 1991\n  - Format: cd\n\n- **Row 13**:\n  - Artist: Dennis Wilson\n  - Album: Pacific Ocean Blue\n  - Year: 2008\n  - Catalogue Number (likely indicating label or re-release info): \"cd : 88697339322 lp : suz5212.1\"\n  - Format: cd / lp\n\nThe entry in Row 13 confirms that there was indeed a release of \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" by Dennis Wilson in the year 2008, and it appears to be a different format (both CD and LP) compared to previous releases.\n\nThus, all conditions specified in the claim are met with regard to the artist, album, and the latest re-release date, though the specific mention of Caribou Records is not verifiable from the table.

For Caribou Records, we need to check if any specific pattern or known number series matches the catalog numbers.\n3. **Format**: We need to verify that both \"lp\" and \"cd\" formats are present for each album.\n\nNow, let's analyze the entries in the table:\n\n- **LA (Light Album)**\n  - LP: Catalog \"jz 35752\", Year 1979\n  - CD: Catalog \"zk 35752\", Year 1989\n\n- **Keepin' the Summer Alive**\n  - LP: Catalog \"fz 36293\", Year 1980\n  - CD: Catalog \"zk 36293\", Year 1991\n\n- **Ten Years of Harmony**\n  - LP: Catalog \"z2x 37445\", Year 1981\n  - CD: Catalog \"z2k 37445\", Year unknown (implied by the pattern)\n\n- **The Beach Boys** (album with no explicit name given)\n  - LP: Catalog \"bw 10\", Year 1974\n  - CD: Catalog \"b00000n0qg\", Year 1999\n\nFor each of these albums, both LP and CD formats are present.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Dennis Wilson's album \"Pacific Ocean Blue,\" we need to verify whether it was re-released by Caribou Records before 2008 and if this is indeed the earliest re-release compared to others listed in the table.\n\nThe relevant information for this verification involves examining the rows related to \"Dennis Wilson\" with the album title \"pacific ocean blue.\" We are interested in both the year of release and the catalog number, which may indicate a different edition or format:\n\n1. **Row 13**: The entry shows a re-release date of 1991 with catalog `zk 34354` for the CD format.\n2. **Row 14**: This indicates another release in 2008 with catalog details \"cd : 88697339322 lp : suz5212.1\" and formats being both CD and LP.\n\nThe claim specifies that this album's earliest re-release from Caribou Records is before 2008. Based on the data:\n- The year 1991 (Row 13) qualifies as a re-release prior to 2008.\n  \nTherefore, the information supports the claim because there was indeed a re-release in 1991, which predates 2008.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the statement is true.
