According to the provided HTML, there is only one such entry:\n   - Row 0: The \"away team\" is \"sydney spirit\".\n\n2. **Check \"Box Score\" Condition for These Entries**:\n   - For row 0 (\"22 october\"), where the \"away team\" is \"sydney spirit\", check if the \"box score\" column contains the text \"box score\". According to the table, it does.\n\n3. **Verify All Other Rows**: Since the claim specifies that all entries in the table should have \"box score\", we need to ensure this condition holds for every row:\n   - Row 0: Contains \"box score\"\n   - Row 1: Contains \"box score\"\n   - Row 2: Contains \"box score\"\n   - Row 3: Contains \"box score\"\n   - Row 4: Contains \"box score\"\n   - Row 5: Contains \"box score\"\n   - Row 6: Contains \"box score\"\n   - Row 7: Contains \"box score\"\n\nSince all entries in the table, including those where the away team is \"sydney spirit\", satisfy the condition of having \"box score\" labeled, the claim is true.\n\nNow, we construct the JSON object with our conclusion and relevant cell information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"box score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe only relevant cell to check directly pertains to the specific condition where the away team is \"sydney spirit\".
