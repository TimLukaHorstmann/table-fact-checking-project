    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Carlton, Collingwood, and Melbourne be all designate as home team\" is true or false, we need to inspect each row of the provided table to see whether Carlton, Collingwood, or Melbourne appear in the \"home team\" column.\n\nLet's evaluate:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Home Team: Hawthorn\n   - Away Team: Melbourne\n   - Relevance: This row shows that Melbourne is not a home team (it's an away team).\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Home Team: Fitzroy\n   - Away Team: Footscray\n   - Relevance: Neither Carlton, Collingwood, nor Melbourne are involved in this match.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Home Team: Essendon\n   - Away Team: North Melbourne\n   - Relevance: Again, none of the specified teams are part of this row.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Home Team: South Melbourne\n   - Away Team: St Kilda\n   - Relevance: No involvement from Carlton, Collingwood, or Melbourne in this match.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Home Team: Richmond\n   - Away Team: Collingwood\n   - Relevance: This row shows that Collingwood is an away team, not a home team.\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Home Team: Geelong\n   - Away Team: Carlton\n   - Relevance: In this row, Carlton appears as the away team, not the home team.\n\nFrom these evaluations, we can conclude:\n\n- Melbourne is never designated as a home team.\n- Collingwood is an away team in one match and does not appear as a home team.\n- Carlton is also only listed as an away team.\n\nThus, none of the teams (Carlton, Collingwood, Melbourne) are designated as the home team in any row of the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this evaluation are all rows under the \"home team\" column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
