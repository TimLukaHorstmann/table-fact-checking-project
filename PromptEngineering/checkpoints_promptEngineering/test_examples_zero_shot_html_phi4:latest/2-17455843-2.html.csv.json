    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Aldershot have the highest scoring game within the 1930 - 31 FA Cup,\" we need to analyze the provided table of match results from a specific round in the competition.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   The claim focuses on finding which team (in this case, Aldershot) had the highest total goals scored in their game during the 1930-31 FA Cup season.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   We need to look at the \"Score\" column for each row as it indicates the number of goals scored by both teams combined in each match. \n\n3. **Examine Each Match Score**: \n   - Match 1: Scarborough vs Stockton, Score: 0-5 (Total Goals = 5)\n   - Match 2: Burton United vs Bradford Park Avenue, Score: 0-7 (Total Goals = 7)\n   - Match 3: Clapton Orient vs Fulham, Score: 2-1 (Total Goals = 3)\n   - Match 4: Leyton vs Millwall, Score: 3-1 (Total Goals = 4)\n   - Match 5: Lincoln City vs Manchester United, Score: 0-7 (Total Goals = 7)\n   - ...\n   - Match 34: Aldershot vs Peterborough & Fletton United, Score: 4-1 (Total Goals = 5)\n\n4. **Identify Highest Total Goals**:\n   From the data provided, matches with the highest total goals scored are:\n   - Burton United vs Bradford Park Avenue and Lincoln City vs Manchester United, each with a total of 7 goals.\n\n5. **Compare Aldershot's Score**:\n   - Aldershot's match against Peterborough & Fletton United had a score of 4-1, totaling 5 goals.\n   - This is less than the highest goal-scoring matches (total of 7 goals).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Since Aldershot did not have the highest scoring game (as there were other games with more total goals), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are those that contain scores for all matches, particularly focusing on identifying the highest totals and comparing them against Aldershot's score. Thus, these cells will primarily be from column \"Score\" for each match listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
