Extract the values of max motive power rpm for each model listed in the table:\n\n   - Panamera: 6200 RPM\n   - Panamera 4: 6200 RPM\n   - Panamera Diesel: 3800 - 4400 RPM (range)\n   - Panamera S: 6000 RPM\n   - Panamera 4S: 6000 RPM\n   - Panamera S E-Hybrid: 5500 RPM\n   - **Panamera GTS**: 6700 RPM\n   - Panamera Turbo: 6000 RPM\n\n3.

Locate the column for CO2 emissions, which is labeled as \"emissions co2\".\n\n3. Extract the values from the specified column and rows:\n   - For \"panamera\", the value in the \"emissions co2\" column is \"196 g / km\".\n   - For \"panamera 4\", the value in the \"emissions co2\" column is \"203 g / km\".\n\n4. Calculate the difference between these two values:\n   - \"panamera 4\" emissions: 203 g/km\n   - \"panamera\" emissions: 196 g/km\n   - Difference = 203 g/km - 196 g/km = 7 g/km\n\n5. The claim states that \"panamera have 7 g / km emission co2 than panamera 4\". This means the \"panamera\" should have 7 g/km less emissions than \"panamera 4\".\n\n6. Since the calculated difference is indeed 7 g/km, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are those containing the CO2 emissions for both models.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"emissions co2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"emissions co2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
