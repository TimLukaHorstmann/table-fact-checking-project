The fighter is Muhsin Corbbrey.\n2. There are 2 wins by TKO.\n3. These fights occurred between 2005 and 2009.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Wins by TKO:** \n   - We need to find rows where the \"result\" column has a value of \"win\" and the \"method\" column indicates \"tko\".\n\n2. **Check Date Range (2005-2009):**\n   - Ensure these wins fall within the date range from 2005 to 2009.\n\n3. **Count Such Wins:**\n   - Count the number of such occurrences and verify if it equals 2.\n\n**Relevant Data Extraction:**\n\n1. **Row by Row Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row Index 0 (Date: 2009-02-28):**\n     - \"result\": win\n     - \"method\": decision\n     - Not a TKO win.\n   \n   - **Row Index 1 (Date: 2006-09-15):**\n     - \"result\": win\n     - \"method\": tko\n     - Within the date range. Relevant.\n\n   - **Row Index 3 (Date: 2006-04-21):**\n     - \"result\": win\n     - \"method\": tko\n     - Within the date range. Relevant.\n\n2. **Count of Wins by TKO in Specified Date Range:**\n\n   - From the analysis, we identified two relevant wins by TKO:\n     - Row Index 1 (2006-09-15)\n     - Row Index 3 (2006-04-21)\n\nThe claim specifies there should be 2 such wins, which matches our findings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied.

Tim Coleman fought against Ryan Rayonec, Shelton Barnes, Kareem Robinson, Anthony Abrams, Ben Lock, Emanuel Gonz\u00e1lez, and Ricardo Planter according to the data provided.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The claim is about a fight between Tim Coleman and Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006.\n- There is no evidence from the table of any fight involving both Tim Coleman and Muhsin Corbbrey during 2006 or at any time listed in the table.\n\nSince there is no record of a fight between Tim Coleman and Muhsin Corbbrey, we can conclude that:\n- The claim \"Tim Coleman have not lose a fight against Muhsin Corbbrey in 2006\" holds true because such an event never occurred according to the data.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE.
