The claim states: \"the date of the discus throw for bulgaria be after sep 5 1986.\" Let's break down this claim and verify it against the information in the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Event**: We are looking at the \"discus throw\" event.\n\n2. **Determine Relevant Details**:\n   - The athlete's nationality (Bulgaria) for the discus throw.\n   - The date on which the record was set by this athlete.\n\n3. **Locate the Discus Throw Row in the Table**:\n   - In the table, we find the \"discus throw\" event listed under the `event` column with row index 16.\n\n4. **Check Nationality**:\n   - The relevant cell for nationality is: \n     - Row Index: 16\n     - Column Name: `nationality`\n   - Value in this cell is \"bulgaria,\" confirming that the athlete was Bulgarian.\n\n5. **Check Date**:\n   - The relevant cell for date is:\n     - Row Index: 16\n     - Column Name: `date`\n   - The value in this cell is \"5 september 1986.\"\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim requires that the date of the discus throw by Bulgaria be after September 5, 1986.\n   - However, the record was set on September 5, 1986, not after.\n\nThus, since the date is not after September 5, 1986, but exactly on this date, the claim does not hold true.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the discus throw for Bulgaria occurred after September 5, 1986, is \"FALSE.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
