    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding tie games and penalty kicks from the provided HTML table:\n\n1. **Identify Tie Games:**\n   - A game is considered tied at the end of regulation play if the total score after both rounds is equal.\n   - From the table, we need to check each row's \"score\" column for ties.\n\n2. **Check Rows for Ties:**\n   - Row 0 (Toulouse FC vs. OGC Nice): Score is \"2 - 2\". This is a tie at the end of regulation play.\n   - Row 1 (Lille OSC vs. AJ Auxerre): Score is \"2 - 2\". This is also a tie at the end of regulation play.\n   - Row 2 (Montpellier HSC vs. FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard): Score is \"2 - 3\". Not a tie.\n   - Row 3 (Stade de Reims vs. Le Havre AC): Score is \"2 - 1\". Not a tie.\n   - Row 4 (FC Metz vs. FC Mulhouse): Score is \"3 - 0\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the scores in the given table and identify the highest-scoring game of the round. The claim states that the highest scoring game saw 5 goals scored.\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"score,\" which shows the aggregate score from both teams for each match. We will go through each row, extract the total number of goals scored in each game, and identify the maximum.\n\nHere's a step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Row 0**: The scores are listed as \"2 - 2\". This results in a total of \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) goals.\n   \n2. **Row 1**: The scores are \"2 - 2\", resulting in a total of \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) goals.\n\n3. **Row 2**: The scores are \"2 - 3\". This gives a total of \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) goals.\n\n4. **Row 3**: The scores are \"2 - 1\", resulting in a total of \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) goals.\n\n5. **Row 4**: The scores are \"3 - 0\", resulting in a total of \\(3 + 0 = 3\\) goals.\n\n6. **Row 5**: The scores are \"0 - 1\". This results in a total of \\(0 + 1 = 1\\) goal.\n\n7. **Row 6**: The scores are \"3 - 5\", giving a total of \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) goals.\n\n8. **Row 7**: The scores are \"0 - 0\", resulting in a total of \\(0 + 0 = 0\\) goals.\n\nBy examining all the rows, we find that the highest number of goals scored in a single game is 8 (in row 6). Therefore, the claim that the highest scoring game saw 5 goals is incorrect; it should be 8 goals. \n\nConsequently, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE\".

We will focus on the \"score\" column as it summarizes the results of both rounds combined, but we'll also confirm by checking individual round scores if necessary.\n\nHere's how to assess each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: `toulouse fc (d1)` vs. `ogc nice (d1)`\n   - Combined Score: `2 - 2`\n   - At least one goal was scored in the match.\n   \n2. **Row 1**: `lille osc (d1)` vs. `aj auxerre (d1)`\n   - Combined Score: `2 - 2`\n   - At least one goal was scored in the match.\n\n3. **Row 2**: `montpellier hsc (d1)` vs. `fc sochaux - montb\u00e9liard (d2)`\n   - Combined Score: `2 - 3`\n   - At least one goal was scored in the match.\n   \n4. **Row 3**: `stade de reims (d2)` vs. `le havre ac (d1)`\n   - Combined Score: `2 - 1`\n   - At least one goal was scored in the match.\n\n5. **Row 4**: `fc metz (d1)` vs. `fc mulhouse (d2)`\n   - Combined Score: `3 - 0`\n   - At least one goal was scored in the match.\n   \n6. **Row 5**: `fc s\u00e8te (d2)` vs. `rc lens (d1)`\n   - Combined Score: `0 - 1`\n   - At least one goal was scored in the match.\n\n7. **Row 6**: `aep bourg sous la roche (d2)` vs. `stade quimp\u00e9rois (d2)`\n   - Combined Score: `3 - 5`\n   - At least one goal was scored in the match.\n   \n8. **Row 7**: `so chtellerault (d2)` vs. `us cr\u00e9teil (d3)`\n   - Combined Score: `0 - 0`\n   - No goals were scored in this match.\n\nUpon reviewing each row, we find that row 7 has a combined score of `0 - 0`, indicating no goals were scored throughout the entire game.
