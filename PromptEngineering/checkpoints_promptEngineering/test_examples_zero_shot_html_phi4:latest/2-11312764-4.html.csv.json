    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"emi watanabe be rank 1 place higher than dagmar lurz in the 1979 world figure skate championship,\" we need to analyze specific data from the provided table.\n\nThe claim suggests that EMI WATANABE's position is one rank higher than DAGMAR LURZ. Therefore, we should check their respective rankings (in the \"Rank\" column) and ensure that EMI WATANABE's rank is indeed one less than DAGMAR LURZ's rank.\n\nLet's look at the relevant data:\n\n1. Locate EMI WATANABE in the table:\n   - Row index: 2\n   - Rank: 3\n\n2. Locate DAGMAR LURZ in the table:\n   - Row index: 3\n   - Rank: 4\n\nEMI WATANABE has a rank of 3, and DAGMAR LURZ has a rank of 4, indicating that EMI WATANABE is indeed one place higher than DAGMAR LURZ. This supports the claim.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- For EMI WATANABE: Row index 2, \"Rank\" column\n- For DAGMAR LURZ: Row index 3, \"Rank\" column\n\nThe JSON response reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
