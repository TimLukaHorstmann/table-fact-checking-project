    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"on september 26 , 1971 the attendance at the game be 57895 crowd,\" we need to verify specific details from the table provided:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: The claim specifies a date of September 26, 1971. We must locate this date in the table.\n\n2. **Attendance Verification**: According to the claim, the attendance on that date was 57,895. We should check if the attendance number matches with what is listed in the table for the corresponding row and column.\n\nBy examining the table:\n\n- The \"date\" column indicates that September 26, 1971, corresponds to week 2.\n- In week 2, the \"attendance\" column shows a value of 57,895.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are met by the data from the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- The cell at row index 1 (corresponding to week 2) and column \"date.\"\n- The cell at row index 1 and column \"attendance.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of it against the given table:\n\n1. The week number 14 should correspond to September 26, 1971.\n2. The attendance for that date (if applicable) should be 57,895.\n\nLet's examine these conditions in relation to the provided table:\n\n- **Week Number and Date Check:**\n  - According to the table:\n    - Week 1 is on September 19, 1971.\n    - Week 2 is on September 26, 1971.\n    - Weeks continue sequentially with dates increasing by about a week.\n\n  From this pattern, it's evident that week 14 cannot be on September 26, 1971. By the time we reach week 14:\n  - Week 13 is on December 12, 1971.\n  - Week 14 is on December 19, 1971.\n\n- **Attendance Check:**\n  - The attendance for September 26, 1971 (week 2) is indeed 57,895. However, this information doesn't apply to week 14 since the date is incorrect in the claim.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- The first part of the claim (\"week 14 be on september 26 , 1971\") is false because week 14 corresponds to December 19, 1971.\n- Although the attendance for September 26, 1971, matches the figure given in the claim (57,895), this date does not correspond to week 14.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is FALSE. The relevant cells needed to verify this are:\n\n- Row corresponding to Week 2 and the \"date\" column to check the actual date for September 26, 1971.\n- Row corresponding to Week 14 and the \"date\" column to verify that it corresponds to December 19, 1971.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
