According to the table, this corresponds to row index 6 (as games are numbered from 3 and not 0).\n\n2. **Assist Verification for John Wall:**\n   - Check if John Wall had 11 assists in that game.\n   - From row index 6 under the column \"high assists\", we see \"kirk hinrich, john wall (6)\". This indicates that John Wall made 6 assists on November 12.\n\n3. **Leading Assists Verification:**\n   - Confirm whether John Wall led both teams in assists with 11.\n   - Since John Wall had only 6 assists and not 11, he did not lead the game in assists for either team.\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n\n- John Wall's assist count is incorrect (he had 6, not 11).\n- He did not lead both teams in assists on November 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index 6, column \"high assists\" to check John Wall's actual assists.\n- Row index 6, column \"team\" or related information about opposing players' assists to confirm who led (though not explicitly needed as we already have sufficient evidence from his own assist count).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
