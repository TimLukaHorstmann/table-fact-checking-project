    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant columns and rows.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n\n1. **Date Column**: We will focus on entries from the year 2002.\n2. **Score Column**: This column shows how many goals were scored by Carsten Jancker in each match (assuming he is included in the \"score\" tally).\n3. **Relevant Matches**:\n   - **9 May 2002**: Scored 7-0, so potentially 7 goals.\n   - **1 June 2002**: Scored 4-0, so potentially 4 goals.\n   - **21 August 2002**: Scored 2-2, so potentially 2 goals.\n   - **11 October 2002**: Scored 1-1, so potentially 1 goal.\n\n### Counting Goals:\n\n- From the match on **9 May 2002**, if Carsten Jancker scored any of those 7 goals, it would contribute to his total for 2002.\n- On **1 June 2002**, he could have scored up to 4 goals.\n- On **21 August 2002**, he could have scored up to 2 goals.\n- On **11 October 2002**, he could have scored up to 1 goal.\n\nTo verify the claim of scoring exactly 4 goals, we need to determine if Carsten Jancker's total number of goals from these matches equals 4. However, without specific attribution of goals to him in each match, we cannot definitively say how many he scored.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that the table does not specify which player scored the goals, we cannot confirm or deny that Carsten Jancker scored exactly 4 international goals in 2002 based solely on this data. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the information provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that \"over half of the goal score be during world cup game or world cup qualifier game.\" This implies we need to check if more than half of the total goals scored in all matches were from those competitions.\n\nLet's break down each row relevant to this analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Total Goals:**\n   - We will calculate the total number of goals scored across all matches.\n   - Extract the `score` column, which is formatted as \"X - Y\", where X represents the goals scored by the home team and Y represents the goals scored by the away team.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Matches:**\n   - We need to identify rows where the competition is either \"2002 world cup\" or \"2002 world cup qualifier\".\n   - For these matches, we will extract the number of goals scored by the home team from the `score` column.\n\n3. **Calculate and Compare:**\n   - Sum up all the goals scored in each match to get the total.\n   - Sum up the goals scored specifically during \"2002 world cup\" or \"2002 world cup qualifier\".\n   - Check if the latter is more than half of the former.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - Competition: friendly\n  - Score: 1 - 0 (Goals scored by home team = 1)\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Competition: friendly\n  - Score: 6 - 2 (Goals scored by home team = 6)\n\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Competition: friendly\n  - Score: 8 - 2 (Goals scored by home team = 8)\n\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Competition: 2002 world cup qualifier\n  - Score: 2 - 2 (Goals scored by home team = 2)\n\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Competition: friendly\n  - Score: 3 - 0 (Goals scored by home team = 3)\n\n- **Row 5:** \n  - Competition: 2002 world cup qualifier\n  - Score: 1 - 0 (Goals scored by home team = 1)\n\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Competition: friendly\n  - Score: 7 - 0 (Goals scored by home team = 7)\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Competition: 2002 world cup\n  - Score: 4 - 0 (Goals scored by home team = 4)\n\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Competition: friendly\n  - Score: 2 - 2 (Goals scored by home team = 2)\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Competition: friendly\n  - Score: 1 - 1 (Goals scored by home team = 1)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Total goals scored in all matches:\n  - \\(1 + 6 + 8 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 35\\)\n\n- Goals scored during \"2002 world cup\" or \"2002 world cup qualifier\":\n  - Row 3: 2 goals\n  - Row 5: 1 goal\n  - Row 7: 4 goals\n  - Total: \\(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\\)\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- Half of the total goals: \\(35 / 2 = 17.5\\)\n- Goals during relevant competitions: 7\n\nSince 7 is not greater than 17.5, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant rows and columns for this analysis are:\n\n- Row 3: competition and score\n- Row 5: competition and score\n- Row 7: competition and score\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"only 1 international goal was scored in all friendly games,\" we need to analyze the table and focus on the entries where the competition type is \"friendly.\" For each friendly game, we'll look at both the 'score' and 'result' columns, as these contain information about goals scored. The relevant conditions involve checking if there's a scenario with exactly one goal in any of the matches.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step for entries where the competition is \"friendly\":\n\n1. **6th June 2000 (Row Index: 4)**:\n   - Competition: Friendly\n   - Score: 3 - 0\n   - Result: 5 - 2\n\n   In this entry, Germany scored 3 goals in their half of the scoreline.\n\n2. **9 May 2002 (Row Index: 7)**:\n   - Competition: Friendly\n   - Score: 7 - 0\n   - Result: 7 - 0\n\n   Here, Germany scored 7 goals in their half of the scoreline.\n\n3. **21 August 2002 (Row Index: 8)**:\n   - Competition: Friendly\n   - Score: 2 - 2\n   - Result: 2 - 2\n\n   In this match, Germany scored 2 goals in their half of the scoreline.\n\n4. **11 October 2002 (Row Index: 9)**:\n   - Competition: Friendly\n   - Score: 1 - 1\n   - Result: 1 - 1\n\n   Here, Germany scored 1 goal in their half of the scoreline.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that there is at least one friendly match where more than one goal was scored by the team (Germany) in question. Therefore, the claim \"only 1 international goal was scored in all friendly games\" does not hold true for the table data provided.\n\nHence, the relevant cells to verify this claim are found in the rows with competition labeled as \"friendly.\" We will specifically extract the 'score' column entries from these rows.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Carsten Jancker's team's lowest score is true or false, we need to examine the scores from the given table and identify if there exists a lower score than 3.\n\nThe relevant column for this analysis is the \"score\" column in the table because it represents the goals scored by Carsten Jancker's team. The claim states that the lowest score of all time is 3, so we need to check each entry under the \"score\" column and find the minimum value among them.\n\nLet's examine the scores from the table:\n\n1. June 3, 2000: Score is 1 - 0\n2. June 7, 2000: Score is 6 - 2\n3. June 7, 2000: Score is 8 - 2\n4. June 2, 2001: Score is 2 - 2\n5. August 15, 2001: Score is 3 - 0\n6. September 1, 2001: Score is 1 - 0\n7. May 9, 2002: Score is 7 - 0\n8. June 1, 2002: Score is 4 - 0\n9. August 21, 2002: Score is 2 - 2\n10. October 11, 2002: Score is 1 - 1\n\nFrom these scores, the lowest score achieved by Carsten Jancker's team in terms of goals scored (the first number in each \"score\" entry) are:\n\n- June 3, 2000: 1 goal\n- September 1, 2001: 1 goal\n- October 11, 2002: 1 goal\n\nThe lowest score here is indeed 1, which occurs on multiple occasions. Since there exists a lower score than 3 (specifically, scores of 1), the claim that \"Carsten Jancker's team's lowest score of all time be 3\" is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion:\n\n- Row index 0: Score is 1 - 0\n- Row index 6: Score is 1 - 0\n- Row index 10: Score is 1 - 1\n\nThese rows contain scores lower than 3, thus making the claim false.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
