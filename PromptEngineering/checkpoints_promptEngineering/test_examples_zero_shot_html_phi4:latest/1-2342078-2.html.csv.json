Then, we check if this count equals 10 as claimed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n1. **Count Episodes Directed by Oscar Rudolph:**\n   - Episode 101 (Row 0): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 102 (Row 1): Directed by John Tracy\n   - Episode 103 (Row 2): Directed by Fred DeLuca\n   - Episode 104 (Row 3): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 105 (Row 4): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 106 (Row 5): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 107 (Row 6): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 108 (Row 7): Directed by John Tracy\n   - Episode 109 (Row 8): Directed by Fred DeLuca\n   - Episode 110 (Row 9): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 111 (Row 10): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 112 (Row 11): Directed by Fred DeLuca\n   - Episode 113 (Row 12): Directed by John Tracy\n   - Episode 114 (Row 13): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 115 (Row 14): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 116 (Row 15): Directed by David Alexander\n   - Episode 117 (Row 16): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 118 (Row 17): Directed by Herb Wallerstein\n   - Episode 119 (Row 18): Directed by Russ Mayberry\n   - Episode 120 (Row 19): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 121 (Row 20): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 122 (Row 21): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 123 (Row 22): Directed by Oscar Rudolph\n   - Episode 124 (Row 23): Directed by George Cahan\n\n2. **Count the Episodes:**\n   By counting, we find that Oscar Rudolph directed episodes 101, 104, 105, 106, 107, 110, 111, 114, 115, 117, 120, 121, 122, and 123. This gives us a total of **14** episodes.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   The claim states that \"10 of the first 24 episodes\" were directed by Oscar Rudolph. However, our count shows there are actually 14 such episodes.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the number of episodes directed by Oscar Rudolph (14) is not equal to 10, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   The relevant cells are those containing the \"Episode\" and \"Directed by\" columns for rows 0 through 23.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
