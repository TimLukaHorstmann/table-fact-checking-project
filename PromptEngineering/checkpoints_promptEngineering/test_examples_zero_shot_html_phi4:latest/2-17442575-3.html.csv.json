Therefore, Detroit Red Wings won this game.\n\n3. **Check the record after the game**:\n   - The \"Record\" column for April 10 shows a 1 - 1 score between both teams, confirming that each team has one win at this point in the series.\n\nThe claim states: \"on april 10 the chicago black hawk v detroit red wing 's record be 1 - 1\". Based on the information from the table:\n- The record is indeed 1 - 1.\n- This means the statement about their record is accurate, though it does not clarify that Detroit Red Wings won this specific game.\n\nSince we are focusing solely on whether the record was correctly stated as \"1 - 1\" for April 10 and not who specifically won or lost, the claim regarding the record is true. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify the claim are those in row_index 1:\n- The score: 7 - 0 indicates Detroit Red Wings' win.\n- The record: 1 - 1 confirms that both teams have one win each.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
