    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the only player with a total score of 141 be jay haas,\" we need to examine the table for players with a total score of 141 and verify if Jay Haas is indeed the only one.\n\nLet's go through the relevant part of the table:\n\n1. **Row Index 9**:\n   - Player: Jay Haas\n   - Total Score: 71 + 70 = 141\n\n2. **Row Index 10**:\n   - Player: Davis Love III\n   - Total Score: 70 + 71 = 141\n\n3. **Row Index 11**:\n   - Player: Tom Watson\n   - Total Score: 71 + 70 = 141\n\n4. **Row Index 8**:\n   - Player: Mark Calcavecchia\n   - Total Score: 74 + 67 = 141\n\nFrom this examination, we can see that there are four players with a total score of 141: Jay Haas, Davis Love III, Tom Watson, and Mark Calcavecchia. Therefore, the claim that \"the only player with a total score of 141 be jay haas\" is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- For Jay Haas:\n  - Row Index: 9\n  - Column Name: \"player\"\n  - Column Name: \"score\"\n\n- For Davis Love III:\n  - Row Index: 10\n  - Column Name: \"player\"\n  - Column Name: \"score\"\n\n- For Tom Watson:\n  - Row Index: 11\n  - Column Name: \"player\"\n  - Column Name: \"score\"\n\n- For Mark Calcavecchia:\n  - Row Index: 8\n  - Column Name: \"player\"\n  - Column Name: \"score\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. Here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
