    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"martin laird be not 1 of the 2 who have 24 event,\" we need to determine how many players in the table have participated in 24 events and whether Martin Laird is one of them.\n\nLet's examine the relevant column, which is the \"events\" column:\n\n- Row 0 (index 1): Matt Kuchar has 24 events.\n- Row 1 (index 2): Dustin Johnson has 22 events.\n- Row 2 (index 3): Charley Hoffman has 22 events.\n- Row 3 (index 4): Steve Stricker has 18 events.\n- Row 4 (index 5): Paul Casey has 16 events.\n- Row 5 (index 6): Jason Day has 23 events.\n- Row 6 (index 7): Luke Donald has 19 events.\n- Row 7 (index 8): Ernie Els has 19 events.\n- Row 8 (index 9, Martin Laird): Martin Laird has 24 events.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that there are exactly two players who have participated in 24 events: Matt Kuchar and Martin Laird. Therefore, Martin Laird is indeed one of the two players with 24 events.\n\nThe claim states that Martin Laird should not be one of these two players, which contradicts our findings. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used to verify this claim:\n\n- For Matt Kuchar: Row index 1, Column \"events\" (value 24)\n- For Martin Laird: Row index 9, Column \"events\" (value 24)\n\nThe JSON response reflecting these findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
