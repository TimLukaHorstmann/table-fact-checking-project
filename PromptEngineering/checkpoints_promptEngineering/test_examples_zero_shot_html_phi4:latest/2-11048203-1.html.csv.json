The claim states that Hatem Aqel competed in a competition that started on December 16, 2003.\n2. The claim also mentions that he competed in a competition ending on October 28, 2013.\n\nLet's break down these points using the relevant columns from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Competition Start Date\n- **Column to Check**: `date`\n- We need to find if there is any entry with a date of \"16 december 2002\" because it might be a typo or misunderstanding for December 16, 2003.\n  \nUpon checking:\n- Row index 0 has the date \"16 december 2002\", not December 16, 2003.\n\n### Condition 2: Competition End Date\n- **Column to Check**: `date`\n- We need to find if there is any entry with a date of \"28 october 2013\" because it might be a typo or misunderstanding for October 28, 2013.\n  \nUpon checking:\n- Row index 8 has the date \"28 october 2013\", which matches.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The table does not contain an entry starting on December 16, 2003. It contains one from December 16, 2002.\n- There is an entry ending on October 28, 2013.\n\nSince one of the conditions (start date) in the claim is incorrect based on the data provided, the entire claim cannot be considered true.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells for verification are those corresponding to the start and end dates mentioned in the claim:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and count the occurrences of matches under two specific competition categories: \"friendly\" and \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\" as well as \"2007 afc asian cup qualification\".\n\n### Steps for Analysis:\n\n1. **Count Matches in Each Competition Category**:\n   - Identify rows where the \"competition\" column contains the value \"friendly\".\n   - Count these occurrences.\n   \n2. **Count Matches in AFC Asian Cup Qualification Categories**:\n   - Identify rows where the \"competition\" column matches either \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\", \"2007 afc asian cup qualification\", or \"2011 afc asian cup qualification\".\n   - These are all related to AFC Asian Cup qualification, so count these occurrences.\n\n3. **Compare Counts**:\n   - Check if the number of \"friendly\" matches is one less than the total number of AFC Asian Cup qualification matches.\n\n### Relevant Rows and Cells:\n\n- **Friendly Matches**:\n  - Row index 3: Venue = \"amman\", Score = \"1 - 1\", Result = \"draw\", Competition = \"friendly\"\n  - Row index 4: Venue = \"amman\", Score = \"2 - 0\", Result = \"win\", Competition = \"friendly\"\n  - Row index 8: Venue = \"amman\", Score = \"1 - 3\", Result = \"loss\", Competition = \"friendly\"\n  - Row index 9: Venue = \"amman\", Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"win\", Competition = \"friendly\"\n\n- **AFC Asian Cup Qualification Matches**:\n  - Row index 1: Venue = \"amman\", Score = \"1 - 0\", Result = \"win\", Competition = \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\"\n  - Row index 2: Venue = \"amman\", Score = \"5 - 0\", Result = \"win\", Competition = \"2006 fifa world cup qualification\" (not part of AFC Asian Cup)\n  - Row index 5: Venue = \"amman\", Score = \"3 - 0\", Result = \"win\", Competition = \"2007 afc asian cup qualification\"\n  - Row index 6: Venue = \"singapore\", Score = \"2 - 1\", Result = \"loss\", Competition = \"2011 afc asian cup qualification\"\n\n### Count and Comparison:\n\n- Friendly Matches: 4\n- AFC Asian Cup Qualification Matches: 3\n\nThe claim states there are one less friendly match than AFC Asian Cup qualification matches. However, we have more friendly matches (4) compared to AFC Asian Cup qualification matches (3).\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
