We must look for this specific date in the \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Outcome Check**: According to the claim, the outcome should be \"winner\". We need to verify if the row with the date \"29 April 2012\" has an \"outcome\" listed as \"winner\".\n\n3. **Opponent Check**: The claim states that \"Tommy Robredo\" was the opponent in the final for this match. Thus, we must confirm whether the \"opponent in the final\" column lists \"Tommy Robredo\" for the row with the date \"29 April 2012\".\n\nNow let's examine the table:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Date: \"29 April 2012\"\n  - Outcome: \"runner-up\"\n  - Opponent in the Final: \"Gilles Simon\"\n\nThe outcome is \"runner-up\", not \"winner\". Therefore, this part of the claim does not hold true.\n\nSince the outcome for the date \"29 April 2012\" is \"runner-up\" and not \"winner\", we do not need to check further details like the opponent.

We must find a row with this exact date.\n2. **Outcome Verification**: Although not explicitly stated in the claim, it implies that Tommy Robredo was involved in a final match on that date, so we should check for a corresponding outcome (either \"winner\" or \"runner-up\").\n3. **Opponent Verification**: The opponent's name must be Tommy Robredo according to the claim.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row of the table:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Date: April 29, 2012\n  - This date does not match July 28, 2013, so this row is irrelevant for our claim.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Date: September 23, 2012\n  - This date does not match July 28, 2013, making this row irrelevant as well.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Date: July 14, 2013\n  - Although the year and month partially match, the day is different. Thus, it's irrelevant for verifying the claim.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Date: July 21, 2013\n  - Again, this date doesn't match July 28, 2013, so this row is also irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Date: July 28, 2013 (matches the claim)\n  - Outcome: Runner-up (consistent with a final match scenario)\n  - Opponent in the Final: Tommy Robredo (matches the opponent mentioned in the claim)\n\nBased on this analysis, row 4 satisfies all conditions of the claim.
