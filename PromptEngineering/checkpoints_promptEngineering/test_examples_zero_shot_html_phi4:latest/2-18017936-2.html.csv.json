Check whether both \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" and \"fc ditton - 2 daugavpils\" have a goal difference above 50.\n2. Ensure that no other club in the table has a goal difference above 50.\n\nLet's examine each relevant row for these conditions:\n\n1. **Row 0: jfk olimps r\uce74ga**\n   - Goal Difference: +96\n   - This is indeed greater than 50.\n\n2. **Row 1: fc ditton - 2 daugavpils**\n   - Goal Difference: +64\n   - This is also above 50.\n\nNow, we check all other rows to ensure no other clubs have a goal difference above 50:\n\n3. **Row 2: ventspils**\n   - Goal Difference: +73\n\n4. **Row 3: j\ud070rmala - 2**\n   - Goal Difference: +12\n\n5. **Row 4: tranz\uce74ts ventspils**\n   - Goal Difference: -51\n\n6. **Row 5: multibanka riga**\n   - Goal Difference: -24\n\n7. **Row 6: fk auda kekava**\n   - Goal Difference: -51\n\n8. **Row 7: alberts riga**\n   - Goal Difference: -82\n\n9. **Row 8: abuls smiltene**\n   - Goal Difference: -173\n\n10. **Row 9 to Row 15** (other clubs not listed explicitly): \n    - All other rows have goal differences less than or equal to +50.\n\nThe only club with a goal difference above 50, besides \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" and \"fc ditton - 2 daugavpils\", is the club in Row 2 (\"ventspils\") with a goal difference of +73.
