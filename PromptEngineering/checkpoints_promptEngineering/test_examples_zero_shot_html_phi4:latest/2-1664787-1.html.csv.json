Based on our analysis:\n- The competition before the final season (\"2012 - 13\") is \"uefa europa league.\"\n- Red Bull Salzburg also participated in the \"uefa europa league\" during the \"2011 - 12\" season.\n\nSince both are the same competition, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are:\n- The cell for row 11 (indexing from zero) and column \"competition,\" which tells us the competition in the \"2012 - 13\" season.\n- The cell for row 10 and column \"club,\" confirming that Red Bull Salzburg participated in the \"uefa europa league.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
