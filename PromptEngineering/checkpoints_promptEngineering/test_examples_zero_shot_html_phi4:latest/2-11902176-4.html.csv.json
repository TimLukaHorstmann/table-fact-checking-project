    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the game on November 19, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the provided table: \n\n1. The home team for the game.\n2. The score of the game.\n\nThe claim states that \"on november 19, the home team be montreal and the score be 4 - 2.\" Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Correct Date\nWe first need to identify the row corresponding to November 19 in the table. By examining each row under the \"date\" column, we find that:\n\n- The fifth row corresponds to \"november 8\"\n- The sixth row corresponds to \"november 10\"\n- ...\n- **The ninth row corresponds to \"november 19\"**\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Home Team\nFor November 19, check the \"home\" column in the table:\n\n- In the ninth row, under the \"home\" column, it lists \"montreal.\"\n\nThis matches the claim that the home team was Montreal.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Score\nNext, we need to verify the score for the same date. Check the \"score\" column in the table for November 19:\n\n- In the ninth row, under the \"score\" column, it lists \"4 - 2.\"\n\nThis matches the claim that the score was 4 - 2.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- The home team on November 19 is indeed Montreal.\n- The score for the game on that date is accurately given as 4 - 2.\n\nThus, the entire claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's construct the relevant JSON object to capture these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON indicates that the claim is true and points to the relevant cells in the table for verification.",

Therefore, there is no instance where Montreal was the home team with a score of 4 - 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because Montreal never hosted a game with that specific score.\n\nThe relevant cells are in row 10 for verifying that Montreal was not home and in row 18 to verify the score when Ottawa played against Montreal.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
