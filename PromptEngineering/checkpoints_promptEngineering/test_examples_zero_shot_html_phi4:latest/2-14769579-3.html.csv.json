Thailand is outside of China, India, and South Korea.\n   - 1982: Location is New Delhi (India). India does not satisfy the condition.\n   - 1986: Location is Seoul (South Korea). South Korea does not satisfy the condition.\n   - 1990: Location is Beijing (China). China does not satisfy the condition.\n   - 1994: Location is Hiroshima (Japan). Japan satisfies the condition, but it's earlier than 1998.\n   - 1998: Location is Bangkok (Thailand). Thailand satisfies the condition and is after all previous years that satisfied it.\n   - 2002: Location is Busan (South Korea). South Korea does not satisfy the condition.\n   - 2006: Location is Doha (Qatar). Qatar satisfies the condition, which means 1998 isn't the latest year for an outside location.\n   - 2010: Location is Guangzhou (China). China does not satisfy the condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that 1998 is the latest such year.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to examine each row in the table and check the \"year\" and \"location\" columns. The claim states that 1986 is the only year where the location is neither South Korea nor India. Thus, for all other years, the locations must be either South Korea or India.\n\n1. **Identify Locations of Interest:**\n   - South Korea: Seoul, Busan\n   - India: New Delhi\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n\n   - **1978**: Location is Bangkok (not South Korea or India).\n     - This does not support the claim.\n   \n   - **1982**: Location is New Delhi (India).\n     - Supports the claim as it's in India.\n\n   - **1986**: Location is Seoul (South Korea).\n     - The year and location are specifically mentioned in the claim, so this supports the claim by being an exception.\n\n   - **1990**: Location is Beijing (not South Korea or India).\n     - This does not support the claim.\n   \n   - **1994**: Location is Hiroshima (Japan, not South Korea or India).\n     - This does not support the claim.\n   \n   - **1998**: Location is Bangkok (not South Korea or India).\n     - This does not support the claim.\n   \n   - **2002**: Location is Busan (South Korea).\n     - Supports the claim as it's in South Korea.\n\n   - **2006**: Location is Doha (not South Korea or India).\n     - This does not support the claim.\n\n   - **2010**: Location is Guangzhou (China, not South Korea or India).\n     - This does not support the claim.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The years 1978, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2006, and 2010 have locations that are neither in South Korea nor India.\n   - Therefore, 1986 is not the only year with such a condition; there are multiple instances where the location is outside of South Korea or India.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.
