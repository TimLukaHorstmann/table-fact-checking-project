Check if \"allen\" had 12 points on that date.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n- **Locate November 17 in the Table:**\n  - The game played on November 17 is against Georgetown with a score of \"l 46 - 45\". This information is found in row index 1.\n\n- **Check High Points for November 17 (Row 1):**\n  - According to the table, \"high points\" for this game are listed as \"allen - 12\".\n  - No other player's points are mentioned in this column for this date. Thus, \"allen\" scored the most with 12 points.\n\n- **Confirm Points Scored by Allen:**\n  - The entry explicitly states \"allen - 12\", confirming that Allen did score 12 points on November 17.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n1.
