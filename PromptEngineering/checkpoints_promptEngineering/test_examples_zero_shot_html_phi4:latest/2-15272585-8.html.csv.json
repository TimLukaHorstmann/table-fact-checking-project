    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Galina Voskoboeva's play percentage on different surfaces from the given table, we need to analyze her match outcomes across various court types:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We will focus on two columns to determine surface type and count matches:\n     - `surface`: This column indicates whether a match was played on clay or hard.\n     - `outcome`: This helps verify that the listed records are part of Voskoboeva's game history.\n\n2. **Count Matches on Each Surface:**\n   - Total number of matches in the table = 5\n   - Clay surface matches:\n     - Row 3: Latina (clay) \u2013 Runner-up\n     - Row 5: Cuneo, Italy (clay) \u2013 Winner\n     - Count = 2 clay matches\n   - Hard surface matches:\n     - Row 1: Tipton (hard (i)) \u2013 Runner-up\n     - Row 2: Mont-de-Marsan (hard (i)) \u2013 Winner\n     - Row 4: Pittsburgh (hard) \u2013 Runner-up\n     - Count = 3 hard matches\n\n3. **Calculate Percentages:**\n   - Percentage of games on clay: \\((\\frac{2}{5}) \\times 100 = 40\\%\\)\n   - Percentage of games on hard (including hard (i)): \\((\\frac{3}{5}) \\times 100 = 60\\%\\)\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states she played 20% of her game on clay and 1% on hard.\n   - Our calculations show she actually played 40% on clay and 60% on hard.\n\nSince our findings do not align with the claim, we conclude that it is FALSE. \n\n5. **Determine Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to extract data from each row concerning the `surface` type:\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- Row 1, Column \"surface\": hard (i)\n- Row 2, Column \"surface\": hard (i)\n- Row 3, Column \"surface\": clay\n- Row 4, Column \"surface\": hard\n- Row 5, Column \"surface\": clay\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
