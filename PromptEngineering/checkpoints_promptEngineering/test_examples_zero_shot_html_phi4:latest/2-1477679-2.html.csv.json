    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"frankie laine be not the winner with the most week\" is true or false, we need to analyze the given table and verify if Frankie Laine's single holds the record for the highest number of weeks at a particular position.\n\nThe table provides information about various artists, their singles, the year(s) they were popular, and the number of weeks each single stayed in that position. Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Frankie Laine's Entry:**\n   - Look for Frankie Laine in the \"artist\" column.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row index 0 (first row): Artist is \"frankie laine\", single is \"i believe\", year is 1953, and weeks are \"18 weeks\".\n\n2. **Compare Weeks with Other Entries:**\n   - We need to check if any other entry in the \"weeks\" column has a higher number than 18 weeks.\n   - Here are the relevant entries:\n     - Row index 1: Artist is \"bryan adams\", weeks are \"16 weeks\".\n     - Row index 2: Artist is \"wet wet wet\", weeks are \"15 weeks\".\n     - Row index 3: Artist is \"queen\", weeks are \"14 weeks\".\n     - Row index 4: Artist is \"slim whitman\", weeks are \"11 weeks\".\n     - Row index 5: Artist is \"david whitfield\", weeks are \"10 weeks\".\n     - Row index 6: Artist is \"whitney houston\", weeks are \"10 weeks\".\n     - Row index 7: Artist is \"rihanna (feat jay - z )\", weeks are \"10 weeks\".\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Number of Weeks:**\n   - The highest number of weeks among all entries is 18, which corresponds to Frankie Laine's entry.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Frankie Laine did not have the most weeks.\n   - Since Frankie Laine's single \"i believe\" stayed for 18 weeks and no other entry surpasses this duration, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify the claim are those containing the number of weeks for each artist:\n     - Row index 0, column \"weeks\" (Frankie Laine's weeks).\n     - Row index 1, column \"weeks\".\n     - Row index 2, column \"weeks\".\n     - Row index 3, column \"weeks\".\n     - Row index 4, column \"weeks\".\n     - Row index 5, column \"weeks\".\n     - Row index 6, column \"weeks\".\n     - Row index 7, column \"weeks\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"weeks\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
