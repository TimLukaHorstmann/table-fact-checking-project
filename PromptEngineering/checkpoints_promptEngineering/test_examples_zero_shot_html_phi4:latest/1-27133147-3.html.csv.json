The `position in table` must be 10th.\n2. The `manner of departure` must be \"resigned\".\n3. The corresponding `date of vacancy` should be \"28 February 2011\".\n\nLet's go through the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 0 (Uni\u00e3o de Leiria):**\n  - Position in Table: Off-season\n  - Manner of Departure: Sacked\n\n- **Row 1 (Mar\u00edtimo):**\n  - Position in Table: 15th\n  - Manner of Departure: Sacked\n\n- **Row 2 (Naval 1 de Maio):**\n  - Position in Table: 14th\n  - Manner of Departure: Sacked\n\n- **Row 3 (Acad\u00e9mica):**\n  - Position in Table: 9th\n  - Manner of Departure: Resigned\n\n- **Row 4 (Naval 1 de Maio):**\n  - Position in Table: 16th\n  - Manner of Departure: Sacked\n\n- **Row 5 (Portimonense):**\n  - Position in Table: 16th\n  - Manner of Departure: Sacked\n\n- **Row 6 (Acad\u00e9mica):**\n  - Position in Table: 13th\n  - Manner of Departure: Resigned\n\n- **Row 7 (Sporting):**\n  - Position in Table: 3rd\n  - Manner of Departure: Resigned\n\n- **Row 8 (Beira-Mar):**\n  - Position in Table: 10th\n  - Manner of Departure: Resigned\n  - Date of Vacancy: 28 February 2011\n\n- **Row 9 (Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal):**\n  - Position in Table: 14th\n  - Manner of Departure: Sacked\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the only row where all conditions are met is Row 8:\n- The position in table is 10th.\n- The manner of departure is \"resigned\".\n- The date of vacancy is \"28 February 2011\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position in table\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
