    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Patrick Rafter won on the week of August 10\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to focus on specific cells related to the columns \"week\", \"winner and score\", and potentially \"tournament\". The relevant information will confirm if Patrick Rafter was indeed the winner for that particular week.\n\nLet's evaluate the claim step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Week:**\n   - According to the table, we need to find the row where the \"week\" column is marked as \"August 10\".\n\n2. **Check the Winner and Score:**\n   - Once we locate the appropriate week, we will check if Patrick Rafter's name appears in the \"winner and score\" column for that specific entry.\n\n3. **Verification through Table Rows:**\n\n   - **Row 6** has:\n     - `tournament`: Toronto\n     - `week`: August 3\n     - `winner and score`: Patrick Rafter 7 - 6 (3), 6 - 4\n\n     This row is not the correct week, so we move to the next.\n\n   - **Row 7** has:\n     - `tournament`: Cincinnati\n     - `week`: August 10\n     - `winner and score`: Patrick Rafter 1 - 6, 7 - 6 (2), 6 - 4\n\n     Here, we find that Patrick Rafter is indeed the winner for the week of \"August 10\".\n\nSince all conditions in the claim are met by row 7 where Patrick Rafter is listed as the winner on August 10, the claim is supported.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winner and score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- The row with index 6 is relevant to confirm that the tournament date matches August 10.\n- The row with index 7 provides the evidence of Patrick Rafter being the winner on that week.",
