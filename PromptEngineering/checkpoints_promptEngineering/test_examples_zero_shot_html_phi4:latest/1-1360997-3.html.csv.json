We need to locate this specific time within the \"time\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Locate Row with Time 1:36.30**:\n   - By examining each row under the \"time\" column, we find that the time \"1:36.30\" is in the third row (0-based index) of the table.\n\n3. **Verify Associated Details for This Row**:\n   - Result: The result for this row is \"won\".\n   - Date: The date associated with this race is \"07 sep 2002\".\n   - Race: The name of the race is \"chelmsford stakes\".\n   - Venue: The venue is \"randwick\".\n   - Group: The group classification is \"g2\".\n   - Distance: The distance for the race is \"1600 m\".\n   - Weight (kg): The weight carried is \"57.5 kg\".\n   - Time: Confirmed as \"1:36.30\".\n   - Jockey: The jockey is \"d beadman\".\n   - Winner/2nd: This column shows \"2nd - platinum scissors\".\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that at time 1:36.30, \"platinum scissors\" was shown as the winner. \n   - However, in this row, while the race result is \"won\" by the main horse (implied), \"platinum scissors\" is listed in the \"Winner/2nd\" column as coming second (\"2nd\").\n   \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim misrepresents the data; \"platinum scissors\" was not shown as the winner but rather as the runner-up (\"2nd\").\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3 (0-based index) for columns: `result`, `time`, and `winner/2nd`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner/2nd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
