    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the total medal counts for both the Soviet Union and East Germany as provided in the table:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - The Soviet Union (URS) is listed at rank 1.\n   - East Germany (GDR) is listed at rank 2.\n\n2. **Extract the total medal count from these rows:**\n   - For the Soviet Union, located in row index 0, the \"total\" column indicates a value of 29 medals.\n   - For East Germany, located in row index 1, the \"total\" column indicates a value of 25 medals.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - The claim states that the Soviet Union received 6 more medals than East Germany.\n   - Calculate the difference between their total medal counts:\n     \\[\n     29 \\text{ (Soviet Union)} - 25 \\text{ (East Germany)} = 4\n     \\]\n   - The calculated difference is 4, not 6.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the Soviet Union received 4 more medals than East Germany and not 6, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells:**\n   - For the Soviet Union, the \"total\" medal count in row index 0.\n   - For East Germany, the \"total\" medal count in row index 1.\n\nHere's the JSON response based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
