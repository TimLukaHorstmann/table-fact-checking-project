The number of losses (`lost`) should be exactly 4.\n2. The goal difference (`difference`) should be less than 24.\n\nLet's go through the rows that have `lost` equal to 4 and check their `difference`:\n\n- **Row 5 (Portuguesa):**\n  - Lost = 4\n  - Difference = -4\n\nSince -4 is less than 24, this row satisfies both conditions specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, there is at least one position that meets the criteria of having a loss of 4 and a difference of less than 24.
