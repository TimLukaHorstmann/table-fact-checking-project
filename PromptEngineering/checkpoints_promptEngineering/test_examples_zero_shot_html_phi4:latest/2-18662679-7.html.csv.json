    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Belarus takes less than 5 hours to complete the event\" is true or false, we need to focus on the specific entry for Belarus in the table and analyze their time.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The row corresponding to Belarus has a `row_index` of 6.\n\n2. **Locate the Time Column:**\n   - The column where the time is recorded is \"time\".\n\n3. **Extract the Time Value for Belarus:**\n   - From the table, in row 6 under the \"time\" column, we see that Belarus' time is `6:06.80`.\n\n4. **Convert Time to Hours:**\n   - The format given for time is minutes and seconds. Convert `6:06.80` into hours:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Minutes to hours} = 6/60 = 0.1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Seconds to hours} = 6.8/3600 \\approx 0.00189\n     \\]\n   - Total time in hours is approximately \\(0.1 + 0.00189 = 0.10189\\) hours.\n\n5. **Compare with 5 Hours:**\n   - The total time for Belarus (approximately 0.10189 hours) is indeed less than 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
