    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jon Sherman wrote the highest number of episodes\" is true or false, we need to evaluate each row in the table's column for \"written by.\" We'll count how many times Jon Sherman's name appears as part of the writing credit.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n1. **Row 3**: \"a guesthouse divided\"\n   - Written By: Constance M Burge & Jack Bernstein\n   - Jon Sherman is not mentioned here.\n   \n2. **Row 4**: \"dawn of the med\"\n   - Written By: Carol Flint & Jon Sherman\n   - Jon Sherman is credited once.\n\n3. **Row 5**: \"you give love a bad name\"\n   - Written By: Michael Rauch & Jessica Ball\n   - Jon Sherman is not mentioned here.\n   \n4. **Row 10**: \"who 's your daddy\"\n   - Written By: Michael Rauch & Jon Sherman\n   - Jon Sherman is credited once.\n\nNow, we'll check if there's any other writer with more credits than Jon Sherman:\n\n- Andrew Lenchewski appears twice in the \"written by\" column.\n- Michael Rauch also appears twice.\n- Constance M Burge appears twice.\n  \nNone of these writers have more writing credits than Jon Sherman (who has two), so based on this data, no writer has a higher count than Jon Sherman.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim are those in the \"written by\" column where Jon Sherman's name is mentioned. These rows and columns are:\n\n- Row 4, Column: written by\n- Row 10, Column: written by\n\nTherefore, the evaluation of the claim results in:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe answer is FALSE because there are other writers (Andrew Lenchewski, Michael Rauch, and Constance M Burge) who have written the same number of episodes as Jon Sherman.",
