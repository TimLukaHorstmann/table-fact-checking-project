Therefore, we will check the 'continent' column for this entry.\n\n3. **Year Built**: The claim asserts that the structure was built before 2009. We must verify the year mentioned in the 'year' column and ensure it is less than 2009.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the table to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row Index 1**:\n  - **Structure Name**: \"omega transmitter chabrier\" (matches the claim)\n  - **Continent**: \"africa\" (matches the claim)\n  - **Year**: 1976 (is indeed before 2009, as required by the claim)\n\nSince all conditions in the claim are satisfied for row index 1 of the table:\n\n- The structure named \"omega transmitter chabrier\" is on the continent of Africa.\n- It was built in 1976, which is before 2009.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data provided in the table.
