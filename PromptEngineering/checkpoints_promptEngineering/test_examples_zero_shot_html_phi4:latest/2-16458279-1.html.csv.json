    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Nick Price of Zimbabwe be place t4 with a score of 70 to -2 par,\" we need to verify each part of the claim against the provided table.\n\n1. **Player's Name**: The claim mentions \"Nick Price.\" We should find this name in the table.\n   \n2. **Country**: It states that Nick Price is from Zimbabwe. This needs to be verified in the table.\n   \n3. **Place/Tie Position**: According to the claim, Nick Price holds the position t4. We need to check if he is listed with \"t4\" in the table.\n\n4. **Score**: The score mentioned is 70. This should match what's in the table for Nick Price.\n   \n5. **To Par**: The claim specifies \"-2\" as his performance relative to par, which should also be verified from the table.\n\nNow, let's analyze these elements using the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - `place`: \"t4\"\n  - `player`: \"nick price\"\n  - `country`: \"zimbabwe\"\n  - `score`: \"70\"\n  - `to par`: \"- 2\"\n\nAll conditions of the claim are met with this row.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Canada have a low score of 70\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check for specific conditions:\n\n1. **Identify Canada's Score**: We must find the row(s) where \"country\" is \"Canada\" and check their \"score\".\n2. **Assess the Description of the Score**: The claim states that 70 is a \"low score\". In golf, lower scores are better, so we should determine if 70 is indeed low in this context.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- Locate the row where the country is Canada:\n  - We find \"mike weir\" from Canada with a score of 70 at position (row index 4).\n\n- Assess whether 70 is considered low within this table:\n  - The lowest score presented in the table is 66 by Darren Clarke.\n  - Other scores range as follows: 69, 69, 70, 70, 71, 71, and 72. Therefore, a score of 70 is indeed lower than scores like 71 or 72.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- The claim \"Canada have a low score of 70\" is supported by the data since Mike Weir's score of 70 from Canada is relatively low compared to other scores in the table.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for verification are those corresponding to Mike Weir's entry:\n- Row index: 4\n- Column name: \"country\" (to verify that it matches \"Canada\")\n- Column name: \"score\" (to confirm the score of 70)\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
