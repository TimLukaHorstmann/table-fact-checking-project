The \"electorate\" column will help us locate the entry for Collingwood, and the \"province\" column will confirm its assignment to a specific province.\n\n2. **Locate the row with Collingwood electorate**:\n   - Scan through each row under the \"electorate\" column.\n   - Find the row where \"Collingwood\" is listed.\n\n3. **Verify the province for Collingwood electorate**:\n   - Once we locate the \"Collingwood\" entry, examine the corresponding cell in the \"province\" column to see if it lists \"Nelson\".\n\n4. **Check the table**:\n   - The row with \"Collingwood\" as the electorate is at index 2 (0-based indexing).\n   - In this row, the province listed is indeed \"Nelson\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Collingwood electorate is assigned to the Nelson province according to the table, the claim is true.\n\n6. **Relevant cells for verification**:\n   - The relevant cells are those in the row where \"Collingwood\" is found, specifically in the \"electorate\" and \"province\" columns.\n   - These correspond to: \n     - Row index 2, Column name \"electorate\"\n     - Row index 2, Column name \"province\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"electorate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"nelson be not the province for the electorate of collingwood\" is true or false, we need to check if the province associated with the electorate \"collingwood\" is indeed \"nelson\".\n\n1. **Locate the row for the electorate \"collingwood\":**  \n   We look at each row in the table to find where the \"electorate\" column contains \"collingwood\". From the provided HTML, we see:\n\n   - Row 2:\n     - member: andrew richmond\n     - electorate: collingwood\n     - province: nelson\n     - mps term: first\n     - election date: 4 1861\n\n2. **Verify the province for \"collingwood\":**  \n   In row 2, the \"province\" column shows \"nelson\", which matches the condition we are checking against.\n\n3. **Assess the claim:**  \n   The claim states that \"nelson be not the province for the electorate of collingwood\". However, from our verification, \"nelson\" is indeed the province for the electorate \"collingwood\".
