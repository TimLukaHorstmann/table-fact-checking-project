    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the home team of Essendon have a crowd of 47656,\" we need to verify two pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. Identify if Essendon is listed as the home team.\n2. Check if the crowd count for this game is indeed 47,656.\n\nLet's examine the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 0**: The home team is Geelong and not Essendon, so we do not consider further details in this row relevant to the claim.\n  \n- **Row 1**: The home team is Fitzroy. Again, this does not match Essendon.\n\n- **Row 2**: The home team is Collingwood, which also does not match.\n\n- **Row 3**: The home team is Hawthorn, so we skip it.\n\n- **Row 4**: The home team is Melbourne, and thus not relevant to our claim.\n\n- **Row 5**: Here, the home team listed is Essendon. This matches the first condition of the claim.\n\nNext, for row 5, check if the crowd count matches:\n\n- The \"crowd\" column in this row lists a number: 47656. This aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied in row 5 (Essendon is the home team and the crowd count is 47,656), we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim include:\n- The \"home team\" column in row index 5.\n- The \"crowd\" column in row index 5.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine each part of the claim and compare it with the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states:\n- There was a crowd of 74,656 for Essendon's home team.\n- The event took place on 26 June 1952.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions against the table:\n\n1. **Crowd Size**: \n   - We need to find the row where Essendon is listed as the \"home team.\"\n   - In the table, Essendon is indeed a home team in the sixth row (index 5), and the crowd size for this match is listed as 47,656.\n\n2. **Date**:\n   - The date of the event mentioned in the claim is 26 June 1952.\n   - However, all entries in the table have the date \"26 June 1982.\"\n\n3. **Home Team**:\n   - Essendon is correctly identified as a home team in the sixth row.\n\n4. **Crowd Size Mismatch**:\n   - The claimed crowd size is 74,656, but the actual recorded crowd size for Essendon's match is 47,656.\n\n5. **Date Mismatch**:\n   - The date provided in the claim (26 June 1952) does not match any date in the table; all matches occurred on 26 June 1982.\n\nGiven these observations, both the crowd size and the date do not align with the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row index 5, column \"crowd\" for the actual crowd size.\n- Any row, column \"date\" to verify that all dates are 26 June 1982 and none match 26 June 1952.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
