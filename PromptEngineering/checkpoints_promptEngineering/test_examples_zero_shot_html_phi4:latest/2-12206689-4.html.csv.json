    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify whether the highest score achieved by a single team in this table is indeed 12. The relevant part of the table for this task is the \"score\" column. \n\nLet's examine each row under the \"Score\" column:\n\n1. June 21: 8-5\n2. June 22: 10-2\n3. June 23: 7-6\n4. June 24: 9-7\n5. June 25: 3-1\n6. June 26: 8-7\n7. June 27: 1-0\n8. June 28: 8-5\n9. June 29: 4-3\n10. June 30: 9-6\n\nFrom these scores, we note the highest score by a single team:\n\n- On June 21, one team scored 8.\n- On June 22, one team scored 10.\n- On June 23, one team scored 7.\n- On June 24, one team scored 9.\n- On June 25, one team scored 3.\n- On June 26, one team scored 8.\n- On June 27, one team scored 1.\n- On June 28, one team scored 8.\n- On June 29, one team scored 4.\n- On June 30, one team scored 9.\n\nHowever, on June 11 (outside of the range given), one team scored 12. This is not within the current dataset's date range but must be considered in verifying claims about scores during that season.\n\nThus, from the provided data, no single team score exceeds 10, while there is a row outside this subset where the highest score achieved by any team was 12.\n\nTherefore, based on these observations, the claim \"the highest score by a single team be 12\" within the given rows of the table is FALSE. The row that would support the claim (if included) should have been June 11 with the score 12-1.\n\nLet's specify the relevant cell for maximum verification from the provided data:\n\n- Row index 9: Score \"12-1\"\n\nHowever, since this row isn't in the given table and is not within our dataset scope, it does not change the conclusion that based on only the provided rows, no team scored more than 10.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"} // This would be relevant if it were part of the table.\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSince row index 9 (with a score of 12) isn't actually included in our data scope here, we recognize the conclusion relies on external knowledge not captured by this specific dataset. Therefore, considering only the provided rows leads us to \"FALSE\".",
