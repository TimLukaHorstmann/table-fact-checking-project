    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Whelan be the only player to score 3 goals in any competition,\" we need to examine each row of the table and focus on whether any player has scored exactly 3 goals in any single column representing a competition: \"league\", \"fa cup\", or \"league cup.\"\n\n1. **Identify players with 3 goals in any category:**\n   - We are looking for rows where the number in either the \"league,\" \"fa cup,\" or \"league cup\" columns is exactly 3.\n\n2. **Check each row:**\n   - **Row index 0 (bok\u0161i\u0107):** \n     - League: 8, FA Cup: 0, League Cup: 0\n     - No column has the value 3.\n   - **Row index 1 (whelan):**\n     - League: 4, FA Cup: 3, League Cup: 0\n     - The \"fa cup\" column has the value 3. This is relevant to our claim.\n   - **Row index 2 (n\u00e9meth):**\n     - League: 3, FA Cup: 1, League Cup: 2\n     - The \"league\" column has the value 3. This needs consideration as it might contradict the claim if true for others.\n   - **Row index 3 to Row index 17 (ince to own goals):**\n     - None of these rows have a value of 3 in any competition category other than those already checked.\n\n3. **Verify uniqueness:**\n   - Whelan has scored 3 goals in the FA Cup, and n\u00e9meth has scored 3 goals in the League.\n   - This means there are two players who have scored 3 goals in different competitions, so whelan is not \"the only player\" to score 3 goals in any competition.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that Whelan is the only player to score 3 goals in any competition is false since N\u00e9meth also has 3 goals in the league.\n\n5. **Relevant cells:**\n   - For Whelan (row index 1): \"fa cup\" column.\n   - For N\u00e9meth (row index 2): \"league\" column.\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
