    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"76059 attend when the result be l 20 - 17,\" we need to check two conditions in the table: whether there is a row where the attendance is 76,059 and where the result of the game was a loss (denoted by 'l') with a score of 20-17.\n\n1. **Check Attendance**: We need to find if any entry in the \"attendance\" column has the value 76059.\n2. **Check Result**: For the row identified with attendance 76059, verify that the \"result\" column indicates a loss (denoted by 'l') and has the score 20-17.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- The \"attendance\" of 76,059 appears in the row corresponding to `week = 7`.\n- In this same row (`week = 7`), the \"result\" is recorded as \"l 20 - 17.\"\n\nSince both conditions match for this row, the claim is supported by the table.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row index 6 (since HTML tables are typically zero-indexed in most programming contexts, but here it will be consistent with the first row being index 0 as per usual data frame indexing):\n  - \"attendance\" column: value is 76059.\n  - \"result\" column: value is \"l 20 - 17.\"\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
