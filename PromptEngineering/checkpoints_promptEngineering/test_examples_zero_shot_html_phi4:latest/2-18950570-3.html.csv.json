The first row has '1.09%' for yellow in the column \"yellow 1.09%\".\n\nSince both conditions are met:\n- The value '0 , 35723' appears under 'yellow'.\n- It corresponds to a 'yellow' percentage of '1.09%'.\n\nThus, the claim is true based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"yellow 1.09%\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"yellow 1.09%\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
