    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the 2008-09 UEFA Cup, we need to determine if there were two teams that scored a total of 4 goals on aggregate based on the given table data.\n\n1. **Understanding the Table**: The table includes results from various matches with columns indicating:\n   - `team 1`: Name of one team in the match.\n   - `agg`: Aggregate score for both legs.\n   - `team 2`: Name of the opposing team.\n   - `1st leg`: Score during the first leg of the match.\n   - `2nd leg`: Score during the second leg.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Claim**: The claim states that there are two teams which scored a total of 4 goals on aggregate during the specified season. This implies looking at the 'agg' column for scores where one team has an aggregate score of exactly 4.\n\n3. **Identifying Relevant Rows**:\n   - Row 2: `cska moscow` vs `shakhtar donetsk`, agg = `1 - 2`\n   - Row 3: `udinese` vs `zenit st petersburg`, agg = `2 - 1`\n   - Row 4: `paris saint-germain` vs `braga`, agg = `1 - 0`\n   - **Row 6**: `marseille` vs `ajax`, agg = `4 - 3`. Here, Marseille scored a total of 4 goals.\n   - **Row 7**: `hamburg` vs `galatasaray`, agg = `4 - 3`. Here, Hamburg also scored a total of 4 goals.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - From the table, we find that both Marseille and Hamburg have an aggregate score of exactly 4 in their respective matches.\n   \n5. **Conclusion**: The claim is verified as true because two teams, Marseille and Hamburg, did indeed each score 4 goals on aggregate.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For Marseille: Row index 6, Column 'agg'.\n   - For Hamburg: Row index 7, Column 'agg'.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Paris Saint-Germain and Braga have the highest combined score of any match\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the total scores for each match in the table and compare them.\n\nFirst, let's identify what a \"combined score\" means in this context: it is the sum of goals scored by both teams in each leg (i.e., first leg + second leg).\n\nNow, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data:** We will examine each row to find out the scores for both legs and calculate their combined score.\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Scores:**\n   - For \"werder bremen vs saint-\u00e9tienne\":\n     - 1st leg: 1 - 0 \u2192 Combined = 1 + 0 = 1\n     - 2nd leg: 2 - 2 \u2192 Combined = 2 + 2 = 4\n     - Total combined score = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n   - For \"cska moscow vs shakhtar donetsk\":\n     - 1st leg: 1 - 0 \u2192 Combined = 1 + 0 = 1\n     - 2nd leg: 0 - 2 \u2192 Combined = 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Total combined score = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n   - For \"udinese vs zenit st petersburg\":\n     - 1st leg: 2 - 0 \u2192 Combined = 2 + 0 = 2\n     - 2nd leg: 0 - 1 \u2192 Combined = 0 + 1 = 1\n     - Total combined score = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n   - For \"paris saint-germain vs braga\":\n     - 1st leg: 0 - 0 \u2192 Combined = 0 + 0 = 0\n     - 2nd leg: 1 - 0 \u2192 Combined = 1 + 0 = 1\n     - Total combined score = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n   - For \"dynamo kyiv vs metalist kharkiv\":\n     - 1st leg: 1 - 0 \u2192 Combined = 1 + 0 = 1\n     - 2nd leg: 2 - 3 \u2192 Combined = 2 + 3 = 5\n     - Total combined score = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n   - For \"manchester city vs aalborg bk\":\n     - 1st leg: 2 - 0 \u2192 Combined = 2 + 0 = 2\n     - 2nd leg: 0 - 2 \u2192 Combined = 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Total combined score = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n   - For \"marseille vs ajax\":\n     - 1st leg: 2 - 1 \u2192 Combined = 2 + 1 = 3\n     - 2nd leg: 2 - 2 \u2192 Combined = 2 + 2 = 4\n     - Total combined score = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n   - For \"hamburg vs galatasaray\":\n     - 1st leg: 1 - 1 \u2192 Combined = 1 + 1 = 2\n     - 2nd leg: 3 - 2 \u2192 Combined = 3 + 2 = 5\n     - Total combined score = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Combined Score:** From these calculations, we observe that:\n   - \"marseille vs ajax\" and \"hamburg vs galatasaray\" both have the highest combined score of 7.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Paris Saint-Germain and Braga\" have the highest combined score.\n   - Their combined score is 1, which is not the highest as compared to others calculated above (5 for werder bremen vs saint-\u00e9tienne, 6 for dynamo kyiv vs metalist kharkiv, and 7 for both marseille vs ajax and hamburg vs galatasaray).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nThe relevant cells involve extracting scores from \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\" columns for all rows to compute combined scores.
