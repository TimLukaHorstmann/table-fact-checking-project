In the table, under the column labeled `december`, there are numbers indicating specific dates in December that correspond to games played by a team (presumably the Philadelphia Flyers given the context). We need to check if any row has the date 21.\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: The claim states that the \"Cleveland Barons\" were involved in this game. Therefore, we should look for rows where the `opponent` column lists \"cleveland barons\".\n\n3. **Score and Points Check**: It claims that the Cleveland Barons scored the most points against the 1977-78 Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st. While exact scoring details between two teams are not explicitly provided, we can infer the score from the `score` column (formatted as \"team_score - opponent_score\"). We need to verify if in such a game, the Cleveland Barons scored more points than any other opponent listed.\n\nLet's proceed with these checks:\n\n- **Row 7** corresponds to December 11th against the \"cleveland barons\", where the score was \"11 - 1\". This means the Philadelphia Flyers scored 11 points against the Cleveland Barons, not vice versa. \n\n- **Row 10** corresponds to December 21st against the \"cleveland barons\" with a score of \"4 - 0\". Here, the Philadelphia Flyers scored 4 points and the Cleveland Barons scored 0.\n\nChecking all other rows for scores involving the \"Cleveland Barons\", we find:\n- **Row 7**: Score \"11 - 1\" (Flyers' win)\n- **Row 10**: Score \"4 - 0\" (Flyers' win)\n\nThe maximum points scored by the Philadelphia Flyers in any game against the Cleveland Barons are 11, which occurred on December 11th.\n\nFor other games:\n- The highest score the Flyers achieved was 11 (against the Cleveland Barons).\n- No other opponent has allowed the Flyers to score as many as 11 points.\n\nThus, the claim that \"the cleveland baron score the most point against the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer on december 21st\" is false.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the 1977 - 78 philadelphia flyer win by 3 point against the boston bruin,\" we need to verify two main aspects from the table: \n\n1. **Match Outcome**: The Philadelphia Flyers must have won a game against the Boston Bruins with a margin of 3 points (goals).\n2. **Date Consistency**: This match should fall within the 1977-78 season.\n\nFrom the given HTML table, let's focus on the relevant columns:\n- **Opponent**: To find matches involving the Boston Bruins.\n- **Score**: To determine if the Flyers won by a margin of 3 goals.\n- **Record**: The record progression can help verify wins and losses indirectly.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify games against the Boston Bruins**:\n   - Row 8: Opponent is \"boston bruins\" with score \"6 - 4\". This indicates a win by 2 points.\n   - Row 12: Opponent is again \"boston bruins\" with score \"1 - 6\". This indicates a loss.\n\nNeither of these games shows a win by a margin of 3 goals. \n\n2. **Check for any other possible matches**:\n   - No additional entries in the table involve the Boston Bruins.\n\nSince neither of the matches against the Boston Bruins resulted in a win with a 3-point (goal) difference, and no other matches exist in the data provided, we can conclude that the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row 8: Column \"opponent\" (\"boston bruins\") and column \"score\" (\"6 - 4\")\n- Row 12: Column \"opponent\" (\"boston bruins\") and column \"score\" (\"1 - 6\")\n\nThese cells were checked to confirm that there was no win by a 3-point margin against the Boston Bruins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
