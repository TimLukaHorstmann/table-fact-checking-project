    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there is any player drafted from \"tennessee state\" with a rank lower than 261.\n\n1. **Identify Players from Tennessee State**: We will look at the column \"school / club team\" in the table and find entries that match \"tennessee state\".\n\n2. **Check Draft Rank of Identified Players**: For each player identified in step 1, we will check their corresponding rank in the \"overall\" column to see if it is lower than 261.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**: If no player from Tennessee State has a rank lower than 261, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- The row with \"tennessee state\" in the \"school / club team\" column is:\n  - Row index 10: Player \"john henry smith\", Rank 261\n\nSince there is only one player from Tennessee State and their rank is exactly 261, there are no players from Tennessee State with a rank lower than 261.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell to verify this claim is:\n\n- Row index 10, Column \"overall\" for the rank.\n- Row index 10, Column \"school / club team\" for the school name.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
