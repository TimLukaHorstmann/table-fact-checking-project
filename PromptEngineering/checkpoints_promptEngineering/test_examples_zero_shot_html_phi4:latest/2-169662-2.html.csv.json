Otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n- Row 1 (Win against Wes Albritton): Losses = 0\n- Row 2 (Loss against Guy Mezger): Losses = 1\n- Row 3 (Win against Jerry Bohlander): Losses = 1\n- Row 4 (Win against Jeremy Screeton): Losses = 1\n- Row 5 (Loss against Guy Mezger): Losses = 2\n- Row 6 (Win against Yuki Kondo): Losses = 2\n- Row 7 (Win against Evan Tanner): Losses = 2\n- Row 8 (Win against Wanderlei Silva): Losses = 2\n- Row 9 (Loss against Frank Shamrock): Losses = 3\n- Row 10 (Win against Ken Shamrock): Losses = 3\n- Rows 11 to 21: All have more than zero losses.\n\nFrom the analysis, only the first row indicates a fighter with zero losses.

For example, entries like \"1: 0:31\" indicate that the event occurred at minute and second of the first round.\n\nWe will iterate through each row to find fights decided in round 1:\n\n1. **Row 22**: The fight was decided by \"TKO (punches)\" with a time of \"0:31\". This indicates it happened in round 1.\n2. **Row 23**: Decided by \"KO (slam)\" at \"0:30\", also indicating round 1.\n3. **Row 24**: The fight was decided via \"submission (cobra choke)\" at \"1:51\". Although the time is beyond one minute, it still falls within the first round.\n4. **Row 27**: Decided by \"TKO (punches)\" with a time of \"9:56\", which indicates it happened in round 1.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that four fights were decided in round 1.
