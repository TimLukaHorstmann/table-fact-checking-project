    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The opponent for game number 75.\n2. Whether \"minnesota north stars\" is correctly identified as the opponent in this context.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: We find that each row corresponds to a game, with games numbered sequentially starting from 63. Therefore, we can calculate which row corresponds to game number 75 by finding how many rows are needed after the first game (row index starts at 0 for game 63). \n\n  - Game 63 is in row index 0.\n  - Thus, Game 75 will be in row index \\( 75 - 63 = 12 \\).\n\n- **Column Name**: The opponent's name is recorded under the column \"opponent\".\n\nNow, let's extract and verify:\n\n- For game number 75 (which corresponds to row index 12), look at the value in the \"opponent\" column:\n  - The table shows that the opponent for game 75 is \"minnesota north stars\".\n\nThis confirms that the claim \"the opponent for game 75 be the minnesota north star\" accurately reflects the data in the table, except for a minor typographical error: it should be \"north stars,\" not \"star.\"\n\nDespite this small discrepancy, the essence of the claim about the opponent is correct. Therefore, based on how claims are typically interpreted (considering minor spelling errors unless specified otherwise), we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table and verify each condition stated in the claim:\n\n1. **Condition Analysis:**\n   - The claim states that \"after March 2 the Minnesota North Stars be not the opponent until game 75.\"\n   - This implies two things:\n     a. No games were played against the Minnesota North Stars after March 2, except for Game 75.\n     b. Game 75 is specifically mentioned as having Minnesota North Stars as the opponent.\n\n2. **Table Examination:**\n   - We need to find entries in the table where \"march\" (column) is greater than 2 and verify if \"opponent\" (column) is not \"Minnesota North Stars,\" except for Game 75.\n   \n3. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The table provides a list of games with respective dates, opponents, scores, and records:\n     - Game 64 has March = 2, opponent = Buffalo Sabres.\n     - Game 65 has March = 5, opponent = Vancouver Canucks (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 66 has March = 8, opponent = Chicago Black Hawks (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 67 has March = 11, opponent = Detroit Red Wings (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 68 has March = 12, opponent = California Golden Seals (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 69 has March = 15, opponent = Chicago Black Hawks (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 70 has March = 16, opponent = Detroit Red Wings (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 71 has March = 18, opponent = Philadelphia Flyers (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 72 has March = 19, opponent = Toronto Maple Leafs (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 73 has March = 23, opponent = Boston Bruins (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - Game 74 has March = 25, opponent = Montreal Canadiens (not Minnesota North Stars).\n     - **Game 75** has March = 26, opponent = Minnesota North Stars.\n     - Game 76 has March = 29, opponent = Detroit Red Wings (after Game 75 and not Minnesota North Stars).\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - From games with March > 2, we verify that no opponent is \"Minnesota North Stars\" except for Game 75.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is TRUE based on the analysis of the table data.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For validation:\n     - Games from March 3 onwards until just before Game 75.\n     - Specifically, the opponent column in these games should not be \"Minnesota North Stars\" except for Game 75 itself.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
