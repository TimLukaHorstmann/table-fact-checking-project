    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the opponent be the yankee when the record be 4 - 5,\" we need to examine each row in the table to find where these conditions are met: the opponent is \"yankees\" and the game record is \"4 - 5.\" We will check for a match and list the relevant cells.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Record 4 - 5**:\n   - Look through all rows to identify any row where the \"Record\" column matches \"4 - 5.\"\n\n2. **Check Opponent in Identified Row(s)**:\n   - For each identified row from step 1, check if the \"Opponent\" column is \"yankees.\"\n   \n3. **Verification**:\n   - If we find a match that satisfies both conditions (record of \"4 - 5\" and opponent as \"yankees\"), then the claim is true.\n   - If no such match exists, the claim is false.\n\nLet's go through each row to perform this verification:\n\n- **Row 0**: Record is \"2 - 3,\" so it doesn't meet the condition of \"4 - 5.\"\n- **Row 1**: Record is \"3 - 3,\" does not meet the \"4 - 5\" condition.\n- **Row 2**: Opponent is \"yankees,\" but record is \"4 - 4,\" doesn't match \"4 - 5.\"\n- **Row 3**: Record is \"6 - 4,\" so it doesn't meet the \"4 - 5\" condition.\n- **Row 4**: Opponent is \"yankees\" and record is \"4 - 5.\" This row satisfies both conditions.\n\nSince we have found a matching row (row 4) where the opponent is \"yankees\" and the record is \"4 - 5,\" the claim is true. The relevant cells from this row are:\n\n- Row index: 4, Column name: Opponent\n- Row index: 4, Column name: Record\n\nThe JSON response for the verification is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to examine the details provided in the table and check if all conditions of the claim match:\n\n1. **Record be 4 - 5**: \n   - We need to find a row where the \"Record\" column value is \"4 - 5\". The relevant cell for this is found at `row_index: 8, column_name: \"Record\"`.\n\n2. **Opponent be Yankee on April 11**:\n   - First, we check if there's an entry with the date \"April 11\". This corresponds to `row_index: 9, column_name: \"Date\"`.\n   - Then, verify that the opponent is \"Yankee\" for this row. The relevant cell is at `row_index: 9, column_name: \"Opponent\"`.\n\n3. **Record consistency check**:\n   - Ensure that when the date is \"April 11\", the record indeed matches \"4 - 5\". This corresponds to verifying the same row where both conditions above are satisfied (`row_index: 9`).\n\nAfter examining these aspects:\n\n- At `row_index: 8`, the record is \"3 - 6\" which does not match \"4 - 5\".\n- At `row_index: 9`, the date is \"April 11\", the opponent is \"Yankee\", and the record is indeed \"4 - 5\".\n\nTherefore, all conditions of the claim are satisfied when checking row 9. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
