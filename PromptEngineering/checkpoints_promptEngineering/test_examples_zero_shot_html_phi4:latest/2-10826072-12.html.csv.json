The margin of victory is found by subtracting the away team's score from the home team's score.\n\nFirstly, let's convert the scores into their numerical equivalents (i.e., points). In Australian rules football scoring:\n- A goal (represented as '6' before a number) equals 6 points.\n- A behind (the numbers themselves) counts as its face value in points.\n\nHere is the breakdown of each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Home team: Carlton, Score: 16.18 (114)\n     - Goals = 16 x 6 = 96\n     - Behinds = 18\n     - Total score = 96 + 18 = 114\n   - Away team: North Melbourne, Score: 3.5 (23)\n     - Goals = 3 x 6 = 18\n     - Behinds = 5\n     - Total score = 18 + 5 = 23\n   - Margin of victory = 114 - 23 = 91\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Home team: St Kilda, Score: 14.15 (99)\n     - Goals = 14 x 6 = 84\n     - Behinds = 15\n     - Total score = 84 + 15 = 99\n   - Away team: Geelong, Score: 3.3 (21)\n     - Goals = 3 x 6 = 18\n     - Behinds = 3\n     - Total score = 18 + 3 = 21\n   - Margin of victory = 99 - 21 = 78\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Home team: Richmond, Score: 6.11 (47)\n     - Goals = 6 x 6 = 36\n     - Behinds = 11\n     - Total score = 36 + 11 = 47\n   - Away team: Fitzroy, Score: 8.17 (65)\n     - Goals = 8 x 6 = 48\n     - Behinds = 17\n     - Total score = 48 + 17 = 65\n   - Margin of victory = 47 - 65 = -18 (Fitzroy wins)\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Home team: Hawthorn, Score: 14.20 (104)\n     - Goals = 14 x 6 = 84\n     - Behinds = 20\n     - Total score = 84 + 20 = 104\n   - Away team: Essendon, Score: 11.5 (71)\n     - Goals = 11 x 6 = 66\n     - Behinds = 5\n     - Total score = 66 + 5 = 71\n   - Margin of victory = 104 - 71 = 33\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Home team: Footscray, Score: 8.15 (63)\n     - Goals = 8 x 6 = 48\n     - Behinds = 15\n     - Total score = 48 + 15 = 63\n   - Away team: Collingwood, Score: 6.10 (46)\n     - Goals = 6 x 6 = 36\n     - Behinds = 10\n     - Total score = 36 + 10 = 46\n   - Margin of victory = 63 - 46 = 17\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Home team: Melbourne, Score: 6.13 (49)\n     - Goals = 6 x 6 = 36\n     - Behinds = 13\n     - Total score = 36 + 13 = 49\n   - Away team: South Melbourne, Score: 2.6 (18)\n     - Goals = 2 x 6 = 12\n     - Behinds = 6\n     - Total score = 12 + 6 = 18\n   - Margin of victory = 49 - 18 = 31\n\nComparing the margins:\n- Row 0: Carlton's margin is 91.\n- Row 1: St Kilda's margin is 78.\n- Row 3: Hawthorn's margin is 33.\n- Row 4: Footscray's margin is 17.\n- Row 5: Melbourne's margin is 31.\n\nCarlton indeed have the largest margin of victory (91) among all listed games on 19 June 1971.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the average away team score is true or false, we need to focus on extracting and calculating data from the relevant columns of the provided table. The specific details in question involve:\n\n1. **Column Relevance**: We need to consider only the \"away team score\" column since it contains the scores of the away teams for each game.\n\n2. **Data Extraction**: We extract the scores from each row under the \"away team score\" column.\n\n3. **Conversion and Calculation**:\n   - The format of each score is presented as 'x.y (z)', where x represents goals, y represents behinds, and z represents the total points.\n   - Each goal counts for 6 points, and each behind counts for 1 point. Therefore, to calculate a team's total score in terms of points from the format 'x.y (z)', we use z.\n\n4. **Scores Extraction**:\n   - From the table, the away team scores are: \n     - Row 0: \"3.5 (23)\"\n     - Row 1: \"3.3 (21)\"\n     - Row 2: \"8.17 (65)\"\n     - Row 3: \"11.5 (71)\"\n     - Row 4: \"6.10 (46)\"\n     - Row 5: \"2.6 (18)\"\n\n5. **Average Calculation**:\n   - Extract the points for each row and calculate their average.\n   - Points are: 23, 21, 65, 71, 46, and 18.\n\n   To find the average score:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{23 + 21 + 65 + 71 + 46 + 18}{6}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{244}{6} \\approx 40.67\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the average away team score should be \"10.81\".\n   - The calculated average is approximately 40.67, not 10.81.\n\nTherefore, based on our calculations, the claim is incorrect.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells Identification**:\n   - The relevant cells are in column \"away team score\" for all rows (0 through 5).\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
