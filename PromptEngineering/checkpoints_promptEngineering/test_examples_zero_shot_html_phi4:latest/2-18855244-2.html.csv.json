Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: Look for the presence of \"pommel horse\" in the \"event\" column across all rows.\n2. **Evaluate Each Instance**:\n   - Row 3: The event is listed as \"pommel horse s.\" This indicates that an athlete received a medal for this event.\n\nGiven that there is indeed at least one instance where an athlete has been awarded a medal for the pommel horse, the claim is false. We'll need to provide evidence from the table to support this conclusion:\n\n- **Relevant Cell**:\n  - Row Index: 3 (1-based indexing)\n  - Column Name: \"event\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer can be provided as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
