    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must carefully check each part of it against the data provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \n\"Jessica Ennis be the guest on Andrew and Jack's guest episode broadcast on 4 May 2012.\"\n\nLet's break down this claim into its conditions:\n1. The episode features Jessica Ennis as a guest.\n2. This episode was first broadcasted on 4 May 2012.\n\nNow, we will verify these two conditions against the table data:\n\n- **Condition 1:** \"Jessica Ennis be the guest on Andrew and Jack's guest episode\"\n   - From the table, the column \"andrew and jacks guest\" in row index 2 (05x03) shows \"jessica ennis\". This confirms that Jessica Ennis is indeed listed as a guest.\n\n- **Condition 2:** \"broadcast on 4 May 2012\"\n   - The column \"first broadcast\" in the same row (index 2, 05x03) contains \"4 may 2012\", which matches the date specified in the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by the data in row index 2 of the table. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the provided information.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row index: 2\n  - Column \"andrew and jacks guest\" for Jessica Ennis.\n  - Column \"first broadcast\" for the date 4 May 2012.\n\nHere is the JSON object that reflects these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as Andrew and Jack's guest be before May 2012,\" we need to examine specific cells in the provided table. The relevant column for this verification is \"first broadcast\" since it gives us the date of each episode, and \"Andrew and Jack's guest\" to ensure that Jessica Ennis is indeed the guest for that particular episode.\n\n1. Locate the row where Jessica Ennis appears as Andrew and Jack's guest:\n   - Look at the \"Andrew and Jack\u2019s guest\" column.\n   - Identify the row with \"jessica ennis.\"\n\n2. Verify the date of first broadcast for this row:\n   - Check the \"first broadcast\" column for that specific row to see if it falls before May 2012.\n\nThe relevant information from the table is as follows:\n\n- Row corresponding to Jessica Ennis (row_index: 2)\n  - Column \"Andrew and Jack\u2019s guest\": Value is \"jessica ennis\"\n  - Column \"first broadcast\": Date is \"4 may 2012\"\n\nFrom this, we see that the first broadcast date with Jessica Ennis as the guest is on May 4th, 2012, which is not before May 2012. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index: 2\n  - Column \"Andrew and Jack\u2019s guest\": jessica ennis\n  - Column \"first broadcast\": 4 may 2012\n\nThus, we conclude with the following JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
