    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Pascal Fabre started in grid 26 and completed 71 laps,\" we need to verify two conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. **Grid Position:** We must check if Pascal Fabre's starting grid position is indeed 26.\n2. **Laps Completed:** We also need to confirm that Pascal Fabre completed 71 laps.\n\nLet's examine each condition using relevant rows and columns from the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Locate Pascal Fabre in the Table:**\n   - Search for a row where \"Pascal Fabre\" is listed under the \"driver\" column.\n   - This occurs at **row 13**.\n\n2. **Verify Grid Position:**\n   - For row 13, check the value in the \"grid\" column to see if it matches the claimed starting position of 26.\n   - In this row, the grid position is listed as **26**, matching the claim.\n\n3. **Verify Laps Completed:**\n   - For row 13, examine the value in the \"laps\" column to confirm that Pascal Fabre completed 71 laps.\n   - The number of laps recorded here is indeed **71**, which matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions have been verified successfully as true using the relevant data from the table. Therefore, the claim is entirely supported by the information presented.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe cells that were checked to verify the claim are:\n- From row 13, column \"driver\" (for identifying Pascal Fabre).\n- From row 13, column \"grid\" (to check starting grid position as 26).\n- From row 13, column \"laps\" (to confirm completion of 71 laps).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince both parts of the claim are verified against the data in the table and found to be accurate, we conclude that the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"when the grid be 5 , the least amount of lap be 43.0,\" we need to focus on two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify entries where the `grid` position is `5`.\n2. Determine the minimum number of laps completed for those entries.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps using the given HTML table data:\n\n### Step 1: Locate Entries with Grid Position 5\n\nWe'll examine each row in the table and identify rows where the `grid` column value equals `5`.\n\n- **Row 13** has a grid position of `5`, corresponding to the driver `michele alboreto` with `43 laps`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Minimum Laps for Grid Position 5\n\nSince there is only one row with a `grid` of `5`, we can directly use that entry:\n\n- The number of laps completed by `michele alboreto` (Row 13) is `43`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim specifies that the least amount of laps completed when the grid position is `5` should be `43.0`. From our analysis, this condition is met with the sole entry where the grid position is `5`, which indeed corresponds to `43 laps`.\n\nTherefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant cell in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down and verify each part of the statement: \n\n1. **Identify Christian Danner's Data in the Table**:\n   - We need to locate the row corresponding to \"Christian Danner\". According to the table, he is listed with:\n     - Laps completed: 3\n     - Grid position: 23\n\n2. **Examine the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Christian Danner's least lap count should be 43 when his grid position was 5.\n   \n3. **Verification of Conditions**:\n   - First, check if there is any record where Christian Danner has a grid position of 5 in the table. In our data, Christian Danner only appears with a grid position of 23.\n   - Next, verify if the least lap count for Christian Danner, based on his actual grid positions, is ever recorded as 43. The given entry shows he completed 3 laps when starting from grid position 23.\n\nSince there is no record where Christian Danner started in grid position 5, and also his lap count of 43 does not correspond to any of his entries (including the one with a grid position of 5), we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are those containing information about Christian Danner's laps and starting grid position, specifically from his row in the table.\n   - According to our analysis, these would be at:\n     - Row index 14 with column name \"laps\" (value: 3)\n     - Row index 14 with column name \"grid\" (value: 23)\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
