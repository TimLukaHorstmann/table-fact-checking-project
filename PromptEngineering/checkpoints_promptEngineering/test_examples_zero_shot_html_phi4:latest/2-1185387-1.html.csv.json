The league column equals \"pasl - pro\".\n2. The playoffs column indicates they lost a semifinal game, which would be specified as \"lost semifinal\".\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n1. **Row 3 (Year: 2007 - 2008):**\n   - League: misl ii\n   - Playoffs: did not qualify\n\n   This row is irrelevant because the league is not \"pasl - pro\" and it does not mention losing a semifinal game.\n\n2. **Row 4 (Year: 2008 - 2009):**\n   - League: pasl - pro\n   - Playoffs: won championship\n\n   This row shows they played in the playoffs but won the championship, so it doesn't support the claim of losing a semifinal game.\n\n3. **Row 5 (Year: 2009 - 2010):**\n   - League: pasl - pro\n   - Playoffs: lost semifinal\n\n   Here, both conditions match the claim:\n   - The league is \"pasl - pro\".\n   - They lost the semifinal game in the playoffs.\n\n4. **Row 6 (Year: 2010 - 2011):**\n   - League: pasl - pro\n   - Playoffs: did not qualify\n\n   Although the league matches, they did not qualify for the playoffs, so it does not support the claim of losing a semifinal game.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe relevant data supporting the claim is found in Row 5. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there is an instance where \"pasl - pro\" lost the semifinal game in the playoff.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index is zero-based in the JSON, so Row 5 corresponds to `row_index: 4`.",
