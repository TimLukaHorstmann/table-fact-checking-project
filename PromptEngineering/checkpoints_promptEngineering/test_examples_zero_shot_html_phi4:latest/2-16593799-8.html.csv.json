    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding matches in which neither team scored a goal (a 0-0 result), we need to examine each row in the provided table under the \"score\" column, specifically looking for instances where no goals were scored by either team.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that there are three games where neither team scored a goal. In football terms, this would be represented as \"0 - 0\".\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the \"score\" column of each row in the table to check for any occurrence of \"0 - 0\".\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - For season 2004:\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 0 - 2\n     - Team 2: PSM Makassar, Score: 2 - 3\n     - Team 1: Hoang Anh Gia Lai, Score: 0 - 1\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 2 - 2\n     - Team 1: Dalian Shide, Score: 3 - 1\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 1 - 2\n   - For season 2005:\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 2 - 1\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 0 - 2\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 2 - 1\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 0 - 1\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 0 - 4\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 1 - 0\n   - For season 2008:\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 1 - 9\n     - Team 2: Beijing Guoan, Score: 4 - 2\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 9 - 1\n     - Team 1: Nam Dinh FC, Score: 2 - 2\n     - Team 2: Kashima Antlers, Score: 8 - 1\n     - Team 1: Krung Thai Bank, Score: 5 - 3\n\n4. **Result**: After reviewing all scores listed in the table, we find that there is no \"0 - 0\" score present.\n\nSince none of the games resulted in a 0-0 draw, the claim is false. No relevant cells contain the score \"0 - 0\". Therefore, there are zero such instances in the data provided.\n\nHere's the JSON output representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine how many games were played in Indonesia and China according to the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Games Played in Indonesia:**\n   - Look for entries where the \"venue\" column mentions \"indonesia\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1: Venue is \"mattoangin stadium, indonesia\".\n     - This indicates 1 game was played in Indonesia.\n\n2. **Identify Games Played in China:**\n   - Look for entries where the \"venue\" column mentions \"china pr\".\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 4: Venue is \"dalian people's stadium, china pr\".\n     - Row 1 (2008): Venue is \"beijing fengtai stadium, china pr\".\n     - This indicates 2 games were played in China.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 1 game was played in Indonesia and 2 fewer games were played in China.\n   - We found 1 game in Indonesia and 2 games in China.\n   - 2 is not 1 less than 1; it is equal to the number of games in Indonesia, not fewer by 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the difference between the number of games played in China and Indonesia is not 2. It is actually 1 (2 games in China minus 1 game in Indonesia equals 1).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1 (2004), \"venue\": \"mattoangin stadium, indonesia\"\n- Row 4 (2004), \"venue\": \"dalian people's stadium, china pr\"\n- Row 13 (2008), \"venue\": \"beijing fengtai stadium, china pr\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
