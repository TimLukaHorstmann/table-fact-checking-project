    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the game number for Cleveland is 71\" is true or false, we need to locate the relevant information in the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** \n   - The column that contains game numbers is likely labeled as a sequence of game identifiers (e.g., Game Number). This is not explicitly named in the snippet you provided, but it's typically the first column when listing sequential games.\n\n2. **Find Cleveland Games:**\n   - We need to locate rows where \"Cleveland\" appears in the opponent/team name column. In this case, look for entries with \"cleveland\" mentioned.\n\n3. **Check Game Numbers for Cleveland:**\n   - Identify the game numbers associated with these Cleveland matches.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Row 67:** \n  - Opponent/Team Name: \"atlanta\"\n  - Game Number: 68\n\n- **Row 68:** \n  - Opponent/Team Name: \"oklahoma city\"\n  - Game Number: 69\n\n- **Row 70:** \n  - Opponent/Team Name: \"los angeles lakers\"\n  - Game Number: 70\n\n- **Row 71:** \n  - Opponent/Team Name: \"cleveland\"\n  - Game Number: 71\n\n- **Row 76:** \n  - Opponent/Team Name: \"cleveland\"\n  - Game Number: 72\n\nThe game number for Cleveland in the first instance is indeed 71, as stated in row 71.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"Opponent/Team Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"Game Number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
