Relevant cells are those containing the number `7` in the `games` column, which is consistent across all rows:\n- Row indices: 0 to 7\n- Column name: `games`\n\n**Part 2: Draws Occurrence**\n- The column labeled `drawn` indicates how many games were drawn.\n- We need to count how many rows have a value greater than `0` in the `drawn` column and verify this number is exactly 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the `drawn` column:\n- Row 2 (`index 1`): `drawn = 1`\n- Row 3 (`index 2`): `drawn = 1`\n- Row 5 (`index 4`): `drawn = 1`\n- Row 7 (`index 6`): `drawn = 1`\n\nThere are indeed 4 instances where the number of drawn games is greater than 0, and in no case does any row have more than 1 draw. This matches the claim exactly.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe entire claim is TRUE based on the analysis above.\n\nRelevant cells include all entries under `games` column to verify part 1, and specific entries in the `drawn` column for part 2.
