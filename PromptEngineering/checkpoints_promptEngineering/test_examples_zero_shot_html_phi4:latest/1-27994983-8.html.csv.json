After identifying the correct row for draw number 3, we need to check if the value in the \"juries\" column is indeed 55.\n\nLet's analyze these steps using the provided HTML table:\n\n1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"27 viewer saw the moniker perform\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table, we must check two conditions:\n\n1. The artist who performed is \"the moniker\".\n2. The number of viewers for this performance is 27.\n\nLet's go through the relevant parts of the table to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row Identification**: \n  - We need to locate the row where the artist is \"the moniker\". From the table, we observe:\n    - Row with `draw` = 3 has the artist \"the moniker\".\n\n- **Artist Verification**:\n  - In this row (row index 2 in zero-based indexing), under the \"artist\" column, it confirms that the performer is indeed \"the moniker\".\n\n- **Viewer Count Verification**:\n  - For the same row (row index 2), we look at the \"viewers\" column to verify the number of viewers.\n  - The value given for \"viewers\" is 69.\n\nNow, compare this information with the claim:\n\n- The claim states that 27 viewers saw \"the moniker\" perform. However, the table indicates that 69 viewers actually watched \"the moniker\".\n\nSince the viewer count from the table (69) does not match the claimed number of viewers (27), the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to check this are:\n- The cell in row index 2 under the column \"artist\".\n- The cell in row index 2 under the column \"viewers\".\n\nThus, the JSON object representing this verification process is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
