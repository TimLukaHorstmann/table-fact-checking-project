    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to assess whether Prince Park had the highest crowd participation based on the data provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant column for this assessment is \"crowd,\" as it directly relates to crowd participation numbers. We will compare the crowd numbers for each match listed and identify if any match was held at Princes Park with a higher number than all other matches.\n\n1. **Extracting the necessary information:**\n   - Look through the table rows and extract the \"venue\" and corresponding \"crowd\" values.\n   \n2. **Analysis of the data:**\n\n   | Row Index | Home Team    | Away Team  | Venue        | Crowd |\n   |-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------|\n   | 0         | north melbourne | south melbourne | arden street oval | 9016  |\n   | 1         | hawthorn     | richmond   | princes park | 15710 |\n   | 2         | fitzroy      | st kilda   | junction oval| 12519 |\n   | 3         | essendon     | collingwood| windy hill   | 25867 |\n   | 4         | melbourne    | carlton    | mcg          | 23336 |\n   | 5         | geelong      | footscray  | vfl park     | 16320 |\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Princes Park had a crowd of 15,710.\n   - The highest recorded crowd in the table is 25,867 at Windy Hill.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the highest number of attendees (25,867) was recorded for an event not held at Princes Park but at Windy Hill, the claim that Prince Park had the highest crowd participation during the 1974 VFL season is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are those corresponding to \"crowd\" and \"venue\" for all rows, as we need to compare each match's attendance figure.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
