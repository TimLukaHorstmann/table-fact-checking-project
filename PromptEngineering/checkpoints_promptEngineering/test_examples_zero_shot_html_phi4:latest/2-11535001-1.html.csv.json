    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"more points be score by the win team in the 2011 world cup qualification match in bolivia than in the 2013 match,\" we must first break down and verify each part of the statement against the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Identify relevant matches**:\n   - The claim mentions a match from \"the 2011 world cup qualification\" that occurred in \"bolivia.\" \n   - The claim also refers to a match from \"the 2013\" period, which is part of the \"world cup qualification.\"\n\n2. **Extract information from the table**:\n   - First, we need to find matches related to \"2011 world cup qualification\":\n     - Row 3: Date is \"11 october 2011\", Competition is \"2014 fifa world cup qualification\". Venue: \"estadio monumental , santiago , chile\" (not in Bolivia).\n     - No match for the 2011 world cup qualification occurred in Bolivia.\n   \n   - Then, we identify matches related to \"2013\":\n     - Row 4: Date is \"15 october 2013\", Competition is \"2014 fifa world cup qualification\". Venue: \"estadio monumental , santiago , chile\".\n  \n3. **Evaluate the points scored by the winning team**:\n   - Since there was no 2011 world cup qualification match in Bolivia, we have no data to compare for that specific condition.\n   \n   - For the October 15, 2013 match (Row 4), score was \"2 - 0\" with result \"2 - 1\". The winning team scored 2 points.\n\nSince there is no 2011 qualification match in Bolivia, we cannot determine if more points were scored by the winning team in such a non-existent match compared to the 2013 match. Therefore, the claim is not supported due to insufficient data for one part of it.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because the specific condition about the \"2011 world cup qualification match in Bolivia\" cannot be satisfied as no such match exists in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to analyze each part of it against the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Claim: \"the estadio monumental\"**\n   - We will check if \"estadio monumental\" is mentioned in the 'venue' column.\n\n2. **Claim: \"in japan host world cup qualify\"**\n   - This involves two parts:\n     a.
