    "resp": "To verify the claim \"episode number 10 be entitle reflection,\" we need to identify the relevant columns and rows in the table:\n\n1. **Episode Number**: This is needed to locate the correct row for episode 10.\n2. **Episode Title**: This will confirm whether the title matches \"reflection.\"\n\nLet's examine these components step-by-step.\n\n- The column corresponding to \"episode number\" is the first numerical column (let's assume it's labeled as such, based on typical table structures).\n- The column corresponding to \"episode title\" contains the titles of each episode.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Locate Row**: Find the row where the episode number is 10.\n2. **Verify Title**: Check if the episode title in that row matches \"reflection.\"\n\nFrom the data:\n- The row with an episode number of 10 corresponds to `row_index` 9 (since indices are zero-based).\n- In this row, the column for the episode title contains \"reflections\" (note the plural form).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states \"episode number 10 be entitle reflection,\" but the actual title is \"reflections.\" Therefore, the claim is not fully accurate.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Episode Number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Episode Title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
