    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the largest crowd to attend a VFL game be at the richmond versus collingwood game,\" we need to examine the relevant data from the table provided.\n\nThe key information necessary for this evaluation is the \"crowd\" column, which contains the number of attendees for each match. We will compare these numbers to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column for this claim is \"crowd,\" as it contains information about the number of people attending each game.\n\n2. **Extract Crowd Data**:\n   - Hawthorn vs North Melbourne: 11,000\n   - Fitzroy vs St Kilda: 15,000\n   - Essendon vs Melbourne: 20,000\n   - Richmond vs Footscray: 26,000\n   - South Melbourne vs Collingwood: 17,000\n   - Geelong vs Carlton: 15,000\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the largest crowd was at the Richmond vs Collingwood game.\n   - From our extracted data, we see that the Richmond vs Footscray game had a crowd of 26,000, which is larger than any other match listed, including the South Melbourne vs Collingwood game with a crowd of 17,000.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The largest crowd was at the Richmond vs Footscray game, not at a Richmond vs Collingwood game.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to identify cells that contain the crowd numbers for all games to verify this information fully.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Hawthorn vs North Melbourne: row_index 0, column_name \"crowd\"\n- Fitzroy vs St Kilda: row_index 1, column_name \"crowd\"\n- Essendon vs Melbourne: row_index 2, column_name \"crowd\"\n- Richmond vs Footscray: row_index 3, column_name \"crowd\" (largest crowd)\n- South Melbourne vs Collingwood: row_index 4, column_name \"crowd\"\n- Geelong vs Carlton: row_index 5, column_name \"crowd\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main aspects:\n\n1. Whether the game between Richmond and Footscray had the highest total score.\n2. If Richmond scored 19.21 in that game.\n\nLet's examine the table data for these conditions:\n\n- **Richmond vs. Footscray:**\n  - Home team (Richmond) score: 20.19 (139)\n  - Away team (Footscray) score: 17.8 (110)\n  - Total score: 20.19 + 17.8 = 37.99 (249)\n\n- **Other games scores:**\n\n  - Hawthorn vs. North Melbourne:\n    - Home team (Hawthorn) score: 17.13 (115)\n    - Away team (North Melbourne) score: 11.11 (77)\n    - Total score: 28.24 (163)\n\n  - Fitzroy vs. St Kilda:\n    - Home team (Fitzroy) score: 14.18 (102)\n    - Away team (St Kilda) score: 20.14 (134)\n    - Total score: 34.32 (236)\n\n  - Essendon vs. Melbourne:\n    - Home team (Essendon) score: 19.21 (135)\n    - Away team (Melbourne) score: 21.15 (141)\n    - Total score: 40.36 (276)\n\n  - South Melbourne vs. Collingwood:\n    - Home team (South Melbourne) score: 15.17 (107)\n    - Away team (Collingwood) score: 21.20 (146)\n    - Total score: 36.37 (253)\n\n  - Geelong vs. Carlton:\n    - Home team (Geelong) score: 14.8 (92)\n    - Away team (Carlton) score: 11.13 (79)\n    - Total score: 25.93 (171)\n\nThe highest total score is from the game between Essendon and Melbourne with a total of 40.36 (276). Richmond vs. Footscray had a lower total score.\n\n- Additionally, Richmond did not score 19.21 in their match against Footscray; they scored 20.19.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that \"the highest scoring game be when richmond play footscary\" is FALSE because the highest scoring game was between Essendon and Melbourne.\n- The claim about Richmond's score of 19.21 is also FALSE.\n\nThus, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 3 (Richmond vs. Footscray) for \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\"\n- Row index 2 (Essendon vs. Melbourne) for \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
