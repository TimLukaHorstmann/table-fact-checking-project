    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Mike Stapleton be pick ahead of any other Canadian player show in the table,\" we need to focus on two aspects from the given HTML table: the draft position (\"pick\" column) and nationality (\"nationality\" column).\n\n1. **Identify Mike Stapleton's Pick**: \n   - From the table, Mike Stapleton is listed at pick number 132.\n\n2. **Identify All Canadian Players**:\n   - Review each row to find players whose nationality is \"Canada.\"\n\n3. **Check Draft Positions for Canadian Players**:\n   - Compare Mike Stapleton\u2019s draft position with those of all other Canadian players in the table to see if he was indeed picked before any of them.\n\nThe relevant rows and their corresponding columns are as follows:\n\n- Row index 5: Mike Stapleton, pick 132, nationality Canada.\n- Other Canadian players' details:\n  - Row index 6: Stefan Larsson, pick 133, nationality Sweden (not relevant).\n  - Row index 7: Cliff Ronning, pick 134, nationality Canada.\n  - Row index 8: Thomas Hussey, pick 140, nationality Canada.\n  - Row index 9: Henrik Cedegren, pick 141, nationality Sweden (not relevant).\n  - Row index 10: Tom Allen, pick 142, nationality Canada.\n  - Row index 12: Darcy Wakaluk, pick 144, nationality Canada.\n  - Row index 13: Mark Thietke, pick 145, nationality Canada.\n  - Row index 14: Kelly Murphy, pick 146, nationality Canada.\n  - Row index 15: Heikki Riihijarvi, pick 147, nationality Finland (not relevant).\n\nFor the claim to be true, Mike Stapleton must have a draft position number lower than all other Canadian players listed. Let's verify:\n\n- Pick for Mike Stapleton: 132\n- Picks for other Canadian players:\n  - Cliff Ronning: 134\n  - Thomas Hussey: 140\n  - Tom Allen: 142\n  - Darcy Wakaluk: 144\n  - Mark Thietke: 145\n  - Kelly Murphy: 146\n\nSince Mike Stapleton was indeed picked at position 132, and all other Canadian players were picked after him (at positions higher than 132), the claim is supported.\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
