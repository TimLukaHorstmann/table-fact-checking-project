Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cells are those containing the 1st round scores for both teams.\n  - Row index 0, column name \"1st round\" (for `fc nantes (d1)`).\n  - Row index 2, column name \"1st round\" (for `ogc nice (d1)`).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
