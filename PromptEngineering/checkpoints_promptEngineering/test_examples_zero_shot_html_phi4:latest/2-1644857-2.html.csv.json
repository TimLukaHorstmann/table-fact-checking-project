    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we must evaluate two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Scotland should have stolen ends less than 9.\n2. Craig Brown should be the skip for the United States.\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the relevant parts of the table:\n\n### Condition 1: \"Scotland have stolen ends less than 9\"\n- Locate the row corresponding to Scotland in the table:\n  - The second row contains data for Scotland.\n  - The column \"stolen ends\" shows a value of 10 for Scotland.\n\nSince 10 is not less than 9, this condition is false.\n\n### Condition 2: \"Craig Brown as the skip\"\n- Locate the row corresponding to the United States in the table:\n  - The seventh row contains data for the United States.\n  - The column \"skip\" shows that Craig Brown is indeed listed as the skip for the United States.\n\nThis condition is true.\n\nSince both conditions need to be satisfied and one of them (the first) is false, the overall claim is FALSE. Now, let's identify the relevant cells used in this verification:\n\n- For Scotland having stolen ends less than 9:\n  - The \"stolen ends\" value for Scotland: Row index 1, Column name \"stolen ends\".\n  \n- For Craig Brown as the skip of the United States:\n  - The \"skip\" value for the United States: Row index 6, Column name \"skip\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"skip\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
