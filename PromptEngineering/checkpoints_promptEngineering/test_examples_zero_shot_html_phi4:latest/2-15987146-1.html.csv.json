Thus, we do not need to evaluate the rest of the claim because one part being false makes the entire claim false.\n\n2. **Part of the Claim**: \"lowest of the first 4 week\"\n   - Analyze attendances for the first four weeks:\n     - Week 1: Attendance = 63713\n     - Week 2: Attendance = 44851\n     - Week 3: Attendance = 60955\n     - Week 4: Attendance = 57491\n\n   Among these, 44851 is indeed the lowest attendance in the first four weeks. However, since we already found that December 27, 1992's attendance was not less than 44851, this part of the claim does not impact our conclusion.\n\nSince the initial condition (\"on december 27 1992 an attendance of less than 44851 be count\") is false, the entire claim is false.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table provided, we need to break down the claim into its components and verify each one against the data in the table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim states: \"during the week after 13 the result be a win with a score of 24 - 21.\"\n   - This implies that after week 13, there should be a game where the team won with a specific score of 24 - 21.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Weeks**:\n   - The weeks following week 13 are weeks 14, 15, 16, 17 (as per the table).\n\n3. **Checking Each Week for the Claim**:\n   - **Week 14**: \n     - Opponent: Chicago Bears\n     - Result: W 24 - 7\n     - The result is a win but not with a score of 24 - 21.\n   \n   - **Week 15**: \n     - Opponent: Green Bay Packers\n     - Result: L 16 - 14\n     - This is a loss, so it doesn't meet the criteria.\n\n   - **Week 16**: \n     - Opponent: Cleveland Browns\n     - Result: W 17 - 14\n     - The result is a win but not with a score of 24 - 21.\n   \n   - **Week 17**: \n     - Opponent: Buffalo Bills\n     - Result: W 27 - 3\n     - The result is a win but not with a score of 24 - 21.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the weeks following week 13 have a game where the team won with a score of 24 - 21.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identifying Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant rows for checking the claim are weeks 14, 15, 16, and 17.\n   - Specifically, we need to check the \"result\" column in these rows.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
