By examining each row under the \"Production Code\" column, we find that `3t7471` is located in the 173rd row (considering the first row as index 0).\n\nNext, for this specific row (index 173), we need to verify the value of the \"US viewers (millions)\" column. The entry shows a rating of `3.39`.\n\nThe claim states that the song with production code `3t7471` has `4.11` viewers in the US, but the actual data shows it has `3.39`.
