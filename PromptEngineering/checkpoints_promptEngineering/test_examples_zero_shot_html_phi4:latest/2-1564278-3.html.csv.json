    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the tournament in cardiff, great britain be on april 16 2007,\" we need to identify the relevant cells from the table and verify if they support or contradict the claim.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim specifies a location (\"cardiff, great britain\"), a date (\"april 16 2007\"), and implies that these correspond to a specific tournament entry in the table.\n   \n2. **Relevant Columns:**\n   - We need to check three columns for the relevant information:\n     - `date`: To verify if the date matches \"4 april 2007\" (as per British English convention used in the table).\n     - `tournament`: To ensure it lists \"cardiff, great britain.\"\n     - `surface` and other columns are not directly relevant to this claim.\n\n3. **Table Examination:**\n   - We look for a row where both the date is \"4 april 2007\" and the tournament is \"cardiff, great britain.\"\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - In the table:\n     - The fifth row has `date` as \"16 april 2007,\" `tournament` as \"cardiff, great britain.\"\n     - The date does not match exactly with \"april 16 2007\" because it is formatted differently (\"16 april 2007\" in the table versus \"april 16 2007\" in the claim). However, this difference is due to formatting (day first vs. month first) rather than an actual discrepancy.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Despite the format difference, both refer to the same calendar date. Therefore, the information supports the claim when considering the context of British English date notation used in the table.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE based on the evidence from the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
