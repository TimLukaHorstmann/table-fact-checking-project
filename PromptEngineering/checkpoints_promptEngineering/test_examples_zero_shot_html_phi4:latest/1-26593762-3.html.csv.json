The position in the table for Burnley at the time of the managerial change was 9th.\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step using the relevant rows and columns from the table.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Outgoing Manager\n\n- **Claim:** \"burnley , whose outgoing manager be brian law\"\n- We need to locate the row corresponding to Burnley.\n- From the table, we see that there is an entry for Burnley:\n  - **Row Index:** 12\n  - **Column Name:** 'team'\n  - The cell contains: \"burnley\"\n\nNext, within this row (row index 12), check the column named 'outgoing manager':\n\n- **Row Index:** 12\n- **Column Name:** 'outgoing manager'\n- The cell contains: \"brian laws\"\n\nThe claim states \"brian law\" which should match exactly with the table's entry. Considering typical variations in capitalization, this matches as \"brian laws\".\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Position in the Table\n\n- **Claim:** \"be 9th\"\n- In the same row for Burnley (row index 12), check the column named 'position in table':\n\n- **Row Index:** 12\n- **Column Name:** 'position in table'\n- The cell contains: \"9th\"\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are verified to be true based on the data from the relevant cells in the table.
