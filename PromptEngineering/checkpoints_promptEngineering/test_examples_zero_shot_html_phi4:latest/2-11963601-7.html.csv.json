    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two conditions against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a game where Manu Gin\u00f3bili was the leading scorer with 44 points.\n2. Confirm that the score of this game was \"100 - 99\".\n\nLet's examine each relevant row from the table one by one:\n\n- **February 5, 2008**: The leading scorer was Tim Duncan with 19 points; not relevant.\n- **February 6, 2008**: The leading scorer was Tim Duncan with 23 points; not relevant.\n- **February 8, 2008**: The leading scorer was Tim Duncan with 21 points; not relevant.\n- **February 10, 2008**: The leading scorer was Tim Duncan with 22 points; not relevant.\n- **February 11, 2008**: The leading scorer was Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points; not the correct score or point count.\n- **February 13, 2008**: The leading scorer was Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 46 points; not the correct score.\n- **February 19, 2008**: The leading scorer was Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 18 points; not the correct score or point count.\n- **February 21, 2008**: The leading scorer was Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 44 points. Check the score: \"100 - 99\". This matches both conditions of the claim.\n- **February 23, 2008**: The leading scorer was Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 30 points; not relevant for further verification since the first match already satisfies all conditions.\n- **February 25, 2008**: The leading scorer was Tim Duncan with 23 points; not relevant.\n- **February 28, 2008**: The leading scorer was Tim Duncan with 31 points; not relevant.\n\nThe claim is verified by the row corresponding to February 21, 2008. Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points in this game and the score was \"100 - 99\".\n\nHere are the relevant cells from that row:\n\n- Column: `leading scorer`, Cell value: `\"manu gin\u00f3bili (44)\"`\n- Column: `score`, Cell value: `\"100 - 99\"`\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"raptor be the home team of the game with manu gin\u00f3bili (34) as the lead scorer,\" we must check specific conditions in the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a game where Manu Gin\u00f3bili was the leading scorer with 34 points.\n2. Determine whether the Spurs were the visiting or home team for that particular game.\n\nFirst, locate the row(s) where \"leading scorer\" contains \"manu gin\u00f3bili (34)\":\n- This occurs in the row with `date: february 11 , 2008`.\n\nNext, check if \"raptors\" was listed as the home team for this specific game:\n- The \"home\" column for `row_index` 4 shows \"raptors\".\n\nThus, both conditions from the claim are met. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are located in `row_index` 4 with columns \"leading scorer\" and \"home\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the given table, we need to carefully analyze each condition mentioned in the claim and verify them against the data presented.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n1. \"when manu gin\u00f3bili (44) be the leading scorer\"\n   - We need to check for rows where the `leading scorer` is \"manu gin\u00f3bili (44)\".\n\n2. \"and the visitor be the maverick\"\n   - We also need to ensure that in those identified rows, the `visitor` column should say \"mavericks\".\n\n3. \"the date be february 28 , 2008\"\n   - Finally, we must check if for the row(s) satisfying the above conditions, the `date` is \"february 28, 2008\".\n\n**Verification Process:**\n- First, identify rows where Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points:\n  - Row 5 (February 21, 2008): The leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 44 points.\n  \n- Check if the visitor in those identified row(s) is \"mavericks\":\n  - For Row 5, the `visitor` is \"spurs\", not \"mavericks\".\n\nSince there is no row where Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 and the visitor was the Mavericks on February 28, 2008 (or any other date), the claim cannot be supported by the data in the table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim is FALSE because it specifies conditions that do not occur together in any row of the table.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to support this conclusion:\n\n1. Row with Manu Gin\u00f3bili as leading scorer with 44 points:\n   - Row index 5 (February 21, 2008), columns `date`, `leading scorer`.\n\n2. Check visitor for that row:\n   - Row index 5, column `visitor`.\n\n3.
