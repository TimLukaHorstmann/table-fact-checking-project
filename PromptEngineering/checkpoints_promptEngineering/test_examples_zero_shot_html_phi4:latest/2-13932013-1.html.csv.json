This information isn't directly provided in a single column, so we will assume that the total number of games played (column \"Games Played\") and the number of wins are related. However, since the table does not explicitly provide wins, we will assume that the context implies that the first entry for each quarterback is their win count.\n\n3. **Count Quarterbacks with More Than 30 Wins:**\n   - We need to count how many quarterbacks have more than 30 games won.\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n- **Jim Brown:** 118 Games Played, 100 wins (first number)\n- **Morten Andersen:** 250 Games Played, 180 wins\n- **Randy Bullock:** 34 Games Played, 25 wins\n- **Joe Flacco:** 206 Games Played, 121 wins\n- **Peyton Manning:** 243 Games Played, 186 wins\n- **Troy Aikman:** 165 Games Played, 110 wins\n- **Brett Favre:** 302 Games Played, 199 wins\n- **Tony Romo:** 191 Games Played, 123 wins\n- **Eli Manning:** 251 Games Played, 156 wins\n- **Kurt Warner:** 208 Games Played, 128 wins\n- **Ryan Tannehill:** 73 Games Played, 47 wins\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- Quarterbacks with more than 30 wins: Jim Brown, Morten Andersen, Joe Flacco, Peyton Manning, Troy Aikman, Brett Favre, Tony Romo, Eli Manning, Kurt Warner, Ryan Tannehill.\n\nThis gives us a total of 10 quarterbacks who have won more than 30 games.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. There are indeed only 10 Cleveland Browns quarterbacks listed with more than 30 wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"otto graham have win 44 more game than brady quinn,\" we need to identify the relevant data from the table for both Otto Graham and Brady Quinn.\n\n1. **Identify Rows:**\n   - The first row corresponds to Otto Graham.\n   - The second row corresponds to Brady Quinn.\n\n2. **Determine Relevant Column:**\n   - The column that indicates the number of wins is \"Games Won.\"\n\n3. **Extract Values:**\n   - For Otto Graham (Row 0), the value in the \"Games Won\" column is 138.\n   - For Brady Quinn (Row 1), the value in the \"Games Won\" column is 2.\n\n4. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - The difference in games won between Otto Graham and Brady Quinn is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     138 - 2 = 136\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Otto Graham has won \"44 more game\" than Brady Quinn.\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of 136 games, not 44.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is incorrect based on the data provided in the table.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row index for Otto Graham (Row 0), \"Games Won\" column.\n   - Row index for Brady Quinn (Row 1), \"Games Won\" column.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object representing the evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Games Won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Games Won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
