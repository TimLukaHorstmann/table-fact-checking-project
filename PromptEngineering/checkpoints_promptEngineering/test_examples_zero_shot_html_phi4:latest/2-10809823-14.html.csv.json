Prince Park is listed as a venue.\n2. The date for the match at Prince Park is 28 June 1980.\n\nLet's examine the table and identify relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Index**: Each row in the table corresponds to a specific game, with its details spread across columns such as \"home team,\" \"away team,\" etc.\n- **Column Name**: The column that contains venue names is labeled \"venue.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each row for these conditions:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Venue: Kardinia Park\n   - Date: 28 June 1980\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Venue: Western Oval\n   - Date: 28 June 1980\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Venue: Princes Park\n   - Date: 28 June 1980\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Venue: MCG\n   - Date: 28 June 1980\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Venue: Lake Oval\n   - Date: 28 June 1980\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Venue: VFL Park\n   - Date: 28 June 1980\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that:\n\n- Princes Park is indeed listed as a venue in Row 2.\n- The date for the match at Princes Park is 28 June 1980.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied.
