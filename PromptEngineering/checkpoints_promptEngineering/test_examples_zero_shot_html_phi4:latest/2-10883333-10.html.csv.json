    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"fitzroy have a higher score than any of the other team\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to compare the scores of all teams involved in the matches listed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Extract Scores**:\n   - For each row in the table, extract both the home team's score and the away team's score.\n   \n2. **Convert Scores**:\n   - Convert the AFL-style score notation (e.g., 14.20 (104)) into a numerical total to facilitate comparison.\n\n3. **Compare Scores**:\n   - Compare Fitzroy's scores with all other teams' scores in their respective matches.\n   - Additionally, compare the scores of all other teams against each other to ensure no team has a higher score than Fitzroy.\n\n### Score Extraction and Conversion:\n\n- **Geelong vs Melbourne**: \n  - Geelong: 14.20 (104)\n  - Melbourne: 14.14 (98)\n\n- **St Kilda vs North Melbourne**:\n  - St Kilda: 15.9 (99)\n  - North Melbourne: 17.19 (121)\n\n- **Richmond vs Essendon**:\n  - Richmond: 19.14 (128)\n  - Essendon: 12.9 (81)\n\n- **Hawthorn vs Collingwood**:\n  - Hawthorn: 19.24 (138)\n  - Collingwood: 13.11 (89)\n\n- **Fitzroy vs Carlton**:\n  - Fitzroy: 15.7 (97)\n  - Carlton: 16.10 (106)\n\n- **Footscray vs South Melbourne**:\n  - Footscray: 13.11 (89)\n  - South Melbourne: 12.15 (87)\n\n### Score Comparison:\n\n- **Fitzroy's Score**: 97\n- Compare Fitzroy's score with all other scores:\n  - Geelong: 104\n  - Melbourne: 98\n  - St Kilda: 99\n  - North Melbourne: 121\n  - Richmond: 128\n  - Essendon: 81\n  - Hawthorn: 138\n  - Collingwood: 89\n  - Carlton: 106\n  - Footscray: 89\n  - South Melbourne: 87\n\nFrom the comparison, it is evident that Fitzroy's score of 97 is not higher than several other teams' scores (e.g., Geelong, North Melbourne, Richmond, Hawthorn, Carlton).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"fitzroy have a higher score than any of the other team\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo verify this claim, we need to look at all rows for both home and away team scores.
