    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down and verify each part of it against the information in the table.\n\n### Claim:\n\"miloslav guren and stephane robidas be the only player that play center on the 1995 - 96 canadiens team.\"\n\n1. **Identify if \"miloslav guren\" plays center:**\n   - From the table, we see miloslav guren is listed as playing in the \"defence\" position (row 2). Thus, he does not play center.\n\n2. **Identify if \"stephane robidas\" plays center:**\n   - From the table, stephane robidas is listed as playing in the \"defence\" position (row 7). Thus, he also does not play center.\n\n3. **Check for other players who play center:**\n   - There are two entries for players with the position of \"center\":\n     - Boyd Olson (row 6) plays center.\n     - Eric Houde (row 9) plays center.\n\nSince neither miloslav guren nor stephane robidas play center, and there are other players listed as centers in the table, the claim is false. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- We need to verify positions for all players mentioned in the claim and check against others who play center.\n  - **miloslav guren** (row 2, column \"position\")\n  - **stephane robidas** (row 7, column \"position\")\n  - Other players playing **center**: \n    - Boyd Olson (row 6, column \"position\")\n    - Eric Houde (row 9, column \"position\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
