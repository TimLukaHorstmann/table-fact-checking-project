According to the table, rows are indexed starting from 0.\n   - Therefore, Row 0 corresponds to \"Round 1\".\n\n2. **Check Relevant Column:**\n   - We need to check the value in the \"away team\" column for this specific row since the claim is about the away team.\n\n3. **Verify the Data:**\n   - In Row 0 (\"Round 1\"), the \"home team\" is \"pohang steelers\".\n   - The \"away team\" listed in the same row (Row 0) is \"adelaide united\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the away team for Round 1 is \"adelaide united\" and not \"pohang steelers\", the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell to verify this claim is from Row 0 in the \"away team\" column, as it directly answers whether \"pohang steelers\" was listed as the away team for Round 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
