    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding viewership numbers for the episodes listed in the table, we need to analyze the data in the \"us viewers (millions)\" column for each episode:\n\n1. **Extract Viewership Data**:\n   - Episode 2: 12.30 million viewers\n   - Episode 3: 12.40 million viewers\n   - Episode 4: 11.81 million viewers\n   - Episode 5: 11.77 million viewers\n   - Episode 6: 11.21 million viewers\n   - Episode 7: 11.45 million viewers\n   - Episode 8: 8.44 million viewers\n\n2. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"the 3rd episode has the second highest number of viewers and the 8th episode has the highest.\"\n\n3. **Determine Viewership Rankings**:\n   - Highest Viewership: Episode 3 with 12.40 million.\n   - Second Highest Viewership: Episode 2 with 12.30 million.\n\n4. **Verification of Claim**:\n   - The claim about Episode 3 having the second highest number of viewers is false since it actually has the highest.\n   - The claim about Episode 8 having the highest viewership is also false as it has the lowest at 8.44 million.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the data provided in the table.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - We need to look at the \"us viewers (millions)\" column for all episodes.\n   - Relevant cells include rows 1 through 7 corresponding to each episode's viewership numbers.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
