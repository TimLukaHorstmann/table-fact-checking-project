    "resp": "To verify the claim about the Brewers' win/loss record in August 2005, we need to identify days when their record was exactly 50% wins and 50% losses. This means we're looking for instances where the number of games won is equal to the number of games lost.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - Each row represents a game day.\n   - The \"Record\" column shows the cumulative win/loss record up to that date.\n\n2. **Identify 50/50 Records:**\n   - A 50/50 record means equal wins and losses (e.g., 17-17, 18-18).\n\n3. **Check Each Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find rows where the \"Record\" column shows a win/loss record with equal numbers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Row 0: August 1, 2005**\n   - Record: 17-16\n   - Not 50/50\n\n2. **Row 1: August 2, 2005**\n   - Record: 18-16\n   - Not 50/50\n\n3. **Row 6: August 7, 2005**\n   - Record: 19-17\n   - Not 50/50\n\n4. **Row 9: August 10, 2005**\n   - Record: 21-18\n   - Not 50/50\n\n5. **Row 13: August 15, 2005**\n   - Record: 22-20\n   - Not 50/50\n\n6. **Row 17: August 19, 2005**\n   - Record: 23-22\n   - Not 50/50\n\n7. **Row 18: August 20, 2005**\n   - Record: 24-22\n   - Not 50/50\n\n8. **Row 21: August 23, 2005**\n   - Record: 25-26\n   - Not 50/50\n\n9. **Row 22: August 24, 2005**\n   - Record: 26-26\n   - This is a 50/50 record.\n\n10. **Row 23: August 25, 2005**\n    - Record: 27-27\n    - This is another 50/50 record.\n\n11. **Subsequent Rows:**\n    - Continue checking, but no more 50/50 records are found after August 25.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Brewers had a 50/50 win/loss record on two days in August 2005: August 24 and August 25.
