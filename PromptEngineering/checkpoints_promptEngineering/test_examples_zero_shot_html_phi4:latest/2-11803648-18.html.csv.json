This information is not explicitly stated for each row, so we must rely on known facts about the draft picks of the Ottawa Senators in 2009.\n   \n2. **List of Ottawa Senators Draft Picks (2009):**\n   - From external knowledge or research, we know that the following players were drafted by the Ottawa Senators in 2009:\n     - Jared Cowen\n     - Jakob Silfverberg\n     - Robin Lehner\n     - Chris Wideman\n     - Mike Hoffman\n     - Jeff Costello\n     - Corey Cowick\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Rows from Table:**\n   - Row 0: Jared Cowen (Nationality: Canada)\n   - Row 1: Jakob Silfverberg (Nationality: Sweden)\n   - Row 2: Robin Lehner (Nationality: Sweden)\n   - Row 3: Chris Wideman (Nationality: United States)\n   - Row 4: Mike Hoffman (Nationality: Canada)\n   - Row 5: Jeff Costello (Nationality: United States)\n   - Row 6: Corey Cowick (Nationality: Canada)\n\n4. **Count Nationalities:**\n   - Canadian players: Jared Cowen, Mike Hoffman, Corey Cowick\n   - Swedish players: Jakob Silfverberg, Robin Lehner\n   - American players: Chris Wideman, Jeff Costello\n\n5. **Determine Majority:**\n   - Total non-American players = 5 (Canada: 3, Sweden: 2)\n   - Total American players = 2\n   - Since 5 out of 7 drafted players are non-American, the majority is indeed non-American.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to identify cells that contain nationality information for these players.\n   - Rows and columns relevant for nationality:\n     - Row 0, Column \"nationality\"\n     - Row 1, Column \"nationality\"\n     - Row 2, Column \"nationality\"\n     - Row 3, Column \"nationality\"\n     - Row 4, Column \"nationality\"\n     - Row 5, Column \"nationality\"\n     - Row 6, Column \"nationality\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true.
