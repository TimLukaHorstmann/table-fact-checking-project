We must find these specific entries in the table.\n\nLet's analyze each player one by one:\n\n- **Michael Daly:**\n  - Look for a row with \"player\" as \"michael daly\".\n  - Check the \"pos\" column to ensure it is \"df\".\n  - Ensure the \"to club\" and \"transfer fee\" columns both show \"released\".\n\n- **Kiatprawut Saiweo:**\n  - Find the row where \"player\" is \"kiatprawut saiwaeo\".\n  - Verify that the \"pos\" column indicates \"df\".\n  - Confirm that both \"to club\" and \"transfer fee\" are \"released\".\n\n- **Suree Sukha:**\n  - Identify the row with \"player\" as \"suree sukha\".\n  - Check if the \"pos\" is \"df\".\n  - Ensure that the \"to club\" and \"transfer fee\" columns show \"released\".\n\nNow, let's locate these entries in the table:\n\n1. **Michael Daly**:\n   - Row index: 1\n   - Columns: \n     - \"pos\": df (satisfies condition)\n     - \"to club\": released (satisfies condition)\n     - \"transfer fee\": released (satisfies condition)\n\n2. **Kiatprawut Saiweo**:\n   - Row index: 7\n   - Columns: \n     - \"pos\": df (satisfies condition)\n     - \"to club\": released (satisfies condition)\n     - \"transfer fee\": released (satisfies condition)\n\n3. **Suree Sukha**:\n   - Row index: 8\n   - Columns: \n     - \"pos\": df (satisfies condition)\n     - \"to club\": released (satisfies condition)\n     - \"transfer fee\": released (satisfies condition)\n\nAll conditions for the claim are satisfied.

This transfer should have occurred after \"1 July 2008\".\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- **Row 3** of the table contains information about \"ashley grimes\":\n  - Column \"player\": \"ashley grimes\"\n  - Column \"to club\": \"millwall\" \n  - Column \"exit date\": \"1 july 2008\"\n\nThe player \"ashley grimes\" indeed transferred to \"millwall\". However, the exit date is \"1 July 2008\", not after this date. This means that while the transfer to Millwall occurred as stated in part of the claim, it did not occur after 1 July 2008.\n\nThus, based on the data from the table, the entire statement of the claim is false because the condition about the timing (\"after 1 July 2008\") is not met. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those that pertain to \"ashley grimes\" in the row where he is listed as transferring to \"millwall\", and his exit date.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"exit date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We will proceed by assuming that \"grimes\" refers to \"grime.\"\n\n2. **Position and Transfer Details:**\n   - The table lists \"ashley grimes\" as playing in the position of \"mf\" (midfielder) with an exit date on \"1 july 2008.\"\n   - The transfer details for this player show that they moved to \"millwall,\" and importantly, the transfer fee is listed as \"free.\"\n\n3. **Transfer Fee Check:**\n   - The claim states a transfer fee of \"300000.\" In the table, the corresponding cell for \"ashley grimes\" under \"transfer fee\" is \"free.\"\n   - A fee labeled as \"free\" does not equate to any monetary value, let alone 300,000.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table data, there's no record of a transfer fee of 300,000 for \"ashley grimes\" or \"grime.\" The player transferred without a financial transaction (\"free\").\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is not supported by the table.
