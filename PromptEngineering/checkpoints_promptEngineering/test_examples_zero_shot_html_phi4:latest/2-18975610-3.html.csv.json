    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table provided in HTML format, we will analyze each condition stated within the claim and verify it against the data from the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"red cliffs have no bye with less than 4 loss and more than 2494 against.\"\n\nLet's break down this claim into its components:\n\n1. **\"red cliffs have no bye\"**: \n   - The \"Byes\" column shows that for \"Red Cliffs,\" the number of byes is `0`.\n\n2. **\"less than 4 losses\"**:\n   - The \"Losses\" column indicates that \"Red Cliffs\" has `18` losses.\n\n3. **\"more than 2494 against\"**:\n   - The \"Against\" column reveals that \"Red Cliffs\" has a score of `2422`.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each condition against the data:\n\n- The first part of the claim states that Red Cliffs have no byes (`0`). This is true according to the table.\n  \n- The second part specifies having less than 4 losses. However, \"Red Cliffs\" has `18` losses, which does not satisfy the condition of being less than 4.\n\n- The third component requires more than `2494` against. For \"Red Cliffs,\" the score is `2422`, which again fails to meet this requirement (it should be greater than 2494).\n\nGiven that two conditions in the claim (\"less than 4 losses\" and \"more than 2494 against\") are not met, we can conclude that the overall claim is false.\n\nTo support our conclusion with specific data from the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: `7` (corresponding to \"Red Cliffs\")\n- **Column Names**:\n  - `\"Byes\"`: `0`\n  - `\"Losses\"`: `18`\n  - `\"Against\"`: `2422`\n\nNow, let's provide the JSON output with this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"sunrayia fl\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
