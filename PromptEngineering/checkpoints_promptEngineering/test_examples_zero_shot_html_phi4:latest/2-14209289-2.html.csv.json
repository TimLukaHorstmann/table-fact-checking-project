    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two parts of it: \n\n1. **Outcome against Montreal**: The claim states that Pittsburgh defeated Montreal. We need to check the game between Pittsburgh and Montreal.\n2. **Pittsburgh's record after this match**: The claim states that Pittsburgh's record was 3-0-2 following their victory over Montreal.\n\nLet's examine these components in the provided table:\n\n1. **Game against Montreal**:\n   - Look for a row where \"home\" is listed as \"pittsburgh\" and \"visitor\" is \"montreal\".\n   - In the table, this corresponds to the row with `date: october 15`. Here, the \"score\" column shows \"2 - 5\", indicating that Montreal scored 2 goals while Pittsburgh scored 5. Therefore, Pittsburgh defeated Montreal.\n\n2. **Record after defeating Montreal**:\n   - Check the \"record\" for the game against Montreal (which we identified in step 1) to see if it aligns with the claim.\n   - The record listed for this row is \"3 - 0 - 2\". This matches what the claim states.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied: Pittsburgh defeated Montreal, and their record after that match was indeed 3-0-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true. The relevant cells from the table to verify this are those containing information about the game against Montreal and its resulting record:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main conditions:\n\n1. Determine if Montreal was a visitor in a game before October 15.\n2. Check if the outcome of this game led to Pittsburgh having a record of \"3 - 0 - 2.\"\n\nLet's analyze the table step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Games Before October 15\n- The relevant rows for games before October 15 are those with dates on or before October 14.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Montreal was a Visitor\n- From the table, we see:\n  - **October 10**: Pittsburgh is the visitor against Montreal. This does not satisfy the condition.\n  - No other game has Montreal as the visitor before October 15.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Record After Each Game\n- We need to check the record after each game to see if it matches \"3 - 0 - 2\" at any point when Montreal was a visitor (which we found does not occur).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since Montreal was never a visitor before October 15, the condition cannot be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are those that help us determine these facts:\n\n1. Date to check games before October 15.\n2. Visitor column to identify if Montreal was a visitor.\n3. Record column to verify if it reached \"3 - 0 - 2.\"\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row for October 10: Visitor (Montreal is not the visitor), Record (\"1 - 0 - 2\").\n- Any row with Montreal as a visitor before October 15 (none exist).\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
