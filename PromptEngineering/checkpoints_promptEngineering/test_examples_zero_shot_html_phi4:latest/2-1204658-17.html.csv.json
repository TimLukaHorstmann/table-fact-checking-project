    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the specific parts of the table related to the claim: \n\nThe claim states, \"the game at mcg have essendon as the away team.\" We will break this down into two key conditions:\n1. The venue must be \"mcg.\"\n2. Essendon must be the away team.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Venue: emcg\n  - Away Team: geelong\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Venue: junction oval\n  - Away Team: fitzroy\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Venue: lake oval\n  - Away Team: essendon\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Venue: mcg\n  - Away Team: collingwood\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Venue: punt road oval\n  - Away Team: carlton\n\nNow, let's focus on the row where the venue is \"mcg\" (row index 3):\n- In Row 3, the venue is indeed \"mcg.\"\n- The away team in this row is \"collingwood,\" not essendon.\n\nSince Essendon is not the away team at \"mcg,\" the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n1. Venue cell (column: \"venue\") for Row 3.\n2.
