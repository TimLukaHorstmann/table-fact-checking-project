    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Montreal be the visitor on March 6\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in the table provided.\n\nThe claim involves two pieces of information:\n1. The date mentioned is March 6.\n2. Montreal is claimed to be the visiting team on this date.\n\nLet's locate and verify these details in the table:\n\n- First, find the row where \"date\" is \"march 6\". This corresponds to the fourth row (considering the first row of actual data as index 0).\n  \n- Within that row, check the \"visitor\" column. According to the table, for March 6:\n  - The visitor is indeed listed as \"montreal\".\n\nBased on this verification:\n\n- The relevant cells are in row index 4.\n- Specifically, the cells we need to verify are under the columns \"date\" and \"visitor\".\n  - For \"date\", it should be \"march 6\".\n  - For \"visitor\", it should be \"montreal\".\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- The row index is adjusted to zero-based indexing as used in programming contexts. March 6th appears at index 3 in the table.\n- Both \"date\" and \"visitor\" columns are relevant for confirming the claim.",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"before March 6 Montreal be the visitor\" is true or false, we need to verify whether there was a game where Montreal was listed as the visiting team before March 6.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n1. **Row Analysis**: The table provides data for multiple dates with each row representing a separate game.\n2. **Date Verification**:\n   - We need to find any entry with \"date\" before \"March 6\".\n3. **Visitor Verification**:\n   - For these entries, check if \"Montreal\" is listed in the \"visitor\" column.\n\nChecking each relevant row:\n\n- **Row Index 0 (March 1)**: \n  - Date: March 1\n  - Visitor: Philadelphia\n  - Montreal is not the visitor here.\n\n- **Row Index 1 (March 2)**:\n  - Date: March 2\n  - Visitor: NY Rangers\n  - Montreal is not the visitor here.\n\nNo further rows are before March 6.
