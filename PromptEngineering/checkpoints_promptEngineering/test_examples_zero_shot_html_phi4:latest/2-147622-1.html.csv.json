    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"the 6th d\u00e1il share of vote be 30.1%,\" we need to extract and verify relevant information from the provided table.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We are looking for data related to the \"6th\" D\u00e1il election.\n   \n2. **Extract Data for 6th D\u00e1il:**\n   - Locate the row where the `d\u00e1il` column is \"6th.\"\n\n3. **Verify Share of Votes for the 6th D\u00e1il:**\n   - Check if the `share of votes` in that row matches \"30.1%.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n- The table provides election data from different years with corresponding details on D\u00e1il numbers, share of votes, seats, and government.\n  \n- For the claim concerning the \"6th d\u00e1il,\" we find the relevant entry as follows:\n\n  | election   | d\u00e1il | share of votes | seats | government           |\n  |------------|------|----------------|-------|----------------------|\n  | 1927 (sep) | 6th  | 38.7%          | 61    | cumann na ngaedheal government |\n\n- The `share of votes` for the \"6th d\u00e1il\" is recorded as **38.7%**, not 30.1%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim states that the \"6th d\u00e1il share of vote be 30.1%.\" However, from the table, the actual `share of votes` for the \"6th d\u00e1il\" is **38.7%**.\n\n- Since the recorded value (38.7%) does not match the claimed value (30.1%), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell to verify this claim is in the row where `d\u00e1il` is \"6th,\" specifically the column for `share of votes`.\n\nHere's the JSON output with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"share of votes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
