Thus, the statement \"Francis II be the spouse of the queen who be the daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicily\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table for this verification are:\n- Row index 1 (for Maria Teresa) and column \"father\"\n- Row index 1 and column \"spouse\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"father\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"spouse\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
