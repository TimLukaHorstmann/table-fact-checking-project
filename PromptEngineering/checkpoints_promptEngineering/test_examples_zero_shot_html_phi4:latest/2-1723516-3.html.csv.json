The relevant cells for verification are from Row 8 in the columns \"score\" and \"surface\".\n\nHere's the structured JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is 7 because table indices typically start from 0 in programming contexts (similar to list indexing in Python), but the table itself starts its rows at a human-readable index of 1. Therefore, Row 8 corresponds to `row_index = 7` when considering zero-based indexing.",
