    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding Susana's team membership across different rounds, we need to analyze specific cells in the table where her alliances or teams are indicated.\n\n### Analyzing the Claim:\nThe claim states: \"Susana z\u00e9 maria and susana telmo play on the same team as the 4th and 5th player respectably.\" This implies that:\n\n1. In a particular round, Susana is part of a team with Z\u00e9 Maria, making them either the 4th or 5th players in some sequential order.\n2. In another round, Susana forms a team with Telmo, again occupying the position of either the 4th or 5th player.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n1. **Identify Rounds for \"Susana Z\u00e9 Maria\"**:\n   - Look through each row where \"susana z\u00e9 maria\" appears.\n   - Determine Susana's team and verify if she is the 4th or 5th member in that configuration.\n\n2. **Identify Rounds for \"Susana Telmo\"**:\n   - Similarly, find rows where \"susana telmo\" is mentioned.\n   - Check whether Susana occupies either the 4th or 5th position on this team.\n\n3. **Cross-verify Team Positions**:\n   - Ensure that in both instances (Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and Susana Telmo), her positioning corresponds to being the 4th or 5th player as claimed.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n1. **Row 6**: \"susana z\u00e9 maria\" is mentioned.\n   - The team composition: \"c\u00e9lia s\u00f3nia susana\", \"maria jo\u00e3o z\u00e9 maria\".\n   - Susana appears in the second team, and Z\u00e9 Maria is also there.\n   - This makes them 3rd and 4th members respectively.\n\n2. **Row 9**: \"susana telmo\" is mentioned.\n   - The team composition: \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\".\n   - Susana appears as the second member, and Telmo as the third.\n   - Here, Susana is not the 4th or 5th player.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- In Row 6, Susana is part of a team with Z\u00e9 Maria but is not the 4th or 5th player (she's 3rd).\n- In Row 9, Susana is on a team with Telmo but again, she is neither the 4th nor 5th (she's 2nd).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim does not hold true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"susana z\u00e9 maria\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"susana telmo\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down and check each part against the table:\n\n1. **\"richardo v be the no9 team\"**: This implies that \"ricardo v\" is in the 9th position (row index 8) of some column. We need to find if there's a column where \"ricardo v\" appears at row index 8.\n\n2. **\"that have no6 play paulo\"**: This suggests that in the same row (index 8), there should be an entry involving \"paulo\" at position 6 (column index 5).\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- Row index 8 corresponds to the column labeled \"all housemates\".\n- In this column, the entry is: `marco ricardo v telmo c\u00e9lia ricardo a z\u00e9 maria maria jo\u00e3o z\u00e9 maria c\u00e9lia s\u00f3nia susana carla paulo marta paulo marta susana m\u00e1rio z\u00e9 maria c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria c\u00e9lia susana z\u00e9 maria`.\n\nChecking for \"ricardo v\" and \"paulo\":\n\n- \"ricardo v\" appears at position 2 in this column.\n- \"paulo\" appears twice: first at position 11 and second at position 12.\n\nThe claim states that \"ricardo v\" should be the 9th team, which means it should appear at position 1 (since counting starts from 0).

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"telmo and paulo play on the same team as no 6 and no 9\" is supported by the table provided, we need to examine each row where \"telmo\" and \"paulo\" appear together in a team with other participants.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows Involving Telmo and Paulo Together:**\n   - Go through the rows of the table and find those that list both \"telmo\" and \"paulo\" as part of the same group or team.\n   \n2. **Check for Groupings with \"no 6\" and \"no 9\":**\n   - Determine if within these identified rows, both \"marta\" (listed as no 6 in the last row) and \"telmo\" (listed as no 9 in the last row) are part of the same team as \"telmo\" and \"paulo\".\n   \n3. **Evaluate Each Relevant Row:**\n   - For each identified row, check if both \"marta\" and \"telmo\" appear together with \"telmo\" and \"paulo\".\n\n**Relevant Rows Analysis:**\n\n- In the rows where \"telmo\" and \"paulo\" are listed together:\n  - **Row 6:** Contains \"paulo marta\", but not \"telmo\".\n  - **Row 7:** Contains \"marta susana telmo\". Here, both \"marta\" and \"telmo\" appear with each other, fulfilling the condition partially.\n  - **Row 8:** Contains \"m\u00e1rio z\u00e9 maria\", neither of whom is \"paulo\" or \"marta\".\n  - **Row 9:** Contains \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\". Here \"telmo\" is present but not \"paulo\" or \"marta\".\n\nUpon reviewing the rows, only Row 7 includes both \"telmo\" and \"marta\", fulfilling part of the condition. However, neither in Row 6 nor Row 7 do we find a team containing all four: \"telmo,\" \"paulo,\" \"marta,\" and another participant matching \"no 9,\" which is also \"telmo.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince there is no row where both \"telmo\" and \"paulo\" are on the same team as both \"marta\" (no 6) and \"telmo\" (no 9), the claim is not supported by any cell in the table.\n\nHere's the JSON output representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"marta susana telmo\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response indicates that while Row 7 has some overlap (with \"telmo\" and \"marta\"), it doesn't satisfy the entire condition with both \"paulo\" present as well.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table data, we must follow these steps:\n\n1. **Interpret the Claim:** \n   - The claim is: \"marco richardo vtelmo be the no8 team that have no9 player telmo\".\n   - This translates to finding if Marco and Ricardo V are in a team with Telmo at position 8, which also has exactly 9 players.\n\n2. **Understand Table Structure:**\n   - The table appears structured into columns representing different teams or line-ups across various rounds.\n   - Each row likely represents a specific round or week of the game where these configurations occur.\n\n3. **Locate Relevant Information in the Table:**\n   - We need to identify if any team listed includes both Marco and Ricardo V with Telmo at the 8th position, and confirm this team has exactly 9 players.\n\n4. **Examine Each Row for Matches:**\n\n   Let's analyze relevant rows:\n\n   - **Row Index 0:** \n     - Columns: \"all housemates\", \"marco ricardo v telmo\", \"c\u00e9lia ricardo a z\u00e9 maria\", ..., \"c\u00e9lia susana z\u00e9 maria\"\n     - The column \"marco ricardo v telmo\" lists players Marco, Ricardo V, and Telmo together.\n     - However, this is not the 8th team but rather one of the first.\n\n   - **Row Index 9:**\n     - Columns: \"riquita\", ..., \"z\u00e9 maria\"\n     - We need to find the column number corresponding to the position labeled as \"no8\". Given no direct labels like \"Team 1, Team 2...\", we infer from previous rows and assume a pattern.\n     - The column with \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\" is relevant here. It includes Telmo at position 9 (if counting players sequentially).\n     - This column does not match the requirement as it contains four names, and none of them are Marco or Ricardo V.\n\n   - **Row Index 8:**\n     - Columns: \"riquita\", ..., \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\"\n     - The column with \"m\u00e1rio z\u00e9 maria\" does not have Telmo at the 8th position nor includes Marco and Ricardo V.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   After analyzing, there is no row where:\n   - Marco and Ricardo V are in a team together with Telmo specifically at the 8th position.\n   - The team has exactly 9 players.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"marco ricardo v telmo\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"c\u00e9lia susana telmo z\u00e9 maria\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those where we checked for the presence of Marco and Ricardo V with Telmo at position 8 in a team configuration.
