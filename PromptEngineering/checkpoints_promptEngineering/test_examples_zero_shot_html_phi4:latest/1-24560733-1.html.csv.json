    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 26 points,\" we need to examine each game's Wildcats' and opponents' scores from the table. The relevant columns for this evaluation are \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents.\"\n\nThe margin of victory or defeat can be calculated by subtracting the opponents' score from the Wildcats' score (Wildcats' points - Opponents' points). We need to determine if any game in which the Wildcats won had a winning margin greater than 26 points.\n\nLet's go through each row where the result is \"win\" and calculate the point difference:\n\n1. **Row 2 (Game 2, Date: Sept 27)**\n   - Wildcats' Points: 20\n   - Opponents' Points: 0\n   - Difference: 20 - 0 = 20\n\n2. **Row 3 (Game 3, Date: Oct 4)**\n   - Wildcats' Points: 20\n   - Opponents' Points: 7\n   - Difference: 20 - 7 = 13\n\n3. **Row 4 (Game 4, Date: Oct 11)**\n   - Wildcats' Points: 26\n   - Opponents' Points: 0\n   - Difference: 26 - 0 = 26\n\n4. **Row 5 (Game 5, Date: Oct 18)**\n   - Wildcats' Points: 14\n   - Opponents' Points: 0\n   - Difference: 14 - 0 = 14\n\n5. **Row 6 (Game 6, Date: Oct 25)**\n   - Wildcats' Points: 7\n   - Opponents' Points: 6\n   - Difference: 7 - 6 = 1\n\n6. **Row 8 (Game 8, Date: Nov 8)**\n   - Wildcats' Points: 15\n   - Opponents' Points: 6\n   - Difference: 15 - 6 = 9\n\n7. **Row 9 (Game 9, Date: Nov 15)**\n   - Wildcats' Points: 36\n   - Opponents' Points: 0\n   - Difference: 36 - 0 = 36\n\nFrom the calculations above, the largest margin by which the Wildcats outscored their opponent is 36 points (in Game 9). This exceeds the claimed maximum of 26 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent by 26 point\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n- Row 4: Wildcats' Points and Opponents' Points\n- Row 6: Wildcats' Points and Opponents' Points\n- Row 9: Wildcats' Points and Opponents' Points\n\nThus, the JSON object with the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
