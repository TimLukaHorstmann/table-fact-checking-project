Verify the result for the identified row:\n   - Check the value in the \"result\" column of the row with the matching date.\n   - In the fifth row, the \"result\" is given as \"3 - 2\".\n\nSince both conditions are met: the date matches \"10 september 2013\", and the result is indeed \"3 - 2\", the claim is fully supported by the table.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the verification details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and the conditions in the claim.\n\n**Claim:** \"The result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1\"\n\n### Breakdown:\n- The claim involves goals numbered greater than 4.\n- We need to check if for any row where `goal` is greater than 4, the `result` column equals \"3 - 1\".\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify rows in the table where the `goal` value is larger than 4.\n2. For those rows, verify if the `result` column has the value \"3 - 1\".\n3. If all such rows satisfy this condition, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The table contains the following rows:\n  - Row 0: `goal = 1`\n  - Row 1: `goal = 2`\n  - Row 2: `goal = 3`\n  - Row 3: `goal = 4`\n  - Row 4: `goal = 5`\n\n- We need to consider rows where `goal > 4`, which is only Row 4.\n\n#### Check for Row 4:\n- **Row 4** has `goal = 5` and `result = 3 - 2`.\n- The result \"3 - 1\" does not match the actual result \"3 - 2\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe condition specified in the claim is not satisfied, as the only goal greater than 4 (which is Row 4) does not have a result of \"3 - 1\".
