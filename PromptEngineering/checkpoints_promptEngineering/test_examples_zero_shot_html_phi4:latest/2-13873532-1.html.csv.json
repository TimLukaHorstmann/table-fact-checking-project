    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Liu Song be not rank higher in 2007 / 2008 than in 2009 / 2010,\" we need to interpret what \"rank higher\" means in this context, and then compare the relevant data from the table for those years.\n\n### Understanding the Table\n\nThe table appears to represent some form of ranking or status across different types of tournaments over several years. The first row contains numerical values that could be interpreted as rankings or scores (though not explicitly stated). The subsequent rows are categories of tournaments, and each cell under these columns indicates a result like \"not held,\" \"lq\" (likely \"lost in qualifying\"), \"1r\" (likely \"first round\"), \"a\" (possibly \"advance\"), etc.\n\n### Interpreting the Claim\n\n- **Rank Higher**: In most contexts, having a lower numerical ranking means being higher up (e.g., 1st is higher than 2nd). Therefore, to determine if Liu Song did not rank higher in 2007/08 compared to 2009/10, we need to compare these two years' rankings.\n- **Relevant Years**: We focus on the columns \"2007 / 2008\" and \"2009 / 2010.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - **Column \"2007 / 2008\"**: The ranking for this year is `72`.\n   - **Column \"2009 / 2010\"**: The ranking for this year is `45`.\n\nGiven these values, a rank of `45` (in 2009/10) is higher than a rank of `72` (in 2007/08). Therefore, Liu Song did indeed rank higher in 2009/10 compared to 2007/08.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the claim states that Liu Song should \"not rank higher\" in 2007/08 than in 2009/10, and we found that he actually did rank higher in 2009/10 (having a lower numerical ranking), the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2007 / 2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 2010\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object reflects that the claim is false based on the rankings from the specified years.",

To verify this, we need to:\n\n1. Identify which row corresponds to \"liu song.\" However, the table does not explicitly mention \"liu song,\" so we must assume that each row represents a player or entity and interpret the ranks based on their progression across seasons.\n\n2. Examine the relevant columns for 2010/2011 and 2011/2012:\n   - The column for 2010/2011 is the second last column.\n   - The column for 2011/2012 is the last column.\n\n3.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Liu Song's best ranking being in 2008/09 when he made it into the top 50 is true, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\nThe structure of the table suggests that each row corresponds to a particular category or type of tournament (e.g., \"ranking tournaments\", \"variant format tournaments\"), and each column represents a year (e.g., \"2008/09\").\n\nTo verify Liu Song's ranking in 2008/09, we need to focus on the row labeled \"ranking tournaments\" because this would typically indicate performance rankings relevant to the context of making it into the top 50.\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: The row that corresponds to \"ranking tournaments\" is key here. According to the table:\n   - The first cell in each row indicates the category of tournament.\n   - For the row starting with \"variant format tournaments\", the ranking details for the years are as follows: \n     - 2008/09: \"not held\"\n\n2. **Examine the Relevant Year (2008/09)**:\n   - In the \"ranking tournaments\" row, under the column for 2008/09, it shows \"not held\". This implies that there was no ranking tournament held in this year, and hence, Liu Song could not have achieved any ranking.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the table indicates \"not held\" for ranking tournaments in 2008/09, Liu Song could not have made it into the top 50 during that season. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this are those under the \"ranking tournaments\" row and specifically in the column labeled \"2008/09\".\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"2008 / 09\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates that the claim is false and specifies the relevant cell used to verify this conclusion.",
