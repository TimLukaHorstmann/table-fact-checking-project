Check the crowd size for that specific game.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim\n\n1. **Identify the Game Location:**\n   - Locate the row where the \"venue\" is listed as \"glenferrie oval\".\n\n2. **Check Crowd Size:**\n   - Find the \"crowd\" column in the same row and verify if it exceeds 30,000.\n\n### Verification from Table\n\n- From the table:\n\n  | home team    | home team score | away team      | away team score | venue          | crowd | date        |\n  |--------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|-------------|\n  | geelong      | 10.17 (77)      | north melbourne| 5.4 (34)        | kardinia park  | 19658 | 31 july 1965|\n  | essendon     | 13.18 (96)      | footscray      | 6.11 (47)       | windy hill     | 16800 | 31 july 1965|\n  | carlton      | 9.19 (73)       | south melbourne| 13.12 (90)      | princes park   | 20744 | 31 july 1965|\n  | st kilda     | 14.12 (96)      | richmond       | 11.17 (83)      | moorabbin oval | 34076 | 31 july 1965|\n  | melbourne    | 12.11 (83)      | fitzroy        | 11.15 (81)      | mcg            | 30381 | 31 july 1965|\n  | **hawthorn** | **8.12 (60)**   | **collingwood**| **12.22 (94)**  | **glenferrie oval** | **18500** | 31 july 1965 |\n\n- The game played at Glenferrie Oval is between Hawthorn and Collingwood.\n- The crowd size for this game was 18,500.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the game at Glenferrie Oval had a crowd size larger than 30,000. However, according to the table, the crowd size was only 18,500, which is less than 30,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify the row where the home team score is \"11.15 (81)\".\n2. Check if the away team score in that row matches \"8.12 (60)\".\n\nLet's examine each row for these conditions:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Home Team Score: \"10.17 (77)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"5.4 (34)\"\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team Score: \"13.18 (96)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"6.11 (47)\"\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team Score: \"9.19 (73)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"13.12 (90)\"\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team Score: \"14.12 (96)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"11.17 (83)\"\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home Team Score: \"12.11 (83)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"11.15 (81)\" \n  - This row matches the first condition where the home team score is \"11.15 (81)\", but we need to check the away team score.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team Score: \"8.12 (60)\"\n  - Away Team Score: \"12.22 (94)\"\n\nIn **Row 4**, which satisfies the first condition, the away team score is \"11.15 (81)\" and not \"8.12 (60)\". Therefore, the second condition of the claim is not met.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify this are from Row 4 for both the home and away team scores:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
