    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Marcus Marshall's best time being 59.2 is true or false, we need to examine the table and locate the relevant information.\n\n### Analysis of the Table:\n- The table provides data for several drivers across multiple columns: \"name\", \"team\", \"qual 1\", \"qual 2\", and \"best\".\n- Each row corresponds to a different driver.\n- We are interested in finding Marcus Marshall's best qualifying time, which is listed under the \"best\" column.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n1. **Locate Marcus Marshall in the Table:**\n   - Search for the row where \"name\" is \"marcus marshall\".\n   - This corresponds to the 15th row (considering the first row as index 0).\n\n2. **Check the \"Best\" Column for Marcus Marshall:**\n   - In the 15th row, under the column \"best\", we find the value \"59.200\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Marcus Marshall's best time is \"59.2\".\n   - The table shows his best time as \"59.200\".\n   - When comparing these values, 59.200 is numerically equivalent to 59.2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since the value in the table matches the claimed value when considering numerical equivalence (ignoring trailing zeros), the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n  \nThus, the answer is \"TRUE\", and the relevant cell for this verification is in row index 15 under the column \"best\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"best\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the team \"rocketsports\" having a Qual 2 time of 58.385, we need to check the relevant entries in the table for drivers associated with this team and their Qual 2 times.\n\n1. Identify which rows correspond to the team \"rocketsports\":\n   - Row index 10: Timo Glock is listed as being part of rocketsports racing.\n   - Row index 12: Ryan Hunter-Reay is also listed as part of rocketsports racing.\n\n2. Check the \"qual 2\" column for these identified drivers:\n   - For Timo Glock (row index 10), the Qual 2 time is indeed 58.385.\n   - For Ryan Hunter-Reay (row index 12), the Qual 2 time is 58.693, which does not affect the claim.\n\nThe claim specifically states that rocketsports have a Qual 2 time of 58.385, and we verified this for Timo Glock, making it true for at least one member of the team.\n\nThus, based on the table data, the claim is supported as true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"qual 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
