    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two aspects from the table: \n\n1. Identify if there was a game against the \"Buffalo Sabres\" and check its attendance.\n2. Compare the attendance figure for this specific game with the number mentioned in the claim (10750).\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n- The relevant row for each game is identified by the `game` column, which has unique numbers from 37 to 50.\n- We search for the opponent \"Buffalo Sabres\" within these rows. \n- In this table, there is a row with an opponent named \"Buffalo sabres\":\n  - **Row index:** 46 (in zero-based indexing as used in programming and commonly assumed here)\n  - This corresponds to game number 47.\n  \n- Once the correct row is identified:\n  - Check the `attendance` column for this row, which shows the attendance figure for the game against Buffalo Sabres. \n  - The attendance listed in this row is 15611.\n\n- Compare this value (15611) with the claim's stated attendance of 10750.\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe attendance of 15611 does not match the claimed attendance of 10750; hence, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells to verify the claim:**\n- Row index for \"Buffalo Sabres\" game (row index 46 in zero-based indexing)\n- Column names relevant to this verification are `opponent` and `attendance`.\n\nThe JSON response with these details will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
