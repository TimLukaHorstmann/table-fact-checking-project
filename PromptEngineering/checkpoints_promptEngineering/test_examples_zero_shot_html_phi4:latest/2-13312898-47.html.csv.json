    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of the statement using the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"Edgerrin James was the number 4 pick in the first round and number 4 overall.\"\n\nLet's break this down into two parts:\n\n1. **\"Edgerrin James was the number 4 pick in the first round.\"**\n   - We need to find the row where Edgerrin James is listed.\n   - In the table, \"edgerrin james\" appears in the row with index 0 (considering 0-based indexing).\n   - For this part of the claim, we need to check:\n     - The `round` column should be 1 (indicating the first round).\n     - The `pick` column should be 4.\n   - Relevant cells for verification:\n     - Row index 0, Column name \"round\": Value is 1.\n     - Row index 0, Column name \"pick\": Value is 4.\n\n2. **\"Edgerrin James was number 4 overall.\"**\n   - Again, we refer to the row where Edgerrin James is listed (row index 0).\n   - For this part of the claim, we need to check:\n     - The `overall` column should be 4.\n   - Relevant cell for verification:\n     - Row index 0, Column name \"overall\": Value is 4.\n\nNow, let's verify these conditions:\n\n- In row index 0:\n  - The `round` value is 1 (first round).\n  - The `pick` value is 4.\n  - The `overall` value is 4.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
