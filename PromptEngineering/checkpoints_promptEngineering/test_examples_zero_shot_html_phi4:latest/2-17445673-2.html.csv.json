    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions:\n1. Identify if there is a match labeled as a win against David Ross.\n2. Check whether this specific match has the longest duration among all matches listed in the table.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Matches Against David Ross\n\nWe scan through each row for the opponent named \"David Ross.\" According to the provided table, we find:\n\n- **Row 11**: \n  - Opponent is \"david ross\"\n  - Result is \"win\"\n\nSo, there is a match against David Ross that was won.\n\n### Step 2: Checking Duration of Matches\n\nNext, we need to determine if this win has the longest duration. We'll look at the 'time' column for all matches and compare:\n\n- **Row 11**: \n  - Time: \"5:36\"\n\nNow let's compare with other match times:\n- Row 1: 1:55\n- Row 2: 1:34\n- Row 3: 5:00\n- Row 4: 3:23\n- Row 5: 5:00\n- Row 6: 4:38\n- Row 7: 0:18\n- Row 8: 2:23\n- Row 9: 5:00\n- Row 10: 5:00\n- Row 12: 6:58\n- Row 13: 9:49\n- Row 14: 5:36 (same as against David Ross)\n- Row 15: 1:20\n\nThe longest duration listed is \"9:49\" in **Row 13**. Therefore, the match with David Ross at \"5:36\" does not have the longest duration.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the claim states that the win against David Ross was the match with the longest time, and our analysis shows otherwise (as there's a longer match), the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are from:\n- Row 11 for identifying the win against David Ross.\n- All rows for comparing durations of matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
