Liselotte Neumann is not mentioned here.\n\n2. **For 1996:**\n   - Check if there is an LPGA Classic tournament in which Liselotte Neumann is listed as a runner-up.\n   - The entry on June 6, 1996, lists the \"Edina Realty LPGA Classic\" with a winner's score of \"-9 (67 + 73 + 67 = 207)\" and mentions Brandie Burton, Carin Koch, and Suzanne Strudwick as the runners-up. Liselotte Neumann is not mentioned here.\n\n3. **For 1998:**\n   - Check if there is an LPGA Classic tournament in which Liselotte Neumann is listed as a runner-up.\n   - The entry on March 22, 1998, lists the \"Standard Register Ping\" with a winner's score of \"-13 (69 + 67 + 69 + 74 = 279)\" and mentions Rosie Jones as the runner-up.
