    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"grass be the surface in 3 of the 14 championship or 21.43%,\" we need to analyze the table data with a focus on two specific aspects:\n\n1. **Counting Instances of \"Grass\" Surface**: We will examine each row's \"surface\" column to identify how many times \"grass\" appears as the surface.\n\n2. **Calculating Percentage**: With the count from step 1, we calculate the percentage of championships where \"grass\" was the surface out of a total of 14 events.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Carpet (i)\n- Row 1: Carpet (i)\n- Row 2: Carpet (i)\n- Row 3: Hard (i)\n- **Row 4: Grass** \n- **Row 5: Grass**\n- Row 6: Hard\n- Row 7: Hard (i)\n- Row 8: Grass\n- Row 9: Grass\n- Row 10: Hard\n- **Row 11: Hard (i)**\n- Row 12: Carpet (i)\n- Row 13: Carpet (i)\n- Row 14: Carpet (i)\n\n\"Grass\" appears in rows 4, 5, 8, and 9. This means \"grass\" is the surface for 4 championships.\n\nNow let's calculate the percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Grass Championships}}{\\text{Total Number of Championships}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{4}{14} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 28.57\\% \\]\n\nThe claim states that grass was the surface in 3 championships, which is incorrect because it actually appears in 4. Consequently, the percentage stated (21.43%) does not match the calculated 28.57%.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and count how many times each opponent appears in the column \"opponent in the final\". The claim states that Yevgeny Kafelnikov is tied for the most common opponent with two matches.\n\nLet's examine the relevant entries:\n\n1. **Yevgeny Kafelnikov**:\n   - 2 August 1999, Montreal, Canada: Winner (Row 4)\n   - 20 November 2000, Stockholm, Sweden: Winner (Row 5)\n\n   Yevgeny Kafelnikov appears twice.\n\nNext, we check if any other opponent appears more than twice:\n\n- **Martin Damm**: 1 appearance (Row 0)\n- **Renzo Furlan**: 1 appearance (Row 1)\n- **Jan Siemerink**: 1 appearance (Row 2)\n- **Todd Martin**: 1 appearance (Row 3)\n- **Fabrice Santoro**: 1 appearance (Row 6)\n- **Harel Levy**: 1 appearance (Row 7)\n- **Marat Safin**: 1 appearance (Row 8)\n- **Paradorn Srichaphan**: 1 appearance (Row 9)\n- **Andre Agassi**: 1 appearance (Row 10)\n- **Nicolas Kiefer**: 1 appearance (Row 11)\n- **Mario An\u010di\u0107**: 1 appearance (Row 12)\n- **Ivo Karlovi\u0107**: 1 appearance (Row 13)\n\nNo other opponent appears more than twice. Therefore, Yevgeny Kafelnikov is indeed tied for the most common opponent with two matches.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 4: \"opponent in the final\" and \"score in the final\"\n- Row 5: \"opponent in the final\" and \"score in the final\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
