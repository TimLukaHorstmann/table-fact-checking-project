Row 5:\n   - Venue: VFL Park\n   - Crowd: 58736\n\nFrom the data above, we can identify that:\n- The crowd numbers are as follows: 25240, 19879, 10626, 14971, 21588, and 58736.\n- The lowest crowd number is 10626 at Lake Oval.\n\nComparing this with VFL Park's crowd of 58736, it is clear that VFL Park does not have the lowest number of crowd. Instead, Lake Oval has the lowest attendance figure.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify this are those concerning the \"crowd\" numbers for each row and specifically identifying the row where the venue is \"VFL Park.\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
