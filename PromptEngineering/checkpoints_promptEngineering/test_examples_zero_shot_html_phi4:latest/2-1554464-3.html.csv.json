Row 12: Date - 14 January 2012, Surface - hard, Opponent - David Ferrer, Result - Lost.\n\n   - **Analysis for Hard Surfaces**:\n     - Olivier Rochus lost to opponents other than David Ferrer in rows 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n     - He lost to David Ferrer only in row 12.\n\n2. **Carpeted Surface Matches**:\n   - There are no entries with \"carpet\" as the surface type.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim that Olivier Rochus loses every time he plays on a hard surface to David Ferrer is false since there are multiple losses on hard surfaces where his opponent was not David Ferrer.\n- The claim about losing to John Isner each time they play on a carpeted surface cannot be evaluated as there are no matches listed on carpeted surfaces.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Evaluation:\n- Rows 2, 3, 4, 6 (for hard surface losses with opponents other than David Ferrer).\n- Row 12 (for loss to David Ferrer on hard surface).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The scores and opponent do not match the claim's specified score.\n  \n- Olivier Rochus does not appear as an opponent in any of the rows.\n\nThe conditions specified in the claim are not met because:\n- Mardy Fish is listed once, but not with the scores 3-6, 4-6.\n- The specified score of 1-6, 5-7 appears against Marcos Baghdatis on a hard (i) surface, not related to Olivier Rochus or matching surfaces.\n\nSince no instance in the table satisfies all conditions of the claim (\"Mardy Fish beat Olivier Rochus with scores 3-6, 4-6 and 1-6, 5-7\"), the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Row index 7 (opponent \"mardy fish\", score \"7 - 5 , 3 - 6 , 4 - 6\", surface \"grass\")\n- Row index 8 (score \"1 - 6 , 5 - 7\", surface \"hard (i)\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
