We need to find a row where the column `october` equals 12.\n2. **Opponent**: It mentions \"have Washington Capital as opponent\". We must check if the `opponent` column contains \"washington capitals\" in the identified row.\n3. **Record**: The claim states \"with 3 - 2 - 0 record\". We need to verify if the `record` column equals \"3 - 2 - 0\" for that row.\n4. **Score**: Finally, it claims \"5 - 3 score\". We should check if the `score` column is \"5 - 3\".\n\n### Verification with Table\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Column `october`: The value is 12, matching the date specified in the claim.\n  - Column `opponent`: The value is \"hartford whalers\", which does not match \"washington capitals\".\n  - Column `record`: The value is \"3 - 3 - 0\".
