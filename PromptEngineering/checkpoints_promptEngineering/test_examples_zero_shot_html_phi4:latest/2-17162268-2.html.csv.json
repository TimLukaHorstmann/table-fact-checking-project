Scott Simpson (USA) - Total: 282\n2. Larry Nelson (USA) - Total: 285\n3. Fuzzy Zoeller (USA) - Total: 286\n4. Raymond Floyd (USA) - Total: 289\n5. Hale Irwin (USA) - Total: 290\n6.

David Graham (Australia) - Total: 302\n\nWe need to identify the highest total score:\n\n- Scott Simpson's total is 282.\n- Larry Nelson's total is 285.\n- Fuzzy Zoeller's total is 286.\n- Raymond Floyd's total is 289.\n- Hale Irwin's total is 290.\n- Tom Watson's total is 291.\n- Andy North's total is 295.\n- Jack Nicklaus's total is 297.\n- David Graham's total is 302.\n\nThe highest total score in the table is 302, which belongs to David Graham from Australia. \n\nSince David Graham has indeed the highest total score and he represents Australia, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\".

Jack Nicklaus has the most wins (four), and all his winning years fall within the specified range from 1962 to 1980.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n- The \"year (s) won\" column for Jack Nicklaus at row index 7.\n- The same column for Hale Irwin at row index 4 to confirm that he does not have more wins than Jack Nicklaus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Relevant years before 1987 are 1974 and 1979.\n   - **Jack Nicklaus**: Years won are 1962, 1967, 1972, 1980.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Jack Nicklaus and determine whether it is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table, we must assess two key parts of the statement:\n\n1. **Jack Nicklaus's Country**: The claim states that \"jack nicklaus of australia\" won the most years. We need to verify his country of origin from the table.\n\n2. **Years Won by Jack Nicklaus**: The claim mentions he expanded wins from 1962 to 1980. We should check if these are indeed the years listed for him in the table, and also confirm that it represents the maximum number of wins compared to other players.\n\nLet's analyze each part:\n\n1. **Country of Origin**:\n   - According to the table, Jack Nicklaus is from the United States (not Australia). Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\n2. **Years Won**:\n   - The table indicates that Jack Nicklaus won in 1962, 1967, 1972, and 1980. This matches with the years mentioned in the claim.\n   - We need to check if he has more wins than any other player. In the table, Hale Irwin is listed as winning three times (1974, 1979, 1990). No other player won more than Jack Nicklaus's four times.\n\nSince one part of the claim about his country is incorrect, we can already determine that the entire statement is FALSE. However, for completeness:\n\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - To verify the year and number of wins: \n    - Row index 8 (Jack Nicklaus): Columns \"player\", \"country\", and \"year (s) won\" are relevant.\n  - To compare with other players' years:\n    - Row indices for other players, specifically Hale Irwin (Row 4), to confirm the maximum number of wins.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
