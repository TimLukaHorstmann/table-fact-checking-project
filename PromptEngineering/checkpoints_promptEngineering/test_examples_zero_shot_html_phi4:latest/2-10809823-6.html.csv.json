    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if Victoria Park is indeed the only venue listed in the table for matches held on 3 May 1980. The relevant information from the table includes both the \"venue\" and \"date\" columns.\n\nHere's how we can check:\n\n1. **Identify Rows by Date**: We look at all rows where the date is \"3 may 1980\". All rows in this table match this criterion, so every row needs to be considered.\n\n2. **Check Venue Column**: For each of these rows, examine the \"venue\" column to determine if there are any venues other than Victoria Park.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Venue is Mcg.\n- **Row 1**: Venue is Victoria Park.\n- **Row 2**: Venue is Princes Park.\n- **Row 3**: Venue is Junction Oval.\n- **Row 4**: Venue is Arden Street Oval.\n- **Row 5**: Venue is VFL Park.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that there are multiple venues listed for matches on 3 May 1980 besides Victoria Park. Therefore, the claim \"the only venue on 3 may 1980 be victoria park\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this include all rows in the table under both the \"venue\" and \"date\" columns:\n\n- Row 0: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 1: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 2: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 3: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 4: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 5: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
