This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez as the next highest rank player in the Belgian First Division A league who played in the Belgian Cup\n\n- We need to identify players who played in the Belgian Cup. This information would be indicated by a non-zero value in the \"super cup\" column.\n- From the table:\n  - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has a \"super cup\" value of 1, indicating he played in the Belgian Cup.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that among players who have a non-zero \"super cup\" value, Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez is the next highest rank player based on the \"total\" column after Jonathan Legear.\n\n- Players with non-zero \"super cup\":\n  - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez: total = 3\n\nSince Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez is the only player with a non-zero \"super cup\" value, he is indeed the highest (and next) rank player in this category.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the table provided, let's break down and verify each part of the statement:\n\n1. **\"Though 4 players from Belgian first division a be in the top 19 scorer\"**: \n   - We need to identify which players are from the \"Belgian first division\". This can typically be inferred if we have contextual knowledge about these players, as the table does not explicitly mention this information.\n   - Based on external knowledge:\n     - Bart Goor\n     - Jelle van Damme\n     - Jan Pol\u00e1k\n     - Tom De Sutter\n   - These four players are indeed from Belgian first division and appear in the top 19 based on the \"total\" column.\n\n2. **\"The top scorer (Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez) have 5 fewer goal than Bart Goor\"**:\n   - Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez's total score is 3.\n   - Bart Goor\u2019s total score is 1.\n   - The claim states that Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has 5 fewer goals than Bart Goor. However, in reality, Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez has more goals (3) compared to Bart Goor (1), not fewer.\n\n3. **\"Who have 11 goal\"**:\n   - The claim mentions Bart Goor having 11 goals, but according to the table, his total is only 1.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the claim is false based on the discrepancies in the number of goals attributed to Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez and Bart Goor. Now, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For verifying Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez:\n  - Row index: 12\n  - Column name for total score: \"total\"\n\n- For verifying Bart Goor:\n  - Row index: 16\n  - Column name for total score: \"total\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
