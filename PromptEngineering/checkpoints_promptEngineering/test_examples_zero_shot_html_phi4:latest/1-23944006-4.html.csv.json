Identify the row corresponding to the San Diego event.\n2. Check the 'year', 'championship', and 'score' columns in that row for accuracy against the claim.\n\n**Analysis of Table:**\n\n- The table has multiple rows, each representing a different match with various attributes such as outcome, year, championship, surface, partner, opponents, and score.\n  \n- We are specifically interested in matches where the 'championship' is \"San Diego.\"\n\n- Locate the row(s) containing \"san diego\" in the 'championship' column.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Row Identification:** \n   - The second row has \"San Diego\" under the 'championship' column.\n\n2. **Check Relevant Details in the Row:**\n   - 'year': 2002\n   - 'championship': San Diego\n   - 'score': 7 - 6 (9 - 7) , 1 - 6 , 5 - 7\n\n3. **Comparison with Claim:** \n   - The claim states that the score should be \"7 - 6 (9 - 7) , 1 - 6 , 5 - 7.\"\n   - This matches exactly with what is in the 'score' column for the San Diego event.\n\nSince all conditions match, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
