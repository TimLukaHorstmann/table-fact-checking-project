    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the power of the 1972 engine, we must examine the table data for entries relevant to this specific year and its associated engine information.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to locate any rows where the `years` column includes \"1972\". From the provided table, there is one such row:\n     - Row 2: `\"1972\", \"455in cubic oldsmobile v8\"`\n\n2. **Examine the Power Information:**\n   - The claim states that the power of this engine \"be not give in hp (kw)\". We will look at the `power` column for the identified row to verify whether the information is missing or specified.\n   - In Row 2, the value under the `power` column is `\"-\"`, indicating that the power is indeed not given.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the engine's power \"be not give in hp (kw)\", which aligns with the observation that the power information is missing (`\"-\"`) for the 1972 entry.\n   - Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data as there is no specified power value for the 1972 engine.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Only one row and column are relevant to this analysis based on the criteria outlined in the claim. Specifically, we focus on:\n  - Row index: 1 (the second row when counting from zero)\n  - Column name: \"power\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis concludes that the claim about the power information for the 1972 engine being unspecified is correct.",
