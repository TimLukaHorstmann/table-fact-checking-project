    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Raymond Felton be 6 - 2 in height\" is true or false based on the given HTML table, we need to verify Raymond Felton's height entry against the data provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row and Column:**\n   - The claim pertains to the player \"Raymond Felton.\"\n   - We need to check the \"height\" column for this player's information.\n   \n2. **Locate Raymond Felton in the Table:**\n   - The table lists players with details about them, including their names, heights, schools, hometowns, colleges, and NBA draft positions.\n   - Scanning through the rows, we find:\n     - Row 3 contains \"Raymond Felton\" as the player's name.\n\n3. **Check the Height:**\n   - In Row 3 (zero-indexed), under the \"height\" column, the entry is \"6 - 2.\"\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Raymond Felton should be \"6 - 2 in height.\"\n   - The table confirms this exact height for Raymond Felton.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the data from the table matches the claim, it is fully supported by the relevant cell.\n\nNow we can construct the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
