    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine how many games were played by the Blue Jays in July according to the table.\n\n1. **Examine Each Row**: We'll examine each row of the table and count the number of entries for the month of July.\n2. **Count Relevant Entries**: Count all rows where the date falls within July, considering that some dates might appear more than once if multiple games were played on a single day (e.g., doubleheaders).\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Rows 0 to 18 are dated from \"July 1\" to \"July 22\", indicating one game per day for these days.\n- Row 19 is dated \"July 23\", but there are two entries: one for the morning or first game and another for an afternoon or second game on that date, making it a total of 2 games on July 23.\n- Rows 20 to 25 continue from \"July 24\" to \"July 25\". Both dates have one entry each, except for July 25 which is noted as \"(13)\" indicating an extra-innings game but still counts as one game day-wise.\n- Row 26 (dated \"July 27\") through row 29 (\"July 30\") show games on four additional days in July.\n- Row 30 is dated \"July 31\", adding one more game.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of games:\n\n- From July 1 to July 22: 18 days = 18 games\n- July 23: 2 games (doubleheader)\n- July 24 to July 25: 2 days = 2 games\n- July 27 to July 30: 4 days = 4 games\n- July 31: 1 game\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n18 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 27 games\n\nThus, the total number of games played by the Blue Jays in July is 27.\n\nThe claim states there were \"a total of 28 games in July,\" which is not supported by our count.
