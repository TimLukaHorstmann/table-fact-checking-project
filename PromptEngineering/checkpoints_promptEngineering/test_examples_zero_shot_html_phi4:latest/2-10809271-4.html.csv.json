    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about St Kilda's and Collingwood's home team scores from the given table, we need to extract and compare the relevant data:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Teams:**\n   - The claim involves two teams: St Kilda and Collingwood.\n\n2. **Locate St Kilda in the Table:**\n   - Find the row where \"st kilda\" is listed as the home team.\n   - This occurs in the last row (row index 5).\n\n3. **Check St Kilda's Home Team Score:**\n   - In row 5, under the column \"home team score\", the value is \"14.17 (101)\".\n\n4. **Locate Collingwood in the Table:**\n   - Find the row where \"collingwood\" is listed as the home team.\n   - This occurs in row index 3.\n\n5. **Check Collingwood's Home Team Score:**\n   - In row 3, under the column \"home team score\", the value is \"13.23 (101)\".\n\n6. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states St Kilda have a home team score of \"9.11\" and Collingwood have a home team score of \"11.13\".\n   - From the table:\n     - St Kilda's actual home team score is \"14.17 (101)\", not \"9.11\".\n     - Collingwood's actual home team score is \"13.23 (101)\", not \"11.13\".\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim does not match the data in the table for either St Kilda or Collingwood.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5, Column \"home team score\" for St Kilda.\n- Row 3, Column \"home team score\" for Collingwood.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"a total of 2 away teams have an away team score that is higher than 10.00 points,\" we need to analyze each row in the table, focusing on the column named \"away team score.\"\n\nThe scores are provided in a format like `X.Y (Z)`, where `X` represents goals and `Y` represents behinds. To convert this into total points:\n- Each goal is worth 6 points.\n- Each behind is worth 1 point.\n\nNow, let's calculate the away team scores for each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Away Team: Richmond\n   - Score: 13.7 (85)\n     - Calculation: \\(13 \\times 6 + 7 = 78 + 7 = 85\\)\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Away Team: South Melbourne\n   - Score: 10.23 (83)\n     - Calculation: \\(10 \\times 6 + 23 = 60 + 23 = 83\\)\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Away Team: North Melbourne\n   - Score: 14.8 (92)\n     - Calculation: \\(14 \\times 6 + 8 = 84 + 8 = 92\\)\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Away Team: Hawthorn\n   - Score: 9.9 (63)\n     - Calculation: \\(9 \\times 6 + 9 = 54 + 9 = 63\\)\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Away Team: Fitzroy\n   - Score: 11.11 (77)\n     - Calculation: \\(11 \\times 6 + 11 = 66 + 11 = 77\\)\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Away Team: Essendon\n   - Score: 23.18 (156)\n     - Calculation: \\(23 \\times 6 + 18 = 138 + 18 = 156\\)\n\nNext, we determine which scores are greater than 10 points:\n\n- Row 0: Richmond's score is 85 (greater than 10).\n- Row 1: South Melbourne's score is 83 (greater than 10).\n- Row 2: North Melbourne's score is 92 (greater than 10).\n- Row 3: Hawthorn's score is 63 (greater than 10).\n- Row 4: Fitzroy's score is 77 (greater than 10).\n- Row 5: Essendon's score is 156 (greater than 10).\n\nAll the away teams listed have scores greater than 10 points. Therefore, there are more than two away teams with scores higher than 10 points.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"a total of 2 away teams have an away team score that is higher than 10.00 points\" is FALSE because all six away teams exceed the specified score threshold.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those in the \"away team score\" column across all rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
