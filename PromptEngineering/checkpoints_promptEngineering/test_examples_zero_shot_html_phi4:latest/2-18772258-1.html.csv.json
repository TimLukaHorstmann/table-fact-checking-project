The player's name is \"Benito Cheng.\"\n2. The player's pick number should be 5.\n\nTo verify this, let's identify and evaluate these specific points using the table:\n\n- **Player's Name**: Look for a row where the \"player\" column contains the name \"Benito Cheng.\" This will help us locate Benito Cheng in the table.\n  \n- **Pick Number**: Check the corresponding value in the \"pick\" column for that same row to see if it matches the number 5.\n\nBy examining the table:\n\n1. Locate the player \"Benito Cheng\":\n   - The name \"Benito Cheng\" is found in the fourth row (considering zero-based indexing, this is index 4).\n\n2. Verify the pick number:\n   - In the same row where \"player\" is \"Benito Cheng,\" check the value in the \"pick\" column.\n   - The \"pick\" for Benito Cheng is indeed listed as 5.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied (i.e., Benito Cheng's pick number is 5), the statement is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells that confirm this information are:\n- Row index 4, Column name \"player\" containing \"Benito Cheng\"\n- Row index 4, Column name \"pick\" containing the value 5\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the list of relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
