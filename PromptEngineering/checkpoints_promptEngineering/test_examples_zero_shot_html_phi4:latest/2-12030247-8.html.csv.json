The claim states that \"Hillary Clinton raised more money than Barack Obama by around 3 million.\"\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n1. **Identify Hillary Clinton's Money Raised:**\n   - Locate Hillary Clinton's row, which is the first row (index 0).\n   - Look at the column labeled \"money raised , 2q\" for her value.\n\n2. **Identify Barack Obama's Money Raised:**\n   - Locate Barack Obama's row, which is the second row (index 1).\n   - Check the same column (\"money raised , 2q\") for his value.\n\nNow let's examine these values:\n\n- Hillary Clinton's \"money raised , 2q\": 27,021,358\n- Barack Obama's \"money raised , 2q\": 33,120,440\n\nNext, calculate the difference in money raised between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 33,120,440 - 27,021,358 = 6,099,082 \\]\n\nThe claim states that Hillary Clinton raised \"more money than Barack Obama by around 3 million.\" However, from our calculation above, it is clear that Barack Obama actually raised significantly more money than Hillary Clinton, with a difference of approximately $6.1$ million.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.
