    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Adnan al Talyani played at the 1986 Gulf Cup only on April 7, 1986\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine the relevant entries related to the 1986 Gulf Cup.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**: \n   - We must locate matches within the table that are associated with the \"1986 gulf cup\".\n\n2. **Check Dates and Conditions**:\n   - For each entry under the \"1986 gulf cup\", verify if any match took place on April 7, 1986.\n   - Ensure no other entries for the 1986 Gulf Cup exist besides the one on April 7.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Row 7**: Date is March 24, 1986, and competition is \"1986 gulf cup\". This does not match April 7.\n  \n- **Row 8**: Date is April 2, 1986, and competition is \"1986 gulf cup\". This also does not match April 7.\n\n- **Row 9**: Date is April 7, 1986, and competition is \"1986 gulf cup\". This matches the date specified in the claim.\n\n- There are no further entries under the \"1986 gulf cup\" after row 9. Therefore, only one match took place on April 7, 1986, for this specific competition.\n\nBased on these observations:\n- Adnan al Talyani played during the 1986 Gulf Cup on only one date listed in the table: April 7, 1986.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided. \n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
