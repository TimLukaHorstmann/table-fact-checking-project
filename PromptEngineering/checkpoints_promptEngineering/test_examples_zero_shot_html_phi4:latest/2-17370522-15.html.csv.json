    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if all players listed in the table for the 2008-09 Manchester City FC season have a transfer fee associated with them. The claim specifies \"all player[s] have a transfer fee,\" so each entry under the \"transfer fee\" column must contain a value other than \"free\" or \"undisc.\"\n\nLet's examine each row in the \"transfer fee\" column:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Transfer Fee = 750000 (has a specific amount, not \"free\" or \"undisc\")\n2. **Row 1**: Transfer Fee = free\n3. **Row 2**: Transfer Fee = undisc\n4. **Row 3**: Transfer Fee = undisc\n5. **Row 4**: Transfer Fee = undisc\n6. **Row 5**: Transfer Fee = free\n\nWe can observe that rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have transfer fees listed as either \"free\" or \"undisc,\" which do not meet the condition of having a specific fee value.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false since not all players have a specified transfer fee. The relevant cells for this determination are in the \"transfer fee\" column, specifically rows where the transfer fee is either \"free\" or \"undisc.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"transfer fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
