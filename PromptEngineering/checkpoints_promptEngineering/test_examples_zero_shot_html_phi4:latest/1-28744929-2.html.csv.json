The head coach of Maryland is indeed Ralph Friedgen.\n2. Ralph Friedgen's tenure as head coach at Maryland is specified as 10 years.\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells in the table that correspond to these conditions:\n\n- **First Condition**: Check if \"Ralph Friedgen\" is listed under the \"head coach\" column for \"Maryland.\"\n  - The row for \"Maryland\" lists \"ralph friedgen\" in the \"head coach\" column, confirming he is indeed the head coach for Maryland.\n\n- **Second Condition**: Verify that the number of years Ralph Friedgen has been at Maryland is 10.\n  - In the same row for \"Maryland,\" under the \"years at school\" column, it states \"10,\" indicating his tenure as head coach is 10 years.\n\nThus, both conditions are satisfied by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, we will identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The row index for Maryland is 5 (considering zero-based indexing).\n- Relevant columns are \"team\" to confirm it's Maryland, \"head coach\" to verify Ralph Friedgen, and \"years at school\" to check his tenure.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years at school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
