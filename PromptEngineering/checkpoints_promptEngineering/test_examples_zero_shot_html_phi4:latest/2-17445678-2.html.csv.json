    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each part of it against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **The match must be a 2-round match:**\n   - We will look for records where `round` equals \"2\".\n\n2. **It must take place in South Dakota, United States:**\n   - The location should exactly match \"south dakota , united states\".\n\n3. **The opponent's name must be Brian Dunn:**\n   - This means the `opponent` column must have \"brian dunn\" as its value.\n\nLet's evaluate each row of the table to see if it matches all these conditions:\n\n- Row 0 (loss to Hank Weis): \n  - Round: 1, Location: South Dakota, Opponent: Hank Weis (Does not match)\n  \n- Row 1 (loss to Don Ortega):\n  - Round: 2, Location: Mexico, Opponent: Don Ortega (Does not match)\n\n- **Row 2 (win against Brian Dunn):**\n  - Round: 2, Location: South Dakota, United States, Opponent: Brian Dunn\n  - This row matches all the conditions of the claim.\n\n- Row 3 (win against Jeff Lindsay):\n  - Round: 3, Location: Colorado, United States, Opponent: Jeff Lindsay (Does not match)\n\n- Row 4 (win against Clint Rather):\n  - Round: 1, Location: Colorado, United States, Opponent: Clint Rather (Does not match)\n  \n- Row 5 (draw with CJ Fernandes):\n  - Round: 2, Location: Louisiana, United States, Opponent: CJ Fernandes (Does not match)\n\n- Row 6 (loss to Shonie Carter):\n  - Round: 2, Location: Louisiana, United States, Opponent: Shonie Carter (Does not match)\n  \n- The remaining rows do not need to be checked further as they do not meet the round condition or other aspects of the claim.\n\nOnly Row 2 matches all conditions provided in the claim.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Brian Dunn was the opponent of the match in South Dakota, United States, which had 3 rounds,\" we need to check three specific conditions using the table data:\n\n1. Identify if there is a record with Brian Dunn as the opponent.\n2. Verify if this match took place in South Dakota, United States.\n3. Confirm that the number of rounds for this match was 3.\n\nLet's analyze each condition based on the provided HTML table:\n\n1. **Brian Dunn as Opponent:**\n   - Look through the \"opponent\" column to find Brian Dunn. The row with index 12 has \"brian dunn\" listed in the opponent column.\n\n2. **Location: South Dakota, United States:**\n   - For the same row (index 12), check the \"location\" column. It lists \"south dakota , united states,\" which matches our requirement.\n\n3. **Number of Rounds: 3:**\n   - Finally, verify the number of rounds in the same row. The \"rounds\" is not explicitly labeled, but we can infer it from the \"round\" mentioned in the record as part of other entries or contextually from a similar structure; however, here it's important to note that Brian Dunn has only 2 recorded rounds (in column \"record\"), which contradicts our requirement of 3.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The opponent is indeed \"Brian Dunn.\"\n- The location matches \"South Dakota, United States.\"\n- However, the number of rounds does not match since it's listed as 2, not 3.\n\nSince all conditions must be met for the claim to be true and one condition (rounds) fails, the claim is false. Therefore, we will mark this with relevant cells that were checked:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
