    "resp": "To verify the claim \"on november 3, the oakland raider played in mile high stadium,\" we need to identify and examine the relevant entries from the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify the Date**: We first look for the row that corresponds to November 3. This is clearly identified by the \"date\" column:\n   - The entry for the date \"november 3\" is found in row index 7 (0-based indexing).\n\n2. **Check Opponent Name**: Next, we verify if the opponent on this date was indeed the Oakland Raiders. In row index 7, under the \"opponent\" column, it reads \"oakland raiders.\"\n\n3. **Verify Game Site**: Finally, we confirm whether the game site was Mile High Stadium. For the same row (index 7), the \"game site\" column indicates that the game took place at \"mile high stadium.\"\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the relevant entries in row index 7:\n\n- The date matches November 3.\n- The opponent is confirmed as Oakland Raiders.\n- The location of the game was Mile High Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.
