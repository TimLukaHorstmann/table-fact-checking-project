    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"mark mccumber have the most cut made with the open championship\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table, we need to analyze the relevant data in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions two key points:\n1. Mark McCumber has the most cuts made.\n2. This achievement relates to The Open Championship.\n\nFrom these, we deduce that we need to compare the \"cuts made\" column across all tournaments listed to see if \"The Open Championship\" indeed has the highest number of cuts made.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"cuts made\" column.\n   - The relevant row for each tournament will be identified by its name.\n\n2. **Extract and Compare Values:**\n   - Look at the values in the \"cuts made\" column for each tournament:\n     - Masters Tournament: 10 cuts made\n     - US Open: 9 cuts made\n     - The Open Championship: 5 cuts made\n     - PGA Championship: 9 cuts made\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum:**\n   - Compare these values to find out which tournament has the most cuts made:\n     - Masters Tournament has the highest number of cuts made (10).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Mark McCumber has the most cuts made with \"The Open Championship,\" but from our comparison, \"The Open Championship\" only has 5 cuts made.\n   - Therefore, this is not true as \"Masters Tournament\" has more cuts made (10).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE because \"The Open Championship\" does not have the most cuts made. The relevant cells for verifying this are those in the \"cuts made\" column for each tournament.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
