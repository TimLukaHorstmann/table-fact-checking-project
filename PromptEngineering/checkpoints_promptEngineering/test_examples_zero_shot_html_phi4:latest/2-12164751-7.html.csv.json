The claim states that \"Manchester United and Real Madrid have an equal value of 417 million.\" \n2. We need to focus on the \"Value\" column (labeled as \"Value(mil.)\" in the table) for both Manchester United and Real Madrid.\n3. In the first row, which corresponds to Manchester United, the value is listed as 208.\n4. In the second row, which corresponds to Real Madrid, the value is listed as 417.\n\nFrom these observations:\n- The value of Manchester United (row index 0) is 208 million.\n- The value of Real Madrid (row index 1) is 417 million.\n\nSince the values for Manchester United and Real Madrid are not equal, and neither matches the stated \"equal value of 417 million,\" we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output should reflect these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Value(mil.)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Value(mil.)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
