The \"construction completed\" date for the flowood site is September 17, 1993, which falls within the year 1993.\n\n### Analyzing the Newsom Brothers Entry:\n- **Row Index**: 4\n- **Construction Completed**: 08 / 08 / 1997\n\nThe \"construction completed\" date for newsom brothers is August 8, 1997. This does not fall within the year 1993.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the construction completion dates do not both fall in 1993 (the flowood site was completed in 1993 and newsom brothers in 1997), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n1. **Flowood Site Construction Completed**: \n   - Row Index: 3\n   - Column Name: \"construction completed\"\n\n2. **Newsom Brothers Construction Completed**:\n   - Row Index: 4\n   - Column Name: \"construction completed\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Potter Co in Copiah be the first project propose, but the last to be list,\" we need to examine two conditions:\n\n1. **First Proposed:** We must verify if \"Potter Co\" is the earliest date listed under the \"proposed\" column.\n2. **Last Listed:** We must check if \"Potter Co\" has the latest date (or non-existent) in the \"listed\" column.\n\nLet's analyze each condition step by step using the table:\n\n### Step 1: Check for First Proposed\nWe will look at the \"proposed\" dates for all entries and identify which one is earliest:\n\n- **Row Index 0:** `msd004006995` - 06 / 14 / 2001\n- **Row Index 1:** `msd008154486` - 06 / 23 / 1993\n- **Row Index 2:** `msd046497012` - 05 / 11 / 2000\n- **Row Index 3:** `msd980710941` - 09 / 08 / 1983\n- **Row Index 4:** `msd980840045` - 10 / 15 / 1984\n- **Row Index 5:** `msd065490930` - 03 / 08 / 2004\n- **Row Index 6:** `msd056029648` (Potter Co) - 05 / 10 / 1993\n- **Row Index 7:** `msd086556388` - 09 / 27 / 2006\n- **Row Index 8:** `msd980601736` - cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL\n\nThe earliest date is \"cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL\" from Row Index 8, so Potter Co in Copiah (Row Index 6) is not the first proposed.\n\n### Step 2: Check for Last Listed\nWe will examine the \"listed\" dates to find out if \"Potter Co\" has the latest date or no date at all:\n\n- **Row Index 0:** `msd004006995` - 09 / 13 / 2001\n- **Row Index 1:** `msd008154486` - No Date\n- **Row Index 2:** `msd046497012` - 07 / 27 / 2000\n- **Row Index 3:** `msd980710941` - 09 / 21 / 1984\n- **Row Index 4:** `msd980840045` - 06 / 10 / 1986\n- **Row Index 5:** `msd065490930` - 07 / 22 / 2004\n- **Row Index 6:** `msd056029648` (Potter Co) - No Date\n- **Row Index 7:** `msd086556388` - 03 / 07 / 2007\n- **Row Index 8:** `msd980601736` - cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL\n\nThe latest date is 03 / 07 / 2007 from Row Index 7, and Potter Co has no listed date. However, since there are other entries with no date at all or dates earlier than the latest listed one, having no date does not make it last listed.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince \"Potter Co\" is neither the first proposed nor the last listed based on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
