    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Olaf Kolzig won the game by decision in every game of the season except the November 6 game against Atlanta,\" we need to examine each row of the table and focus on the columns that mention both the 'decision' and the 'score'. \n\nThe relevant steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The \"decision\" column tells us who made the decision (presumably the goalkeeper, likely Kolzig in this context).\n   - The \"score\" column indicates which team won or lost each game. We need to interpret this score to see if Washington won.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Game**:\n   - For every row, check whether the 'decision' is \"kolzig\".\n   - Then, determine if Kolzig's team (Washington) won by comparing the scores in the \"score\" column.\n   - Specifically for the game on November 6 against Atlanta, confirm that this is an exception where Washington lost and Kolzig was still listed as making the decision.\n\n3. **Check All Rows**:\n   - For each row, if Kolzig made a decision but Washington did not win, it indicates whether that specific claim holds true.\n   \nLet's evaluate:\n\n- **November 1**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (0-2) to NY Rangers. Not relevant since the team did not win.\n- **November 2**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (3-2) to Philadelphia. Again, not a win for Washington.\n- **November 5**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (0-5) to Carolina. No victory here either.\n- **November 6**: Decision by Johnson, Washington lost (1-2) against Atlanta. This is the noted exception since it's mentioned in the claim and Kolzig wasn't making a decision.\n- **November 8**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington won (4-1) over Ottawa.\n- **November 10**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (5-2) to Tampa Bay. No win here.\n- **November 15**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (1-2) to Florida.\n- **November 16**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (2-5) to Tampa Bay.\n- **November 19**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (4-3) to Florida.\n- **November 21**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (5-1) to Atlanta.\n- **November 23**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington won (4-3) against Buffalo.\n- **November 24**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington won (2-5) against Buffalo.\n- **November 26**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (3-1) to Buffalo.\n- **November 28**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (2-1) to Florida.\n- **November 30**: Decision by Kolzig, Washington lost (3-4) to Carolina.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- In every game except November 6 where Johnson was the decision-maker, Kolzig made a decision. Washington won only on November 8 and November 24 when Kolzig made a decision.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not accurate as stated because there are several games other than November 6 where Kolzig's team did not win despite his making the decision. The assertion that Kolzig \"won\" by decision in every game except one isn't true for all entries listed.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify all entries where the home team is \"Philadelphia.\"\n2. Check their attendance figures.\n3. Compare these figures with the attendance of all other games listed in the table to see if they are indeed the highest.\n\nFrom the provided HTML table, we extract the relevant data:\n\n- **Row 1:** Date - November 2; Visitor - Philadelphia; Attendance - 16055\n- Check for any row where \"Philadelphia\" is mentioned as a home team. The only match here (row index 1) indicates that Washington was the visitor and had an attendance of 16,055.\n\nNext, we need to examine all rows in the table to see if there's any game with higher attendance:\n\n- **Row 0:** Attendance - 18200\n- **Row 1:** Attendance - 16055 (Philadelphia as a visitor)\n- **Row 2:** Attendance - 12171\n- **Row 3:** Attendance - 15530\n- **Row 4:** Attendance - 19666\n- **Row 5:** Attendance - 14617\n- **Row 6:** Attendance - 12101\n- **Row 7:** Attendance - 19526\n- **Row 8:** Attendance - 13411\n- **Row 9:** Attendance - 11669\n- **Row 10:** Attendance - 19727 (Highest)\n- **Row 11:** Attendance - 13650\n- **Row 12:** Attendance - 11204\n- **Row 13:** Attendance - 10526\n- **Row 14:** Attendance - 16386\n\nUpon comparing the attendance figures, we find that:\n- The highest attendance recorded in this table is 19,727 (row index 11) for a game where Washington was the home team against Philadelphia. \n\nThus, the claim \"the game against Philadelphia have the highest attendance\" is false because although there were two games with Philadelphia involved as a visitor or home team, none had the highest attendance overall.\n\nRelevant cells to consider in this determination are:\n- Row 1 (Philadelphia as visitor)\n- All rows for comparison of attendance numbers\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim's veracity is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
