In this case, it shows \"2008\".\n\n#### Conclusion from Data:\n\n- Rebecca Tegg's activity period is only in 2008.\n- Therefore, she was not active in 2009, 2010, or 2011.\n\n### Verifying the Claim\n\nSince Rebecca Tegg's recorded activity does not include 2009, 2010, or 2011, the claim that she \"be not active\" during these years is correct.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Years Active\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to assess whether \"enza barilla\" and \"snez veljanovska\" have ended their active careers based on the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Enza Barilla**:\n   - Check the \"Yearly Activity Status\" column for Enza Barilla's row (row index 0).\n   - The status is \"Retired,\" which indicates that she is no longer actively participating.\n\n2. **Snez Veljanovska**:\n   - Check the \"Yearly Activity Status\" column for Snez Veljanovska's row (row index 24).\n   - The status is \"Active,\" indicating she is still currently active.\n\nSince the table shows that Enza Barilla is retired but Snez Veljanovska is active, the claim that both athletes are no longer active is incorrect. Therefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- For Enza Barilla:\n  - Row index: 0\n  - Column name: \"Yearly Activity Status\"\n\n- For Snez Veljanovska:\n  - Row index: 24\n  - Column name: \"Yearly Activity Status\"\n\nThus, we can construct the JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Yearly Activity Status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Yearly Activity Status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
