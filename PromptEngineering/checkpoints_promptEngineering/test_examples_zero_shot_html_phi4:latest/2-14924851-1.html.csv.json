No other team has earned fewer points than Bahia.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim that Bahia lost the greatest number of games is supported by the data.\n- The claim that Bahia earned the fewest points is also supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are verified to be true based on the table provided. \n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- For maximum \"Lost\" (24), all rows need comparison, but we specifically check row index 23 (Bahia) for maximum value.\n- For minimum \"Points\" (46), all rows need comparison, but we specifically check row index 23 (Bahia) for the minimum value.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the Team with the Greatest Number of Losses\n- We look at the \"Losses\" column for each row and find the maximum value.\n- The maximum number of losses is 24, which occurs at row index 23 (Fortaleza).\n\n#### 2. Identify the Team with the Fewest Points\n- We examine the \"Points\" column to find the minimum value.\n- The fewest points are 46, shared by several teams: Bahia (row index 23) and Fortaleza (row index 22).\n\n### Verification of Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"the Fortaleza team lost the greatest number of games and earned the fewest points.\"\n\n- **Greatest Number of Losses**: Verified as true. Fortaleza has 24 losses, which is the maximum in the table.\n- **Fewest Points**: This part of the claim is false because Fortaleza does not have the fewest points; it shares the lowest point total with Bahia.\n\nSince one condition (fewest points) is not met, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify both parts of the claim, we need to reference:\n- The \"Losses\" column for all rows.\n- The \"Points\" column for all rows.\n\nSpecifically, the relevant cells are:\n- Row index 23, column \"Losses\" (24 losses)\n- Row index 22 and 23, column \"Points\" (46 points)\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
