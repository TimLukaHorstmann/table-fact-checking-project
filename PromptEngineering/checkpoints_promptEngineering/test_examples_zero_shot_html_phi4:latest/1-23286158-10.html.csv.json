Arco Arena is not the Rose Garden; thus, this game was an away game.\n   - **Game 78 (April 7)**: \"location attendance\" is \"staples center 16790\". Staples Center is in Los Angeles, so this game was an away game for Portland.\n   - **Game 79 (April 9)**: \"location attendance\" is \"rose garden 20693\". This specifies the Rose Garden, indicating a home game for Portland.\n   - **Game 80 (April 11)**: \"location attendance\" is \"staples center 18997\". Staples Center is not in Portland, so this was an away game.\n   - **Game 81 (April 12)**: \"location attendance\" is \"rose garden 20691\". This indicates a home game for Portland.\n\n4. **Counting Away Games**: From the above analysis:\n   - Games 77, 78, and 80 were played at venues other than the Rose Garden, making them away games.\n   - Therefore, there are 3 away games out of the 5 listed.\n\nThe claim states that \"3 of the 5 game play by the portland between april 3 and april 12 , 2010 be away game\", which matches our finding of 3 away games.

Therefore, the claim that he was the high scorer in \"1 game\" is false because it actually happened twice.\n\n### Condition 2: High Rebounder\n\nWe check the \"high rebounds\" column to determine how many times Lamarcus Aldridge is mentioned as the high rebounder.\n\n- **Row 0 (Game 77):** Marcus Camby had 15 rebounds.\n- **Row 1 (Game 78):** Lamarcus Aldridge had 12 rebounds.\n- **Row 2 (Game 79):** Marcus Camby had 18 rebounds.\n- **Row 3 (Game 80):** Marcus Camby had 17 rebounds.\n- **Row 4 (Game 81):** Marcus Camby had 13 rebounds.\n\nLamarcus Aldridge was the high rebounder in one game: Game 78. Therefore, the claim that he was a high rebounder in \"zero games\" is false because it actually happened once.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are false based on the table data, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nFor verifying these claims, the relevant cells to check are:\n- \"high points\" column for Game 78 and Game 79.\n- \"high rebounds\" column for Game 78.\n\nHere's the list of relevant cells with their row indices and column names:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The team playing is the Portland Trail Blazers (which can be inferred from the 'team' column when it states \"sacramento\", \"la clippers\", etc., as these are games against those teams).\n2. Marcus Camby's presence as the high rebounder, indicated by his name in the \"high rebounds\" column.\n\nLet's analyze each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (Game 77)**\n  - Team: Sacramento (Portland played against Sacramento)\n  - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (15)\n\n- **Row 1 (Game 78)**\n  - Team: LA Clippers (Portland played against the Clippers)\n  - High Rebounds: Lamarcus Aldridge (12)\n\n- **Row 2 (Game 79)**\n  - Team: Dallas (Portland played against Dallas)\n  - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (18)\n\n- **Row 3 (Game 80)**\n  - Team: LA Lakers (Portland played against the Lakers)\n  - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (17)\n\n- **Row 4 (Game 81)**\n  - Team: Oklahoma City (Portland played against OKC)\n  - High Rebounds: Marcus Camby (13)\n\nFrom this analysis, Marcus Camby is listed as the high rebounder in games 77, 79, 80, and 81.

The relevant information for this task can be found in the \"team\" column (to identify if it's a game involving Portland) and the \"location attendance\" column (to confirm whether each game is a home or away game).\n\nHere's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Check if all games are played by Portland:**\n   - The claim involves games played by Portland, so we need to verify that in each row of the table within the specified date range, the \"team\" column indicates it was a game involving Portland.\n\n2. **Verify home games based on \"location attendance\":**\n   - For each game identified as being played by Portland, check if the location mentioned is one of their home arenas (i.e., \"arco arena\" or \"rose garden\").\n\nLet's verify this step-by-step for each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Date: April 3\n  - Team: Sacramento (This suggests a game against Sacramento, not necessarily by Portland)\n  - Location Attendance: Arco Arena (Portland's home arena)\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Date: April 7\n  - Team: LA Clippers (A game against the Clippers; check for Portland\u2019s player contributions)\n  - Location Attendance: Staples Center (Not a home game for Portland)\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Date: April 9\n  - Team: Dallas (A game against Dallas; check for Portland's player contributions)\n  - Location Attendance: Rose Garden (Portland's home arena)\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Date: April 11\n  - Team: LA Lakers (A game against the Lakers; check for Portland\u2019s player contributions)\n  - Location Attendance: Staples Center (Not a home game for Portland)\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Date: April 12\n  - Team: Oklahoma City (A game against Oklahoma City; check for Portland's player contributions)\n  - Location Attendance: Rose Garden (Portland's home arena)\n\nFor rows where the \"team\" indicates a game against another team, we need to ensure that players from Portland were involved in those games.
