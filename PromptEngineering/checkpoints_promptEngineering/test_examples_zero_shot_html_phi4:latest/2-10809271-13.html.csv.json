    "resp": "To verify the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team,\" we need to examine the table's relevant information. The claim involves two pieces of data: identifying Carlton as a team and checking if their venue is Princes Park.\n\n1. **Identify Carlton Team in Table**: \n   - We need to locate the row where \"Carlton\" appears in the column labeled \"home team.\" By examining each row:\n     - Row 0: Home team is Essendon.\n     - Row 1: Home team is Collingwood.\n     - Row 2: Home team is Carlton. This row matches our requirement.\n\n2. **Check Venue for Carlton**:\n   - In the same row (Row 2) where \"Carlton\" is identified as the home team, we need to verify if the venue listed is Princes Park.\n   - The column labeled \"venue\" in Row 2 shows \"princes park,\" which matches our claim.\n\nGiven these steps, both conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim include:\n- The cell where \"Carlton\" appears as the home team (Row 2, Column \"home team\").\n- The cell indicating the venue as Princes Park (Row 2, Column \"venue\").\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
