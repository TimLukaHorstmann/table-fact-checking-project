    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"la ronde be direct by roger vadim,\" we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. The original title is \"La Ronde.\"\n2. The director is Roger Vadim.\n\nLet's examine these conditions against the relevant rows in the provided table:\n\n- We start by searching for the row where the original title matches \"la ronde\" (case-insensitive comparison, as HTML often doesn't distinguish case differences within content).\n\n- Upon reviewing the table entries, we find that the entry with an original title of \"La Ronde\" is located at:\n  - **Row Index:** 12\n  - The relevant columns are \"Original Title\" and \"Director.\"\n\n- For the row at index 12:\n  - **Column: Original Title** has the value \"la ronde,\" which matches our condition.\n  - **Column: Director** has the value \"Roger Vadim,\" matching the second part of our claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by this row in the table. Therefore, the claim is supported fully by the data present in the table at row index 12.\n\nHere's the JSON output summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Original Title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Roger Vadim directed 'La Ronde' in 1966\", we need to check the relevant details from the table against each component of the claim.\n\n1. **Director**: The claim states Roger Vadim as the director.\n2. **Title (Original/English)**: The claim involves the film titled \"La Ronde\".\n3. **Year**: According to the claim, the year is 1966.\n\nLet's break down these components with respect to the table:\n\n- We look for a row where:\n  - The column \"director\" contains \"Roger Vadim\".\n  - Either the \"original_title\" or \"english_title\" contains \"La Ronde\".\n  - The \"year\" is 1966.\n\nUpon examining each row, we find:\n\n- **Row Index: 3**\n  - Column \"director\": Contains \"roger vadim\"\n  - Column \"original_title\": Contains \"la ronde\"\n  - Column \"year\": Contains \"1965\"\n\nThis matches the director and title but not the year. The actual year for Roger Vadim's direction of \"La Ronde\" is 1965, not 1966 as stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, because the year does not match, the claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The row with index 3 from columns \"director\", \"original_title\", and \"year\".\n\nHere's the resulting JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original_title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
