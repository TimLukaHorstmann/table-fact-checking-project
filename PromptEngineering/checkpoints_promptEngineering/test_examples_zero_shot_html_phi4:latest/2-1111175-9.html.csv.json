    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Magdalena Maleeva's tennis career is supported by the table data, let's analyze the necessary details:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- **Duration of Career:** The claim states a 12-year span from 1993 to 2005.\n- **Relevant Columns for Verification:**\n  - \"Year\": To check when her career events began and ended.\n  - \"Tournament\": Not directly needed unless it aids in confirming the timeline.\n  - \"Event Type\", \"Round\", \"Opponent\", \"Score\": Not necessary unless they provide indirect evidence of her career's start or end.\n\n### Verification Process:\n1. **Earliest Year:**\n   - Look for the first occurrence of a year in the table, which is 1993. This indicates the beginning of the recorded events.\n  \n2. **Latest Year:**\n   - Look for the last occurrence of a year, which is 2005. This marks the end of her recorded events.\n\n### Calculation:\n- The time span from 1993 to 2005 (inclusive) is indeed 13 years, but if we consider just the start and endpoint without including both years fully in counting (i.e., 1994 through 2004), it spans 11 full calendar years. However, the claim of a \"12-year span\" can include both starting and ending points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Supported by Table Data:** The data shows events from 1993 to 2005, which supports a career spanning these years.\n  \nThus, based on the table information, the claim is supported as it accurately reflects her active years according to the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
