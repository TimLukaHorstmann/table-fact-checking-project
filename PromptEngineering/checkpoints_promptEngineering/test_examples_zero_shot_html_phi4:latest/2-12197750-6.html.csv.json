From the table:\n   - Row 0: Area is not Manawatu.\n   - Rows where Area = Manawatu are relevant for checking Years = '9 - 13' or '1 - 13'.\n\n2. Schools in Manawatu offering up to year 13:\n   - **Row 10**: \"tararua college\" offers '9 - 13'.\n   - **Row 14**: \"tkkm o tamaki nui a rua\" offers '1 - 13'.\n   - **Row 15**: \"totara college of accelerated learning\" offers '1 - 13'.\n\n3.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"5 schools be located in the Norsewood area,\" we need to evaluate the entries under the \"Area\" column in the provided table and count how many times \"Norsewood\" is mentioned.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant cell:\n\n1. The \"Area\" column indicates where each school is located.\n2. We will scan through all rows for entries that mention \"Norsewood.\"\n\nHere are the observations from the table:\n\n- **Row 12**: Area = Norsewood (Pangaroa School, which is not Norsewood)\n- **Row 13**: Area = Norsewood (Norsewood School)\n- **Row 14**: Area = Pahiatua\n- **Row 15**: Area = Woodville\n- **Row 16**: Area = Dannevirke\n- **Row 17**: Area = Norsewood (Norsewood Ruahine School)\n- **Row 18**: Area = Pahiatua\n- **Row 19**: Area = Pahiatua\n- **Row 20**: Area = Woodville\n- **Row 21**: Area = Dannevirke\n- **Row 22**: Area = Norsewood (Norsewood TKKM)\n- **Row 23**: Area = Dannevirke\n- **Row 24**: Area = Dannevirke\n\nFrom this analysis, the schools located in \"Norsewood\" are in rows:\n\n- Row 13: Norsewood School\n- Row 17: Ruahine School\n- Row 22: TKKM O Tamaki Nui a Rua\n\nOnly three schools are located in the Norsewood area, not five as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is false. The relevant cells for verifying this are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
