This matches the first condition of the claim.\n\n2. **Opponent Verification:**\n   - The claim mentions \"louisville\" as the opponent.\n   - In the corresponding row (where date is November 14), the 'opponent' column contains \"louisville\". Thus, this part of the claim is also verified.\n\n3. **Venue Verification:**\n   - The venue stated in the claim is \"dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc\".\n   - In the same row for November 14, the 'site' column specifies \"dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc\". This confirms the venue part of the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim (date, opponent, and venue) are verified by the data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.
