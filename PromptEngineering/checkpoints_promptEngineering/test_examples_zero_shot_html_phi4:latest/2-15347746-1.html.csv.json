    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about Andre Fluellen being drafted as a defensive tackle in round 3, let's carefully evaluate each part of the claim against the provided table.\n\n1. **Player Name:**\n   - The claim specifies \"andre fluellen\". In the table, there is an entry with \"player\" value \"andre fluellen\".\n\n2. **Position:**\n   - The claim states that he was drafted as a \"defensive tackle\". According to the table, in the same row where Andre Fluellen's name appears, the \"position\" column has the value \"defensive tackle\".\n\n3. **Round:**\n   - The claim mentions \"round 3\". In the row corresponding to Andre Fluellen, the \"round\" column is indeed set to 3.\n\nThe table confirms that all parts of the claim are correct for Andre Fluellen:\n\n- He was drafted in round 3.\n- His position at the time of the draft was defensive tackle.\n- The player's name matches exactly as stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE. \n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. We need to capture information about the row where Andre Fluellen appears:\n\n- Row index for Andre Fluellen is 3 (considering zero-based indexing).\n- The relevant columns are \"round\", \"position\", and \"player\".\n\nHere is the JSON response with these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to check if there is a player from Central Florida taken in round 3, and whether this is indeed the earliest round such a player is picked according to the table.\n\n1. **Identify Players from Central Florida**: We scan through the \"team\" column for any entry that matches \"central florida.\"\n\n2. **Determine the Round of Pick for Such Players**:\n   - We identify that Kevin Smith, listed as a running back, is associated with Central Florida.\n   - According to the table, Kevin Smith is picked in round 3.\n\n3. **Check for Earlier Rounds for Central Florida Players**: \n   - The table needs to be examined to see if there are any entries where players from Central Florida were picked in rounds earlier than 3.\n   - Upon reviewing all rows, no player from Central Florida appears before round 3.\n\nThus, the claim that \"round 3 be the earliest round for a player to be take from central florida\" is supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion are:\n- The cell with Kevin Smith's information, which provides evidence of a pick in round 3.\n- A comprehensive check across all rows confirms no earlier picks from Central Florida.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
