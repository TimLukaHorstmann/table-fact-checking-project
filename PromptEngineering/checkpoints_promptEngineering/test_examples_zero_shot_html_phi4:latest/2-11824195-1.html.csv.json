    "resp": "To verify the claim \"33057 crowd attend the week 6 game,\" we need to check two conditions against the table:\n\n1. The attendance for week 6 is indeed 33,057.\n2. Week 6 corresponds to the date and opponent mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions:\n\n- **Week Condition**: According to the table, week 6 is listed as having an \"attendance\" of 33,057. This matches the number given in the claim.\n\n- **Game Details for Week 6**: The table shows that the game in week 6 was against the \"oakland raiders,\" and the result was a loss with a score of 34 - 13. While these details are not directly mentioned in the claim, they confirm the context of the attendance figure.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- The cell containing the \"attendance\" for week 6.\n- The cell containing the \"week\" number to ensure it is indeed week 6.\n\nNow, let's identify the specific rows and columns from the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: Week 6 corresponds to row index 5 (since indexing starts at 0).\n- **Column Names**:\n  - \"attendance\" for the attendance figure.\n  - \"week\" to confirm it is week 6.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row index 5, column name \"attendance\".\n2. Row index 5, column name \"week\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the row corresponding to Week 6 in the table.\n2. Check the \"attendance\" column for that row to see if it matches the claimed attendance figure of 33,007.\n\nBy reviewing the table:\n\n- The row with `week` equal to 6 is:\n  - Date: October 16, 1966\n  - Opponent: Oakland Raiders\n  - Result: L 34 - 13\n  - Attendance: 33,057\n\nThe attendance figure for Week 6's game is listed as 33,057, not 33,007.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.
