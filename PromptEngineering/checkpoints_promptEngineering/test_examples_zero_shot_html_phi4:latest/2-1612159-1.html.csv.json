From the table, this corresponds to the row with index 15.\n\n- **Check Position (pos)**:\n  - In row 15, under the column \"pos\", we find the value is indeed \"13\".\n\n- **Check Head Coach**:\n  - In the same row (index 15), under the column \"head coach\", the entry is \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\".\n  - The names mentioned in the claim are all present in this cell, confirming that they were indeed the head coaches for that season.\n\nSince both conditions specified in the claim (position and head coach) match exactly with the data from the table, we conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row Index**: 15\n- **Column Names**:\n  - \"pos\" to verify the position.\n  - \"head coach\" to confirm the coaches listed.\n\nGiven these observations, here's the JSON response as required:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The position finish for that season should be 13th.\n\nLet's examine each condition against the relevant row in the table, which corresponds to the season \"2011 - 12.\"\n\n**Relevant Row:**\n\n- **Season**: 2011 - 12\n- **Division (div)**: 1st\n- **Position (pos)**: 13\n- **Top Scorer**: adamov - 11\n- **Head Coach**: protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\n\n**Verification of Conditions:**\n\n1. The \"head coach\" column for the season \"2011 - 12\" is listed as \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny.\" This matches exactly with the claim.\n2. The \"pos\" column (position finish) for the same season shows a value of 13, which also aligns with the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied according to the data in the table, thus supporting the claim fully.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- For the position: Row index 15 (\"2011 - 12\"), \"pos\" column.\n- For the head coach: Row index 15 (\"2011 - 12\"), \"head coach\" column.\n\nThe JSON object with our findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Lowest Position Claim**: The claim states that the \"2011 - 12 season lead to the lowest position\". We must check if the position ('pos' column) for this season is indeed the lowest among all listed seasons.\n\n2. **Head Coach Claim**: It asserts that the head coach for the \"2011 - 12\" season was \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\". We need to check if this matches the data in the 'head coach' column for this row.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n- **Lowest Position Check**: \n  - The table lists positions from various seasons. For each season, we extract the position number:\n    - 1992: 8\n    - 1993: 17\n    - 1994: 2\n    - 1995: 14\n    - 1996: 11\n    - 1997: 13\n    - 1998: 6\n    - 1999: 7\n    - 2000: 12\n    - 2001: 12\n    - 2002: 11\n    - 2003: 11\n    - 2004: 12\n    - 2005: 13\n    - 2006: 12\n    - 2007: 16 (This is the lowest position)\n    - 2008: 1\n    - 2009: 14\n    - 2010: 9\n    - 2011-12: 13\n    - 2012-13: 13\n\n  From this, it's clear that the \"2007\" season has the lowest position at rank 16. Thus, the claim about the \"2011-12\" season having the lowest position is false.\n\n- **Head Coach Check**: \n  - For the \"2011 - 12\" season, the head coach listed in the table is \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\". This matches exactly with what's claimed. Therefore, this part of the claim is true.\n\nSince one condition of the claim (lowest position) is false, the entire claim is deemed false. The relevant cells to verify these conditions are for the \"2011 - 12\" season and the lowest ranked position (2007).\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For checking the head coach in \"2011 - 12\": Row index 16, Column 'head coach'.\n- For confirming it's not the lowest position: Compare row indices of all positions; the relevant cell for the actual lowest is Row index 15, Column 'pos'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
