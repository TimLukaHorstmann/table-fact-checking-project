Therefore, the claim is supported by the table information.\n\nWe now construct a JSON object with the result and list the relevant cells from the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
