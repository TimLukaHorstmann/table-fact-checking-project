    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check if Brian Rafuse's points for (pf) is indeed 60 in the provided table. Here's how we can systematically verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - The claim involves \"Brian Rafuse\" and his \"points for\" value.\n   - From the table, locate the row corresponding to Brian Rafuse.\n\n2. **Locate Row and Column:**\n   - Scan through each row under the 'locale' column until we find \"nova scotia\", which is associated with Brian Rafuse.\n   - Once identified, check the 'pf' (points for) value in this specific row.\n\n3. **Verification Process:**\n   - Find the row where 'locale' is \"nova scotia\".\n   - Check the value under the 'pf' column for this row to see if it matches 60 as claimed.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells Extraction:**\n   - Note the index of the row and the specific column (pf) that needs verification.\n   - In zero-based indexing, count from the first data row in the table:\n     - \"alberta\" is at index 0,\n     - \"saskatchewan\" is at index 1,\n     - ...\n     - \"nova scotia\" is at index 10.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The relevant cell for verifying the claim has 'locale' as \"nova scotia\" and 'pf' as 60.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"brian rafuse 's pf be 60\" is TRUE.\n\n6. **JSON Representation of the Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pf\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON response indicates that the claim is true and provides the relevant cell used to verify this information.",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table and check for instances where the \"stolen ends\" column equals 5. For those rows, we then verify if the \"pa\" (points allowed) column is equal to 86.\n\nThe relevant columns from the table are:\n- \"stolen ends\"\n- \"pa\"\n\nNow let's go through each row in the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: stolen ends = 11\n2. **Row 1**: stolen ends = 12\n3. **Row 2**: stolen ends = 22\n4. **Row 3**: stolen ends = 11\n5. **Row 4**: stolen ends = 14\n6. **Row 5**: stolen ends = 19\n7. **Row 6**: stolen ends = 15\n8. **Row 7**: stolen ends = 6\n9. **Row 8**: stolen ends = 7\n10. **Row 9**: stolen ends = 3\n11. **Row 10**: stolen ends = 5\n\nIn Row 10, we find that \"stolen ends\" is equal to 5. For this row:\n- \"pa\" (points allowed) = 86\n\nThis matches the condition specified in the claim.\n\nThere are no other rows where \"stolen ends\" equals 5.\n\nSince there is exactly one occurrence of \"stolen ends\" being 5, and for that occurrence, \"pa\" is indeed 86, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"stolen ends\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pa\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kevin Martin's pf be 89\" is true or false, we need to verify two specific aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Player Name Verification**: Identify if Kevin Martin is associated with a particular locale in the table.\n2. **Points For (pf) Value Check**: Verify that for this row, the value under the \"pf\" column is 89.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the provided HTML table:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Locate Kevin Martin in the Table**:\n   - The table includes a column named \"skip,\" which lists player names.\n   - We need to find the row where \"Kevin Martin\" appears under this column.\n\n2. **Check the Points For (pf) Value**:\n   - Once we have identified Kevin Martin's row, examine the value in the \"pf\" column for that particular row.\n   - According to the claim, this value should be 89.\n\n### Verification\n\n- In the first row of the table:\n  - The \"skip\" column has \"kevin martin,\" indicating this is the correct row related to Kevin Martin.\n  - The \"pf\" (Points For) column in the same row lists a value of **86**.\n\nThus, according to the data provided in the table, Kevin Martin's \"pf\" value is not 89; it is actually 86. Therefore, the claim that Kevin Martin's \"pf be 89\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- The relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n  - The cell where Kevin Martin is listed under the \"skip\" column.\n  - The cell in the same row under the \"pf\" column.\n\nIn terms of indexing from zero, these correspond to:\n- Row index: 0 (since HTML tables typically start indexing rows from 1 but Python lists from 0)\n- Column names: \"skip\" and \"pf\"\n\n### JSON Output\n\nHere's the correct JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"skip\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pf\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
