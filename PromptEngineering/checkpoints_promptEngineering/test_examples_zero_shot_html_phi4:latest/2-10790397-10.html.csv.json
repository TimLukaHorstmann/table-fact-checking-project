South Melbourne vs. Melbourne: 10,000\n2. Hawthorn vs. Collingwood: 10,000\n\nBoth games have a crowd size of 10,000, which are indeed the two smallest crowds.\n\nThe claim states that the game between South Melbourne and Melbourne was one of these two with the smallest crowd.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim provided, let's break down each component of the statement and verify it against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Round Number**: The claim mentions \"round 10,\" but the table does not specify round numbers for the matches listed. There is no direct reference to rounds in the table.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**: \n   - The claim states that Richmond played against St Kilda.\n   - From the table, we see in row 0: Richmond as the home team and St Kilda as the away team.\n\n3. **Outcome of the Match**:\n   - The claim asserts that Richmond beat St Kilda by a margin of \"7.34 (54) points.\"\n   - In terms of points scored:\n     - Richmond's score is \"16.14 (110)\" which translates to 16 goals and 14 behinds, equaling 110 points.\n     - St Kilda's score is \"8.8 (56),\" translating to 8 goals and 8 behinds, equaling 56 points.\n   - The point difference between Richmond and St Kilda is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     110 \\text{ points} - 56 \\text{ points} = 54 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n   - To express this in terms of goals (G) and behinds (B), note that a goal equals 6 points. The difference can be broken down into:\n     \\[\n     7 \\text{ goals } (42 \\text{ points}) + 2 \\text{ behinds } (12 \\text{ points}) = 54 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Richmond beat St Kilda by \"7.34 (54) points.\"\n\n4. **Venue**:\n   - The claim states the match took place at Punt Road Oval.\n   - From row 0 in the table, we see that the venue is indeed listed as Punt Road Oval.\n\n5. **Date of the Match**: \n   - The claim does not specify a date, but all matches are on \"1 july 1933,\" which aligns with the match involving Richmond and St Kilda.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- All conditions in the claim regarding teams involved, score difference, venue, and date match with the information from row 0 of the table.\n- The only unsupported detail is the mention of \"round 10\" as no round numbers are provided in the table. However, since there's no direct contradiction to any fact within the table itself, the lack of round number does not invalidate the claim based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, the claim about the specific match details (teams, score difference, and venue) is entirely consistent with the information available from row 0.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Points can be calculated using the formula: \\( \\text{Total Points} = 6 \\times \\text{Goals} + 1 \\times \\text{Behinds} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Score Differences for Each Game:**\n   - For each game, calculate the absolute difference between the home team score and the away team score using their total points.\n\n3. **Compare Differences to Find Closest Game:**\n\nLet's compute these differences:\n\n- **Richmond vs St Kilda:**  \n  Richmond: 16.14 (110), St Kilda: 8.8 (56)  \n  Difference = |110 - 56| = 54\n\n- **Essendon vs North Melbourne:**  \n  Essendon: 9.21 (75), North Melbourne: 15.18 (108)  \n  Difference = |75 - 108| = 33\n\n- **South Melbourne vs Melbourne:**  \n  South Melbourne: 13.10 (88), Melbourne: 12.9 (81)  \n  Difference = |88 - 81| = 7\n\n- **Geelong vs Footscray:**  \n  Geelong: 11.16 (82), Footscray: 7.15 (57)  \n  Difference = |82 - 57| = 25\n\n- **Hawthorn vs Collingwood:**  \n  Hawthorn: 5.14 (44), Collingwood: 15.6 (96)  \n  Difference = |44 - 96| = 52\n\n- **Fitzroy vs Carlton:**  \n  Fitzroy: 5.19 (49), Carlton: 13.14 (92)  \n  Difference = |49 - 92| = 43\n\n4. **Determine the Closest Score:**\n   - The smallest difference is 7, which occurs in the game between South Melbourne and Melbourne.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"the south melbourne v melbourne game have the closest score in round 10.\" Based on our calculations, this game indeed has the closest score among all listed games.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate which game in the table had the second closest score difference on 1 July 1933.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Extract Scores:**\n   - Convert each team's scores from the format \"X.Y (Z)\" where X and Y are whole numbers representing goals and behinds, respectively, into total points Z.\n   \n2. **Calculate Score Differences:**\n   - For each game, calculate the absolute difference between the home team score and the away team score.\n\n3. **Identify Closest Scores:**\n   - Rank these differences to find which games had the closest scores.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Check if the \"south melbourne v melbourne\" game has the second smallest score difference.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- **Richmond vs St Kilda:**  \n  - Score Difference = |110 - 56| = 54\n\n- **Essendon vs North Melbourne:**  \n  - Score Difference = |75 - 108| = 33\n\n- **South Melbourne vs Melbourne:**  \n  - Score Difference = |88 - 81| = 7\n\n- **Geelong vs Footscray:**  \n  - Score Difference = |82 - 57| = 25\n\n- **Hawthorn vs Collingwood:**  \n  - Score Difference = |44 - 96| = 52\n\n- **Fitzroy vs Carlton:**  \n  - Score Difference = |49 - 92| = 43\n\n### Sorted Differences:\n1.

Therefore, it does not have the smallest crowd.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is incorrect because \"windy hill\" does not have the smallest crowd.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For \"lake oval\":\n  - Row Index: 2\n  - Column Name: \"crowd\"\n\n- For \"windy hill\":\n  - Row Index: 1\n  - Column Name: \"crowd\"\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
