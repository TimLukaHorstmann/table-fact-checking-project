Our task is to focus on the relevant column and row that pertain to the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: \n   - The claim refers to \"week 1.\" Therefore, we need to look at the first row of data under the \"week\" column.\n\n2. **Check the attendance for week 1**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct row (row index 0), we need to examine the value in the \"attendance\" column for that specific row.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The cell at row index 0 and column name \"attendance\" should contain the number 62936, as stated in the claim.\n\nLet's verify these steps with the table data:\n\n- Row corresponding to week 1 (row index 0):\n  - \"week\": 1\n  - \"date\": 1970 - 09 - 19\n  - \"opponent\": chicago bears\n  - \"result\": l 24 - 16\n  - \"game site\": yankee stadium\n  - **\"attendance\": 62936**\n\nThe attendance value of 62936 matches the claim.
