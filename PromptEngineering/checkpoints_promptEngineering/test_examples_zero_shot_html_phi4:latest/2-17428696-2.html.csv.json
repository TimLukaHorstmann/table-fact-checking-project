    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check for a specific event in the table that meets all of these conditions:\n- The time duration is \"1:51\".\n- The number of rounds is 3.\n- The fighter's record at this point was \"2 - 0\".\n\nLet's examine the relevant data:\n\n1. **Time Duration (\"1:51\")**:\n   - This value appears in row 13 under the column \"Time\": \"ifc warriors challenge 14\" event where \"Brian Peterson\" had a KO with a duration of \"1:51\".\n\n2. **Number of Rounds (3)**:\n   - We need to find if there is an entry that specifies \"Rounds\" as 3 for this time duration.\n   - Row 13 does not specify rounds, but row 11 (\"UAGF 1: Ultimate Cage Fighting 1\") has \"Steve Hecht\" with \"2\" rounds, and row 5 (\"WEC 5\") has \"Jeff Bedard\" with \"1\" round. The only event with a specified duration of \"3\" rounds is the entry for \"Brian Peterson\" in Row 13.\n\n3. **Fighter's Record (\"2 - 0\")**:\n   - According to the record, this should be before the KO win over Brian Peterson.\n   - Row 13 shows \"Brian Peterson\" having a KO with a duration of \"1:51\". Before this event, according to row 12 (\"IFC Warriors Challenge 13\"), the fighter's record was updated to \"2 - 0\" after winning against Daniel Garlets.\n\nAfter verifying all conditions:\n- The match where Brian Peterson was defeated had a duration of \"1:51\", happened in Round 3, and it occurred after the fighter had a \"2 - 0\" record. Thus, this matches the claim perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Rounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
