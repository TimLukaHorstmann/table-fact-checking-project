    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim provided, we need to analyze the table data against each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Weeks and Attendance:**\n   - Week 14 (Row Index: 13):\n     - \"chicago bears\" as the opponent.\n     - Result is \"w 27 - 9\", which indicates a win.\n     - Attendance is 73,609.\n   \n   - Week 15 (Row Index: 14):\n     - \"oakland raiders\" as the opponent.\n     - Result is \"w 23 - 17\", indicating another win.\n     - Attendance is 73,572.\n\n2. **Verify Conditions of the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there should be a loss in both week 14 and week 15. However:\n     - Week 14 was a win (\"w 27 - 9\").\n     - Week 15 was also a win (\"w 23 - 17\").\n\n3. **Check Attendance Difference:**\n   - Even if the condition of losses had been met, we calculate the attendance difference:\n     - Week 15 Attendance: 73,572\n     - Week 14 Attendance: 73,609\n     - Difference = 73,609 - 73,572 = 37\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies both games should be losses; they were not.\n   - Therefore, regardless of the attendance difference being correct (37), the condition about losing is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, since the conditions regarding the outcomes of the games are false (they were wins, not losses), the entire claim does not hold true. Thus, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells needed to verify this are those containing the attendance and result for both Week 14 and Week 15:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
