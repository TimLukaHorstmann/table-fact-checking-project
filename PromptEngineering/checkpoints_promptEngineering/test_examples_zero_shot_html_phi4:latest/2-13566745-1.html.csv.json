    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two conditions based on the provided table:\n\n1. **The team playing in the \"lj\u00f3nagryfjan\" arena is coached by \"P\u00e1lmi \u00fe\u00f3r s\u00e6varsson\".**\n2. **This team is called \"skallagr\u00edmur\".**\n\nLet's examine each condition using relevant cells from the table:\n\n### Condition 1: Team in \"lj\u00f3nagryfjan\" Arena and Coach\n\n- **Arena Column**: We need to find which team plays at the \"lj\u00f3nagryfjan\" arena.\n  - From the table, under the \"arena\" column, we see that \"Njar\u00f0v\u00edk\" plays at \"lj\u00f3nagryfjan\".\n\n- **Coach Column**: Next, verify if \"P\u00e1lmi \u00fe\u00f3r s\u00e6varsson\" is the head coach for this team.\n  - The corresponding row (row index 6) has \"einar j\u00f3hannsson\" as the coach of \"Njar\u00f0v\u00edk\", not \"P\u00e1lmi \u00fe\u00f3r s\u00e6varsson\".\n\n### Condition 2: Team Name\n\n- **Team Column**: We need to verify if the team playing at \"lj\u00f3nagryfjan\" is called \"skallagr\u00edmur\".\n  - As established, the team is \"Njar\u00f0v\u00edk\", not \"skallagr\u00edmur\".\n\nSince both conditions are not met (the coach and team name do not match those stated in the claim), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these conditions are:\n\n1. The cell for the arena (\"lj\u00f3nagryfjan\") which corresponds to the row index 6, column \"arena\".\n2. The cell for the coach of this team, also at row index 6, column \"head coach\".\n3. The cell for the team name in the same row (row index 6, column \"team\").\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"arena\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
