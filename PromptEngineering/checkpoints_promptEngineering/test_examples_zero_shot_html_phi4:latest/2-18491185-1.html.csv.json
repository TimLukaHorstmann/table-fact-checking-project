From the table, this is labeled as \"one\", which we assume matches the description of the \"first episode\".\n   - In the same row (row index 0), check the \"date\" column for the date \"7 / 02 / 08\".\n\n3. **Evaluation:**\n   - The first row has:\n     - `episode`: \"one\"\n     - `date`: \"7 / 02 / 08\"\n\nSince both conditions match, the claim is fully supported.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify if ESPN2 aired episode one on July 21, 2008. The relevant pieces of information from the table for this verification are:\n\n1. **Episode Name**: The claim specifies \"episode one,\" so we look at the `episode` column.\n2. **Date**: The claim states the date as \"7 / 21 / 08,\" so we need to check the `date` column.\n\nWe will evaluate each row in the table to see if both conditions (episode and date) match simultaneously:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Episode: \"one\"\n  - Date: \"7 / 02 / 08\"\n\n  The episode matches, but the date does not. Therefore, this row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Episode: \"two\"\n  - Date: \"7 / 21 / 08\"\n\n  The date matches, but the episode does not. Therefore, this row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Episode: \"three\"\n  - Date: \"7 / 31 / 08\"\n\n  Neither the episode nor the date matches. This row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Episode: \"four\"\n  - Date: \"8 / 05 / 08\"\n\n  Neither the episode nor the date matches. This row is not relevant.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Episode: \"five\"\n  - Date: \"8 / 05 / 08\"\n\n  Neither the episode nor the date matches. This row is not relevant.\n\nAfter evaluating all rows, there is no entry in the table where both the episode is \"one\" and the date is \"7 / 21 / 08.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row 0, `episode` column: to check if it matches \"one.\"\n- Row 0, `date` column: to see the actual date of episode one.\n- Row 1, `date` column: to confirm the date \"7 / 21 / 08\" is associated with a different episode.\n\nThus, the JSON object representing this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
