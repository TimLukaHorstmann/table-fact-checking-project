The claim states that Pacquiao had no defense for his titles \"50% of the time.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the data:\n\n1. **First Fight**: \n   - Title: WBC Flyweight (112), Lineal Flyweight (112)\n   - Date: 1998-12-04\n   - Defenses: 1\n\n2. **Second Fight**:\n   - Title: IBF Super Bantamweight (122)\n   - Date: 2001-06-23\n   - Defenses: 4\n\n3. **Third Fight**:\n   - Title: The Ring Featherweight (126)\n   - Date: 2003-11-15\n   - Defenses: 2\n\n4. **Fourth and Fifth Fights**:\n   - Titles: WBC Super Featherweight (130), The Ring Junior Lightweight (130)\n   - Date: 2008-03-15\n   - Defenses: 0 for both titles\n\n5. **Sixth Fight**:\n   - Title: WBC Lightweight (135)\n   - Date: 2008-06-28\n   - Defenses: 0\n\n6. **Seventh Fight**:\n   - Title: The Ring Junior Welterweight (140)\n   - Date: 2009-05-02\n   - Defenses: 0\n\nNow, let's count the number of fights with no defenses and compare it to the total number of fights:\n\n- Total Fights: 7\n- Fights with 0 Defenses: 4 (Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh)\n\nTo find out if he lacked any defense \"50% of the time,\" we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Fights with 0 defenses}}{\\text{Total Fights}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 57.14\\% \\]\n\nSince 57.14% is greater than 50%, the claim that Pacquiao lacked any defense 50% of the time from 1998 to 2009 is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are those containing the \"defenses\" information:\n\n- Row Index 0, Column: defenses\n- Row Index 1, Column: defenses\n- Row Index 2, Column: defenses\n- Row Index 3, Column: defenses\n- Row Index 4, Column: defenses\n- Row Index 5, Column: defenses\n- Row Index 6, Column: defenses\n- Row Index 7, Column: defenses\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Manny Pacquiao had his first TKO in a winning bout in 2001,\" we need to examine the relevant information from the table:\n\n1. **Identify all TKO wins**: The column 'result' contains details of how each match concluded, including any TKOs (Technical Knockouts). We will look for rows where 'tko' appears.\n\n2. **Determine the date of these TKO wins**: The column 'date' provides the dates of each bout. We need to ensure that at least one TKO win occurred in 2001 or earlier, as this would potentially be Manny Pacquiao's first TKO win.\n\n3. **Confirm it was a winning bout**: A TKO result indicates a win unless otherwise noted (e.g., 'loss' or 'defeated'), so a 'tko' result confirms the match was won by Manny Pacquiao.\n\nLet's analyze each row to find relevant TKO wins:\n\n- Row 0: Result is 'ko 8 / 12', not a TKO.\n- Row 1: Result is 'ko 8 / 12', not a TKO.\n- **Row 2**: Result is 'tko 6 / 12' and date is '2001 - 06 - 23'. This is a TKO win in 2001, relevant to the claim.\n- Row 3: Result is 'tko 11 / 12', but it occurred after 2001 ('2003 - 11 - 15').\n- Rows 4 to 7: None of these rows have 'tko' results.\n\nThus, Manny Pacquiao's first TKO win indeed occurred in 2001 as per row 2.

Let's quickly check the number of wins for other years:\n\n- **1998**: \n  - Row 1: December 4, 1998 (win)\n  - Row 2: December 4, 1998 (win)\n\n- **2001**:\n  - Row 3: June 23, 2001 (win)\n\n- **2003**:\n  - Row 4: November 15, 2003 (win)\n\n- **2009**:\n  - Row 8: May 2, 2009 (win)\n\nComparing these results:\n\n- 1998: 2 wins\n- 2001: 1 win\n- 2003: 1 win\n- 2008: 3 wins\n- 2009: 1 win\n\nManny Pacquiao indeed won more bouts in 2008 than any other year listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Manny Pacquiao won more bouts in 2008\" is TRUE.

The term \"final scoring point\" typically refers to the outcome when a decision is made by judges, which is represented as \"SD\" (split draw), \"UD\" (unanimous decision), or \"MD\" (majority decision) followed by the scores for each judge.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows:\n\n1. **Row 9**: Manny Pacquiao vs. Ricky Hatton\n   - Result: KO 2 / 12\n\n2.

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"Manny Pacquiao won the most bouts in 2001,\" we need to analyze the data provided in the table for the year 2001 and compare it with other years.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We focus on the \"date\" column to extract the year of each bout.\n   - We then count how many bouts took place in each year where Manny Pacquiao emerged victorious (as indicated by results like \"ko\" or \"tko\").\n\n2. **Extract Year and Verify Victory:**\n   - For each row, check if the year is 2001 and if the result indicates a win for Pacquiao.\n   - The results that indicate a win are \"ko\" (knockout) and \"tko\" (technical knockout).\n\n3. **Count Victories in 2001:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 3: Date is 2001-06-23, Result is \"tko\", which indicates a victory.\n   - This row shows one victory for Manny Pacquiao in 2001.\n\n4. **Compare with Other Years:**\n   - Count victories in other years by applying the same criteria:\n     - 1998: Row 0 and Row 1 both show victories (\"ko\").\n     - 2003: Row 3 shows a victory (\"tko\").\n     - 2008: Rows 4, 5, and 6 all show victories (\"sd\" is considered a win in this context).\n     - 2009: Row 7 shows a victory (\"ko\").\n\n   - Count of victories:\n     - 1998: 2 victories\n     - 2001: 1 victory\n     - 2003: 1 victory\n     - 2008: 3 victories\n     - 2009: 1 victory\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Manny Pacquiao did not win the most bouts in 2001. The year with the most victories is 2008, where he won three bouts.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"Manny Pacquiao won the most bouts in 2001\" is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3: Contains the victory in 2001.\n- Rows from other years that show victories:\n  - Row 0 and Row 1 for 1998\n  - Row 3 for 2003\n  - Rows 4, 5, and 6 for 2008\n  - Row 7 for 2009\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Manny Pacquiao's biggest difference in score points during his bouts, we need to focus on the `result` column of the table. This column specifies how each bout concluded and provides information about the score when it was a split decision (`sd`), indicating differing scores between judges.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The key column here is `result`, as it contains the outcomes in terms of decisions and rounds, which can indicate the score point difference.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - For a result to have points, it must be a split decision (`sd`).\n   - Compare these results for their score differences if they exist.\n   \n3. **Extract Score Differences**:\n   - Split Decision Results:\n     - Manny Pacquiao vs Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez (Row 5 and 6): `sd 12 / 12`\n     - The split decision means at least two judges scored the bout differently, with one or more having a score difference of 2 points. However, exact scores aren't provided.\n   - No other rows indicate a split decision (`sd`).\n\n4. **Evaluate Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions the bout against Marco Antonio Barrera (Row 4) and implies it had the largest point difference.\n   - Row 4's result is `tko 11 / 12`, which means a technical knockout in round 11 of a scheduled 12 rounds, with no mention of a score difference as it wasn't decided by judges.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the bout against Marco Antonio Barrera resulted in a TKO and not a decision by scores, there is no score point difference to compare.\n   - Therefore, the claim that Manny Pacquiao had the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera is false because such a difference did not exist for this bout.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
