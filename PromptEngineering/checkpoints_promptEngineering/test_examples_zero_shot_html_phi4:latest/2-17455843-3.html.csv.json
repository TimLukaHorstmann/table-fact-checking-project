Identify the matches that ended in a tie (\"score\" column indicates a tie with an equal score).\n2. Check if those matches were replays.\n3. Determine which team won the replays and verify if it was the home team.\n\n### Relevant Data from Table:\n\n- **First Replay (Row Index 1):**\n  - Home Team: York City\n  - Score: 3 - 2\n  - Away Team: Nelson\n  - Date: 18 December 1930\n\n  Initial match details:\n  - Tie No: 1\n  - Home Team: Nelson\n  - Score: 1 - 1\n  - Away Team: York City\n  - Date: 13 December 1930\n  \n  **Verification for Replay 1:**\n  - The initial game ended in a tie (1 - 1).\n  - On replay, the home team was York City and they won with a score of 3 - 2.\n\n- **Second Replay (Row Index 15):**\n  - Home Team: Coventry City\n  - Score: 1 - 2\n  - Away Team: Exeter City\n  - Date: 18 December 1930\n\n  Initial match details:\n  - Tie No: 16\n  - Home Team: Exeter City\n  - Score: 1 - 1\n  - Away Team: Coventry City\n  - Date: 13 December 1930\n\n  **Verification for Replay 2:**\n  - The initial game ended in a tie (1 - 1).\n  - On replay, the home team was Coventry City but they lost with a score of 1 - 2. Exeter City won.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFor the claim to be true:\n- Both replays should have been won by the home teams.\n- The first replay was won by the home team (York City).\n- The second replay was not won by the home team (Coventry City lost).\n\nThus, the claim is false because in one of the replays, the away team (Exeter City) won.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n1. Initial match and replay details for Nelson vs York City.\n2.

We need to locate this particular matchup within the table.\n\n2. **Extract the Score of the Match**: Once we find the relevant row, extract the score to determine how many goals each team scored in that match.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Margin of Victory**: The claim indicates that Crystal Palace's victory was by a margin of 6 goals over Newark Town. We need to calculate this goal difference from the extracted scores and check if it matches what is claimed.\n\n4. **Compare with Other Matches**: To ensure that this game indeed represents the most overwhelming defeat on that day, we must compare its scoreline (margin) against other games played on the same date.\n\nLet's perform these checks:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Game**:\n   - The table lists several matches played on 13 December 1930. We need to find the row with Crystal Palace as the home team playing against Newark Town.\n   - From the table, we find that Row 15 corresponds to \"crystal palace\" vs. \"newark town.\"\n\n2. **Extract the Score of the Match**:\n   - In Row 15, the score is listed as \"6 - 0.\" This means Crystal Palace scored 6 goals and Newark Town scored 0 goals.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Margin of Victory**:\n   - The goal difference in this match is calculated as \\(6 - 0 = 6\\). Therefore, Crystal Palace won by exactly 6 goals over Newark Town.\n   - This aligns with what the claim states regarding the margin of victory.\n\n4. **Compare with Other Matches**:\n   - We need to ensure that no other match on this date had a larger goal difference than 6-0.\n   - By examining each game's score from Rows 1, 2 (replay), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 (replay), and 17:\n     - None of these matches have a goal difference greater than 6.\n   - For example, other notable scorelines include \"4-0\" (Row 3: walsall vs. newport county) and \"4-2\" (Rows 13 and 14). However, none exceed the 6-goal margin seen in Row 15.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the claim is fully supported by the data provided in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Away Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}, // Checking the replay date for thoroughness\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"} // Other matches on the same day\n  ]\n}\n```",

Since we can't have half a match, exactly half would mean 8 or 9 wins.\n   - Check if the home team won exactly 8 or 9 matches.\n\n6. **Detailed Evaluation**:\n   - Row 1: Nelson (1) vs York City (1) \u2192 Draw\n   - Row 2: Replay, not counted in original matches\n   - Row 3: Watford (3) vs Luton Town (1) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 4: Walsall (4) vs Newport County (0) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 5: Crewe Alexandra (2) vs Queens Park Rangers (4) \u2192 Away win\n   - Row 6: Gainsborough Trinity (0) vs Southport (4) \u2192 Away win\n   - Row 7: Scarborough (6) vs Lincoln City (4) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 8: Doncaster Rovers (0) vs Notts County (1) \u2192 Away win\n   - Row 9: Wellington Town (2) vs Wrexham (4) \u2192 Away win\n   - Row 10: Fulham (4) vs Halifax Town (0) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 11: Accrington Stanley (0) vs Torquay United (1) \u2192 Away win\n   - Row 12: Brentford (1) vs Norwich City (0) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 13: Bristol Rovers (4) vs Stockport County (2) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 14: Carlisle United (4) vs Tunbridge Wells Rangers (2) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 15: Crystal Palace (6) vs Newark Town (0) \u2192 Home win\n   - Row 16: Exeter City (1) vs Coventry City (1) \u2192 Draw\n   - Row 17: Replay, not counted in original matches\n\n7. **Count the Wins**:\n   - Total home wins = 8 (Rows 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15)\n\nSince there are exactly 8 home wins out of 17 matches, this does not equal half (which would require 8.5 or rounded to either 8 or 9).

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the table provided and check for matches that required a replay due to a tie, as well as verify if those replays were played in the same city as the original match.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Ties:**\n   - From the table, look at the \"score\" column to find any matches that ended in a tie (e.g., \"1 - 1\").\n   - We have two such instances:\n     - Row 1: \"nelson\" vs \"york city\", score \"1 - 1\"\n     - Row 16: \"exeter city\" vs \"coventry city\", score \"1 - 1\"\n\n2. **Check for Replays:**\n   - After identifying tied matches, look at the subsequent rows to find replays.\n   - For row 1 (Tie between \"nelson\" and \"york city\"), there is a replay in row 2.\n   - For row 16 (Tie between \"exeter city\" and \"coventry city\"), there is a replay in row 17.\n\n3. **Verify Replay Locations:**\n   - Check if the replays were played in the same city as the original match by comparing the \"home team\" of both the tie and its corresponding replay.\n   - For row 1 and row 2:\n     - Original match (row 1): Home team is \"nelson\".\n     - Replay (row 2): Home team is \"york city\". The cities are different, indicating the replay was not in the same city as the original match.\n   - For row 16 and row 17:\n     - Original match (row 16): Home team is \"exeter city\".\n     - Replay (row 17): Home team is \"coventry city\". Again, the cities are different.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that in the only match that had to be replayed due to a tie, it was played in the same city as the first game. However, both replays occurred in different cities than their respective original matches. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Rows 1 and 2 for the \"nelson\" vs \"york city\" match.\n- Rows 16 and 17 for the \"exeter city\" vs \"coventry city\" match.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
