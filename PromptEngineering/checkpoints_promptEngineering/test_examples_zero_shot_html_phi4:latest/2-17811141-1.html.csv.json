    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"only 3 of all the driver be note as be present for all round\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to identify drivers who are noted as being present for all rounds. The relevant column for this determination is the one containing information about which rounds each driver participates in.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column to check is \"Round Participation\", which lists the specific rounds a driver participates in.\n\n2. **Understand the Criteria for \"All Rounds\":**\n   - For this context, let's assume there are 9 rounds total (as indicated by some drivers participating up to round 9).\n   - A driver noted as present for all rounds would have their participation listed as \"all\" or \"1-9\".\n\n3. **Scan the Table:**\n   - We need to go through each row and check if a driver is marked as being present for all rounds.\n\n4. **Count the Drivers Noted for All Rounds:**\n   - As we scan, we count how many drivers meet the criteria of participating in all 9 rounds.\n\n### Relevant Rows Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1:** \"all\" (Driver noted for all rounds)\n- **Row 2:** \"all\" (Driver noted for all rounds)\n- **Row 7:** \"all\" (Driver noted for all rounds)\n- **Rows 8, 15, and 21-25:** These rows indicate specific ranges but not all 9 rounds.\n- **Other Rows:** Either specific round numbers or do not cover all 9 rounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the analysis above, three drivers are indeed marked as present for all rounds (rows 1, 2, and 7). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Round Participation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Round Participation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Round Participation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object indicates that the claim is true and lists the relevant cells used to verify it.",
