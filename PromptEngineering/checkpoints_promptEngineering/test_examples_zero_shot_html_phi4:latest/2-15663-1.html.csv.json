Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index 5, column \"live births\" (value: 43,243)\n- Row index 5, column \"migration\" (value: -14,873)\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"live births\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"migration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
