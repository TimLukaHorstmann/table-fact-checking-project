    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"The first episode to air, 'All Mix Up,' was also the most-watched episode of the season, with 8.32 million viewers,\" we need to verify two key aspects from the provided data:\n\n1. **Episode Order**: Ensure that \"All Mix Up\" is indeed the first episode aired.\n2. **Viewership Statistics**: Confirm that \"All Mix Up\" had the highest number of viewers at 8.32 million.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Check Episode Order**:\n   - Locate \"All Mix Up\" in the data to see its airing order. The table lists episodes with corresponding row indices, where each episode's title and order can be identified.\n   - According to the first row (row index 0), the title is \"title\" for \"All Mix Up,\" and the episode number is given under column \"episode_no\": 1.\n\n2. **Verify Viewership**:\n   - Look at the viewership numbers in the \"us_viewership_millions\" column to find if 8.32 million corresponds with \"All Mix Up.\"\n   - Row index 0 has a viewership of 8.32 million, which matches \"All Mix Up.\"\n\n3. **Check for Higher Viewership**:\n   - Review all entries in the \"us_viewership_millions\" column to ensure no other episode had higher viewership than 8.32 million.\n   - The table shows that 8.32 million is indeed the highest value recorded in the column, indicating that \"All Mix Up\" was the most-watched.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data:\n- \"All Mix Up\" is listed as episode number 1 (the first aired).\n- It has the highest viewership at 8.32 million.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim verification is \"TRUE.\"\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode_no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us_viewership_millions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to examine the table and determine how many episodes Michael McDonald directed.

Determine if \"All Mix Up\" had 6.32 million viewers, making it the least watched episode.\n\nLet's examine each point in detail:\n\n### Verification Process\n\n#### Point 1: Identifying the First Episode\n- **Row Index**: 0 corresponds to \"All Mix Up.\"\n- **Column Name**: The first column indicates the episode number.\n- **Relevant Information**:\n  - Row index 0, column \"Season Episode\": This entry is labeled as \"25,\" indicating it's the first episode of this season. Thus, \"All Mix Up\" is indeed the first episode to air.\n\n#### Point 2: Viewer Count and Comparison\n- **Row Index**: 0 for identifying viewership of \"All Mix Up.\"\n- **Column Name**: \"U.S. Viewers (Millions)\" provides the viewer count.\n- **Relevant Information**:\n  - Row index 0, column \"U.S. Viewers (Millions)\": Shows 8.17 million viewers. This contradicts the claim that it had 6.32 million viewers.\n  - To verify if it is indeed the least watched episode, we need to compare this value with all other viewer counts in the same column:\n    - Rows with lower viewer counts are row indices: 13 (5.03 million), 12 (5.68 million), and several others above 6.32 million.\n- **Conclusion**: \"All Mix Up\" is not the least watched episode.\n\n### Claim Evaluation\n\nThe claim that \"the first episode to air, 'All Mix Up,' be also the least watched episode of the season, with 6.32 million viewers\" is false because:\n- \"All Mix Up\" was indeed the first episode but had more than 6.32 million viewers.\n- It is not the least watched episode as other episodes have lower viewer numbers.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing information about the episode number and the viewership data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Season Episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"U.S. Viewers (Millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"U.S. Viewers (Millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe inclusion of row index 13 is to demonstrate a comparison for the least watched episode condition.",
