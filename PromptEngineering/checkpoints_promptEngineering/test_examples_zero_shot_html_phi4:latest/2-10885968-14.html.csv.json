    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to carefully examine the relevant parts of the table and compare them with the details provided in the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"the score for the away team of north melbourne be 7.14 (56)\".\n\nLet's break down what we need to verify:\n1. Identify the row where the away team is North Melbourne.\n2. Check the corresponding 'away team score' for that row to see if it matches \"7.14 (56)\".\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The relevant column names are 'away team' and 'away team score'.\n- We need to find the row with the 'away team' as \"north melbourne\" and then check the value in the 'away team score' column for that same row.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n1. Row 0: \n   - Away Team: hawthorn\n   - Away Team Score: 17.15 (117)\n2. Row 1:\n   - Away Team: geelong\n   - Away Team Score: 13.18 (96)\n3. Row 2:\n   - Away Team: south melbourne\n   - Away Team Score: 12.6 (78)\n4. Row 3:\n   - Away Team: north melbourne\n   - Away Team Score: 13.11 (89)\n5. Row 4:\n   - Away Team: collingwood\n   - Away Team Score: 7.14 (56)\n6. Row 5:\n   - Away Team: melbourne\n   - Away Team Score: 6.22 (58)\n\nFrom this, we observe that in row 3, the away team is indeed North Melbourne, but their score is \"13.11 (89)\", not \"7.14 (56)\" as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 3 with column name 'away team'\n- Row index 3 with column name 'away team score'\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
