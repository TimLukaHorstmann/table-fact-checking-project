    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' draft activity in the 1993 NFL Draft, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the table. The claim states that \"the tampa bay buccaneer[s] draft[ed] 4 wide receivers in the 1993 draft.\" \n\nWe will verify this by checking the following:\n1. The number of wide receivers drafted.\n2. Ensure that these players were indeed selected by Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n### Relevant Information from the Table:\n\n- **Column \"player\"**: Contains names of the players drafted.\n- **Column \"position\"**: Specifies the position of each player.\n- **Column \"pick\"**: Indicates the draft pick number, which can help identify if they are in sequence and potentially by the same team (Tampa Bay Buccaneers).\n- **Column \"round\"**: Specifies the round in which the player was picked.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. Identify all players with the position of \"wide receiver\".\n2. Count how many wide receivers were drafted.\n3. Check if they align with a sequence that could be attributed to Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n#### Analyzing the Table:\n\n- **Wide Receivers Identified**:\n  - Lamar Thomas, pick 60, round 3\n  - Horace Copeland, pick 104, round 4\n  - Tyree Davis, pick 176, round 7\n  - Darrick Branch, pick 220, round 8\n\nFrom the table, we can see there are four players listed with the position \"wide receiver\". \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is that Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted 4 wide receivers in the 1993 draft. The table shows exactly four players selected for the position of wide receiver. However, it does not explicitly mention which team picked these players. Without additional information confirming these picks were by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, we cannot conclusively verify the claim based solely on this table.\n\nThus, while the number aligns with the claim, the lack of specific attribution to Tampa Bay Buccaneers means we cannot confirm it as true from the given data alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Our focus will be on the \"position\" column, specifically identifying entries where the position is listed as \"wide receiver.\"\n\n**Steps:**\n- Examine each row in the \"position\" column to count how many players are listed with the position of \"wide receiver\".\n  \n**Reviewing the Data:**\n\n1. **Row 0**: Defensive End\n2. **Row 1**: Linebacker\n3. **Row 2**: Wide Receiver (Relevant)\n4. **Row 3**: Defensive Back\n5. **Row 4**: Running Back\n6. **Row 5**: Wide Receiver (Relevant)\n7. **Row 6**: Defensive Tackle\n8. **Row 7**: Wide Receiver (Relevant)\n9. **Row 8**: Wide Receiver (Relevant)\n10. **Row 9**: Kicker\n\n**Count:**\n- There are four players listed as \"wide receiver\".\n\nThe claim states that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted less than four wide receivers. Since there are exactly four wide receivers, this makes the statement false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nWe identified rows where the position is \"wide receiver\". The relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- Row 2 (Lamar Thomas)\n- Row 5 (Horace Copeland)\n- Row 7 (Tyree Davis)\n- Row 8 (Darrick Branch)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
