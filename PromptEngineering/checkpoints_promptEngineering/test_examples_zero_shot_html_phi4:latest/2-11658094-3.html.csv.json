    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions from the table against the provided statement:\n\n1. The institution founded in 1891.\n2. The same institution leaving (or ceasing participation) in 1975 and located in Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nLet's examine each condition step by step with reference to the data available:\n\n### Condition 1: Institution Founded in 1891\n- We need to find an entry where \"Founded\" is equal to 1891.\n- From the table:\n  - \"Western Carolina University\" was founded in 1889 (not 1891).\n  - \"Mars Hill College\" was founded in 1856 (not 1891).\n  - \"Presbyterian College\" was founded in 1880 (not 1891).\n  - \"Queens University of Charlotte\" was founded in 1857 (not 1891).\n  - **\"Western Carolina University\"** is the closest by founding year, but it's not 1891.\n  - None of the entries explicitly matches the year 1891.\n\n### Condition 2: Institution Leaving in 1975 and Located in Hickory, North Carolina\n- We need an entry where \"Joined/Left\" includes the year 1975 and \"Location\" is \"Hickory, NC\".\n- From the table:\n  - **\"Western Carolina University\"** joined/left in 1933 and left in 1975. The location is \"Cullowhee, NC\", not Hickory.\n  - **\"Mars Hill College\"** joined in 1973 and left in 1975. The location is \"Mars Hill, NC\", not Hickory.\n\nNo entry matches both the founding year of 1891 and the specific conditions of leaving in 1975 from a location in Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nBased on this analysis, none of the entries satisfy both required conditions completely. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nFor completeness, let's identify which cells were relevant to evaluating the claim:\n- \"Founded\" column for each row.\n- \"Joined/Left\" column for checking the year 1975.\n- \"Location\" column for verifying Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nRelevant rows based on conditions evaluated (though none fully satisfy both):\n1. Row index 10 (\"Western Carolina University\")\n   - Founded in 1889\n   - Joined/Left: left in 1975\n   - Location: Cullowhee, NC\n\n2. Row index 11 (\"Mars Hill College\")\n   - Founded in 1856\n   - Joined/Left: joined in 1973, left in 1975\n   - Location: Mars Hill, NC\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Joined/Left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Joined/Left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To evaluate the claim using the provided table data:\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n- **\"the former private member\"**: We need a university marked as \"private\".\n- **\"be found in 1839\"**: The founding year should be 1839.\n- **\"leave in 1975\"**: The university must have a departure or end of membership recorded for the year 1975.\n- **\"be hickory, north carolina\"**: The location should match \"Hickory, North Carolina\".\n\n**Relevant Data Points:**\n1. **Private Member**: Look for universities marked as \"private\".\n2. **Founding Year (1839)**: Identify any university founded in 1839.\n3. **End of Membership (1975)**: Locate the end year of membership or participation if applicable, specifically in 1975.\n4. **Location (\"Hickory, North Carolina\")**: Confirm the university's location.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n1. Examine each row to identify universities marked as \"private\".\n2. Check these private universities for a founding year of 1839.\n3. Verify if any such private university has a departure or end membership noted in 1975.\n4. Ensure that this matches the location \"Hickory, North Carolina\".\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Private Universities**: \n  - Presbyterian College (Clinton, South Carolina)\n  - Queens University of Charlotte\n  - Newberry College\n  - Mars Hill College\n  - Wingate University\n  - St Andrews University\n\n- **Founding Year 1839**: Only Newberry College is listed as founded in 1839. However, its location is Newberry, South Carolina.\n\n- **End of Membership (1975)**: \n  - Mars Hill College ended membership in 1975.\n  \n- **Location Check**:\n  - No university from the private category matches both founding year 1839 and \"Hickory, North Carolina\". Western Carolina University is located at Cullowhee, North Carolina with a founding year of 1889.\n\nUpon evaluating these criteria against each row, no single university fits all conditions in the claim. Thus:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Private Member Start End Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThe relevant cells highlight the founding year and membership status of Newberry College (as no other university fits all conditions), and location confirmation for Western Carolina University.",
