    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"a shutout game be when a team do not score at all during a game the new jersey devil lose 3 games this way, scoring no point,\" we need to verify whether there are three instances in which New Jersey was the home team and their opponents scored more goals while New Jersey did not score any.\n\n**Relevant Criteria from the Claim:**\n1. Identify when New Jersey is the home team (i.e., the \"home\" column).\n2. Check the \"score\" for games where New Jersey's opponent scores and New Jersey does not (indicating a shutout loss).\n\nLet's examine each row of the table where New Jersey is the home team:\n\n- **November 3**: \n  - Home: Yes, New Jersey.\n  - Score: 1 - 2. \n  - This was a loss for New Jersey and they did not score any points.\n\n- **November 8**:\n  - Home: Yes, New Jersey.\n  - Score: 1 - 4. \n  - This was a win for New Jersey (they scored more).\n\n- **November 10**:\n  - Home: No, away team is New Jersey.\n\n- **November 12**: \n  - Home: No, away team is New Jersey.\n\n- **November 14**: \n  - Home: Yes, New Jersey.\n  - Score: 4 - 2. \n  - This was a loss for New Jersey and they did not score any points.\n\n- **November 16**:\n  - Home: Yes, New Jersey.\n  - Score: 1 - 0. \n  - This was a loss for New Jersey and they did not score any points.\n\n- **November 17**: \n  - Home: No, away team is New Jersey.\n\n- **November 21**: \n  - Home: No, away team is New Jersey.\n\n- **November 23**:\n  - Home: Yes, New Jersey.\n  - Score: 3 - 0. \n  - This was a win for New Jersey (they scored more).\n\n- **November 24**:\n  - Home: Yes, New Jersey.\n  - Score: 3 - 2. \n  - This was a win for New Jersey (they scored more).\n\n- **November 28**:\n  - Home: No, away team is New Jersey.\n\n- **November 30**:\n  - Home: Yes, New Jersey.\n  - Score: 0 - 4. \n  - This was a win for New Jersey (they scored more).\n\nFrom the above analysis, we find that there are three shutout losses where New Jersey did not score any points:\n\n1. November 3\n2. November 14\n3. November 16\n\nThe claim is thus fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
