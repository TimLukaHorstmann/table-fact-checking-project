The pattern observed is:\n\n- Nominated in 1995\n- Nominated again in 1997\n\nThere's no entry for 1999, but based on the data available up to 1998:\n- He was nominated in 1995 and 1997 (every other year).\n- There's no nomination information for 1999, thus we cannot confirm \"every other year\" from 1997 onwards.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided years (up to 1998), David Duchovny is indeed nominated every other year starting from 1995. However, since there's no data beyond 1998 to complete the cycle for another year (i.e., 1999), we cannot fully confirm \"every other year\" indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, based on available data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"recipients and nominees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
