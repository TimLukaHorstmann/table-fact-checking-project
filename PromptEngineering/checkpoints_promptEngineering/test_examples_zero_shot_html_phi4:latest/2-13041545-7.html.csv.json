    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Turnbow (4 - 8) take the loss in the game that ends with a 54 - 61 record,\" we need to verify several elements based on the table data:\n\n1. **Verify Turnbow's Record**: We must find an entry where \"turnbow\" is listed as taking the loss and has a record of \"4 - 8\".\n\n2. **Check for Record 54 - 61**: Identify if this game results in the overall team record reaching 54 wins and 61 losses.\n\n**Steps to Verify:**\n\n- Locate the row where Turnbow (4 - 8) is mentioned as taking the loss.\n- Check the \"Record\" column to see if it matches or leads up to a 54 - 61 outcome after this game.\n\n**Analysis of the Table:**\n\n1. **Identify Turnbow's Entry**:\n   - Row 15 shows \"Turnbow (4 - 8)\" under the \"Loser\" column, indicating Turnbow is indeed taking the loss with that specific record.\n\n2. **Verify Record Before and After This Game**:\n   - The row before this game (Row 14) has a team record of \"53 - 60\".\n   - Row 15 itself shows a record update to \"54 - 61\" after Turnbow's loss, confirming the claim about the record.\n\nThus, all conditions in the claim are satisfied by Row 15.
