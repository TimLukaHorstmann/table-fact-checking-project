    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table, we must verify each part of it against the provided data.\n\nThe claim states: \n1. There is a rank with \"a total of more than 21 medals.\"\n2. For this rank, \"the total gold medal be 13.\"\n\nLet's break down and check these conditions:\n\n### Step 1: Find Rank with Total More Than 21 Medals\n- The table provides totals in the column labeled \"total\".\n- We need to find a row where the value under the \"total\" column is greater than 21.\n\nLooking at the relevant cells for total medals:\n- Row index 0 (Rank 1): Total = 22\n- Row index 1 (Rank 2): Total = 21\n\nOnly Rank 1 has more than 21 medals, with a total of 22.\n\n### Step 2: Check Gold Medals for This Rank\n- We need to ensure that the rank identified in step 1 also has exactly 13 gold medals.\n- The column labeled \"gold\" provides the number of gold medals.\n\nLooking at the relevant cells for gold medals:\n- Row index 0 (Rank 1): Gold = 13\n\nRank 1 indeed has 13 gold medals.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied:\n- Rank 1 has a total of more than 21 medals.\n- The number of gold medals for Rank 1 is 13.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells that verify this claim are:\n\n- For checking \"total\" > 21: Row index 0 (Rank 1), column \"total\".\n- For checking \"gold\" = 13 at Rank 1: Row index 0, column \"gold\".\n\nThe JSON response with these findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rank 3 have 6 total medal\" is true or false based on the given HTML table, we need to verify the relevant details from the table.\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Rank 3:**\n   - The row corresponding to rank 3 is the third row in the table (index starts at 0):\n     ```\n     <tr>\n       <td>3</td>\n       <td>1</td>\n       <td>3</td>\n       <td>12</td>\n       <td>16</td>\n     </tr>\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the Total Medal Count for Rank 3:**\n   - Look at the \"total\" column in this row to find out how many medals rank 3 has.\n   - The value under the \"total\" column is 16.\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Value:**\n   - The claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals, but according to the table, they have 16 medals.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual total number of medals (16) does not match the claimed total (6), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cell to verify the claim is located at row index 2 (third row, zero-indexed) in the \"total\" column.\n\nThus, the JSON response with the answer and the relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
