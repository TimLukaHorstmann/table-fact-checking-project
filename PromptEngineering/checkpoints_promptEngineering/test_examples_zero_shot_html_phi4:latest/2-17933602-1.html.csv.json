    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part against the table data:\n\n1. **Clubs Mentioned**: The claim mentions three clubs: Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP.\n\n2. **City Mentioned**: The city mentioned in the claim is Lisbon.\n\n3. **Number of Clubs from Lisbon**: The claim suggests that these three clubs are \"3 of 4\" clubs with Lisbon as their city.\n\nNow, let's verify each part:\n\n- **Belenenses**: From the table, Belenenses is located in Lisbon.\n- **Benfica**: From the table, Benfica is also located in Lisbon.\n- **Sporting CP**: Sporting CP is listed in the table as being based in Lisbon.\n\nNext, we need to determine if there are exactly four clubs from Lisbon:\n\n1. **Belenenses** (Lisbon)\n2. **Benfica** (Lisbon)\n3. **Sporting CP** (Lisbon)\n\nWe must check the entire table to ensure no other club is based in Lisbon:\n\n- Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra: City - Coimbra\n- Boavista: City - Porto\n- Braga: City - Braga\n- Estoril - Praia: City - Estoril\n- Gil Vicente: City - Barcelos\n- Uni\u00e3o de Leiria: City - Leiria\n- Penafiel: City - Penafiel\n- Mar\u00edtimo: City - Funchal\n- Nacional: City - Funchal\n- Beira-Mar: City - Aveiro\n- Moreirense: City - Guimar\u00e3es\n- Porto: City - Porto\n- Rio Ave: City - Vila do Conde\n- Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es: City - Guimar\u00e3es\n- Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal: City - Set\u00fabal\n\nUpon reviewing the entire table, no other club is based in Lisbon. Therefore, there are only three clubs from Lisbon.\n\nThe claim states that these three clubs are \"3 of 4\" with Lisbon as their city, which is incorrect because there are not four clubs from Lisbon.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- Belenenses: Row 1, Column 'city'\n- Benfica: Row 2, Column 'city'\n- Sporting CP: Row 12, Column 'city'\n\nAdditionally, we checked all other rows for the city column to confirm there are no additional clubs from Lisbon.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"city\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
