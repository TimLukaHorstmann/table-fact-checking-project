Confirm that this episode's original air date is October 4, 2008.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Episode s07e04:**\n   - Look for a row where the \"tv broadcast\" column has the value `s07e04`. This indicates the specific episode we are interested in.\n   - The table shows that the row with `s07e04` is:\n     - No in series: 147\n     - No in season: 4\n     - Title: the engagement ring\n     - Directed by: roy burdine\n     - Written by: robert david\n     - Original air date: october 4, 2008\n\n2. **Verify Air Date:**\n   - Check the \"originalairdate\" for this row to ensure it matches October 4, 2008.\n   - The air date is indeed listed as October 4, 2008.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table.
