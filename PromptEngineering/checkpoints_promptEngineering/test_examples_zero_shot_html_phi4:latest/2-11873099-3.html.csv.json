    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Maxi is the only player on the list from Eurasia\" is true or false, we must evaluate the relevant information in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest:**\n   - The column that indicates a player's continent or region of origin (in this context) is the `country` column.\n\n2. **Understand the Geographical Context:**\n   - Eurasia typically refers to Europe and Asia combined, as they form the largest landmass on Earth.\n   - To verify the claim, we need to identify players whose countries are either in Europe or Asia.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Row:**\n   - **Row 0:** van bommel (country: ned) - Netherlands is in Europe.\n   - **Row 1:** larsson (country: swe) - Sweden is in Europe.\n   - **Row 2:** maxi (country: arg) - Argentina is in South America, not Eurasia.\n   - **Row 3:** damia (country: esp) - Spain is in Europe.\n   - **Row 4:** f navarro (country: esp) - Spain is in Europe.\n   - **Row 5:** oscar lopez (country: esp) - Spain is in Europe.\n   - **Row 6:** gabri (country: esp) - Spain is in Europe.\n   - **Row 7:** r\u00fcst\u00fc (country: tur) - Turkey is in Asia (and also part of Eastern Europe geographically, but primarily considered Asian for this context).\n   - **Row 8:** rodri (country: esp) - Spain is in Europe.\n\n4. **Determine the Validity of the Claim:**\n   - Maxi is from Argentina, which is not a Eurasian country.\n   - There are other players (van bommel, larsson, damia, f navarro, oscar lopez, gabri, r\u00fcst\u00fc, rodri) from countries in Europe or Asia, meaning more than one player on the list is from Eurasia.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim that \"Maxi is the only player on the list from Eurasia\" is false.
