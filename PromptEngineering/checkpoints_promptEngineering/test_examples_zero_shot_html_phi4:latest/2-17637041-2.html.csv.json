    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the album be release on the same label in 2 region\" is true based on the provided table, we need to analyze the data and check whether there are two different regions where an album was released under the same label.\n\nThe relevant column for checking labels is \"label\", as it contains information about which music company (or label) released the album. Additionally, the \"region\" column will help us determine if these releases occurred in different regions.\n\nLet's examine each row of the table to identify any instances where the same label appears under two different regions:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Region: Japan\n   - Label: Toshiba EMI\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Region: United Kingdom and Ireland\n   - Label: Parlophone\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Region: United Kingdom and Ireland\n   - Label: Parlophone (same label as in Row 1, but same region, so doesn't count for the claim)\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Region: France\n   - Label: Because Music\n\n5. **Row 4**: \n   - Region: United States\n   - Label: Astralwerks\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Region: United States\n   - Label: Astralwerks (same label as in Row 4, but same region, so doesn't count for the claim)\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- Parlophone is listed twice, both times under \"United Kingdom and Ireland\". This does not satisfy the condition of being in two different regions.\n- Toshiba EMI appears only once in Japan.\n- Because Music appears only once in France.\n- Astralwerks appears twice but both times in the United States.\n\nNo label appears under two different regions. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those containing the \"label\" and \"region\" for each row:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"region\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"label\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"region\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
