    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the season finale for season 4 is May 21, 2008,\" we need to focus on two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The row corresponding to season 4.\n2. The column that lists the date of the season finale.\n\nLet's identify these elements in the provided HTML table:\n\n- **Row Identification:** Season numbers are listed under the \"season\" column (first column), which is a straightforward integer indicating each season sequentially from 1 to 8. Therefore, for Season 4, we need to look at row index 3 because it starts counting from 0.\n\n- **Column Identification:** The date of the season finale is found in the column titled \"season finale\" (sixth column when counting from zero as used in programming).\n\nBy examining these specific cells:\n\n1. Locate row index 3 for Season 4.\n2. Check the value under the \"season finale\" column in that row.\n\nHere's what we find:\n- The date listed for the season finale of Season 4 is indeed \"May 21, 2008\".\n\nThus, all conditions specified in the claim are met, and the statement can be verified as true based on the data provided in the table.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response indicating our findings would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"season finale\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This corresponds to Row Index 0.\n  \n- Once located, we also check the same row in the \"rank\" column to confirm whether it equals 21. \n\n**Verification from Table:**\n\n- **Row 0:** \n  - \"season premiere\": september 22 , 2004\n  - \"rank\": 21\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied for Row Index 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table, and we conclude that it is TRUE.\n\nThe JSON response with the relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season premiere\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
