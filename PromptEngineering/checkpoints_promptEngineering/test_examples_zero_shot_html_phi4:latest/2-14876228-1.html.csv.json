This corresponds to row index 9 in zero-based indexing.\n  \n- **Wins Check:**\n  - In row index 9, under the 'wins' column, the number of wins for \"olimpia\" is recorded as 2.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table:\n\n- Olimpia is at position 10.\n- Olimpia has 2 wins.\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To assess the claim about the table, we need to determine if the total number of goals scored (\"scored\" column) by teams ranked higher than position 10 is zero.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The phrase \"position higher than 10\" suggests positions 1 through 9.\n   - We are interested in the sum of the values in the \"scored\" column for these rows (positions).\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - Positions from 1 to 9 need to be considered.\n   - The relevant column is \"scored,\" as it shows the total goals each team has scored.\n\n3. **Extracting Values:**\n   - For position 1, Cerro Porte\u00f1o: Scored = 30\n   - For position 2, Guaran\u00ed: Scored = 21\n   - For position 3, Nacional: Scored = 25\n   - For position 4, 3 de Febrero: Scored = 24\n   - For position 5, 12 de Octubre: Scored = 22\n   - For position 6, Tacuary: Scored = 24\n   - For position 7, Libertad: Scored = 21\n   - For position 8, Sportivo Luque\u00f1o: Scored = 20\n   - For position 9, General Caballero ZC: Scored = 16\n\n4. **Calculating the Total:**\n   - Sum of \"scored\" values for positions 1 through 9:\n     \\[\n     30 + 21 + 25 + 24 + 22 + 24 + 21 + 20 + 16 = 203\n     \\]\n\n5. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that this total should be zero.\n   - Since the calculated total is 203, which is not zero, the claim is false.\n\n6. **Identifying Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those in the \"scored\" column for rows corresponding to positions 1 through 9.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"scored\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
