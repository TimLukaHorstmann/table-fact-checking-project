Identify the row with a screening start date of \"3 april 2006\". The dates are written in different formats (\"May\" vs. \"april\"), but recognizing that there might be a typographical inconsistency (i.e., April instead of May), we need to check all rows for consistency and find one starting on \"3 april 2006.\"\n\n2. Verify the end date in that row against \"28 april 2006\" as specified in the claim.\n\n3. The relevant cells to verify are:\n   - Row with the start date: \"3 april 2006\"\n   - Column name for screening started\n   - Column name for screening completed\n\n4. From the table, locate:\n   - Screening started on \"3 april 2006\" is in row index 12.\n   - The corresponding screening completed date in this row is \"2 june 2006.\"\n\n5.
