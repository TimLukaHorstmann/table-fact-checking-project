    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Tacna have a 3% change in the country's population since 1993,\" we need to examine the relevant data within the provided HTML table.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: The region \"tacna\" is listed, so we'll locate its corresponding row in the table. It appears as the second-to-last entry in the body of the table.\n\n2. **Locate Change in % of Country's Population Since 1993**:\n   - From the HTML structure and headers, the column for \"% change in country\u2019s population since 1993\" is identified by its header: `change in % of countrys population since 1993`.\n   - This corresponds to the fourth column of the table.\n\n3. **Extract Data for \"tacna\"**:\n   - Identify which row contains \"tacna\". From inspection, \"tacna\" appears in the last but one position (second-to-last row) within the `<tbody>`, corresponding to `row_index` 18.\n   - The fourth column of this row lists a change value of \"0.3\".\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states there is a \"3% change\". In decimal form, 3% equals 0.03, but the table shows a change of 0.3%, not 3%.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the table lists a 0.3% change for Tacna and not 3%, the claim does not match the data in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This corresponds to row index 13.\n\n2. **Check the Relevant Column**: Look at the column \"% of countrys population since 1993\" for this row.
