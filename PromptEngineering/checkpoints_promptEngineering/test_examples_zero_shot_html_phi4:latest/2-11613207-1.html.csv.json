Check if \"Ballantine's Championship\" is the only competition held in April.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Competitions in April\n\nWe will look at the `dates` column for any entries indicating that the event occurs in April. The relevant rows with their indices and dates are:\n\n- Row index 0: Date \"apr 25 - 28\" indicates an event occurring in April.\n- Other row dates do not mention April.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying the Tournament Name\n\nNext, we need to confirm that the tournament name for the date identified as April is indeed \"Ballantine's Championship\". This information can be found in the `tournament` column:\n\n- Row index 0 has the tournament named \"Ballantine 's championship\".\n\n### Step 3: Check for Other April Competitions\n\nWe need to ensure there are no other tournaments listed under different dates that take place in April. Based on our examination of the `dates` column, only one date falls within April (Row index 0).\n\nBased on these steps, \"Ballantine 's championship\" is indeed the only competition taking place in April according to the data provided.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"the Ballantine 's Championship be the only competition on the Korean tour that take place in April\" is true.
