    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding Iraq's GDP (PPP) in 2011, we need to examine specific elements from the provided table. The claim states that \"iraq have a gdp (ppp) (billions usd) on 127348 in 2011.\" We will break this down into two parts for verification:\n\n1. **Country Verification**: Check if there is an entry for Iraq in the table.\n2. **GDP Value Verification**: Verify that the GDP (PPP) value for Iraq matches \"127348\" billion USD.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Locate Iraq in the Table**:\n   - Review each row of the table to find a country named \"iraq\". The relevant entry is found on:\n     - Row index: 6\n     - Country column value: \"iraq\"\n\n2. **Verify GDP (PPP) Value**:\n   - Check the GDP (PPP) value in the same row for Iraq. This corresponds to the column \"2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd\".\n   - The value in this cell is \"127.348\" billion USD.\n\n3. **Compare Values with Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"127348\". This implies a value without decimal places, which translates numerically as 127,348 million USD.\n   - However, the table lists GDP as \"127.348\" billion USD, equivalent to 127,348 million USD when converted.\n\nGiven this conversion, both values represent the same economic quantity\u2014just expressed differently (billion vs. million). Therefore, the claim is substantiated by the data in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the information available in the table. The relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index: 6\n- Column name for country: \"country\" with value \"iraq\"\n- Column name for GDP (PPP): \"2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd\" with value \"127.348\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
