This matches with the claim.\n- The fifth row has \"22 january 2003\" as the date, so it does not match.\n- The sixth row has \"2 march 2003\" as the date, so it does not match.\n\nUpon finding the matching date in the fourth row (\"7 january 2003\"), we then check the attendance value for this row. According to the table:\n\n- For the date \"7 january 2003\", the 'attendance' is indeed \"62740\".\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table that verify this claim:\n\n1. The cell in the fourth row under the 'date' column confirms the date as \"7 january 2003\".\n2.

Check if the recorded attendance for this match exceeds 70,000.\n\nLet's analyze the table data against these criteria:\n\n- **Date Verification**: Locate the row with the date \"7 january 2003\". From the table:\n  - The fourth row lists the date as \"7 january 2003\".\n\n- **Attendance Check**:\n  - In the same row (fourth), under the column labeled \"attendance\", the value is \"62740\".\n  - This means the attendance recorded for this match was 62,740.\n\nNow, let's compare this attendance figure with the claim's requirement of being greater than 70,000:\n\n- The attendance of 62,740 is less than 70,000. Therefore, the condition specified in the claim is not met.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim \"the match played on 7 January recorded an attendance greater than 70000\" is FALSE.\n\nFor completeness, here are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- The date (\"date\") column at row index 3 has the value \"7 january 2003\".\n- The attendance (\"attendance\") column at row index 3 has the value \"62740\".\n\nThe JSON response reflecting this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
