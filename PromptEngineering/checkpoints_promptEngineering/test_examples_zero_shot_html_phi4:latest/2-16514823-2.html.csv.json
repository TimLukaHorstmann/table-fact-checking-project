    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to evaluate whether G\u00f6teborg played a match against Ullevi on September 19th, 2015.\n\n1. **Date Check**: The claim mentions \"September 19th, 2015\". However, according to the table provided:\n   - The date of interest is listed as \"2005-09-19\", which is indeed in the year 2005, not 2015.\n   \n2. **Opponent Check**: The column labeled \"Home/Away\" provides information about opponents and match locations:\n   - For the row with the date \"2005-09-19\", it shows \"G\u00f6teborg\" as playing at \"Ullevi\". This indicates that G\u00f6teborg played a home game against an unspecified opponent, but not necessarily Ullevi.\n\n3. **Opponent Identification**:\n   - In the column labeled \"Home/Away\", the value for September 19th is simply \"G\u00f6teborg\", which denotes G\u00f6teborg as playing at home.\n   - The corresponding opponent in this case, located in the same row under the \"Home/Away\" column, is listed as \"G\u00f6teborg\". This implies that \"Ullevi\" was the venue for a match involving G\u00f6teborg but does not confirm Ullevi as the opposing team.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the table lists the opponent as \"G\u00f6teborg\", it indicates that this was likely a home game (potentially against another G\u00f6teborg-based team or an away team playing at Ullevi) rather than G\u00f6teborg being matched up against Ullevi specifically.\n\nBased on these checks, the claim is false since:\n- The year 2015 does not match with any data in the table.\n- There's no indication that Ullevi was the opponent; it appears to be a home venue for a game involving a team named \"G\u00f6teborg\".\n\nHere\u2019s the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Home/Away\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are from row index 17 (counting starts at 0), corresponding to the date and opponent details for September 19th, 2005.",
