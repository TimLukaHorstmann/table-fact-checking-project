    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the table, we need to examine each part of the claim against relevant data in the table:\n\n1. **Team**: The claim refers to a game where \"jim maloney\" and \"marshall bridges\" were pitchers. From the table, we see that this situation occurs for the team \"milwaukee braves.\"\n\n2. **Date**: The date given in the claim is unspecified, but we can verify it through relevant data. For the row concerning the Milwaukee Braves against the Cincinnati Reds on June 8, 1961.\n\n3. **Opponent**: The opponent mentioned is not specified in the claim directly, but checking the table reveals that the \"cincinnati reds\" were indeed the opponents for this game.\n\n4. **Pitcher(s)**: The claim states \"jim maloney marshall bridge be the pitcher,\" which suggests both individuals were involved as pitchers. In the table, we see \"jim maloney (2) marshall bridges\" listed under the Pitcher column, confirming their involvement in that specific game.\n\n5. **Inning**: The claim specifies that this occurred in the 7th inning. According to the table data for the same row, the game was indeed in the \"7th\" inning.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are corroborated by the data in the first row (row index 0) under the relevant columns ('team', 'date', 'opponent', 'pitcher', and 'inn'), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE. The specific cells from the table that support this conclusion are as follows:\n\n- Row Index: 0, Column Name: \"team\" (milwaukee braves)\n- Row Index: 0, Column Name: \"date\" (june 8 , 1961)\n- Row Index: 0, Column Name: \"opponent\" (cincinnati reds)\n- Row Index: 0, Column Name: \"pitcher\" (jim maloney (2) marshall bridges)\n- Row Index: 0, Column Name: \"inn\" (7th)\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"inn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify if there is an entry in the table where a pitcher set a record in the 7th inning and the names \"Joel Peralta\" and \"Robinson Tejeda\" appear as pitchers.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant columns for this verification are:\n   - `inn`: To check for games that occurred specifically in the 7th inning.\n   - `pitcher`: To verify if \"Joel Peralta\" and \"Robinson Tejeda\" were involved as pitchers.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Check each row to see if the inning is the 7th.\n   - If the inning is the 7th, check the `pitcher` column for the names \"Joel Peralta\" and \"Robinson Tejeda\".\n\n3. **Verification Process**:\n   - **Row 0**: The inning is the 7th (`<td>7th</td>`), but the pitchers listed are \"Jim Maloney (2) Marshall Bridges\". Neither Joel Peralta nor Robinson Tejeda appear here.\n   - **Rows 1 to 6**: These rows have innings of 6th, 11th, 9th, 3rd, and 6th respectively. Therefore, they do not meet the inning condition.\n   - **Row 7**: The inning is the 4th, so it does not meet the inning condition.\n\nSince no row in the table matches both conditions (inning being the 7th and having \"Joel Peralta\" and \"Robinson Tejeda\" as pitchers), the claim is false.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are from Row 0, specifically in the `inn` and `pitcher` columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"inn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pitcher\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
