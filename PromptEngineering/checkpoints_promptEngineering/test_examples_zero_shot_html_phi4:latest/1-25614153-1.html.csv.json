    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"joel houston composes 4 of the songs on the album con todo,\" we need to perform a structured check against the provided table data:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We focus on the columns related to composers and original albums:\n     - `composer`: This column indicates who composed each song.\n     - `original album`: This column shows which album each song belongs to.\n\n2. **Evaluate Conditions in the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions \"joel houston\" as a composer, so we need to identify rows where Joel Houston is listed under the `composer` column.\n   - Additionally, it specifies an album named \"con todo,\" for which there seems to be no direct match in the table's `original album` column. It might be intended or misspelled compared to known album names.\n\n3. **Check for Joel Houston as Composer:**\n   - Look for rows where \"joel houston\" appears in the `composer` column:\n     - Row 1: \"para exaltarte\" has Joel Houston as composer.\n     - Row 2: \"correr\u00e9\" also lists Joel Houston as composer.\n     - Row 4: \"desde mi interior\" includes Joel Houston as composer.\n     - Row 9: \"soy libre\" involves Joel Houston among the composers.\n\n   This confirms that Joel Houston is credited as a composer for four songs. \n\n4. **Check Album Association:**\n   - Now, we need to check if these four songs belong to an album titled \"con todo.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1 (\"para exaltarte\") has the album name \"this is our god.\"\n     - Row 2 (\"correr\u00e9\") also belongs to \"this is our god.\"\n     - Row 4 (\"desde mi interior\") is part of \"unidos permanecemos.\"\n     - Row 9 (\"soy libre\") falls under the \"saviour king\" album.\n\n   None of these albums match or closely resemble \"con todo.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - While Joel Houston composes four songs in the table, none of them are from an album named \"con todo.\" Therefore, the claim is false based on the mismatch between the specified album and actual album names.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"composer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"composer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"composer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"composer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"original album\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
