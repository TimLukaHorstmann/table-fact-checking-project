Therefore, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nNext, we identify the relevant cells to verify the claim. These are located at row index 3 (since HTML tables use zero-based indexing for rows and headers are not included in counting):\n\n- **Row Index**: 3\n- **Column Names**:\n  - \"gold\" with a value of 3.\n  - \"silver\" with a value of 1.\n  - \"bronze\" with a value of 4.\n  - \"rank\" (to ensure it's indeed rank 4).\n\nNow, we construct the JSON object according to the instructions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We locate row corresponding to rank 4 in the table.\n\n2. **Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medals**:\n   - At rank 4, check if there are indeed 3 gold medals, 1 silver medal, and 4 bronze medals.\n     - Gold: The value at rank 4 for the \"gold\" column is 3.\n     - Silver: The value at rank 4 for the \"silver\" column is 1.\n     - Bronze: The value at rank 4 for the \"bronze\" column is 4.\n\n3. **Highest Total Check**:\n   - The claim states this makes the \"highest total\". We need to check if the \"total\" at rank 4 is the highest in the table.\n   - For each row, compare the \"total\" value:\n     - Rank 1: Total = 11\n     - Rank 2: Total = 14 (highest)\n     - Rank 3: Total = 12\n     - Rank 4: Total = 8\n     - Other ranks have totals less than or equal to 8.\n\nSince the total at rank 4 is not the highest, the claim \"make the highest total\" is false. Therefore, based on the evaluation, the claim as a whole is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n- The gold, silver, bronze, and total values at rank 4.\n- The total values of all ranks to verify if rank 4 has the highest total.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
