    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to examine the table and identify the relevant information for the rider ranked 12th. The claim states: \"on june 3, the rider rank 12th have a time of 18'19.47 and a speed of 123.539 mph.\"\n\n1. **Locate the 12th Ranked Rider**: According to the table provided, row indices start at 0, so the 12th ranked rider corresponds to `row_index = 11`.\n\n2. **Check the Time and Speed for June 3**:\n   - We need to determine which column represents the data for \"June 3.\" Assuming columns are named or represent sequential days from left to right (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, etc.), we must identify which column corresponds to June 3.\n   - In this context, assuming each subsequent column after the first one indicates a consecutive day, and without explicit labels for dates, it is reasonable to check sequentially:\n     - Column 0: First day\n     - Column 1: Second day\n     - Column 2: Third day (likely June 3 if starting from June 1)\n   - Therefore, column `column_name = \"Column_2\"` should correspond to the data for June 3.\n\n3. **Verify Time and Speed**:\n   - For `row_index = 11` and `column_name = \"Column_2\"`, check if the time is \"18'19.47\" and speed is \"123.539 mph.\"\n   - From the table: \n     - The entry for row 11, column 2 shows \"18'19.47\" and \"123.539 mph.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both the time and speed values match those stated in the claim.\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Column_2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
