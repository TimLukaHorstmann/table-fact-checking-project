    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the frequency of San Antonio Spurs being the visiting team versus the home team, we need to analyze the table row by row and focus on two specific columns: \"visitor\" and \"home\". The claim states that the Spurs visit less frequently than they play at home. \n\n1. **Analyzing Rows for \"Visitor\":**  \n   - Row 0: Date \"December 2, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 1: Date \"December 3, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 4: Date \"December 10, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 5: Date \"December 11, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 7: Date \"December 15, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 8: Date \"December 17, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 9: Date \"December 19, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 11: Date \"December 23, 1976\", Visitor is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n\n   From this analysis, we can see that the San Antonio Spurs appear as the visiting team in **8** rows.\n\n2. **Analyzing Rows for \"Home\":**\n   - Row 3: Date \"December 8, 1976\", Home is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 6: Date \"December 14, 1976\", Home is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 10: Date \"December 21, 1976\", Home is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 12: Date \"December 26, 1976\", Home is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n   - Row 13: Date \"December 28, 1976\", Home is \"San Antonio Spurs\"\n\n   From this analysis, we can see that the San Antonio Spurs appear as the home team in **5** rows.\n\n3. **Comparing Frequencies:**  \n   The San Antonio Spurs are listed as visiting teams more frequently (8 times) than they play at home (5 times). Therefore, the claim \"the san antonio spur be the visit team less frequently than they be the home team\" is FALSE.\n\n4. **Identifying Relevant Cells:**  \n   - For the \"Visitor\" column: Rows 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11.\n   - For the \"Home\" column: Rows 3, 6, 10, 12, and 13.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant part of the claim is: \"the san antonio spur play against the kansas city king before playing against the cleveland cavalier.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**:\n   - We need to find the game where the San Antonio Spurs played against Kansas City Kings and the game where they played against Cleveland Cavaliers.\n   \n2. **Check Order of Games**:\n   - According to the table:\n     - The game against Kansas City Kings is on December 26, 1976 (row 11).\n     - The game against Cleveland Cavaliers is on December 19, 1976 (row 9).\n\n3. **Verify Sequence**:\n   - For the claim to be true, the game against Kansas City Kings should occur before the game against Cleveland Cavaliers.\n   - From the dates in the table, we see that the San Antonio Spurs played against the Cleveland Cavaliers on December 19, 1976, and then played against the Kansas City Kings on December 26, 1976. Therefore, the sequence is not as claimed.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is false because the game against the Cleveland Cavaliers occurred before the game against the Kansas City Kings.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to identify the cells that contain information about these two games for verification.\n   - For the game against Cleveland Cavaliers (December 19, 1976), relevant cells are in row 9.\n   - For the game against Kansas City Kings (December 26, 1976), relevant cells are in row 11.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
