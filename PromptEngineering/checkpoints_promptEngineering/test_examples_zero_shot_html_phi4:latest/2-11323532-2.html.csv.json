Check the \"Language\" column to see if it mentions \"vietnamese.\"\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The relevant row (row index 16) for Vietnam lists:\n  - Country / Region: Vietnam\n  - Language: vietnamese\n\nThis confirms that people from Vietnam speak Vietnamese according to the table.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check two conditions for Israel in the table:\n\n1. The language of the show is Hebrew.\n2. The status of the show is ongoing.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the data from the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: \n  - From the table, identify the row corresponding to \"Israel\". It is in row index 13 (considering the first row as index 0).\n\n- **Language Verification**:\n  - Check the \"Languages\" column for Israel. The cell content is \"Hebrew\".\n\n- **Status Verification**:\n  - Check the \"Status\" column for Israel. The cell content is \"discontinued\".\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n1. The language of the show in Israel is indeed Hebrew, which satisfies the first condition.\n2. However, the status of the show in Israel is \"discontinued\", not \"ongoing\". This does not satisfy the second condition.\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the claim to hold and one of them fails (the status being discontinued), the entire claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells that were checked are:\n\n- Languages: Row index 13, Column name \"Languages\".\n- Status: Row index 13, Column name \"Status\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Languages\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
