This notation implies that their scores were identical, placing them at an equal position, which is fifth in this context.\n\n### Step 3: Confirm Details\n\n- **Bob Gilder's Row**:\n  - `row_index`: 4\n  - `column_name`: \"place\" (value = \"t5\")\n\n- **Steven Richardson's Row**:\n  - `row_index`: 5\n  - `column_name`: \"place\" (value = \"t5\")\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that Bob Gilder and Steven Richardson are tied for fifth place is supported by the data in the table, as both have a rank of \"t5\", which indicates they share the same position.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
