    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"footscray be the home team when the away team score be 9.4 (58),\" we need to verify two conditions from the table: \n\n1. Identify rows where the away team score is 9.4 (58).\n2. Check if the corresponding home team in those rows is \"footscray.\"\n\nLet's evaluate each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Home Team: essendon\n  - Away Team Score: 9.4 (58)\n  - Since the away team score matches, check the home team:\n    - The home team here is \"essendon,\" not \"footscray.\"\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team: collingwood\n  - Away Team Score: 9.8 (62)\n  - This does not match the required away team score of 9.4 (58).\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Home Team: south melbourne\n  - Away Team Score: 9.8 (62)\n  - This does not match the required away team score of 9.4 (58).\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team: melbourne\n  - Away Team Score: 17.7 (109)\n  - This does not match the required away team score of 9.4 (58).\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Home Team: footscray\n  - Away Team Score: 13.9 (87)\n  - This does not match the required away team score of 9.4 (58).\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team: carlton\n  - Away Team Score: 16.10 (106)\n  - This does not match the required away team score of 9.4 (58).\n\nThe only row where the away team scored 9.4 (58) is Row 0, but in this row, the home team is \"essendon,\" not \"footscray.\" Therefore, there is no instance in which \"footscray\" was the home team when the away team scored 9.4 (58).\n\nThe claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n- Row 0: Away Team Score (matches 9.4 (58))\n- Row 0: Home Team (does not match footscray)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
