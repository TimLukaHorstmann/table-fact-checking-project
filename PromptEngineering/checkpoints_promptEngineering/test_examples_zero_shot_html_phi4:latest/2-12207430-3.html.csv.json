    "resp": "To verify the claim about the Toronto Blue Jays' record after their game against the Kansas City Royals on May 12th, we need to check specific entries in the table.\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to May 12th:\n   - From the table, on \"May 12,\" the matchup is \"KC\" vs. \"TOR.\"\n\n2. Check the result of this game:\n   - The result column for May 12 shows \"4-3,\" meaning the Kansas City Royals won.\n\n3. Confirm the effect on the Toronto Blue Jays' record:\n   - Prior to May 12, the Blue Jays had a record of \"17 - 11\" (as per the row for \"May 11\").\n   - A loss in this game would add one loss to their record.\n   - Therefore, after this game, their updated record should be \"17 wins and 12 losses.\"\n\n4. Validate against the claim:\n   - The claim states that the Blue Jays' record dropped to \"18 - 12.\"\n   - However, based on our calculation from the table, it should be \"17 - 12\" after losing on May 12.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row index corresponding to May 11: row_index = 3 (for the Blue Jays' record before May 12)\n- Row index corresponding to May 12: row_index = 4 (to check the game result and confirm it was a loss)\n\nJSON Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"TOR\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"the Kansas City Royals beat the Blue Jays with a record of 18 - 12 after May 12th,\" we need to examine the game results involving the Kansas City Royals and check their win-loss record immediately following May 12.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games for the Kansas City Royals:**\n   - The table provides information about various games that Kansas City Royals played.\n   - We are interested in the games after May 12th to verify if they beat the Blue Jays with a specific win-loss record of 18-12.\n\n2. **Examine Post-May 12 Games for Royals:**\n   - Check each row from May 13 onward where \"Royals\" is listed under the \"Opponent\" column.\n   - Identify games against the Blue Jays to see if such a game resulted in a win and verify the resulting record.\n\n3. **Review Each Relevant Game:**\n   - **May 22:** Royals vs. Mariners, Royals won (7-5).\n   - **May 23:** Royals vs. Mariners, Royals lost (6-2).\n   - **May 24:** Royals vs. Mariners, Royals won (5-2).\n   - **May 25:** Royals vs. Mariners, Royals won (6-5).\n   - **May 27:** Royals vs. Athletics, Royals won (4-1).\n   - **May 28:** Royals vs. Athletics, Royals lost (4-3).\n   - **May 29:** Royals vs. Angels, Royals lost (3-1).\n   - **May 30:** Royals vs. Angels, Royals lost (4-3 in 10 innings).\n   - **May 31:** Royals vs. Angels, Royals won (7-2).\n\n4. **Check for Game Against the Blue Jays:**\n   - There are no games listed against the Blue Jays after May 12th within the table.\n   - Therefore, there is no record of the Royals beating the Blue Jays after this date.\n\n5. **Verify Record After May 12:**\n   - Count the wins and losses for the Royals from May 13 to May 31:\n     - Wins: 6 (May 22, May 24, May 25, May 27, May 31)\n     - Losses: 4 (May 23, May 28, May 29, May 30)\n\n   The record after May 12 is not 18-12. Instead, it is 7-5 before May 13 and changes to 13-9 by the end of May.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there was no game against the Blue Jays post-May 12th where they could achieve an 18-12 record, the claim cannot be true based on the data provided.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
