We will check if the `opponent` column for week 17 is \"san diego chargers\".\n\n3. **Result Verification**: The result of the game should be a win with a score of 17-12, as per the claim. We'll verify this in the `result` column.\n\n4. **Attendance Verification**: The claim mentions an attendance of 62,593. This will be checked against the `attendance` column for week 17.\n\nNow let's examine the table:\n\n- For row with `week = 17`, we find:\n  - `opponent`: \"san diego chargers\"\n  - `result`: \"w 17 - 12\"\n  - `attendance`: 62593\n\nAll parts of the claim match the corresponding cells in the table for week 17.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two key points against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Number of Games Played in September**: We must identify how many games occurred in September and their corresponding scores.\n2. **Specific Scores Mentioned in the Claim**: We must check if any game had one of the specific scores mentioned: \"w 23 - 20\", \"w 38 - 31\", \"w 24 - 7\", \"w 28 - 24\", or \"w 17 - 12\".\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify September Games\n\n- The table provides the dates and results for each game.\n- We need to find all games with dates in September.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **September 9, 1990**: Result = \"w 14 - 9\"\n- **September 16, 1990**: Result = \"w 17 - 13\"\n- **September 23, 1990**: Result = \"w 20 - 3\"\n- **September 30, 1990**: Result = \"w 24 - 10\"\n\nThere are four games played in September.\n\n### Step 2: Check for Specific Scores\n\nWe need to check if any game had the scores mentioned in the claim:\n\n- **\"w 23 - 20\"**: \n  - Found on December 2, 1990 (row index 12).\n  \n- **\"w 38 - 31\"**:\n  - Found on December 10, 1990 (row index 13).\n\n- **\"w 24 - 7\"**:\n  - Found on December 16, 1990 (row index 14).\n\n- **\"w 28 - 24\"**:\n  - Found on December 22, 1990 (row index 15).\n\n- **\"w 17 - 12\"**:\n  - Found on December 30, 1990 (row index 16).\n\nNone of these scores occurred in September.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states there are five games played in September with specific scores. However, we found only four games in September, and none match the specified scores. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- **September Games**:\n  - Row index 0: Result \"w 14 - 9\"\n  - Row index 1: Result \"w 17 - 13\"\n  - Row index 2: Result \"w 20 - 3\"\n  - Row index 3: Result \"w 24 - 10\"\n\n- **Specific Scores**:\n  - Row index 12: Result \"w 23 - 20\"\n  - Row index 13: Result \"w 38 - 31\"\n  - Row index 14: Result \"w 24 - 7\"\n  - Row index 15: Result \"w 28 - 24\"\n  - Row index 16: Result \"w 17 - 12\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
