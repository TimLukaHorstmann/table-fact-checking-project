Locate the row corresponding to the \"11 - 98\" date.\n2. Check the value under the column labeled \"pictorials\" for this row.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Row**: The table contains rows indexed from 0 to 8. We need to find the row where the date is \"11 - 98\". By inspecting the table:\n   - Row index 7 corresponds to the date \"11 - 98\".\n\n2. **Check Column Value**: For row index 7, look at the value in the column \"pictorials\".\n   - The entry for this cell is \"girls of the acc\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claim**: The claim specifies \"girl of the acc\" (note the singular form and lack of spaces) while the table lists \"girls of the acc\". These two phrases are not identical.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pictorial name in the 11 - 98 issue is \"girls of the acc\", which does not match exactly with the claim that states it should be \"girl of the acc\".\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cell for verification is at row index 7 in the column \"pictorials\".\n\nHere's the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pictorials\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
