    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Chelsea's performance in January 2003 is true or false, we need to carefully examine the table and check each part of the claim:\n\n1. **\"Chelsea win all their match in January 2003\":**\n   - We look for matches played by Chelsea in January 2003.\n   - The relevant rows are those with dates \"4 January 2003\" and \"26 January 2003\".\n   - For \"4 January 2003\", the result is \"1 - 0\". This indicates a win.\n   - For \"26 January 2003\", the result is \"4 - 0\". This also indicates a win.\n   - Both matches were won by Chelsea in January 2003.\n\n2. **\"keep a clean sheet as well\":**\n   - A \"clean sheet\" means conceding no goals, i.e., the opponent's score should be 0.\n   - For \"4 January 2003\", the result is \"1 - 0\". Chelsea conceded 0 goals in this match.\n   - For \"26 January 2003\", the result is \"4 - 0\". Again, Chelsea conceded 0 goals.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are met (Chelsea won all matches and kept a clean sheet in each), the claim is true. Now, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row index 0: \n  - Date: \"4 January 2003\"\n  - Result: \"1 - 0\" (indicating a win and a clean sheet)\n- Row index 1:\n  - Date: \"26 January 2003\"\n  - Result: \"4 - 0\" (indicating a win and a clean sheet)\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

From the table:\n     - Row 3 has \"arsenal\" as the opponent.\n     - Row 4 also has \"arsenal\" as the opponent (in a replay match).\n\n2. **Extract attendance figures from these rows:**\n   - For the match on 8 March 2003 (Row 3), the attendance is 38104.\n   - For the replay match on 25 March 2003 (Row 4), the attendance is 41456.\n\n3. **Compare attendances for all matches in the table to check if Arsenal matches had the highest attendance:**\n   - Row 0 (Middlesbrough) has an attendance of 2796.\n   - Row 1 (Shrewsbury Town) has an attendance of 7950.\n   - Row 2 (Stoke City) has an attendance of 26615.\n   - Row 3 (Arsenal, first match) has an attendance of 38104.\n   - Row 4 (Arsenal, replay match) has an attendance of 41456.\n\n4. **Determine if the Arsenal matches had the highest attendance:**\n   - The attendances for matches against Arsenal are 38104 and 41456.\n   - Comparing these to other attendances:\n     - 41456 is greater than 2796, 7950, 26615, and 38104.\n\nTherefore, the match on 25 March 2003 (Row 4) with an attendance of 41456 was indeed the highest recorded attendance in this table. This supports the claim that when Arsenal were the opponent, the attendance record was the highest.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells for verification:**\n   - The \"opponent\" and \"attendance\" columns are relevant to verify which matches involved Arsenal and their corresponding attendances.\n   - Relevant rows are 3 and 4 (Arsenal matches), with \"opponent\" and \"attendance\" being the key columns.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
