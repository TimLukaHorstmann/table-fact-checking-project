Identify the relevant data: We focus on the \"attendance\" column since it contains the figures necessary for verifying the claim.\n2. Extract attendance values from each row:\n   - Row 1: 56715\n   - Row 2: 60755\n   - Row 3: 60238\n   - Row 4: 47190\n   - Row 5: 60238\n   - Row 6: 47693\n   - Row 7: 50574\n   - Row 8: 60238\n   - Row 9: 58850\n   - Row 10: 60238\n   - Row 11: 44815 (lowest so far)\n   - Row 12: 60238\n   - Row 13: 60238\n   - Row 14: 77277\n\n3. Determine the minimum attendance value:\n   - After comparing all values, we find that 44815 is indeed the lowest attendance figure in the table.\n\n4. Confirm the claim:\n   - The claim states that \"the lowest attendance figure in a game is 44815.\" We found this to be true as no other attendance figures are lower than 44815.\n\n5. Identify relevant cell:\n   - The minimum value occurs in row 11 under the column \"attendance.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell for verification is:\n\n- Row index: 10 (since indexing typically starts at 0)\n- Column name: \"attendance\"\n\nThus, we can construct the JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the fewest point score by any opponent be 6 by the Philadelphia Eagles,\" we need to focus on the columns related to opponents and scores. The relevant data in the table includes the 'opponent' column, which tells us who they played against, and the 'result' column, which provides the game's final score.\n\n1. Identify all entries where an opponent is mentioned along with their respective scores:\n   - Week 2: Played against \"philadelphia eagles\" with a result of \"w 38 - 6.\" The Eagles scored 6 points.\n   - Week 4: Played against \"chicago bears\" with a result of \"w 24 - 3.\" The Bears scored 3 points.\n   - Week 14: Played against \"los angeles rams\" with a result of \"l 10 - 34.\" The Rams scored 10 points.\n\n2. Compare the scores of all opponents to find the fewest:\n   - Philadelphia Eagles: 6 points\n   - Chicago Bears: 3 points\n   - Los Angeles Rams: 10 points\n\nThe lowest score among these games is 3 points by the Chicago Bears, not 6 points by the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThus, the claim is false.
