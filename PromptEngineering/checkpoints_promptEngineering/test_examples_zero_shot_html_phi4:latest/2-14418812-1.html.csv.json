The time and date should match \"1:00 pm on sunday, november 27.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant columns and rows in the table that contain this information:\n\n- **Column Check**:\n  - The `opponent` column contains the names of the teams.\n  - The `date` column provides the day and month when the game was played.\n  - The `time (et)` column specifies the time at which the game occurred.\n\n- **Row Verification**:\n  - We need to find the row where the opponent is \"new york jets.\"\n  - Verify that in this row, the date is \"sunday november 27\" and the time is \"1:00 pm.\"\n\nNow, let's go through the table:\n\n1. **Row 11**: \n   - `opponent`: new york jets\n   - `date`: sunday november 27\n   - `time (et)`: 1:00 pm\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions of the claim.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the claim is supported by the data in Row 11.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about week 14 is true or false, we need to verify specific pieces of information from the table: the starting time for the game during week 14.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to assess the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Row Corresponding to Week 14:**  \n   The table includes a \"week\" column which allows us to directly locate week 14. Based on the HTML representation of the table, we can see that row index 13 corresponds to week 14.\n\n2. **Locate the Time for Week 14:**  \n   We need to find the time at which the game started during week 14. This information is contained in the \"time (et)\" column.\n\n3. **Verify the Claimed Time Against the Table Data:**\n   - From the table, we see that in row index 13 (week 14), under the \"time (et)\" column, it states \"4:00 pm\".\n   - The claim is that during week 14, the game started at 9:00 pm. Comparing this with the actual data (\"4:00 pm\"), it's clear there is a discrepancy.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since the time in the table for week 14 is \"4:00 pm\" and not \"9:00 pm\", the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim include:\n     - Row index 13, column \"week\" (to identify it's indeed about week 14).\n     - Row index 13, column \"time (et)\" (to check the actual game start time).\n\nBased on these steps, we can construct the JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time (et)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
