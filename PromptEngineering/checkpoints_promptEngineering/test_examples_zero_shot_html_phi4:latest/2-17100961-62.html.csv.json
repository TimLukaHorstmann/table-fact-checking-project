    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"bobby wilson be pick by the washington redskins before jimmy spencer,\" we need to analyze two conditions based on the information provided in the table:\n\n1. Bobby Wilson must have been picked by a team, and we are interested if it was by the Washington Redskins (though this specific detail is not directly stated in the table).\n2. We must determine that Bobby Wilson's pick occurred before Jimmy Spencer's pick.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Bobby Wilson**:\n  - Round: 1\n  - Pick Number in Round: 17\n  - Overall Pick Number: 17\n\n- **Jimmy Spencer**:\n  - Round: 8\n  - Pick Number in Round: 20\n  - Overall Pick Number: 215\n\nThe claim is concerned with the sequence of the picks (i.e., whether Bobby Wilson was picked before Jimmy Spencer). The relevant column here is \"overall,\" which indicates the order in which players were selected overall in the draft.\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - Bobby Wilson's overall pick number is 17.\n  - Jimmy Spencer's overall pick number is 215.\n\nSince Bobby Wilson's overall pick number (17) is less than Jimmy Spencer's overall pick number (215), it indicates that Bobby Wilson was indeed picked before Jimmy Spencer. \n\nThe claim does not explicitly require verification of the team that picked Bobby Wilson because the focus is on the sequence of picks, which can be determined independently of the specific teams involved.\n\nThus, based solely on the order of picks:\n\n- **Answer**: TRUE\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells from the table to support this determination:\n- For Bobby Wilson: Row 0, Column \"overall\"\n- For Jimmy Spencer: Row 4, Column \"overall\"\n\nThese are the cells that were used to verify that Bobby Wilson was picked before Jimmy Spencer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, it does not explicitly mention which team drafted each player. Thus, we do not have direct evidence of any player being drafted by the Washington Redskins from this table alone.\n\n3. **Relevant Columns**:\n\n   - Since the claim involves both \"draft to the Washington Redskins\" and \"have a db position,\" relevant columns would be those containing information about the team (which is missing) and the player's position.\n   \n4. **Verifying the Claim**:\n   \n   - There are no explicit indications or column entries in the table that specify which team drafted each player, including the Washington Redskins. Thus, we cannot verify from the provided data if any players were indeed drafted by the Redskins.\n   - Although there is a player with the position \"db\" (Jimmy Spencer and Charles Bell), without knowing their respective draft teams, we cannot confirm they were drafted by the Redskins.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n\n   - Since there is no available information in the table regarding which team drafted each player, especially the Washington Redskins, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based solely on this data.\n   - Therefore, due to insufficient information concerning draft teams, we conclude that the claim cannot be substantiated with the given dataset.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those containing the position information for players identified as having a \"db\" role (defensive back), even though we cannot confirm their team draft due to lack of data.",

We need to identify the smallest number in this column because it indicates the earliest round.\n\n- **Round Values:** From the table, we have rounds as follows:\n  - Row 0: 1\n  - Row 1: 3\n  - Row 2: 6\n  - Row 3: 7\n  - Row 4: 8\n  - Row 5: 9\n  - Row 6: 10\n  - Row 7: 11\n  - Row 8: 12\n\nThe smallest number (earliest round) is **1**.\n\n#### Step 2: Check the College for the Earliest Round\nOnce we have identified that the earliest round is 1, we need to examine which college's player was selected in this round.\n\n- From row with `round = 1`:\n  - The \"college\" column value is \"michigan state.\"\n\n#### Step 3: Verify Both Conditions\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n- The earliest round is indeed Round 1.\n- The player from Round 1 is drafted from \"michigan state.\"\n\nSince both conditions of the claim hold true, we can conclude that the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- **Row Index:** 0 (since it corresponds to the first row where `round = 1`).\n- **Columns:**\n  - `\"round\"`: To verify which round is the earliest.\n  - `\"college\"`: To confirm the college of the player drafted in that round.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, the claim is true.

We again refer to the \"round\" column for Jimmy Spencer's actual pick.\n\nNow, let's identify Jimmy Spencer's entry:\n\n- **Row containing Jimmy Spencer**:\n  - The player name is \"jimmy spencer\".\n  - In the table, this corresponds to row index 4 (considering that indexing starts from 0).\n  - For this row, the values are: \n    - `round`: 8\n    - `pick`: 20\n    - `overall`: 215\n    - `name`: jimmy spencer\n    - `position`: db\n    - `college`: florida\n\nAnalyzing the claim against this information:\n\n1.
