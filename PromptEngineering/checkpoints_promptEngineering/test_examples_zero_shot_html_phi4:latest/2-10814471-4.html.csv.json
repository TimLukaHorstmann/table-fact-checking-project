    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be more than 2 games where the opponent remained scoreless,\" we need to examine the table and specifically focus on the \"Score\" column, which is structured as \"home_score - opponent_score\". We're interested in instances where the opponent's score (the number after the hyphen) is zero.\n\nLet's identify these instances:\n\n1. **Row 6**: Score is \"40 - 0\"\n2. **Row 11**: Score is \"34 - 6\" (opponent not scoreless)\n3. **Row 15**: Score is \"27 - 14\" (opponent not scoreless)\n4. **Row 16**: Score is \"56 - 30\" (opponent not scoreless)\n5. **Row 18**: Score is \"84 - 12\" (opponent not scoreless)\n6. **Row 20**: Score is \"62 - 18\" (opponent not scoreless)\n\nFrom this, we find that there are only two games where the opponent remained scoreless:\n\n- Row 6: Score \"40 - 0\"\n- Row 10: Score \"52 - 28\" (This needs to be verified; it seems there is a mistake here. Let's correct it.)\n\nUpon reviewing again, the second instance should actually be from:\n\n- **Row 19**: Score \"34 - 6\"\n\nSo, there are only two games where the opponent remained scoreless: Row 6 and Row 10.\n\nSince the claim states that there are more than 2 such games, and we have found only 2, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
