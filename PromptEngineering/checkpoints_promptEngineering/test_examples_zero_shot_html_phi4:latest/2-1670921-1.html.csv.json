We should check if this pair appears in the \"battling partners\" column.\n\n2. **Runs Scored**: The claim specifies that they scored \"195 runs together\". We need to find the corresponding entry for this pair and verify the number of runs mentioned.\n\n3. **Venue**: The claim states that this occurred in \"Karachi\". We should check if the venue is indeed listed as Karachi for their match.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n- **Battling Partners**: In row 4, we find \"battling partners\" to be \"mahela jayawardene and thilan samaraweera\", which matches the claim.\n\n- **Runs Scored**: In the same row (row 4), the \"runs\" column shows 437. This does not match the claimed 195 runs.\n\n- **Venue**: The \"venue\" for this entry is listed as \"karachi\", which matches the claim.\n\nBased on these checks, while the partners and venue are correct according to the claim, the number of runs scored together (195) does not match the data in the table (437).
