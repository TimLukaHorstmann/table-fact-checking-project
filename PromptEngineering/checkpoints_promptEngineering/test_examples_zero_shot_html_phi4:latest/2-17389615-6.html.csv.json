The team name \"evansville viper.\"\n2. The sport, which is implicitly football based on the context.\n3. The venue being \"goebel soccer complex.\"\n4. Winning a championship at that venue.\n\nLet's verify each component against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Team Name**: \n   - We find a row with \"evansville vipers\" under the \"team\" column (row index 1).\n\n2. **Sport**:\n   - The sport for this team is football, as shown in the \"sport\" column of the same row.\n\n3. **Venue**:\n   - The venue listed for the evansville vipers is \"goebel soccer complex,\" found in the \"venue\" column (row index 1).\n\n4. **Championships**:\n   - To determine if they won a championship, we check the \"championships\" column of the same row. It lists \"none,\" indicating that the evansville vipers did not win any championships.\n\nBased on this examination, the relevant cells to verify the claim are from row 1 for the columns \"team,\" \"sport,\" \"venue,\" and \"championships.\"\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is FALSE because the evansville vipers did not win a championship at Goebel Soccer Complex. \n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
