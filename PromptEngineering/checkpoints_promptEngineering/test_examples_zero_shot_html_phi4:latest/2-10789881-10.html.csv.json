    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if two-thirds of the home teams scored higher than 10 goals (not points).\n\n1. **Extract the relevant data from the table**:\n   - We will focus on the \"home team score\" column.\n   - The scores are given in a format where the first number represents goals and the second number represents behinds, e.g., 14.12 means 14 goals and 12 behinds.\n\n2. **List the home team scores**:\n   - Hawthorn: 14.12 (96) \u2192 14 goals\n   - Fitzroy: 8.10 (58) \u2192 8 goals\n   - Richmond: 8.18 (66) \u2192 8 goals\n   - Geelong: 7.10 (52) \u2192 7 goals\n   - Essendon: 12.9 (81) \u2192 12 goals\n   - South Melbourne: 10.12 (72) \u2192 10 goals\n\n3. **Count the number of home teams with scores higher than 10 goals**:\n   - Hawthorn scored 14 goals.\n   - Fitzroy scored 8 goals.\n   - Richmond scored 8 goals.\n   - Geelong scored 7 goals.\n   - Essendon scored 12 goals.\n   - South Melbourne scored 10 goals.\n\n   From the above, only Hawthorn and Essendon have scores higher than 10 goals. That's 2 out of 6 teams.\n\n4. **Calculate if this meets the claim**:\n   - Two-thirds of 6 is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4 \\).\n   - We need at least 4 home teams to have scored more than 10 goals for the claim to be true.\n   - Only 2 teams meet this criterion.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\" is FALSE because only 2 out of 6 teams scored more than 10 goals, which is less than the required 4.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells**:\n   - We need to consider all rows for the \"home team score\" column since we are evaluating each home team's performance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
