The relevant column for this task is \"position\".\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how we'll evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Defensive Positions**: We look at each player in the table and check if their position includes any term related to defense, such as \"defensive back\" or similar defensive terms.\n\n2. **Count Defensive Players**:\n   - From the table, we extract the rows where the position is specifically a defensive role.\n   - Check for positions like \"defensive back\", which are clearly defensive roles.\n\n3. **Verify Against Claim**: \n   - If there are only two players with such positions, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Position = \"running back\" (Not defensive)\n- Row 1: Position = \"cornerback\" (While a cornerback is typically on defense, it's not specified as \"defensive back\")\n- Row 2: Position = \"defensive back\" (Defensive position)\n- Row 3: Position = \"tackle\" (Offensive position)\n- Row 4: Position = \"guard\" (Offensive position)\n- Row 5: Position = \"center\" (Offensive position)\n- Row 6: Position = \"tackle\" (Offensive position)\n- Row 7: Position = \"tackle\" (Offensive position)\n- Row 8: Position = \"tackle\" (Offensive position)\n- Row 9: Position = \"defensive back\" (Defensive position)\n- Row 10 to 16: Positions include \"center\", \"back\", which are not specifically defensive roles like \"defensive back\".\n- Row 17 to 19: Include \"tackle\", \"end\", not specified as defensive.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find that only rows 2 and 9 have players with a position labeled explicitly as \"defensive back\".
