    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Jim Obradovich based on the provided table, we need to verify several conditions:\n\n1. **Jim Obradovich's Pick Occurred After Round 2**: We need to check his row and see if the \"round\" value is greater than 2.\n\n2. **Jim Obradovich's Pick Occurred Before Pick 183**: We need to confirm that his \"pick\" number is less than 183.\n\n3. **Jim Obradovich Plays Tight End Position**: Verify that in his row, the \"position\" matches \"tight end\".\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells from the table for Jim Obradovich:\n\n- The row containing Jim Obradovich is:\n  - Row Index: 3\n  - Columns to check:\n    - \"round\": Value is 7 (which is greater than 2)\n    - \"pick\": Value is 158 (which is less than 183)\n    - \"position\": Value is \"tight end\"\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied with these values. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the table data provided in HTML format, we will break down the claim into its components and verify each one using relevant cells from the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"Jim Obradovich pick before round 2\"**: \n   - We need to check if Jim Obradovich was picked in a round before Round 2.\n   \n2. **\"pick 183\"**:\n   - This indicates that Jim Obradovich was supposed to be the 183rd overall pick.\n   \n3. **\"play tight end position\"**:\n   - We need to verify if Jim Obradovich plays the position of a Tight End.\n\n### Verification Against Table:\n\n- From the table, we have entries for players with their respective rounds and picks. We will check each part of the claim using this data.\n\n#### 1. Check \"Jim Obradovich pick before round 2\":\n   - Look for Jim Obradovich in the table:\n     - **Row 3** shows: `round` = 7, `pick` = 158, `player` = jim obradovich.\n     - Since Round 7 is after Round 2, this part of the claim is false.\n\n#### 2. Check \"pick 183\":\n   - According to the same row for Jim Obradovich:\n     - **Row 3** shows: `pick` = 158.\n     - The pick number is not 183, so this part of the claim is also false.\n\n#### 3. Check \"play tight end position\":\n   - From Row 3 data for Jim Obradovich:\n     - `position` = Tight End.\n     - This part of the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince two parts of the claim are incorrect (Jim Obradovich was not picked before Round 2, nor was he the 183rd pick), the entire claim is false. \n\nThe relevant cells from the table that help verify this claim include:\n- Row index 3 for Jim Obradovich's round, pick number, and position.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
