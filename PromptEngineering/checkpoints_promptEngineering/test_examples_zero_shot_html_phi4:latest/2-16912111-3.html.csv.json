    "resp": "To verify the claim made about the table, we need to evaluate it against each relevant piece of data in the table:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. \"The Blue Bomber defeat the Toronto Argonauts on Oct 18.\"\n2. \"But lose to the Calgary Stampeders the following week by a score of 37 - 16.\"\n\nLet's check each part of the claim against the table.\n\n#### Part 1: Defeat of the Toronto Argonauts on October 18\n- **Date Check**: Look for the game played on Oct 18.\n  - The row with `week` value 17 has `date: oct 18`.\n  \n- **Opponent Check**: Confirm that the opponent is the Toronto Argonauts.\n  - In the same row, `opponent` is listed as \"calgary stampeders,\" not the \"toronto argonauts.\"\n\nThe claim states a game against the Toronto Argonauts on Oct 18, but the table shows it was actually against Calgary Stampeders.\n\n#### Part 2: Loss to the Calgary Stampeders by 37 - 16\n- **Date Check**: Look for the game played in the week following October 18.\n  - The row with `week` value 18 has `date: oct 26`.\n\n- **Opponent Check**: Confirm that the opponent is the Calgary Stampeders.\n  - In this row, `opponent` is listed as \"montreal alouettes,\" not the \"calgary stampeders.\"\n\n- **Score Check**: Confirm the score is 37 - 16 against the Calgary Stampeders.\n  - The game on oct 18 (week 17) has a score of `37 - 16`, but the opponent was \"calgary stampeders\" and this event occurred in week 17, not after Oct 18 as claimed.\n\nThe claim mentions losing to Calgary Stampeders by a specific score following an incorrect date.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth parts of the claim are inaccurate based on the table data:\n\n- The game against Toronto Argonauts was on October 10 (week 16), not October 18.\n- The loss to the Calgary Stampeders occurred on October 18, not after it as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is false.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding attendance at two specific games, we must examine relevant data from the table for both dates mentioned in the claim: October 26, 2008, and November 1, 2008.\n\n**Claim Breakdown:**\n\n1. \"20102 fan attend the blue bomber game at the montreal alouettes on oct 26 , 2008\"\n2. \"24595 fan attend the blue bomber game against the hamilton tiger - cat at home on nov 1 , 2008\"\n\nFor each part of the claim, we need to verify two aspects from the table: \n- The opponent for that specific date.\n- The attendance figure reported.\n\n**Verification Process:**\n\n1. **Date October 26, 2008**\n   - Look up row with \"date\": \"oct 26\".\n   - In this row:\n     - Verify the \"opponent\" is \"montreal alouettes.\"\n     - Verify \"attendance\" is 20102.\n   - The relevant row for Oct 26 is row index 17, which has:\n     - Opponent: \"montreal alouettes\"\n     - Attendance: 20202 (not 20102 as claimed)\n\n2. **Date November 1, 2008**\n   - Look up row with \"date\": \"nov 1\".\n   - In this row:\n     - Verify the \"opponent\" is \"hamilton tiger - cats.\"\n     - Verify \"attendance\" is 24595.\n   - The relevant row for Nov 1 is row index 18, which has:\n     - Opponent: \"hamilton tiger - cats\"\n     - Attendance: 24595 (matches claim)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- For the first part of the claim (October 26), the attendance number does not match. It claims 20102, but the table shows 20202.\n- The second part is correct; both the opponent and attendance figure match.\n\nThus, since one condition in the claim is incorrect, the entire claim must be deemed false.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
