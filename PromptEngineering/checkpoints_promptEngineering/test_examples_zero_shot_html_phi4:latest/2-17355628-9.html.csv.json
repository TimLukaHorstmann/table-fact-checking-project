    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Oklahoma City Thunder do not break 100 points at all during March 2009\" is true or false, we need to examine the scores of each game played by the team in March 2009 according to the table provided.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We are interested in the \"Score\" for each game played by the Oklahoma City Thunder during March 2009. This information can be found under both the \"Team\" column and its corresponding score.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game**:\n   - For each row (each represents a game), check if the Oklahoma City Thunder's score is above 100.\n   - Record rows where this condition is met as they are relevant to assessing the claim.\n\n3. **Review of Scores**:\n   - Game against Washington: Scored 104 points (Row Index 0)\n   - Game against LA Clippers: Scored 118 points (Row Index 1)\n   - Game against Houston: Scored 120 points (Row Index 2)\n   - Game against New Orleans: Scored 106 points (Row Index 3)\n   - Game against Portland: Scored 109 points (Row Index 4)\n   - Game against Golden State: Scored 104 points (Row Index 5)\n   - Game against Utah: Scored 123 points (Row Index 6)\n\nEach of these games shows that the Oklahoma City Thunder scored more than 100 points.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are multiple instances where the team scored over 100, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**: For each game where they scored above 100, identify the relevant cells in terms of row index and column name for verification.\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object provides the answer along with the relevant cells that were examined to verify the claim.",
