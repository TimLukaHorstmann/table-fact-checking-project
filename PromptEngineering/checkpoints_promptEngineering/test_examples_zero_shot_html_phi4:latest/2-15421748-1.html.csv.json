This identifies the team in fifth position.\n\n2. **Extract Goal Difference:**\n   - Once we have identified the fifth position, we look at the column labeled \"difference.\"\n   - This column contains values that represent each team's goal difference.\n   - We extract the value from this column for the row where `position` is 5 to determine the goal difference of the fifth-placed team.\n\n3. **Verify Claim:**\n   - The claim states, \"the goal difference for fifth position be 0.\"\n   - By checking the relevant cell in the table (fifth position's goal difference), we verify if it matches the value 0 as stated in the claim.\n\nNow let us apply these steps to the given table:\n\n- Locate the row with `position` = 5:\n  ```\n  <tr>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>mackenzie</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>10</td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>27</td>\n    <td>0</td>\n  </tr>\n  ```\n\n- Extract the value from the \"difference\" column for this row: `0`.\n\n- Compare with the claim: The extracted goal difference is indeed 0, which matches the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nIdentifying relevant cells:\n- For verifying the position, we use `row_index` 5 and `column_name` \"position\".\n- For verifying the goal difference, we use `row_index` 5 and `column_name` \"difference\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: In Python-based data structures, indexing typically starts at 0, so the fifth row corresponds to `row_index` 4.",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"position 5 have the lowest difference of all the positions,\" we need to analyze the 'difference' column for each row in the provided table. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The relevant column to check against the claim is the 'difference' column, as it directly relates to comparing which team has the lowest difference.\n\n2. **Extract Data from the Table:**\n   - **Row 0 (Position 1):** Difference = 17\n   - **Row 1 (Position 2):** Difference = 14\n   - **Row 2 (Position 3):** Difference = -4\n   - **Row 3 (Position 4):** Difference = -10\n   - **Row 4 (Position 5):** Difference = 0\n   - **Row 5 (Position 6):** Difference = -17\n\n3. **Compare Differences:**\n   - The differences are as follows: 17, 14, -4, -10, 0, and -17.\n   - We need to determine the lowest value among these numbers.\n\n4. **Determine Lowest Difference:**\n   - Comparing all values, -17 is the smallest number in the 'difference' column.\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim for Position 5:**\n   - For position 5 (Row 4), the difference is 0.\n   - Since -17 (from Row 5) is less than 0, position 5 does not have the lowest difference.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The claim that \"position 5 have the lowest difference of all the positions\" is false because position 6 has a lower difference (-17) compared to position 5's difference (0).\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those in the 'difference' column for all rows, specifically:\n\n- Row 4 (Position 5): Difference = 0\n- Row 5 (Position 6): Difference = -17\n\nTherefore, the JSON object representing the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
