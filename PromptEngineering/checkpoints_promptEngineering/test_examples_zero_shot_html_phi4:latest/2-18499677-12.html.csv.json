    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"nikola kova\u010devi\u0107 compete in the club gabeca montichiari 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, we need to verify two main components of the claim using relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify \"nikola kova\u010devi\u0107\":**  \n   We first locate where \"nikola kova\u010devi\u0107\" appears in the table under the 'name' column. Upon examining the table:\n   \n   - \"nikola kova\u010devi\u0107\" is listed in row 0.\n\n2. **Verify the club name for \"nikola kova\u010devi\u0107\":**  \n   Next, we check the '2008 club' column to see which club he competed for in 2008:\n\n   - In row 0, under the '2008 club' column, it states that his club was \"rpa perugia.\"\n\n3. **Compare with the claim:**  \n   The claim specifies that \"nikola kova\u010devi\u0107\" competed in \"gabeca montichiari\" during 2008. From our verification:\n   \n   - His actual club listed is \"rpa perugia,\" not \"gabeca montichiari.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the information from the table does not support the claim that \"nikola kova\u010devi\u0107 compete in the club gabeca montichiari 2008.\" Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- The cell in row 0 under 'name' to identify who we're looking at.\n- The cell in row 0 under '2008 club' to verify which club he competed for.\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our solution is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
