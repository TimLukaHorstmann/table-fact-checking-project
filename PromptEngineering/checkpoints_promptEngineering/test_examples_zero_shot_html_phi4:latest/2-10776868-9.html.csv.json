Teams such as Melbourne, Essendon, Collingwood, Carlton, South Melbourne, North Melbourne, St Kilda, Geelong, Fitzroy, Footscray, and Hawthorn are known to be part of the VFL at that time.\n  - Although we cannot confirm this directly from the table due to a lack of explicit mention, historical context supports this assumption.\n\n- **Condition 2: Date Verification**\n  - The table lists the matches all occurring on \"23 June 1962.\" This is explicitly mentioned in the \"date\" column for every row in the table.\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- All rows have the date \"23 June 1962,\" which supports the claim that games took place on this date.\n- Given historical context, it's reasonable to assume the matches listed are part of the VFL season. However, since the table doesn't explicitly state \"VFL,\" we rely on context and common knowledge about Australian football leagues during that era.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the date condition in each row are from the \"date\" column:\n\n- Row 0: {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 1: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 2: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 3: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 4: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n- Row 5: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n\nGiven these analyses and assumptions about the VFL context:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
