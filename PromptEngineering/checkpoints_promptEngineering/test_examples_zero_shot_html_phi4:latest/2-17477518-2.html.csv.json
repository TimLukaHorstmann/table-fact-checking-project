    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"ian hutchinson be on the yamaha team and have a speed of 120.953 mph,\" we need to verify two conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. Ian Hutchinson should be associated with the Yamaha team.\n2. Ian Hutchinson's speed should be 120.953 mph.\n\nWe will analyze these conditions based on the table data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify Ian Hutchinson in the Table:**\n   - Row index 6 contains \"ian hutchinson\" as the rider.\n\n2. **Check the Team for Ian Hutchinson:**\n   - In row index 6, under the column \"team,\" it shows \"yamaha.\" This matches the first condition of being on the Yamaha team.\n\n3. **Check the Speed for Ian Hutchinson:**\n   - In row index 6, under the column \"speed,\" it is listed as \"120.953 mph.\" This matches the second condition regarding speed.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data in the table at row index 6. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo support this conclusion, we identified two relevant cells from the table:\n\n- The cell at row index 6, column \"team,\" which contains \"yamaha.\"\n- The cell at row index 6, column \"speed,\" which contains \"120.953 mph.\"\n\nHere is the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
