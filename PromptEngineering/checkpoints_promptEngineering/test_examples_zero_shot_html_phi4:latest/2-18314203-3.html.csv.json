    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Germany have 0 gold's, but 5 silver's,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table: Germany having zero gold medals and five silver medals.\n\n1. **Identify the row for Germany**: \n   - From the table, Germany is listed in the seventh row (index 6 because indexing starts at 0).\n\n2. **Check the 'gold' column**:\n   - For Germany, the value under the 'gold' column is `0`. This supports the first part of the claim that Germany has zero gold medals.\n\n3. **Check the 'silver' column**:\n   - For Germany, the value under the 'silver' column is `5`. This supports the second part of the claim that Germany has five silver medals.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied according to the table data for Germany in row 6.\n\nThus, the relevant cells from the table are:\n- The cell at row index 6, column 'gold'.\n- The cell at row index 6, column 'silver'.\n\nGiven these verifications, the claim is TRUE. Therefore, the JSON object representing this evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
