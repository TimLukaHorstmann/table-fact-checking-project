There are four such entries:\n\n1. Adelaide 36ers vs Wollongong Hawks\n2. Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles\n3. Gold Coast Blaze vs New Zealand Breakers\n4. Perth Wildcats vs Melbourne Tigers\n5. Sydney Spirit vs South Dragons\n\nNext, examine the row that includes both Sydney Spirit and South Dragons:\n\n- **Row Index 7** (0-based index) contains:\n  - Home Team: Sydney Spirit\n  - Score: 103 - 94\n  - Away Team: South Dragons\n\nThe score in this row matches the claim of \"103 - 94\" for the game between Sydney Spirit and South Dragons on November 29th.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.
