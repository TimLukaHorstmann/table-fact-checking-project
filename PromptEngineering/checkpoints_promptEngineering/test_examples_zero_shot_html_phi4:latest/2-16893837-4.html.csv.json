    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if Neuza Silva competed on a clay surface in exactly 9 matches according to the table.\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving Neuza Silva**: \n   - Look for rows where \"partnering\" column might indicate Neuza Silva as one of the players.\n   - The name \"Neuza Silva\" does not explicitly appear in the \"partnering\" column, so we need to consider if there is any implicit indication or common knowledge that suggests she was involved.\n\n2. **Check Surface Type for Each Match**:\n   - For each match involving Neuza Silva, check the \"surface\" column to see if it is \"clay\".\n\n3. **Count Matches on Clay**:\n   - Count how many of these matches were played on a clay surface.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- Rows 0 to 7: The partnering player is either Angela Cardoso or Ana Catarina Nogueira.\n- Row 8: Partnering player is Frederica Piedade.\n- Rows 9 and 10: Partnering players are Michelle Larcher de Brito and Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler.\n\nSince Neuza Silva's name does not appear in the \"partnering\" column, we need to consider if she might have been involved in any matches indirectly. However, based on the table alone, there is no explicit mention of her involvement.\n\nAssuming Neuza Silva was involved in all matches with Ana Catarina Nogueira and Frederica Piedade (rows 1-7 and rows 8-9), we proceed to count the clay surface matches:\n\n- Rows 0 to 7: All have \"clay\" as the surface.\n- Row 8: Surface is \"hard\".\n- Row 9: Surface is \"hard\".\n\nThus, Neuza Silva would have competed on a clay surface in rows 0 through 7, totaling 8 matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she competed on a clay surface in 9 matches is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are those with \"clay\" in the \"surface\" column for rows potentially involving her:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that Neuza Silva has only partnered with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler 2 times. We will check each row to see if this condition holds.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Scan through the table and identify rows where \"neuza silva\" appears in the \"partnering\" column.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler:**\n   - For each occurrence of \"neuza silva,\" check if \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" is listed as her partner.\n   - Count how many times this partnership occurs.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - If Neuza Silva partnered with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler exactly 2 times, the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Partnering is \"angela cardoso\" (not relevant).\n- Row 1: Partnering is \"ana catarina nogueira\" (not relevant).\n- Row 2: Partnering is \"frederica piedade\" (not relevant).\n- Row 3: Partnering is \"ana catarina nogueira\" (not relevant).\n- Row 4: Partnering is \"ana catarina nogueira\" (not relevant).\n- Row 5: Partnering is \"ana catarina nogueira\" (not relevant).\n- Row 6: Partnering is \"ana catarina nogueira\" (not relevant).\n- Row 7: Partnering is \"frederica piedade\" (not relevant).\n- Row 8: Partnering is \"frederica piedade\" (not relevant).\n- Row 9: Partnering is \"michelle larcher de brito\" (not relevant).\n- **Row 10:** Partnering is \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" (relevant, count as 1).\n- **Row 11:** Partnering is \"maria jo\u00e3o koehler\" (relevant, count as 2).\n\nNeuza Silva appears twice in the table with Maria Jo\u00e3o Koehler.
