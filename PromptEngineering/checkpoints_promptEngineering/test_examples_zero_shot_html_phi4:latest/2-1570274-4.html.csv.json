Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row**: The claim pertains specifically to the \"US Open.\" Therefore, we will focus on the row of the table where \"tournament\" is labeled as \"us open.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Appropriate Column**: The claim concerns wins in the US Open. Hence, we are interested in the column named \"wins.\"\n\n3. **Extract and Evaluate Data**:\n   - Locate the data point at the intersection of the row for \"us open\" and the \"wins\" column.\n   - From the table, this cell is found under the \"tournament\" labeled as \"us open\" with a corresponding value in the \"wins\" column.\n\n4. **Check Against the Claim**:\n   - The value in the \"wins\" column for the \"US Open\" row is `0`.\n   - This indicates that Tony Lema did not have any wins in the US Open.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the value is `0`, it supports the claim that Tony Lema did not win in the US Open.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.
