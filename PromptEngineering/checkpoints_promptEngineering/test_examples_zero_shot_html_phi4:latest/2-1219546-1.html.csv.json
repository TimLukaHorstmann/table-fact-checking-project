    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the shortest game in the 1977 World Series, we need to verify two parts of the statement:\n\n1. Identify which game was the shortest based on the \"time\" column.\n2. Verify whether this game occurred on October 13th.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the Shortest Game\nWe examine the \"time\" column for each row in the table to find the shortest duration:\n\n- **Row 1 (Game 1):** Time is \"3:24\"\n- **Row 2 (Game 2):** Time is \"2:27\"\n- **Row 3 (Game 3):** Time is \"2:31\"\n- **Row 4 (Game 4):** Time is \"2:07\" (shortest duration)\n- **Row 5 (Game 5):** Time is \"2:29\"\n- **Row 6 (Game 6):** Time is \"2:18\"\n\nThe shortest game, as per the data in the table, took place on October 15th at Dodger Stadium with a time of \"2:07\" (as indicated by row index 3).\n\n#### Step 2: Check the Date\nNow we check whether this shortest game occurred on October 13th:\n\n- **Row 4** corresponds to the date \"October 15,\" not October 13.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the shortest game was played on October 13th, but according to the data, it was actually played on October 15th. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n#### Relevant Cells\nTo evaluate this claim, we considered:\n- The \"time\" column for all rows to determine the shortest game.\n- The \"date\" column specifically for row index 3 (the shortest game) to verify its date.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
