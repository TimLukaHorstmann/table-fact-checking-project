    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year,\" we need to analyze the data in the table provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there was a tied game on November 6, 1980.\n   - It also implies that this is the only instance of a tie during that year within the context of this dataset.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - The table contains data for games played in the year 1960, not 1980. Therefore, there is no record from November 6, 1980.\n   - We need to identify any tied game records within the provided data.\n\n3. **Identifying Tied Games:**\n   - A tie in this context is indicated by a \"result\" that shows equal scores for both teams (e.g., \"t 38 - 38\").\n   - From the table, we find:\n     - In row 11 (week 12), the result is \"t 38 - 38,\" indicating a tied game between Buffalo Bills and the team in question.\n\n4. **Checking for Other Tied Games:**\n   - We need to ensure there are no other rows with a similar \"result\" showing a tie.\n   - Reviewing all rows, only row 11 shows a tied result.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no data from 1980 in the table and only one tied game recorded in 1960, the claim about November 6, 1980, cannot be supported by this dataset.\n   - The claim itself is false because it references an incorrect year (1980 instead of 1960).\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant cells to verify the claim are those that indicate a tie and the date of the games:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
