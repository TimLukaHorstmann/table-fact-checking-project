    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"subsidiary be primarily locate in the UK,\" we must examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the company type is \"subsidiary.\"\n2. Check the country of incorporation for each subsidiary to see if it is located in the United Kingdom (UK).\n3. Compare the number of subsidiaries incorporated in the UK with those incorporated elsewhere.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the data provided:\n\n1. **Identify Subsidiaries:**\n   - \"cobalt ground solutions\" (incorporated in the United Kingdom)\n   - \"cygnific\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"epcor\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"klm asia\" (incorporated in Taiwan)\n   - \"klm catering services\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"klm cityhopper\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"klm cityhopper uk\" (incorporated in United Kingdom)\n   - \"klm equipment services\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"klm financial services\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"klm flight academy\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"klm health services\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"martinair\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n   - \"transaviacom\" (incorporated in Netherlands)\n\n2. **Count Subsidiaries by Incorporation Location:**\n   - United Kingdom: 2 subsidiaries (\"cobalt ground solutions,\" \"klm cityhopper uk\")\n   - Other countries: 11 subsidiaries\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The claim that subsidiaries are primarily located in the UK is not supported by the data, as only 2 out of 13 subsidiaries are incorporated there.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
