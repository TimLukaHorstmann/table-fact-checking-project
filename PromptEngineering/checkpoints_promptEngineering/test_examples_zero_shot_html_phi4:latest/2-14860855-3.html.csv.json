    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"the last year list in the table be 1979,\" we need to analyze the data provided in the HTML table format. The key is to look at the 'year' column and identify which entry appears last.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: \n   - The claim specifically concerns the 'year' column because it mentions \"the last year list.\"\n\n2. **Examine the 'year' column**:\n   - Look at each row in the 'year' column to determine the sequence of years.\n   - According to the table, the entries are: 1979, 1980, 1982, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990.\n\n3. **Determine the last year listed**:\n   - The order of years is sequential except for the repeated entry in 1982.\n   - The final (or last) entry in this sequence is 1990.\n\n4. **Compare with the claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"the last year list in the table be 1979.\"\n   - However, our analysis shows that the last year listed is actually 1990.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the actual last year (1990) does not match the claimed year (1979), the statement is false.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells for verification**:\n   - We need to consider all rows in the 'year' column as they are necessary to establish the sequence and identify the final year.\n   - The row indices for the 'year' column range from 0 to 11 (as there are 12 entries).\n\nThe JSON response based on this analysis would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
