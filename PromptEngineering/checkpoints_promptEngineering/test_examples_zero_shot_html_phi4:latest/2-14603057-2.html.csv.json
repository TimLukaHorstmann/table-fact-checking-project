Here's a step-by-step examination of this process:\n\n1. **Identify the Row:** \n   The table lists school years in chronological order under the column labeled \"school year.\" To find the relevant row, we look for the entry with \"2004 - 05.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Correct Column:**\n   Once the correct row is identified, the next step is to check the column labeled \"Class A\" since this holds the names of schools or entities assigned to Class A for that specific school year.\n\n3. **Verify the Data:**\n   After locating the intersection of the 2004 - 05 school year row and the \"Class A\" column, we examine the content in that cell to see if it matches the claim's assertion (\"plain\").\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n- The relevant row for the 2004 - 05 school year is the one where the \"school year\" entry reads \"2004 - 05\". By examining this row:\n  - **Row Index:** This corresponds to index 14 in a zero-indexed list (15th row if we start counting from 1).\n  \n- Checking the column for Class A:\n  - **Column Name:** The header for Class A is simply labeled \"Class A\".\n\n- In this cell, the content reads \"plains\", not \"plain\".
