    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the only div finish of 7th be in season 1969 - 70 for the houston rocket\", we need to verify two main components from the data:\n\n1. The existence of a 7th place finish within the Division (Div) standings.\n2. Whether this occurs during the specified season (\"1969-70\") and whether there are any other seasons with a similar 7th place divisional finish.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps to verify these conditions using the table:\n\n1. **Identify all entries in the \"Div\" column that have a value of \"7th\":**\n\n   - Row 3: Div = \"6th\"\n   - Row 4: Div = \"5th\"\n   - Row 5: Div = \"2nd\"\n   - Row 6: Div = \"4th\"\n   - **Row 7**: Div = \"7th\", Year = \"1969-70\"\n   - Row 8: Div = \"3rd\"\n   - ...

This occurs in Row 7.\n\n2. **Verify if Row 7 corresponds to the year \"1969-70\":**\n\n   - For Row 7: Year = \"1969-70\", Confirmed that this matches the specified season in the claim.\n\n3. **Check for any other rows with a Div value of \"7th\" outside of \"1969-70\":**\n\n   - We only find one row (Row 7) with Div = \"7th\" and no others meet this condition across all other seasons listed.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is fully supported by the table. The 7th place finish within the division indeed occurs only during the season \"1969-70\".\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting the result of our evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Div\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are from Row 7 (index 6 since indices start at 0), specifically the columns for Division (\"Div\") and Year.
