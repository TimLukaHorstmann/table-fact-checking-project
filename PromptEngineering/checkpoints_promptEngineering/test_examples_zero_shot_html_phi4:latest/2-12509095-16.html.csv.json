We will look specifically at the 'player' and 'surface' columns.\n\nHere's a detailed analysis of each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Contains year \"2009\", not relevant to any specific player or match result.\n2. **Row 1**: Player is Ga\u00ebl Monfils, surface is hard.\n3. **Row 2**: Player is Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, surface is hard.\n4. **Row 3**: Player is Andy Roddick, surface is hard.\n5. **Row 4**: Contains year \"2010\", not relevant to any specific player or match result.\n6. **Row 5**: Player is Nikolay Davydenko, surface is hard.\n7. **Row 6**: Contains year \"2011\", not relevant to any specific player or match result.\n8. **Row 7**: Player is David Ferrer, surface is hard (i).\n9. **Row 8**: Contains year \"2012\", not relevant to any specific player or match result.\n10. **Row 9**: Player is Roger Federer, surface is clay (i).\n11. **Row 10**: Player is Novak Djokovic, surface is hard.\n12. **Row 11**: Player is Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, surface is clay.\n13. **Row 12**: Player is Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, surface is hard.\n14. **Row 13**: Player is Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych, surface is hard.\n15. **Row 14**: Contains year \"2013\", not relevant to any specific player or match result.\n16. **Row 15**: Player is Milos Raonic, surface is hard.\n17. **Row 16**: Player is Novak Djokovic, surface is hard.\n18. **Row 17**: Player is Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, surface is hard.\n\nNow, we focus on finding entries related to John Isner and clay surfaces:\n\n- There are no rows with \"John Isner\" in the 'player' column. \n- Only two players have matches listed on a clay surface: Roger Federer (Row 9) and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (Row 11).\n\nSince John Isner is not mentioned at all in any row, he did not play on a clay surface from 2009 to 2013 based on the table.\n\nThus, the claim \"from 2009 to 2013 john isner played on clay surface a total of 3 times\" is false. The relevant cells are those that could potentially verify or falsify the presence of John Isner playing on clay; however, since he does not appear in the player column at all, there are no specific 'relevant_cells' tied to John Isner and clay.\n\nThe final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if John Isner played on a grass surface three times between 2009 and 2013 according to the data provided in the table.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the relevant components of the claim:\n1. The player: John Isner.\n2. The time period: From 2009 to 2013.\n3. The playing surface: Grass.\n4. The frequency: Three times.\n\nNow we will examine the given HTML table for relevant information:\n\n- **Years**: We need to consider all rows from 2009 to 2013 inclusive, ignoring the summary years like \"2009\", \"2010\", etc., since they are not related to specific players or events.\n  \n- **Player's Name**: Look specifically for entries where the player is John Isner. The table lists several players, but we must focus on identifying any instances of John Isner.\n\n- **Surface Type**: Check if the surface is specified as \"grass\" when John Isner is mentioned.\n\nNow let\u2019s go through the relevant sections:\n\n- **2009**:\n  - No mention of John Isner.\n  \n- **2010**:\n  - Nikolay Davydenko on hard surface, no grass or John Isner.\n  \n- **2011**:\n  - David Ferrer on hard (i) surface, no grass or John Isner.\n\n- **2012**:\n  - Roger Federer and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga are mentioned; both played on clay surfaces. Janko Tipsarevi\u0107 is noted to have played on grass at the Olympics in London, but it's not John Isner.\n\n- **2013**:\n  - Milos Raonic, Novak Djokovic, and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro all play on hard surfaces; no mention of John Isner or grass.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that:\n- John Isner is not mentioned in any row from 2009 to 2013.\n- Even though there's a match on a grass surface (Janko Tipsarevi\u0107 in 2012), it does not pertain to John Isner.\n\nBased on the examination of all relevant cells, we can conclude that John Isner did not play on a grass surface during this period according to the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThere are no specific rows (or cells) that support the claim since John Isner isn't mentioned in the context of playing on a grass surface during the specified years.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a minority of the events have been played in the United States\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and identify which rows indicate tennis matches/events held in the United States.\n\n1. **Identify Events Held in the United States:**\n   - We focus on the \"event\" column to find entries that mention locations within the United States.\n   - The relevant events based on their descriptions are:\n     - \"indian wells, united states\"\n     - \"washington, united states\"\n     - \"us open, new york, united states\"\n     - \"winston-salem, united states\"\n     - \"cincinnati, united states\" (mentioned twice)\n\n2. **Count the Total Number of Events:**\n   - There are 15 rows with specific events listed in the table (excluding the year markers and player names).\n\n3. **Count the Number of U.S.-Based Events:**\n   - Based on our identification above:\n     - \"indian wells, united states\"\n     - \"washington, united states\"\n     - \"us open, new york, united states\"\n     - \"winston-salem, united states\" (mentioned twice)\n     - \"cincinnati, united states\" (mentioned twice)\n\n   This gives us a total of 7 U.S.-based events.\n\n4. **Determine if it is a Minority:**\n   - A minority would mean less than half of the total events.\n   - Total number of events = 15\n   - Number of events in the United States = 7\n   - Since 7 out of 15 is not less than half (it's more than half), the events held in the U.S. do not constitute a minority.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant rows for checking this claim are those that mention an event in the United States:\n     - Row 1 (\"indian wells, united states\")\n     - Row 4 (\"washington, united states\")\n     - Row 6 (\"us open, new york, united states\")\n     - Rows 12 and 13 both refer to \"winston-salem, united states\"\n     - Rows 14 and 15 both refer to \"cincinnati, united states\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
