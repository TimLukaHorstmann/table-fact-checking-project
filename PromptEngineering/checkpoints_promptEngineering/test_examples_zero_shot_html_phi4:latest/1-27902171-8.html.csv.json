McMillan**: Check if in that same row, there are exactly \"7 high assists by N. McMillan\".\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the table to verify these conditions:\n\n1. **Finding the Record**:\n   - Look for a row with the record \"34 - 27\". From the table, we can see this occurs in the row corresponding to game number 5 (index 4 since it starts from 0):\n     ```\n     Row Index: 4\n     Game Details: \n     Date: March 17\n     Team: Golden State Warriors\n     Score: l 107 - 119\n     Record: 34 - 27\n     ```\n\n2. **Checking High Assists**:\n   - In this row, we need to verify the \"high assist\" detail. The relevant cell for \"high assists by N. McMillan\" is in the column labeled \"high_assist\".\n   - From the table data:\n     ```\n     Row Index: 4\n     high_assist: r pierce (5)\n     ```\n\nFrom this examination, we see that N. McMillan does not have 7 high assists; instead, R. Pierce has 5 high assists in this row.\n\nSince both conditions are not met for the record \"34 - 27\" and \"N. McMillan having 7 high assists\", the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- The cell containing the team's record.\n- The cell indicating who made the high assists.\n\nThus, the JSON object should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high_assist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Whether all of these high assists occurred in a single game on March 10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n**1. Counting High Assists by G. Payton:**\n\nWe need to find each instance where \"G. Payton\" is listed as having high assists and count them:\n\n- **Row 3 (March 17):** G. Payton - 11 assists\n- **Row 6 (March 19):** G. Payton - 11 assists\n- **Row 9 (March 21):** G. Payton - 7 assists\n- **Row 13 (March 27):** G. Payton - 7 assists\n\nAdding these up:  \n11 (Row 3) + 11 (Row 6) + 7 (Row 9) + 7 (Row 13) = 36 assists in total.\n\nThe claim states that G. Payton had a total of 8 high assists, which is incorrect based on our count.\n\n**2. Checking if All Assists Occurred on March 10:**\n\n- **Row 5 (March 10):** R. Pierce - 5 assists\n\nG. Payton does not have any assists listed for the game on March 10.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because:\n\n- The total number of high assists by G. Payton is 36, not 8.\n- None of these assists occurred in the game on March 10.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nThe relevant cells are those where G. Payton has high assists recorded:\n\n- Row 3, \"High Assist\"\n- Row 6, \"High Assist\"\n- Row 9, \"High Assist\"\n- Row 13, \"High Assist\"\n\nAdditionally, the cell for March 10 is relevant to check the claim about that specific date:\n\n- Row 5, \"High Assist\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"High Assist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"High Assist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"High Assist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"High Assist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"High Assist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
