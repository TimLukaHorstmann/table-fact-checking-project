    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false based on the table data, we need to verify two main conditions: \n1. The team's win percentage was 0.72 during a particular year.\n2. The team suffered a total of 23 losses in that same year.\n\nFirst, recall how to calculate the win percentage:\n\\[\n\\text{Win Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Wins}}{\\text{Wins} + \\text{Losses}}\n\\]\nGiven the claim's stated win percentage of 0.72 and total losses of 23 for a specific season, we can establish an equation with wins \\( W \\) and losses \\( L = 23 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{W}{W + 23} = 0.72\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( W \\):\n\\[\nW = 0.72(W + 23)\n\\]\n\\[\nW = 0.72W + 16.56\n\\]\n\\[\nW - 0.72W = 16.56\n\\]\n\\[\n0.28W = 16.56\n\\]\n\\[\nW = \\frac{16.56}{0.28} = 59.14\n\\]\n\nSince the number of wins must be a whole number, we round \\( W \\) to 59.\n\nNow verify if any row in the table matches:\n- Wins = 59\n- Losses = 23\n\nLet's go through the relevant columns for each row:\n\n1. **Check Wins Column** (Column index: 3)\n2. **Check Losses Column** (Column index: 4)\n\nWe iterate over each row to find where Wins equals 59 and Losses equals 23.\n\n- For the year \"2007 - 08\" at Row Index 15:\n  - Wins = 61\n  - Losses = 21\n\nThis does not match our criteria. Let's try another:\n\n- For none of the other rows do we find Wins = 59 and Losses = 23.\n\nSince no row in the table matches both a win percentage of approximately 0.72 (which equates to exactly 59 wins) and a total loss count of 23, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer is \"FALSE\". No relevant cells satisfy all conditions of the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"0.72 be the highest win percentage when there be 22 loss,\" we must calculate the win percentage for each row where the number of losses is exactly 22 and then determine if this results in a win percentage of at least 0.72.\n\nThe win percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Win Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Wins}}{\\text{Wins} + \\text{Losses}} \\]\n\nLet's go through the rows where \"Loss\" is 22 and calculate their win percentages:\n\n1. **Row with Index 7** (2003-04):\n   - Wins: 29\n   - Losses: 53 \n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\n2. **Row with Index 9** (2004-05):\n   - Wins: 62\n   - Losses: 20\n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\n3. **Row with Index 10** (2005-06):\n   - Wins: 54\n   - Losses: 28 \n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\n4. **Row with Index 11** (2006-07):\n   - Wins: 61\n   - Losses: 21\n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\n5. **Row with Index 13** (2008-09):\n   - Wins: 46\n   - Losses: 36 \n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\n6. **Row with Index 16** (2010-11):\n   - Wins: 40\n   - Losses: 42 \n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\n7. **Row with Index 17** (2011-12):\n   - Wins: 33\n   - Losses: 33 \n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\n8. **Row with Index 18** (2012-13):\n   - Wins: 25\n   - Losses: 57 \n   - This row does not have 22 losses, so it is irrelevant.\n\nAfter checking all the rows, we find only one row where the number of losses is exactly 22:\n\n9. **Row with Index 15** (2009-10):\n   - Wins: 54\n   - Losses: 28 \n   - This does not have 22 losses, but there was an error above; let's check again.\n\nRe-evaluating for errors:\n- There is actually no row with exactly 22 losses. The claim specifies a condition that isn't met by any entry in the table.\n\nSince there are no rows with \"Loss\" equal to 22, it is not possible to determine if a win percentage of 0.72 or higher can be achieved under this condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be supported as no relevant data matches the specified criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
