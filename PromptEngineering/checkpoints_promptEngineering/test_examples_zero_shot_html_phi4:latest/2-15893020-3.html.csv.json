    "resp": "To determine the accuracy of the claim about Deon Kruis's batting average being 0.1, we need to evaluate relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Batting Average Formula**: Batting average is typically calculated as total runs scored divided by the number of times out (i.e., matches played minus not outs).\n  \nTo verify the claim, consider these steps:\n1. Identify Deon Kruis's statistics in the table.\n2. Calculate his batting average using available data.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Deon Kruis**: \n  - Matches Played: 12\n  - Runs Scored: 3\n  - Not Outs: 1\n\nThe formula for batting average is:\n\\[\n\\text{Batting Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Runs}}{\\text{Matches Played} - \\text{Not Outs}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Batting Average} = \\frac{3}{12 - 1} = \\frac{3}{11} \\approx 0.2727\n\\]\n\nThe calculated average is approximately 0.2727, which is not equal to 0.1.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Deon Kruis's batting average is 0.1 is **FALSE**.\n\nRelevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row index of Deon Kruis (11th row)\n- Columns: \"Matches Played,\" \"Runs Scored,\" and \"Not Outs.\"\n\nIn JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"matches_played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runs_scored\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"not_outs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
