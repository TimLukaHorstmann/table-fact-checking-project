    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to find a row in the table corresponding to the date \"july - 13\" and check if the value under the column \"bada\" is indeed \"0.05%\". Let's analyze the table:\n\n1. Look at each entry under the \"date\" column for \"july - 13\":\n   - There are two entries with \"july - 13\": one from \"net market share\" and another from \"statcounter global stats\".\n\n2. Check the \"bada\" values in these rows:\n   - For the row labeled \"net market share\", under \"date: july - 13\", the value for \"bada\" is \"0.05%\".\n   - The other entry from \"statcounter global stats\" does not have a percentage value but instead shows \"4.64%\". However, this is irrelevant since we already found the correct row and value.\n\n3. Therefore, the claim that \"bada have a value of 0.05% on july - 13\" corresponds to the row from \"net market share\".\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- Row index: The \"net market share\" entry is at index 4 (since indexing starts at 0).\n- Column name for BADA: \"bada\"\n\nThus, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bada\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
