There is no mention of Maserati 250F associated with Hans Herrmann.\n\n2.

However, Daimler Benz AG scored 8 points in 1954 and 1 point in 1955.\n\n3. **Relevant Information**:\n   - Hans Herrmann's score in 1953: 0 points (row index 0).\n   - Daimler Benz AG's score in 1954: 8 points (row index 1).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no entry for Hans Herrmann in 1955, we cannot directly compare his scores from 1953 and 1955.\n   - The claim indirectly refers to comparing Hans Herrmann\u2019s absence of a score in 1955 with Daimler Benz AG's score in 1954. However, since Hans Herrmann did not have an entry for 1955, the comparison is not directly valid as per the table data.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim cannot be verified as true because it requires information about Hans Herrmann's points in 1955, which does not exist in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Hans Herrmann's Participation:**\n   - The table shows an entry for Hans Herrmann:\n     - Year: 1953\n     - Entrant: hans herrmann\n     - Chassis: veritas meteor\n     - Engine: veritas l6\n\nHans Herrmann is listed only in the year 1953.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Hans Herrmann scored fairly well with the Porsche 718/2,\" we need to check two main conditions against the provided table:\n\n1. Verify if Hans Herrmann was associated with the Porsche 718/2.\n2. Determine if he scored well with it.\n\nLet's break down these steps using the table data:\n\n### Step 1: Check for Association\n- We look through the \"entrant\" column to see if there is any entry where Hans Herrmann is linked with the Porsche 718/2 chassis or engine.\n- The entries related to Porsche are in rows with year 1960 and 1961, under the entrant \"Porsche System Engineering,\" not Hans Herrmann.\n\n### Step 2: Check Scoring\n- For Hans Herrmann, we find him in row 0 (year 1953), associated with the Veritas Meteor chassis and engine. His score is 0 points.\n- Since there are no entries for Hans Herrmann related to Porsche 718/2, his scoring with this specific car cannot be evaluated.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Hans Herrmann was never associated with the Porsche 718/2 in the table; hence, any claim about his performance or scoring with it is not supported by the data.\n- Therefore, the claim \"Hans Herrmann scored fairly well with the Porsche 718/2\" is false based on this table.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are where Hans Herrmann's information and Porsche 718/2 entries appear:\n\n1. **Row Index: 0**\n   - Column Name: \"entrant\" (Hans Herrmann)\n   - Column Name: \"chassis\"\n   - Column Name: \"engine\"\n\n2. **Rows with Porsche 718/2**: \n   - Row Index: 10, Column Name: \"entrant\" (Porsche System Engineering)\n   - Row Index: 11, Column Name: \"entrant\" (Ecurie Maarsbergen)\n\nThe claim is not supported by the data provided in these cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
