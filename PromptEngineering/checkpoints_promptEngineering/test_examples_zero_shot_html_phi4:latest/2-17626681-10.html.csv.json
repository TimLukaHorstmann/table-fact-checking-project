    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the attendance figures for each game listed in the table and identify if the final round has a higher attendance than any other game.\n\nThe claim states: \"in the 2008 - 09 Manchester United FC season, the final round have higher attendance than any other game list.\"\n\nLet's examine the relevant column \"attendance\" for each row:\n\n1. **First knockout round first leg**: Attendance = 80018\n2. **First knockout round second leg**: Attendance = 74769\n3. **Quarter-final first leg**: Attendance = 74517\n4. **Quarter-final second leg**: Attendance = 50010\n5. **Semi-final first leg**: Attendance = 74733\n6. **Semi-final second leg**: Attendance = 59867\n7. **Final**: Attendance = 62467\n\nThe attendance for the final is 62467, which we need to compare against all other games:\n\n- The highest attendance among the other games is 80018 (first knockout round first leg).\n\nSince 80018 (the highest non-final game) is greater than 62467 (final), the final does not have a higher attendance than any other game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. Here are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
