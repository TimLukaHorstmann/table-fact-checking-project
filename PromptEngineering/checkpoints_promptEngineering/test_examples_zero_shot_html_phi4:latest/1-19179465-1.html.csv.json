We look at each row to find where the club name matches \"featherstone rovers.\"\n\n- Row 7 contains the data for \"featherstone rovers.\"\n- In this row, we need to verify the value in the column labeled \"drawn.\"\n\nThe entry under the \"drawn\" column for \"featherstone rovers\" is indeed \"1.\" Additionally, the claim mentions that these games are out of a total of 18 matches. The table confirms they played 18 games as shown under the \"played\" column.\n\nThus, both conditions specified in the claim (\"1 drawn game\" and \"out of 18\") align with the data provided for \"featherstone rovers.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.
