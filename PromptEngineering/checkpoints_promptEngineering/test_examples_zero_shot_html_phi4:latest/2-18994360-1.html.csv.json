Let's examine each row in the table to see which rows satisfy all three conditions:\n\n- Row 1:\n  - Points: 33 (less than 54)\n  - Draw: 1 (less than 4)\n  - Place: 10 (not less than 10)\n\n- Row 2:\n  - Points: 42 (less than 54)\n  - Draw: 2 (less than 4)\n  - Place: 8 (less than 10)\n  - Song: \"eu mesmo\"\n\n- Row 3 to Row 10:\n  - None of these rows have a draw number smaller than 4.\n\nOnly row 2 satisfies all three conditions (points < 54, draw < 4, place < 10), and the song in this row is indeed \"eu mesmo\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"elaisa's song ai a noite get first place,\" we need to check two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the singer and song:** The claim states that Elisa is the singer, and her song is \"ai a noite.\" We need to find the corresponding row in the table where both these conditions are met.\n\n2. **Check the place of the song:** According to the claim, the song should be ranked first. Thus, we must verify if the place for this entry is 1.\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find Elisa's Entry\n\n- Look at each row under the \"singer\" column to find an entry with the name \"elaisa.\"\n- According to the table, Elisa (spelled as \"elaisa\") appears in row index 4.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Song Title\n\n- Check if the song title associated with this singer is \"ai a noite.\"\n- In row index 4 under the \"song\" column, we find that the song is indeed \"ai a noite.\"\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Place\n\n- Now, verify if the place for this entry (row index 4) is 1.\n- According to the table, the place for Elisa's song in row index 4 is 6.\n\nSince the claim states that the song should be ranked first, but it is actually ranked sixth, the claim is false. \n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- Singer name: Row index 4, Column \"singer\"\n- Song title: Row index 4, Column \"song\"\n- Place ranking: Row index 4, Column \"place\"\n\nNow let's format the JSON response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"singer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
