    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is true or false, we need to focus on two relevant parts of the table:\n\n1. The cell with draw number 2 (since the claim specifies \"2\"), which corresponds to row index 1.\n2. The column labeled \"song\", as it contains the titles we need to examine.\n\nLet's evaluate these elements:\n\n- Row index 1 has the song title \"razstoyaniya\".\n- We need to check if this song title is in English.\n\n\"Razstoyaniya\" is not an English word; it appears to be a transliteration of a Russian word meaning \"distances\" or \"farewells\". Therefore, it is not an English title.\n\nSince the claim requires checking that two song titles are in English, and we only need one because the table entry refers specifically to draw number 2, the examination of just this cell reveals that the claim does not hold true for the specific instance given.\n\nThus, the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is FALSE based on the information provided by the table.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
