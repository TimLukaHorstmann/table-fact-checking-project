The positions jump from 1st (`t1`) directly to 3rd (`t3`). Therefore, the first condition of the claim is not met.\n\nEven if we were to check the \"to par\" values for `t3`, they are all \"e\", but this does not satisfy the claim since there is no tie for 2nd place.\n\nGiven these observations, the claim is false. The relevant cells to verify this are those in the \"place\" and \"to par\" columns for rows with `t1` and `t3`.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
