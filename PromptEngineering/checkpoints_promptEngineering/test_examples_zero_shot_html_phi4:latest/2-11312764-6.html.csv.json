    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"United Kingdom finish with 187.84 points,\" we need to analyze the relevant data in the provided HTML table.\n\n1. **Identify Rows Related to the United Kingdom:**\n   - The column `nation` contains entries for different countries.\n   - We'll look for rows where `nation` is \"united kingdom.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - From the identified rows, we will check the value in the `points` column.\n\n3. **Verification Steps:**\n\n   - First, scan through the table to find any instances of \"united kingdom\" in the `nation` column:\n     - Row 5: The entry is \"janet thompson / warren maxwell,\" and `nation` is \"united kingdom.\" The corresponding `points` value here is `194.00`.\n     - Row 8: The entry is \"jayne torvill / christopher dean,\" and `nation` is \"united kingdom.\" The corresponding `points` value here is `187.84`.\n     - Row 13: The entry is \"karen barber / nicky slater,\" and `nation` is \"united kingdom.\" The corresponding `points` value here is `169.74`.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against Extracted Data:**\n   - We need to determine if any of these entries result in a total score of exactly 187.84 points for United Kingdom.\n   - Notice that each skater represents a distinct pairing, and their scores do not aggregate across different pairings under one nation's total.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim suggests a combined total or specific outcome for the \"United Kingdom\" as a whole. However, in this context, no such aggregated score exists; instead, individual pairs have separate point values.\n   - One of these entries (row 8) has exactly `187.84` points for one pairing from the United Kingdom.\n\nThus, given how the table presents data\u2014with distinct scores per pair\u2014the claim \"United Kingdom finish with 187.84 point\" is interpreted as being true based on individual results and not aggregated team totals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
