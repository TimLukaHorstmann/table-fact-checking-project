    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to carefully analyze each part of it in relation to the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant match:** The claim mentions \"the closest match of the day\" and provides specific scores for Richmond and Collingwood: Richmond scored 11.14 (80) and lost to Collingwood who scored 13.4 (82). Therefore, we need to verify this particular row in the table.\n\n2. **Verify the match details:**\n   - Check if there is a row with Richmond as the home team and Collingwood as the away team.\n   - Confirm that the scores are indeed 11.14 (80) for Richmond and 13.4 (82) for Collingwood.\n   - Calculate the point difference between these two scores: \\( 82 - 80 = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Determine if this is the closest match:** We need to verify that no other match in the table has a smaller point difference.\n\n4. **Check other rows for closer matches:**\n   - Geelong vs North Melbourne: Scores are 172 and 97, with a difference of \\( 172 - 97 = 75 \\).\n   - Fitzroy vs Melbourne: Scores are 88 and 107, with a difference of \\( 107 - 88 = 19 \\).\n   - South Melbourne vs St Kilda: Scores are 94 and 69, with a difference of \\( 94 - 69 = 25 \\).\n   - Hawthorn vs Footscray: Scores are 85 and 90, with a difference of \\( 90 - 85 = 5 \\).\n   - Essendon vs Carlton: Scores are 78 and 140, with a difference of \\( 140 - 78 = 62 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The match between Richmond and Collingwood has the smallest point difference of 2, not 4 as stated in the claim.\n\n6. **Relevant cells for verification:**\n   - Row index 4 (Richmond vs Collingwood):\n     - \"home team score\": 11.14 (80)\n     - \"away team score\": 13.4 (82)\n   - Other rows are checked to ensure no closer match exists.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because the closest match was separated by only 2 points, not 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if none of the venues had more than 7000 spectators on June 29, 1935, according to the table provided.\n\nHere's a step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The \"crowd\" column contains the number of spectators at each venue.\n2. **Check Each Row in the Table**:\n   - **Row 0 (Geelong vs North Melbourne)**: Crowd is 7000.\n   - **Row 1 (Fitzroy vs Melbourne)**: Crowd is 11000, which is more than 7000.\n   - **Row 2 (South Melbourne vs St Kilda)**: Crowd is 19000, which is more than 7000.\n   - **Row 3 (Hawthorn vs Footscray)**: Crowd is 9000, which is more than 7000.\n   - **Row 4 (Richmond vs Collingwood)**: Crowd is 25000, which is more than 7000.\n   - **Row 5 (Essendon vs Carlton)**: Crowd is 18000, which is more than 7000.\n\nThe claim states that none of the venues had more than 7000 spectators. However, we found several rows where the crowd exceeded 7000 (specifically in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). This means the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification**: These are the cells from the \"crowd\" column that have values greater than 7000.\n- Row Index 1: Crowd = 11000\n- Row Index 2: Crowd = 19000\n- Row Index 3: Crowd = 9000\n- Row Index 4: Crowd = 25000\n- Row Index 5: Crowd = 18000\n\nNow, let's return the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
