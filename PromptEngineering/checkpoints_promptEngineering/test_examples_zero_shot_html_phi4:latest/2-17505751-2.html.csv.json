    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"during the 2008 - 09 real madrid cf season , garc\u00eda and agus both have loan return,\" we need to verify two main conditions from the provided table:\n\n1. Both players, Javi Garc\u00eda (referred to as just \"garc\u00eda\") and Agus, must have entries with a type labeled as \"loan return.\"\n2. These transactions should be relevant to or occurring during the 2008-09 season.\n\nLet's go through the relevant columns in the table:\n\n- **Type**: This column indicates whether the transaction was a transfer or loan-related event.\n- **Transfer window**: Indicates when the transaction happened, either summer or winter. The \"summer\" generally corresponds with June to August, and \"winter\" typically refers to January.\n\nFrom the claim:\n- Javi Garc\u00eda (\"garc\u00eda\") and Agus should both be associated with \"loan return.\"\n- For the 2008-09 season's relevance: Real Madrid CF would likely have these transfers during either the summer of 2009 or the winter of 2008/09. Therefore, we check transactions in those windows.\n\nLet's inspect each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 5**: \n   - Name: \"gonz\u00e1lez\" (not garc\u00eda)\n   - Type: \"loan return\"\n   - Transfer window: \"summer\"\n   \n2. **Row 6**:\n   - Name: \"garc\u00eda\" (matches Javi Garc\u00eda)\n   - Type: \"loan return\"\n   - Transfer window: \"summer\"\n\n3. **Row 7**:\n   - Name: \"agus\" \n   - Type: \"loan return\"\n   - Transfer window: \"summer\"\n\n4. **Row 8**:\n   - Name: \"granero\" (not garc\u00eda or agus)\n   - Type: \"loan return\"\n   - Transfer window: \"summer\"\n\n5. **Row 11**:\n   - Name: \"parejo\"\n   - Type: \"loan return\"\n   - Transfer window: \"winter\"\n\n6. **Row 12**:\n   - Name: \"faubert\" (not garc\u00eda or agus)\n   - Type: \"loan\"\n   - Transfer window: \"winter\"\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- Javi Garc\u00eda is listed with a type of \"loan return\" in summer, meeting one condition.\n- Agus is also listed with a type of \"loan return\" in summer, meeting the second condition.\n\nThe claim does not specify the exact year, but it's reasonable to assume these events occurred during or around that season.
