Whether Jeff Gordon is associated with Hendrick Motorsports on that specific date.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part in the table:\n\n- **Date Check**: We look for a row where the \"Date\" column matches \"June 16\". According to the data, there are two entries dated \"June 16\", specifically in rows 0 and 1.\n  \n- **Driver and Team Verification**:\n  - In Row 0: \n    - Date is \"June 16\", Driver is \"Jeff Gordon\", and Team is \"Hendrick Motorsports\". This matches the claim entirely.\n  - In Row 1: \n    - Date is also \"June 16\", but the driver is \"Bill Elliott\" with the team \"Melling Racing\". This does not match our claim.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is supported by the information in row 0 of the table. The relevant cells that verify the claim are:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"Date\": Matches the date condition.\n- Row 0, Column \"Driver\": Confirms Jeff Gordon's participation.\n- Row 0, Column \"Team\": Confirms Hendrick Motorsports as the team.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE based on the data provided in row 0.
