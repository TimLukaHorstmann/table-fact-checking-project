Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The \"category\" column holds all possible category names for the awards.\n2. **Check All Rows in 2001**:\n   - For each row where the year is \"2001\", check the corresponding value in the \"category\" column.\n\nBased on the table provided, here's what we find:\n\n- Row 0: Category is \"best telenovela\"\n- Row 1: Category is \"best lead actress\"\n- Row 2: Category is \"best lead actor\"\n- Row 3: Category is \"best female villain\"\n- Row 4: Category is \"best male villain\"\n- Row 5: Category is \"best supporting actress\"\n- Row 6: Category is \"best supporting actor\"\n- Row 7: Category is \"best first actress\"\n- Row 8: Category is \"best first actor\"\n- Row 9: Category is \"best song for a telenovela\"\n\nThe row that mentions support actresses states the category as \"best supporting actress,\" not \"best support actress.\" Therefore, there is no category titled \"best support actress\" in the table.\n\nThus, the claim \"in 2001 there be a category of best support actress\" is **FALSE**.
