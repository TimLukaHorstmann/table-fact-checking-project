We will go through each row to see how many matches were won in two sets.\n\nLet's evaluate the rows:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Result is \"6\u20134, 6\u20131\" - Win in 2 sets.\n2. **Row 1**: Result is \"7\u20135, 6\u20133\" - Win in 2 sets.\n3. **Row 2**: Result is \"6\u20133, 6\u20132\" - Win in 2 sets.\n4. **Row 3**: Result is \"6\u20131, 6\u20130\" - Win in 2 sets.\n5. **Row 4**: Result is \"7\u20136^(7\u20135), 7\u20136^(9\u20137)\" - Win in 3 sets.\n6. **Row 5**: Result is \"4\u20136, 7\u20136^(8\u20136), 6\u20133\" - Win in 3 sets.\n7. **Row 6**: Result is \"6\u20130, 6\u20132\" - Win in 2 sets.\n8. **Row 7**: Result is \"6\u20132, 4\u20136, 6\u20131\" - Win in 3 sets.\n9. **Row 8**: Result is \"6\u20132, 6\u20134\" - Win in 2 sets.\n10. **Row 9**: Result is \"4\u20136, 5\u20137\" - Loss.\n11. **Row 10**: Result is \"6\u20130, 6\u20132\" - Win in 2 sets.\n12. **Row 11**: Result is \"6\u20131, 6\u20130\" - Win in 2 sets.\n13. **Row 12**: Result is \"6\u20133, 1\u20136, 0\u20136\" - Loss (in 3 sets).\n14. **Row 13**: Result is \"6\u20131, 6\u20130\" - Win in 2 sets.\n15. **Row 14**: Result is \"6\u20133, 6\u20134\" - Win in 2 sets.\n16. **Row 15**: Result is \"6\u20130, 6\u20133\" - Win in 2 sets.\n17. **Row 16**: Result is \"1\u20136, 5\u20137\" - Loss.\n18. **Row 17**: Result is \"6\u20130, 6\u20133\" - Win in 2 sets.\n19. **Row 18**: Result is \"6\u20130, 6\u20133\" - Win in 2 sets.\n20. **Row 19**: Result is \"1\u20136, 5\u20137\" - Loss.\n21. **Row 20**: Result is \"6\u20130, 6\u20133\" - Win in 2 sets.\n22. **Row 21**: Result is \"6\u20132, 6\u20131\" - Win in 2 sets.\n23. **Row 22**: Result is \"3\u20136, 6\u20133, 2\u20136\" - Loss (in 3 sets).\n24. **Row 23**: Result is \"3\u20136, 3\u20136\" - Loss.\n25. **Row 24**: Result is \"2\u20136, 1\u20136\" - Loss.\n\nCounting the wins in two sets from the above rows:\n- Rows where the result indicates a win in 2 sets: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21.\n\nThere are 15 wins in two sets. \n\nThe claim states \"thirty match be win in 2 set\", which implies 30 matches won in straight sets (2 sets), but based on the table, only 15 matches meet this criterion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
