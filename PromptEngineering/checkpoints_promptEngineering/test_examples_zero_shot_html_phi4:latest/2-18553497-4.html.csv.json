    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Amr el-safty be only 1 of 2 players on the list to not score in the Egyptian Premier League,\" we need to identify which players have a value of '0' under the column \"egyptian premier league\" and verify if there are exactly two such players. We will also confirm that Amr el-safty is indeed one of these players.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Identify Players with Zero Goals in Egyptian Premier League:**\n   - Go through each row under the column \"egyptian premier league\" to find entries where the value is '0'.\n\n2. **Relevant Rows for Checking:**\n   - Amr el-safty: Check his entry (row index 14).\n   - Totals: This row is not a player and should be ignored for individual counts.\n   - Other players with zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League:\n     - Abdel halim ali (row index 3)\n     - Hani said (row index 4)\n     - Shikabala (row index 5)\n     - Ahmed magdy (row index 7)\n     - Mostafa gaafar (row index 8)\n     - Alaa kamal (row index 9)\n     - Mahmoud samir (row index 10)\n     - Ricardo alves fernandes (row index 11)\n     - Sabry raheel (row index 12)\n     - Wisam el abdy (row index 13)\n\n3. **Count Players with Zero Goals in Egyptian Premier League:**\n   - From the list above, there are 10 players with zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n   - Amr el-safty is one of them.\n\n4. **Verify Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Amr el-safty is one of only two players who did not score in the Egyptian Premier League.\n   - Since there are 10 such players, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We need to include cells that show zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League for all relevant players and specifically confirm Amr el-safty's entry.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
