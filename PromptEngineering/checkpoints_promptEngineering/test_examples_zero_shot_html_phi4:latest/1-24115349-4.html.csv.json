The claim specifically pertains to the percentage of votes that Kennedy received in Bristol County. \n\nLet's identify the relevant data from the table:\n- Locate the row corresponding to \"Bristol\" in the `county` column.\n- Check the value under the `kennedy %` column for this row.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The row for Bristol County is the third row (index 2, considering zero-based indexing).\n- In this row, under the `kennedy %` column, it shows \"1.2%\".\n\nSince the percentage of votes Kennedy received in Bristol County matches exactly with the claim (1.2%), we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThus, the JSON output should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kennedy %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
