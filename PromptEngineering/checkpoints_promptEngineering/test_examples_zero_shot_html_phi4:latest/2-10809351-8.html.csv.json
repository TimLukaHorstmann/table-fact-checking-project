    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare the crowd sizes for two venues: Kardinia Park and Lake Oval.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data in the Table**:\n   - For each venue mentioned in the claim, locate the row in which they are involved.\n   - Extract the 'crowd' values for these rows.\n\n2. **Locate Rows by Venue**:\n   - Look at the \"venue\" column to find entries for Kardinia Park and Lake Oval.\n\n3. **Extract Crowd Data**:\n   - From the table, identify the crowd sizes corresponding to each venue:\n     - Kardinia Park (Row 0): The 'crowd' value is 22500.\n     - Lake Oval (Row 4): The 'crowd' value is 12500.\n\n4. **Compare Crowd Sizes**:\n   - Calculate the difference in crowd size between Kardinia Park and Lake Oval: \n     \\[\n     22500 - 12500 = 10000\n     \\]\n   - The claim states that Kardinia Park has a crowd participant count of 10,000 more than Lake Oval. Our calculation confirms this.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the difference is exactly 10,000 as claimed, the statement is TRUE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - For Kardinia Park: Row index 0, 'crowd' column.\n   - For Lake Oval: Row index 4, 'crowd' column.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
