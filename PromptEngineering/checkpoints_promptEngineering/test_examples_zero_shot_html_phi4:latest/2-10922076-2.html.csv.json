This entry is found in row index 3 (assuming zero-based indexing).\n\n- **Step 2: Verify Total Capacity (MWE) for \"ramakkalmedu\"**\n\n  Once we locate the row with \"ramakkalmedu\", we check the value in the \"total capacity (mwe)\" column. For row index 3, this value is 25.0.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are satisfied based on our verification:\n\n- The power plant located at \"ramakkalmedu\" exists.\n- Its total capacity (MWE) is indeed 25.\n\nGiven that both conditions of the claim are met by the data in the table, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the relevant information formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total capacity (mwe)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

According to the HTML table, this corresponds to `row_index` 1.\n  \n- **Verify the Total Capacity:**\n  - For the row corresponding to \"cape comorin\", we need to check the value in the 'total capacity (mwe)' column. The table shows that the total capacity for \"cape comorin\" is 33.0.\n\n- **Compare with Claimed Value:**\n  - The claim states the total capacity should be 25, but our verification from the table indicates it is actually 33.0.\n  \nSince the actual capacity (33.0) does not match the claimed value (25), the claim is false.\n\nNow let's construct the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"power plant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total capacity (mwe)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object clearly indicates that the claim is false and provides the relevant cells used for verification.",
