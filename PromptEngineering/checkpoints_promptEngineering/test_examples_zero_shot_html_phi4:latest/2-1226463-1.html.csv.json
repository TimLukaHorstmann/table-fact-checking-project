We must check if any entry in the \"entrant\" column specifies or implies his participation during these years:\n\n1. Reviewing the table:\n   - In 1967, the entrant is \"lotus components ltd\".\n   - In 1968, the entrant is \"gold leaf team lotus\", with two entries for different chassis.\n   - From 1969 to 1970, the entrants are various forms of \"owen racing organisation\" and \"yardley team brm\".\n   - In 1971, the entrant is \"bruce mclaren motor racing\".\n   - In 1972, the entrant is \"marlboro brm\".\n   - In 1973, the entrant is \"uop shadow racing team\".\n   - In 1977, the entrant is \"shadow racing team\".\n\n2. Checking for Jackie Oliver's name or associated teams:\n   - The table does not list \"jackie oliver\" as an entrant in any row.\n   - No entries explicitly associate Jackie Oliver with any of these teams during the specified years.\n\nSince there are no explicit mentions of Jackie Oliver participating under any listed entrants from 1967 to 1977, we conclude that the claim is false based on this table.
