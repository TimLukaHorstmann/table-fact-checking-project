    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and verify two main points:\n\n1. **Footscray's Score**: Check if Footscray scored 7.9 in a game during the 1927 VFL season.\n2. **Lowest Score**: Confirm that this score of 7.9 is indeed the lowest score among all games listed.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Footscray's Score\n- Look for the row where \"footscray\" appears in either the \"home team\" or \"away team\" column.\n- In the table, Footscray is listed as the away team in the fourth row with a score of 7.9.\n\n### Step 2: Compare All Scores\n- Extract and compare all scores from both the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns to find the lowest score.\n- Convert each score from its traditional Australian rules football format (e.g., 7.9) into total points for easier comparison:\n  - A score of `a.b` translates to `(10 * a) + b`.\n  \nLet's convert all scores:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Hawthorn: 9.6 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 9) + 6 = 96 \\)\n   - Richmond: 9.20 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 9) + 20 = 110 \\)\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Essendon: 12.12 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 12) + 12 = 132 \\)\n   - South Melbourne: 15.9 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 15) + 9 = 159 \\)\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - St Kilda: 15.7 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 15) + 7 = 157 \\)\n   - North Melbourne: 13.10 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 13) + 10 = 140 \\)\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Melbourne: 10.13 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 10) + 13 = 113 \\)\n   - Footscray: 7.9 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 7) + 9 = 79 \\)\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Geelong: 12.15 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 12) + 15 = 135 \\)\n   - Fitzroy: 12.8 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 12) + 8 = 128 \\)\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Collingwood: 13.5 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 13) + 5 = 135 \\)\n   - Carlton: 14.11 \u2192 \\( (10 \\times 14) + 11 = 151 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Lowest Score\n- From the converted scores, Footscray's score of 79 is indeed the lowest among all the games listed.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim that \"in the 1927 VFL season, Footscray scored the lowest of all the games, with 7.9 at Victoria Park\" is true based on the table data.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- **Footscray's Score**: Row 3, \"away team score\"\n- **Lowest Score Verification**:\n  - All scores from both columns need to be considered for comparison.\n  \nRelevant cells include:\n- Row 3, \"away team score\" (for Footscray's score)\n- Rows 0 to 5, \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" (for verification of the lowest score)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
