    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two aspects of the statement based on the provided table:\n\n1. There should be three tournaments listed between 2010 and 2011.\n2. One of these tournaments must have been won by Peter Senior.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- **Identify Tournaments from 2010 through 2011:**\n  - Review each row in the table for dates within this range (from Feb 14, 2010 to Oct 16, 2011).\n\n- **Row Verification:**\n  1. Row 0: Date is \"Feb 14, 2010\", which falls within the specified date range.\n  2. Row 1: Date is \"Mar 7, 2010\", which also falls within the specified date range.\n  3. Row 2: Date is \"Mar 28, 2010\", which falls within the specified date range.\n  4. Row 3: Date is \"Oct 24, 2010\", which falls within the specified date range.\n  5. Row 4: Date is \"Aug 20, 2011\", which falls within the specified date range.\n  6. Row 5: Date is \"Oct 16, 2011\", which also falls within the specified date range.\n\n- **Count of Tournaments:**\n  - There are six tournaments listed from 2010 to 2011 (rows 0 through 5).\n\n- **Check for Peter Senior as a Winner:**\n  - Look at the \"runner(s) - up\" column in these rows.\n  - Row 8 is outside the range and shows that Peter Senior was runner-up, not the winner.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states there are three tournaments from 2010 to 2011 with one won by Peter Senior. While there are indeed more than three tournaments in this period (six to be exact), none of them were won by Peter Senior; he is listed as a runner-up in a tournament outside the specified date range.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- The \"date\" column from rows 0 through 5, to verify the number and dates of tournaments.\n- The \"runner(s) - up\" column from rows 0 through 5, to check for Peter Senior as a winner.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
