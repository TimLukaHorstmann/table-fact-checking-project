Therefore, the date provided in the claim is incorrect for these entries.\n\n3. **Verify Attendance**:\n   - For the game on \"2006-10-31\" (home), the attendance is indeed 41,978.\n   - Check if this is the highest attendance in the table:\n     - Other attendances are: 35,000; 41,976; 31,471; 41,978; and 23,000.\n\n4. **Determine Highest Attendance**:\n   - The highest attendance recorded in the table is indeed 41,978, which occurs twice (on \"2006-10-31\" against Bordeaux and on \"2006-09-27\" against Galatasaray).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the game on \"2006-10-31\" does have one of the highest attendances, the claim incorrectly references a date in 2009 instead of 2006.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
