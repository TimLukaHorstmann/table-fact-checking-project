We're interested in the row where the date is \"oct 11\".\n\n2. **Check the Columns for the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions that \"the black knight lose to duke\". This involves two pieces of information:\n     - Whether the opponent on October 11th was indeed Duke.\n     - Whether the result of the game was a loss.\n\n3. **Locate the Row and Verify Details:**\n   - From the table, locate the row with the date \"oct 11\":\n     - The row index for this entry is 4 (considering zero-based indexing).\n   - Check the \"opponent\" column in this row to verify if it is Duke:\n     - In row 4, under the \"opponent\" column, we find \"duke\".\n   - Check the \"result\" column in this row to see if the result was a loss:\n     - In row 4, under the \"result\" column, it shows \"loss\".\n\nSince both conditions are met (the opponent is Duke and the result is a loss), the claim is supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We must ensure that the result for this game is listed as \"loss\".\n\n3. **Record Check**: The claim indicates that their record dropped to \"2 - 1\". So, we need to verify if:\n   - Before this game, the record was \"1 - 0\".\n   - After losing this game, it should be \"2 - 1\".\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n- **Row with Date 'sept 27'**:\n  - The table shows that on \"sept 27\", the opponent is indeed \"villanova\" and the result is a \"loss\". This satisfies two parts of our claim.\n\n- **Record Verification**:\n  - Before this game (on \"sept 13\" against holy cross), their record was \"1 - 0\".\n  - After the game on \"sept 27\", their record updates to \"2 - 1\".\n\nAll conditions in the claim are verified against the table data.
