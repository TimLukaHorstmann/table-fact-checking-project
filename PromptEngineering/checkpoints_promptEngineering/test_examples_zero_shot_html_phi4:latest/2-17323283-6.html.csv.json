    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate specific conditions mentioned in the claim against the data provided in the HTML table.\n\n### Claim:\n\"The Philadelphia Flyer record be 40 - 11 - 10 as of February 23rd.\"\n\n### Conditions to Check:\n1. The game must have occurred on February 23.\n2. The opponent for that game must be \"philadelphia flyers.\"\n3. The record after this game must be \"40 - 11 - 10.\"\n\n### Relevant Table Analysis:\n\n- **Row Indexing:**\n  - The table uses zero-based indexing in programming terms, but I'll use one-based indexing to match typical human-readable formats.\n\n- **Checking Conditions:**\n\n1. **Date Check (February 23):**\n   - We need a row where the \"february\" column is 23.\n   \n2. **Opponent Check (\"philadelphia flyers\"):**\n   - For the row with February as 23, we must check if the \"opponent\" column contains \"philadelphia flyers.\"\n\n3. **Record Check (\"40 - 11 - 10\"):**\n   - Finally, verify that the \"record\" column for this game is \"40 - 11 - 10.\"\n\n### Relevant Rows in the Table:\n\n- **Row 11 (index 10):**\n  - Game: 61\n  - February: 23\n  - Opponent: philadelphia flyers\n  - Record: 40 - 11 - 10\n\nThis row satisfies all three conditions of the claim:\n- The game occurred on February 23.\n- The opponent was \"philadelphia flyers.\"\n- The record after this game is \"40 - 11 - 10.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince all conditions in the claim are met by the data in row 11, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
