Pounds should be on the Republican ticket** for one of the offices.\n2. **Edward Lindgren should be on the Workers' ticket** for one of the offices.\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows and columns in the table to find these names:\n\n- First, we need to identify where \"lewis h pounds\" appears under the \"republican ticket\" column:\n  - Look at each row in the \"republican ticket\" column:\n    - Governor: Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.\n    - Lieutenant Governor: Seymour Lowman\n    - Secretary of State: Florence E. S. Knapp\n    - Comptroller: Vincent B. Murphy\n    - Attorney General: Albert Ottinger\n    - Treasurer: Lewis H. Pounds (found in this row)\n    - State Engineer: Roy G. Finch\n\n  Thus, \"Lewis H. Pounds\" is indeed on the Republican ticket under the Treasurer position.\n\n- Next, we need to identify where \"edward lindgren\" appears under the \"workers ticket\" column:\n  - Look at each row in the \"workers ticket\" column:\n    - Governor: James P. Cannon\n    - Lieutenant Governor: Franklin P. Brill\n    - Secretary of State: Lilly Lore\n    - Comptroller: Abraham Epstein\n    - Attorney General: Arthur S. Leeds\n    - Treasurer: Edward Lindgren (found in this row)\n    - State Engineer: Richard J.
