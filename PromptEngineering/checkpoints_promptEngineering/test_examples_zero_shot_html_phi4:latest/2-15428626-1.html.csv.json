    "resp": "To verify the claim \"October 27, 1963 be the date of the game against Houston Oiler,\" we need to check two specific pieces of information from the table: the date and the opponent for each row.\n\n1. **Locate the Date**: We look at the \"date\" column to find any entry matching \"October 27, 1963.\"\n2. **Check Opponent Against**: Once we identify the correct row with the specified date, we check the \"opponent\" column in that same row to see if it lists \"Houston Oiler.\"\n\nHere's how we can verify these steps:\n\n- Inspect each entry under the \"date\" column for the value \"October 27, 1963.\"\n- Identify the corresponding row. In this case, \"October 27, 1963\" is found in row 7.\n- Verify the opponent listed in that same row (row 7) by checking the \"opponent\" column.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n- The date \"October 27, 1963\" corresponds to row 7.\n- In row 7 of the \"opponent\" column, it lists \"Oakland Raiders,\" not \"Houston Oiler.\"\n\nSince the opponent for the game on October 27, 1963, is \"Oakland Raiders\" and not \"Houston Oiler,\" the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 7 in the \"date\" column.\n- Row 7 in the \"opponent\" column.\n\nThe JSON response based on these findings would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is zero-based as per typical programming conventions.",
