Based on our analysis of the table, the value in the relevant cell confirms this statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- We need to specify the row index and column name for verification:\n  - Row Index: The \"moto2\" entry corresponds to row index 3 (considering zero-based indexing).\n  - Column Name: \"pole\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table, we must analyze relevant entries in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions two key pieces of information: \"4 pole\" and \"moto2 class.\"\n   - Thus, we need to examine both the 'pode' (pole) column for the number 4 and see if this corresponds to any entry under the 'class' column that matches \"moto2.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Relevance:**\n   - **Row 0:** \n     - Class: `125 cc`\n     - Pole: `0` (not relevant as it's not equal to 4)\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - Class: `250 cc`\n     - Pole: `0` (not relevant as it's not equal to 4)\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Class: `motogp`\n     - Pole: `0` (not relevant as it's not equal to 4)\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Class: `moto2`\n     - Pole: `4` (relevant because pole equals 4 and the class is \"moto2\")\n   - **Row 4:** \n     - This row represents a total summary rather than specific data for one class, so it's not directly relevant to verify the claim about a single class.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there are \"4 pole\" in association with a \"moto2 class.\" Based on our examination:\n     - Row 3 supports this because it has `4` in the 'pole' column and corresponds to the \"moto2\" class.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on the information available in the table. The relevant cells are from row 3 (index 3) under both the 'class' and 'pole' columns.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
