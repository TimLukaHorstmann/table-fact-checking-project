    "resp": "To verify the claim \"with a final score of 75 - 86, b shaw have 5 assist,\" we must evaluate two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Final Score Condition**: Identify if there is a game with a final score of 75 - 86.\n2. **Assists by B Shaw Condition**: Check whether B Shaw has 5 assists in that particular game.\n\nLet's analyze each condition using the table data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### 1. Final Score Condition\n- We need to look for a row where the \"score\" column matches \"l 75 - 86.\"\n- Checking the first row:\n  - Row 0: \"Score\" is listed as \"l 75 - 86.\"\n\nThis confirms that there is indeed a game with this score.\n\n#### 2. Assists by B Shaw Condition\n- Next, we need to verify whether in the identified row (row 0), B Shaw has 5 assists.\n- From Row 0:\n  - The \"high assists\" column shows: \"b shaw (5)\"\n\nThis confirms that B Shaw had exactly 5 assists in this game.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 0 for the \"score\" and \"high assists\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the required information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The \"series\" value should be \"1 - 1\".\n2. For this series, the \"location attendance\" should be \"boston garden\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n#### Condition 1: Series = \"1 - 1\"\nWe need to find rows where the \"series\" column is \"1 - 1\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 2 has a \"series\" value of \"1 - 1\".\n\n#### Condition 2: Location Attendance for Series \"1 - 1\" should be \"boston garden\"\nNext, check the \"location attendance\" in row 2:\n\n- In Row 2, \"location attendance\" is indeed \"boston garden\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions are satisfied for row 2.
