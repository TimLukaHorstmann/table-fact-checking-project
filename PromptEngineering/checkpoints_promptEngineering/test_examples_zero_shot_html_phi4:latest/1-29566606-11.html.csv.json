    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"big brother will return on September 9, 2011\" is true or false, we need to verify two main components of the claim using the provided table:\n\n1. The programme name should be \"big brother\".\n2. The date of return for this programme should be \"September 9, 2011\".\n\nLet's examine these components in detail using the table:\n\n- **Programme Name**: We locate the row where the programme is named \"big brother\". According to the table, this information is found in the first column labeled \"programme\".\n  \n- **Date of Return**: Once we identify the correct row for \"big brother\", we need to check the \"date of return\" value. This is found in the fourth column.\n\nNow, let's locate and verify these values from the relevant cells in the table:\n\n1. The row with programme name \"big brother\":\n   - Row index: 1 (second row in the body of the table)\n   - Column for programme name: \"programme\"\n\n2. Check the date of return in this row:\n   - Row index: 1\n   - Column for date of return: \"date of return\"\n   - Value found: \"9 September 2011\"\n\nThe claim states that \"big brother will return on September 9, 2011\". The value from the table is \"9 September 2011\", which matches the claim exactly.\n\nBased on this verification:\n\n- The programme name and date of return both match what's stated in the claim.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are:\n- Row index: 1, Column: \"programme\" (to confirm the programme name)\n- Row index: 1, Column: \"date of return\" (to verify the date)\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
