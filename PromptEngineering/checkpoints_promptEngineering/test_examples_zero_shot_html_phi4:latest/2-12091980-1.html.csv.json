    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\" is true, we need to inspect the 'goals for' column in the provided table.\n\nHere's what needs to be done:\n1. Identify the relevant data from the table: The 'goals for' column contains information about how many goals each team has scored.\n2. Check if any value in this column is less than 30, as this would violate the claim that no game was played when the number of goals for a team is below 30.\n\nLet's examine the 'goals for' column row by row:\n\n- **Ottawa Hockey Club**: 90 goals\n- **Montreal Wanderers**: 74 goals\n- **Montreal Victorias**: 76 goals\n- **Quebec Hockey Club**: 57 goals\n- **Montreal Hockey Club**: 49 goals\n- **Montreal Shamrocks**: 30 goals\n\nThe minimum number of 'goals for' in the table is 30, from the Montreal Shamrocks. Since there are no entries with fewer than 30 goals, it supports the claim that no game was played when the goals for were less than 30.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this claim include all rows in the 'goals for' column:\n\n- Row Index 0 (Ottawa Hockey Club): Goals For = 90\n- Row Index 1 (Montreal Wanderers): Goals For = 74\n- Row Index 2 (Montreal Victorias): Goals For = 76\n- Row Index 3 (Quebec Hockey Club): Goals For = 57\n- Row Index 4 (Montreal Hockey Club): Goals For = 49\n- Row Index 5 (Montreal Shamrocks): Goals For = 30\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
