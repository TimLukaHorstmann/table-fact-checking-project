    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"melbourne play at home on june 12 1965\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to verify two conditions from the data:\n\n1. **Team Involved**: The claim involves Melbourne as the home team.\n2. **Date of Match**: The match should be played on June 12, 1965.\n\nWe'll check each row in the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Home Team: Hawthorn\n  - Date: 12 June 1965\n\n  This row does not involve Melbourne as the home team. Therefore, it's irrelevant to our claim.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team: South Melbourne\n  - Date: 12 June 1965\n\n  Again, this row doesn't involve Melbourne as the home team. It's also irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team: Essendon\n  - Date: 12 June 1965\n\n  This row does not involve Melbourne either, making it irrelevant to our claim.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team: Melbourne\n  - Date: 14 June 1965\n\n  Although Melbourne is the home team here, the date is not 12 June 1965. Thus, this row doesn't satisfy both conditions of the claim.\n\n- **Row 4 and Row 5**:\n  - Dates: 14 June 1965 for both rows.\n  \n  Neither involves Melbourne as a home team on the specified date.\n\nAfter evaluating all rows in the table, none support the claim that \"Melbourne play at home on June 12, 1965\". Therefore, the answer is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells needed to verify this are related to the 'home team' and 'date' columns for rows that match either part of the condition (though no row fully satisfies both). However, since we need only those that directly relate to verifying Melbourne as a home team on the specified date:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
