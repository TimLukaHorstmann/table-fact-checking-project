    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the player from Norfolk State wear jersey number (s) 51\", we need to check two pieces of information from the table for a particular row:\n\n1. The player's college or university, which should be \"Norfolk State\".\n2. The jersey number(s) associated with this player, which should be \"51\".\n\nLet's go through the steps to identify the relevant data in the table:\n\n- We need to find the row where the \"from\" column indicates \"norfolk state\". This corresponds to checking each row for the specified value.\n- Once we have identified the correct row based on the \"from\" column, we then check if the \"jersey number (s)\" in that same row is \"51\".\n\nNow, let's apply this process to our table:\n\n1. **Check the \"from\" Column**:\n   - Scan through each row under the \"from\" column.\n   - Row 11 lists \"norfolk state\", which matches the condition.\n\n2. **Verify the \"jersey number (s)\" in the Identified Row**:\n   - For the identified row (Row 11), check the \"jersey number (s)\" value.\n   - The entry for this cell is \"51\".\n\nSince both conditions are met, we can conclude that the claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere's the relevant information formatted as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"from\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"jersey number (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The row index is adjusted to be zero-based as per standard practice in programming and data tables.\n- Row 11 corresponds to `row_index` of 10 because indexing starts at 0. Therefore, the relevant cells for verification are located at `row_index` 10 with column names \"from\" and \"jersey number (s)\".",
