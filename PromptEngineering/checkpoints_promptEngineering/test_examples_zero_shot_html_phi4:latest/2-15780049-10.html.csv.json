The claim states:\n\n1. \"The high point for the Toronto Raptors was Dell Curry (17)\"\n2. \"The high rebound was Antonio Davis (12)\"\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to May 2, which is `row_index = 4` (since indexing starts at 0).\n\n2. **Check the \"team\" Column:**\n   - The claim specifies that Dell Curry scored for the Toronto Raptors.\n   - In the table, `row_index = 4`, the \"team\" column states \"detroit\", indicating that this game was not played by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n3. **Check the \"high points\" Column:**\n   - According to the claim, Dell Curry had the highest points with 17.\n   - In `row_index = 4`, the \"high points\" column is \"dell curry (17)\", which matches the name and score in the claim.\n\n4. **Check the \"high rebounds\" Column:**\n   - The claim states Antonio Davis had the most rebounds with 12.\n   - In `row_index = 4`, the \"high rebounds\" column is \"antonio davis (12)\", which matches the name and number of rebounds in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim about Dell Curry having the highest points and Antonio Davis having the highest rebounds on May 2 is factually correct based on the table data.\n- However, the claim incorrectly attributes these statistics to a game played by the Toronto Raptors, whereas the team was actually Detroit. Therefore, the context of the claim regarding the team (Toronto Raptors) makes it false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- Row 4, \"team\" column: Confirms the team is Detroit.\n- Row 4, \"high points\" column: Confirms Dell Curry's high points.\n- Row 4, \"high rebounds\" column: Confirms Antonio Davis' high rebounds.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table's data against the claim statement: \"4 of the 5 game list be against detroit at the palace of auburn hill.\"\n\nThe relevant columns for this verification are:\n- `team`: To confirm that each game listed is indeed against Detroit.\n- `location attendance`: To check whether the location is \"the palace of auburn hills\" or not.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Team: \"detroit\" (Matches the condition)\n   - Location Attendance: \"the palace of auburn hills 22076\" (Matches the condition)\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Team: \"detroit\" (Matches the condition)\n   - Location Attendance: \"the palace of auburn hills 22076\" (Matches the condition)\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Team: \"detroit\" (Matches the condition)\n   - Location Attendance: \"air canada centre 20138\" (Does not match the condition)\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Team: \"detroit\" (Matches the condition)\n   - Location Attendance: \"air canada centre 20112\" (Does not match the condition)\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Team: \"detroit\" (Matches the condition)\n   - Location Attendance: \"the palace of auburn hills 22076\" (Matches the condition)\n\nNow, summarizing:\n- Games at The Palace of Auburn Hills are in rows 0, 1, and 4.\n- Therefore, only 3 games were played against Detroit at The Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nThe claim stated that \"4 of the 5 game list be against detroit at the palace of auburn hill,\" which is false. Only 3 out of 5 games meet both conditions.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
