    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts:\n\n1. Whether there is only one team founded before 1970.\n2. Whether this team is Fajardo FC.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table and focus on the \"founded\" column since it contains the founding year of each club.\n\n- **Row 0**: Academia Quintana FC, Founded: 1969\n- **Row 1**: Atl\u00e9tico de San Juan FC, Founded: 2008\n- **Row 2**: Bayam\u00f3n FC, Founded: 2009\n- **Row 3**: Fajardo FC, Founded: 2010\n- **Row 4**: Guaynabo Fluminense FC, Founded: 2002\n- **Row 5**: Gigantes de Carolina FC / Boca Juniors Carolina FC, Founded: 1998\n- **Row 6**: Puerto Rico Islanders FC, Founded: 2003\n- **Row 7**: CF Tornados de Humacao, Founded: 1994\n\nFrom this evaluation:\n- Academia Quintana FC is the only team founded before 1970 (1969).\n- Fajardo FC was founded in 2010, which is after 1970.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"only 1 team be found before 1970, that be the fajardo fc\" is false because:\n- There is indeed only one team founded before 1970.\n- However, it is not Fajardo FC; instead, it's Academia Quintana FC.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are in the \"founded\" column for each row. Specifically, we need the founding year of both Academia Quintana FC and Fajardo FC:\n\n- Row 0 (Academia Quintana FC): Founded: 1969\n- Row 3 (Fajardo FC): Founded: 2010\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
