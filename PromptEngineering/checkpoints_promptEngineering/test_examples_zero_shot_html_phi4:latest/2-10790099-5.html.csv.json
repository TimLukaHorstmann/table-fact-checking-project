This is because we need a consistent way to compare scores, and the value in parentheses represents total points scored by that team in a match.\n\n3. **Compare Scores**:\n   - Footscray: 13.14 (92)\n   - Fitzroy: 12.6 (78)\n   - Carlton: 13.15 (93)\n   - North Melbourne: 18.10 (118) - highest score\n   - Richmond: 13.18 (96)\n   - South Melbourne: 14.15 (99)\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Score**: Upon comparing all numerical scores, North Melbourne's score of 118 is indeed the highest among the teams listed.\n\n5. **Verify Claim**: The claim that \"north melbourne have the highest home team score in the list\" matches our findings from the comparison step.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**: Since we're interested in verifying the claim about scores, the relevant cells are those in the \"home team\" and \"home team score\" columns for all rows, but specifically focusing on North Melbourne's row to confirm it has the highest score.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThis JSON includes all scores for verification and focuses on the row where North Melbourne has its score to confirm it is indeed the highest.",

Identify the rows where each venue is mentioned:\n   - **Punt Road Oval** appears in Row 5.\n   - **Arden Street Oval** appears in Row 4.\n\n2. Extract the relevant \"Crowd\" values from these rows:\n   - For **Punt Road Oval (Row 5)**, the crowd number is 10,000.\n   - For **Arden Street Oval (Row 4)**, the crowd number is 12,000.\n\n3. Compare the crowd numbers to see if Punt Road Oval has 2,000 more people than Arden Street Oval:\n   - The difference in crowd size is \\(10,000 - 12,000 = -2,000\\).\n   - This means Punt Road Oval actually had 2,000 fewer people than Arden Street Oval.\n\nSince the claim states that Punt Road Oval has 2,000 more people than Arden Street Oval and our comparison shows it is not true, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to assess the crowd sizes for each game and identify if the crowd at Lake Oval ranks as the third largest.\n\n1. **Extract Crowd Data:**\n   - **Footscray vs St Kilda:** 14,000 (Western Oval)\n   - **Fitzroy vs Geelong:** 13,000 (Brunswick Street Oval)\n   - **Carlton vs Collingwood:** 32,000 (Princes Park)\n   - **North Melbourne vs Melbourne:** 12,000 (Arden Street Oval)\n   - **Richmond vs Hawthorn:** 10,000 (Punt Road Oval)\n   - **South Melbourne vs Essendon:** 28,000 (Lake Oval)\n\n2. **Rank the Crowd Sizes:**\n   - Largest crowd: 32,000 at Princes Park\n   - Second largest crowd: 28,000 at Lake Oval\n   - Third largest crowd: 14,000 at Western Oval\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   The claim states that \"the third largest crowd be on the venue of lake oval\". However, the third largest crowd is actually at Western Oval (14,000), not Lake Oval.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because the third largest crowd was at Western Oval, not Lake Oval.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - We need to examine the \"crowd\" column for all rows and the specific row where Lake Oval appears.\n   - Relevant cells are:\n     - Row 0 (Western Oval) with Crowd of 14,000\n     - Row 1 (Brunswick Street Oval) with Crowd of 13,000\n     - Row 2 (Princes Park) with Crowd of 32,000\n     - Row 3 (Arden Street Oval) with Crowd of 12,000\n     - Row 4 (Punt Road Oval) with Crowd of 10,000\n     - Row 5 (Lake Oval) with Crowd of 28,000\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
