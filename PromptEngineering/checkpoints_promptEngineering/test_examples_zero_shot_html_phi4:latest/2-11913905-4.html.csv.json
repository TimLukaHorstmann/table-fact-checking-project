    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to identify which items in the table are marked as \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\" and then check their associated dates.\n\n1. First, locate the row where the condition is described as \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs.\" This occurs in:\n   - Row 8: The entire row has this description for all columns (\"number & name,\" \"description,\" \"livery,\" \"owner (s),\" and \"date\").\n\n2. Next, extract the date from that row to see if it matches the claim of being \"1956.\"\n\n3. For Row 8:\n   - Column \"date\" has the value \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs.\"\n\nThe claim specifies a date of \"1956,\" but the relevant entry for items undergoing overhaul is not associated with this date; instead, it's marked as \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs.\" Therefore, there is no association between the year 1956 and any item in that state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE**. Here are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"number & name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"description\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"livery\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"owner (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
