    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to identify and verify each part of the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Date Check**: The claim specifies \"on October 25\". We must find a row where the date column matches \"25 October\".\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: For that specific date (\"25 October\"), we check if the opponent column is \"panathinaikos\".\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant rows in the table:\n\n- The first row has the date \"20 September\", which does not match.\n- The second row has the date \"4 October\", which also does not match.\n- **The third row** matches our date with \"25 October\". We then check the opponent column for this row, and it shows \"panathinaikos\".\n- Subsequent rows do not need to be checked further as we have already identified a matching row.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nThe relevant cell information includes:\n- The date \"25 October\" found in the third row under the column \"date\".\n- The opponent \"panathinaikos\" also found in the same row under the column \"opponent\".\n\nThe final JSON response with this information is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table data, we need to evaluate each condition in the claim against the information provided:\n\n1. **Condition**: \"The game with 18843 attendance\"\n   - We will locate the row where the `attendance` column is `18843`.\n\n2. **Condition**: \"Have panathinaikos as opponent\"\n   - For the same row, we check if the `opponent` column is `panathinaikos`.\n\n3. **Condition**: \"With fr round on 25 october\"\n   - Again, in that row, ensure that the `round` column is `fr` and the `date` column is `25 october`.\n\nLet's verify these conditions step by step:\n\n- Looking through each row to find where `attendance` equals `18843`, we identify this value in the fourth row.\n  \n- For that same row (fourth row), check the `opponent`:\n  - The opponent listed is `lokomotiv moscow`, not `panathinaikos`.\n\nSince the condition regarding the opponent (`panathinaikos`) does not hold true for this row, we can already conclude that the claim is false without needing to verify further conditions.\n\nThus, based on our evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those that contain the attendance and opponent data for the row where the attendance matches 18843.",
