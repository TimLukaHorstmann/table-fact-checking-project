The date associated with week 12.\n2. Whether this date matches December 2, 2001.\n\nLet's examine the relevant part of the table:\n\n- **Row index:** This is where each row in the table corresponds to a particular game. The rows are indexed starting from zero. Week 12 would be on the 11th index because indexing starts at 0.\n  \n- **Columns:**\n  - \"week\": Contains week numbers.\n  - \"date\": Contains the dates of the games.\n\nChecking row with `row_index = 11`:\n- The \"week\" column value is \"12\", which matches week 12.\n- The \"date\" column value is \"december 2 , 2001\".\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the claim that week 12 is on December 2, 2001, is true. \n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row index 11 in the \"week\" column, confirming it's indeed week 12.\n- Row index 11 in the \"date\" column, confirming the date as December 2, 2001.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This can be identified directly by scanning the rows for the first column labeled \"week.\"\n\n2. **Check Attendance for Week 12:**\n   - For the identified week (row) 12, examine the \"attendance\" column to see what value is listed.\n\n3. **Compare Claimed Value with Table Value:**\n   - The claim states that on week 12, the attendance was 64217.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Week 12 has an attendance of 52135 (as found in the corresponding row for week 12).\n\n4. **Determine Truthfulness of Claim:**\n   - Since the claimed value (64217) does not match the actual value from the table (52135), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this information are:\n     - The cell in row 12, column \"week\" which verifies it's indeed week 12.\n     - The cell in row 12, column \"attendance\" which contains the actual attendance figure (52135).\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is 11 because table indices in programming typically start at 0.
