    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze each part of it and compare it against the information in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n- \"the singular if the plural be xweer (a) du\"\n\nWe must find a row where the plural is \"xweer (a) du\" and then check if its corresponding singular matches \"tlanka\".\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Plural \"xweer (a) du\":**\n   - We search through each row in the \"plural\" column to find this specific value.\n\n2. **Check the Corresponding Singular:**\n   - Once we identify the row, we check the singular for that row and see if it matches \"tlanka\".\n\n### Table Analysis:\n- **Row 7** contains the plural \"xweer (a) du\".\n- The corresponding singular in Row 7 is \"xweera\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that the singular should be \"tlanka\" when the plural is \"xweer (a) du\". However, the singular for this row is actually \"xweera\", not \"tlanka\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- We need to include the cells from Row 7 that are relevant to verifying the claim:\n  - Singular: \"xweera\"\n  - Plural: \"xweer (a) du\"\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"singular\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"plural\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
