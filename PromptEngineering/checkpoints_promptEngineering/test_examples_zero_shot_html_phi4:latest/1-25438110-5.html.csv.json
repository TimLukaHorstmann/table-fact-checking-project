    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the specific data in the table related to the revenue figures for South Lake Tahoe and Clark County casinos for FY09 (2009).\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"fy09 millions\" column as it contains the revenue figures for 2009.\n   - Specifically, we need to find:\n     - The revenue figure for South Lake Tahoe in the row where the county is listed as \"south lake tahoe.\"\n     - The revenue figure for Clark County (Clark) in the row where the county is listed as \"clark.\"\n\n2. **Extract Revenue Figures:**\n   - From the table, locate the row with \"county\" as \"south lake tahoe\":\n     - Row index 3\n     - Revenue for FY09 (2009): 264 million dollars.\n   \n   - Locate the row with \"county\" as \"clark\":\n     - Row index 0\n     - Revenue for FY09 (2009): 9081 million dollars.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that South Lake Tahoe had more than double the revenue of Clark County casinos in 2009.\n   - Calculate double the revenue of South Lake Tahoe:\n     - Double of 264 = 528 million dollars.\n   - Compare this with the revenue for Clark County, which is 9081 million dollars.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - 528 million dollars (double of South Lake Tahoe) is much less than 9081 million dollars (Clark County's revenue).\n   - Therefore, South Lake Tahoe did not have more than double the revenue of Clark County casinos in 2009.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - For South Lake Tahoe: Row index 3, \"fy09 millions\"\n   - For Clark County: Row index 0, \"fy09 millions\"\n\nThe claim is false based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fy09 millions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fy09 millions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
