    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"juventus hold the average position of 7 with 49 against,\" we need to evaluate the statement based on the given table data:\n\n1. **Position**: The claim states Juventus holds an \"average position of 7.\" In sports standings, a team's position is typically their rank in the league or tournament; it doesn't imply an average value but rather the exact spot they are occupying. According to the table, Juventus indeed occupies the 7th position.\n\n2. **Against**: The claim also mentions that Juventus has \"49 against.\" This refers to goals or points conceded (\"against\"). Looking at the table for the row corresponding to Juventus (row index 6), we see that the value under the column \"against\" is indeed 49.\n\nTo verify these, we examine relevant rows and columns:\n\n- **Row Index**: The position of Juventus in the table is at row index 6.\n- **Column Names**:\n  - For \"position,\" the correct column name is \"position.\"\n  - For \"against,\" the correct column name is \"against.\"\n\nBy checking both conditions against the data, we confirm that:\n\n- Juventus is in the 7th position (not an average but their actual ranking).\n- The number of goals or points conceded (\"against\") by Juventus is 49.\n\nSince both parts of the claim match the table data accurately, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are:\n- Row index 6, column \"position\" for the position.\n- Row index 6, column \"against\" for the number against.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
