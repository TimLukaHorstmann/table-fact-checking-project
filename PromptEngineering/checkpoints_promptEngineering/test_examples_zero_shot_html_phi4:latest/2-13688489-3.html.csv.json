    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if each specified season (2009 Clausura, 2008 Clausura, 2008 Apertura, and 2006 Clausura) has a match where the score is \"1:0\". Let's examine each season one by one using the provided table.\n\n### Examination:\n\n1. **2009 Clausura**\n   - We need to check both matches for this season:\n     - Row with `season = \"2009 clausura\"`, `home = \"olimpia\"`, and `score = \"1:2\"` (row index 12).\n     - Row with `season = \"2009 clausura\"`, `home = \"cerro porte\u00f1o\"`, and `score = \"1:0\"` (row index 13).\n\n   Relevant match found in row index 13 for score \"1:0\".\n\n2. **2008 Clausura**\n   - We need to check both matches for this season:\n     - Row with `season = \"2008 clausura\"`, `home = \"olimpia\"`, and `score = \"1:3\"` (row index 15).\n     - Row with `season = \"2008 clausura\"`, `home = \"cerro porte\u00f1o\"`, and `score = \"1:0\"` (row index 16).\n\n   Relevant match found in row index 16 for score \"1:0\".\n\n3. **2008 Apertura**\n   - We need to check both matches for this season:\n     - Row with `season = \"2008 apertura\"`, `home = \"olimpia\"`, and `score = \"1:2\"` (row index 17).\n     - Row with `season = \"2008 apertura\"`, `home = \"cerro porte\u00f1o\"`, and `score = \"1:0\"` (row index 18).\n\n   Relevant match found in row index 18 for score \"1:0\".\n\n4. **2006 Clausura**\n   - We need to check both matches for this season:\n     - Row with `season = \"2006 clausura\"`, `home = \"cerro porte\u00f1o\"`, and `score = \"1:0\"` (row index 23).\n     - Row with `season = \"2006 clausura\"`, `home = \"olimpia\"`, and `score = \"2:1\"` (row index 24).\n\n   Relevant match found in row index 23 for score \"1:0\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll specified seasons have at least one match with a score of \"1:0\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there are matches for a score of \"0:1\" in the seasons specified by the claim: \"2006 clausura,\" \"2008 apertura,\" and \"2006 clausura.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches for Score \"0:1\":**\n   - We need to find all rows where the score column has the value \"0:1.\"\n\n2. **Check Season Names Against Claimed Seasons:**\n   - For each match found in step 1, we will check if its corresponding season matches any of those specified in the claim.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that a score of \"0:1\" should exist for these specific seasons: \"2006 clausura,\" \"2008 apertura,\" and \"2006 clausura.\"\n   - Note that \"2006 clausura\" is repeated in the claim. We need to ensure it exists with a score of \"0:1\" only once.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Matches for Score \"0:1\"\n\n- **Row 33:** Season is \"2008 apertura,\" Score is \"0:1.\"\n- **Row 41:** Season is \"2007 apertura,\" Score is \"0:1.\" (Not needed)\n- **Row 57:** Season is \"2006 clausura,\" Score is \"1:0.\" (Score doesn't match)\n\n### Step 2: Check Against Claimed Seasons\n\n- For the score \"0:1\":\n  - **\"2008 apertura\"** matches in Row 33.\n  - **\"2006 clausura\"** does not have a matching score of \"0:1.\"\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Claim\n\nThe claim requires:\n- A match for \"0:1\" in both \"2006 clausura\" and \"2008 apertura.\"\n- The repetition of \"2006 clausura\" suggests it should be counted twice if applicable, but there is no second instance.\n\nBased on our findings:\n- There is a score of \"0:1\" for the season \"2008 apertura,\" which matches.\n- There is no score of \"0:1\" for the season \"2006 clausura.\"\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE** because it incorrectly states that there should be a score of \"0:1\" in both \"2006 clausura\" and \"2008 apertura.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the score is \"0:1\" and their corresponding season names:\n\n- Row 33, Column \"Score\"\n- Row 33, Column \"Season\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
