The claim states: \"the player that be pick in round 22 play in rb position.\"\n\nLet's break down and check each condition:\n\n1. **Round:** The claim specifies a player picked in round 22. We need to locate the row where the `round` column has the value 22.\n\n2. **Position:** Once we identify the correct row, we must verify if the player\u2019s `position` is \"rb.\"\n\nNow let's examine the table:\n\n- From the table data provided:\n  - The row with `round = 22` is found in the last two rows of the table.\n  - In that row (`row_index: 21`), the values are:\n    - `round`: 22\n    - `pick`: 3 (this column is not directly relevant to the claim, but it provides context)\n    - `overall`: 198\n    - `name`: al cruver\n    - `position`: rb\n    - `college`: washington state\n\nThe player picked in round 22 indeed has the position \"rb,\" which matches the condition in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

The claim states \"8.0 be the lowest pick number where the overall pick number be 32.\" This means we are looking for the smallest round where the pick number is 8 and the overall pick number is greater than or equal to 32.\n\nLet's break down the relevant conditions:\n1. **Pick Number**: The claim specifies a pick number of 8.\n2. **Overall Pick Number**: We need to check if there exists any row with an overall pick number less than 32 but still having a pick number of 8.\n\nWe will now examine the rows in the table where the pick number is 8:\n- Row 1: `overall = 8`\n- Row 2: `overall = 23`\n- Row 3: `overall = 38`\n- Row 4: `overall = 48`\n- Row 5: `overall = 58`\n- Row 6: `overall = 68`\n- Row 7: `overall = 78`\n- Row 8: `overall = 88`\n- Row 9: `overall = 98`\n- Row 10: `overall = 108`\n- Row 11: `overall = 118`\n- Row 12: `overall = 128`\n- Row 13: `overall = 138`\n- Row 14: `overall = 148`\n- Row 15: `overall = 158`\n- Row 16: `overall = 168`\n- Row 17: `overall = 178`\n- Row 18: `overall = 188`\n\nFrom the above data, we can see that there are rows with an overall pick number less than 32 and a pick number of 8. Specifically:\n- Row 1 has an overall pick number of 8.\n- Row 2 has an overall pick number of 23.\n\nSince both rows have an overall pick number less than 32, the claim is false because there are earlier overall picks with a pick number of 8 that are lower than 32.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying this claim include:\n- Row 1: `overall = 8`\n- Row 2: `overall = 23`\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
