    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Active Years**: The claim states that Titus Ozon was active from \"1947 - 1964\". We need to check if this matches the data in the \"years\" column for Titus Ozon.\n\n2. **Goals Scored**: The claim mentions that Titus Ozon scored \"157 goals\". This needs to be verified against the \"goals\" column for Titus Ozon.\n\nLet's identify the relevant row and columns from the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**:\n  - We look for the row where the name is \"titus ozon\".\n  - From the table, we find that Titus Ozon is in the row with `rank = 10`.\n\n- **Column Verification**:\n  - For the active years, we check the \"years\" column.\n  - For the number of goals scored, we check the \"goals\" column.\n\nNow, let's verify each part of the claim against the table:\n\n1. **Active Years**:\n   - In row with `rank = 10`, under the \"years\" column, it states \"1947 - 1964\". This matches the claim.\n\n2. **Goals Scored**:\n   - In the same row (`rank = 10`), under the \"goals\" column, it shows \"157\". This also matches the claim.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for verification are:\n\n- Row index: 9 (since indexing starts from 0)\n- Columns: \"years\" and \"goals\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160,\" we need to examine the table for players who were active during this period and check their respective goals.\n\nThe relevant column for our analysis is the \"years\" column to identify players active from 1950 through 1965. We also need to verify their \"goals\" against the threshold of 160.\n\nHere's how we can evaluate each row:\n\n1. **Row 10 (Titus Ozon)**: The years listed are 1947 - 1964. This player overlaps with the period from 1950 to 1965. His goal count is 157, which is less than 160.\n   \n2. **Row 9 (Mihai Adam)**: The years listed are 1962 - 1976. This player also overlaps with the period from 1950 to 1965. However, his goal count is 160, which does not satisfy the \"less than 160\" condition.\n\n3. **Rows 1 through 8** and row 5 (Florea Dumitrache) have years listed that do not overlap with the specified range of 1950 - 1965 and are therefore irrelevant for this claim.\n\nGiven these observations, while Titus Ozon meets the criteria, Mihai Adam does not. Therefore, the statement is not fully supported as it claims all goal scores during that period should be less than 160, which is contradicted by Mihai Adam's goals.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n- Row 9: \"years\" and \"goals\"\n- Row 10: \"years\" and \"goals\"\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
