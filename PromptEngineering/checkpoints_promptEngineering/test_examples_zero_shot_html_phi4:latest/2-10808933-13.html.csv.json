The home team is South Melbourne.\n2. The away team is Hawthorn.\n3. The score for South Melbourne is 12.10 (82).\n\nWe will verify these conditions by checking the table:\n\n- **Home Team**: Look at the column \"home team\" to find a row where it says \"south melbourne\".\n- **Away Team**: In the same row, check if the \"away team\" column contains \"hawthorn\".\n- **Score of Home Team**: Confirm that in the same row, the \"home team score\" column has \"12.10 (82)\".\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant row:\n\n1. The row where \"south melbourne\" is listed as the home team is at index 5.\n2. In this row:\n   - The \"away team\" is indeed \"hawthorn\".\n   - The \"home team score\" is \"12.10 (82)\".\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are from row index 5:\n- Column: \"home team\"\n- Column: \"away team\"\n- Column: \"home team score\"\n\nThus, the JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

All entries in the table are for this specific date, so we need not filter by date further.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - We will check both the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns to see if Richmond appears as the away team.\n   \n3. **Row Analysis**:\n\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Home Team: Melbourne\n     - Away Team: St Kilda\n     - Richmond is not mentioned.\n\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - Home Team: Footscray\n     - Away Team: Geelong\n     - Richmond is not mentioned.\n   \n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Home Team: Essendon\n     - Away Team: North Melbourne\n     - Richmond is not mentioned.\n   \n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Home Team: Collingwood\n     - Away Team: Fitzroy\n     - Richmond is not mentioned.\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Home Team: Carlton\n     - Away Team: Richmond\n     - Here, Richmond is playing as the away team.
