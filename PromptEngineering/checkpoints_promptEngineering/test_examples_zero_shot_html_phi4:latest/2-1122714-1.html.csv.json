    "resp": "To verify the claim \"james hunt ran on grid 2 for 73 lap,\" we need to check three specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. The driver is \"james hunt.\"\n2. James Hunt started on grid position 2.\n3. James Hunt completed 73 laps.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the table and verify each condition:\n\n- **Driver Name**: In the first row, under the column \"driver,\" the entry is \"james hunt.\" This matches the driver name mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Grid Position**: Still looking at the first row, under the column \"grid,\" the entry is 2. This confirms that James Hunt started on grid position 2, as stated in the claim.\n\n- **Laps Completed**: In the same row, under the column \"laps,\" it shows 73 laps completed by James Hunt. This matches the number of laps mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 0, column \"driver\"\n- Row index 0, column \"grid\"\n- Row index 0, column \"laps\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the list of relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"grid 23 be a + 4 lap in the time / retire section,\" we need to check two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. The entry with `grid` equal to `23`.\n2. The corresponding `time / retired` for that grid should be `+ 4 laps`.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data points:\n\n- **Grid Number Check**: We search the \"grid\" column for an entry with a value of `23`. Looking through the table, we find:\n  - Row index 12 has `grid` = 23.\n\n- **Time/Retired Check**: For row index 12 (where grid is 23), check the `time / retired` column. We see that it contains `+ 4 laps`.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied for this entry, which confirms the statement as true.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- Row 12, Column \"grid\"\n- Row 12, Column \"time / retired\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to evaluate two conditions for James Hunt based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Number of Laps**: The claim states \"James Hunt have less than 72 lap\". We will check the \"laps\" column for James Hunt's entry.\n\n2. **Grid Position**: The claim states \"a grid 1\", meaning his starting position should be grid number 1. We will check the \"grid\" column for this information.\n\nLet's examine the relevant row in the table:\n\n- For James Hunt:\n  - Row Index: 0\n  - Laps: 73 (in the \"laps\" column)\n  - Grid: 2 (in the \"grid\" column)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the claim based on these values:\n\n1. **Laps Condition**: The claim states he should have less than 72 laps. James Hunt completed 73 laps, so this condition is not met.\n\n2. **Grid Position Condition**: The claim states his grid position should be 1. His actual grid position was 2, so this condition is also not met.\n\nSince neither of the conditions in the claim are satisfied, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"+ 4 lap be not the time / retire for grid 23\", we need to examine the relevant columns in the table: \"time / retired\" and \"grid\". We are looking for the row where the value under the \"grid\" column is 23, and then checking if the corresponding value under the \"time / retired\" column is \"+ 4 laps\".\n\n1. **Locate Row with Grid 23**: Look through the \"grid\" column to find the row with a grid position of 23.\n\n2. **Check Time/Retired for This Row**: Once the correct row is identified, check what value appears in the \"time / retired\" column for that same row.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states \"+ 4 lap be not the time / retire\". If the cell contains \"+ 4 laps\", then the claim would be FALSE because \"+ 4 laps\" is indeed the recorded time/retired. If it does not contain \"+ 4 laps\", the claim would be TRUE.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n- **Row Index**: The row where \"grid\" is 23 corresponds to row index 11 in a zero-indexed system (12th row if counting from one).\n\n- **Grid Value**: In this row, the value for \"grid\" is indeed 23.\n  \n- **Time/Retired Value**: For this same row, under \"time / retired\", we have \"+ 4 laps\".\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the time/retired for grid 23 is exactly \"+ 4 laps\".
