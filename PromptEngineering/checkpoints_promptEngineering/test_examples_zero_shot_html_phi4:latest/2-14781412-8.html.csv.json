Extract the \"gold\" values for each year from the table:\n   - 1982: nadia al - moutawaa\n   - 1986: takashi tomura\n   - 1994: konoshin kuwahara\n   - 1998: jin kanno\n   - 2002: mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski\n   - 2006: ali yousuf al - rumaihi\n   - 2010: ramzy al duhami\n\n2. Check if all gold medalists are different except for 1994 and 1998:\n   - Compare each \"gold\" value to ensure they are unique.\n   - Specifically check the values for 1994 (\"konoshin kuwahara\") and 1998 (\"jin kanno\"). These should be identical to satisfy the claim.\n\n**Verification:**\n- From the extracted data, each gold medalist is indeed different in every year except for 1994 and 1998.\n- However, the values for 1994 (\"konoshin kuwahara\") and 1998 (\"jin kanno\") are not identical. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nTo verify this, we need to look at the \"gold\" column for all rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate it based on the provided table:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time\"**\n2. **\"In Seoul 2 times\"**\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n- The table lists years, locations, and medal winners for specific events. We are interested in determining where \"equestrian\" events were held, specifically focusing on South Korea and Seoul.\n  \n#### Extracting Relevant Information:\n1. **Identify the rows with the location 'Seoul':**\n   - Row 2: Year 1986, Location: Seoul\n     - Gold: Takashi Tomura\n     - Silver: Shuichi Toki\n     - Bronze: Ryuzo Okuno\n\n2. **Check if any other row mentions South Korea hosting more than once:**\n   - There are no additional rows with the location 'Seoul'.\n   - There is a row (Row 4) for Bangkok, 1998, where South Korea won silver through \"sohn bong-gak\". However, this doesn't imply that South Korea hosted in 1998.\n\n3. **Determine if any other country besides South Korea hosted more than once:**\n   - New Delhi (1982)\n   - Hiroshima (1994)\n   - Bangkok (1998)\n   - Busan (2002)\n   - Doha (2006)\n   - Guangzhou (2010)\n\nNone of these locations appear more than once.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- South Korea hosted the event only in Seoul, 1986.\n- No other country has hosted the event more than once according to this table.\n\nThe claim \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time\" is false because South Korea did not host it more than once. The part about Seoul hosting twice is also incorrect since Seoul appears only once in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2, Column 'location': Indicates Seoul as a host.\n- Row 4, Column 'silver': Mentions a participant from South Korea (sohn bong-gak), but does not indicate hosting.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
