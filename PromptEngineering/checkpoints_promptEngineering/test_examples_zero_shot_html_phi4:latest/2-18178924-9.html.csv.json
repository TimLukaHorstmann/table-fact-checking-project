Check the 'against' column for these rows to see if any value is less than 16:\n   - For row index 1, \"against\" is 9.\n   - For row index 3, \"against\" is 9.\n   - For row index 4, \"against\" is 16.\n\nThe claim states that Twickenham, London has matches where the 'against' value is less than 16. We found two instances (rows 1 and 3) where this condition is satisfied:\n\n- Row index 1: \"against\" = 9\n- Row index 3: \"against\" = 9\n\nBoth of these values are indeed less than 16, supporting the claim.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is TRUE.
