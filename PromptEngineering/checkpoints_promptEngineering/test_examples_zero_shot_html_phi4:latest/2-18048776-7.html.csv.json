The table lists \"vijay singh\" as first place with a score of 271 and \"to par\" value of 9.\n   \n2. **\"by finishing 9 under par\"**\n   - According to the table, Vijay Singh's \"to par\" is indeed 9. This confirms that he finished 9 strokes under par.\n\n3. **\"2 stroke in front of Steve Stricker\"**\n   - Vijay Singh's total score is 271.\n   - Steve Stricker\u2019s score is 273.\n   - The difference between their scores (273 - 271) is indeed 2 strokes, confirming that Singh finished two strokes ahead of Stricker.\n\nBased on the analysis above, all conditions stated in the claim are supported by the data provided in the table.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify the stroke difference between the first place golfer and the twelfth place golfer in the table.\n\n1. Identify the scores for each relevant player:\n   - The first-place golfer, Vijay Singh, has a score of 271.\n   - We identify who is in twelfth place by checking the placement rows:\n     - Row with \"t10\" and Tiger Woods has a score of 279.\n     - Row with \"9\" (John Cook) has a score of 278.\n     - The next row after that, also marked as \"t7,\" includes both Billy Mayfair and Davis Love III, who have scores of 277. \n\n   Since the table uses shared rankings (e.g., t4 for tied fourth place), the twelfth distinct golfer is Tiger Woods at a score of 279.\n\n2. Calculate the stroke difference:\n   - The difference in strokes between Vijay Singh's 271 and Tiger Woods' 279 is \\(279 - 271 = 8\\).\n\n3. Conclusion based on the above analysis: \n   - The claim \"only 8 stroke separate the first place golfer from the twelfth place golfer\" is TRUE.\n\n4.
