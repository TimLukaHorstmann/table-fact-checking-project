February 2: Score `3 - 4` (Loss)\n     - Record: `32 - 11 - 7`\n     - Losses = 11\n  2. February 13: Score `2 - 3` (Loss)\n     - Record: `37 - 12 - 7`\n     - Losses = 12\n\n- Continue until identifying the fifth loss:\n\n  1. February 15: Score `6 - 5` (Loss, Fifth Loss)\n     - Record: `37 - 12 - 8`\n     - Losses increase from 12 to 13.\n\n- **Verify if This Should Be a Win:**\n  - The score is `6 - 5`, meaning Detroit won the game.\n  - However, it's recorded as a loss in the record column.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince February 15 was indeed marked as a loss when Detroit won (score of `6 - 5`), this confirms that the fifth loss should have been a win. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object contains the correct answer along with the relevant cells from the table that were used to verify the claim.",
