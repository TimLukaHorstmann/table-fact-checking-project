If one team\u2019s home ground is different from where they played, that team likely traveled.\n\nLet's analyze these components:\n\n- **Date Verification**: \n  We look at all rows for the \"date\" column to find entries corresponding to August 8, 1981.\n\n- **Teams and Venue**:\n  Next, we check if there is a match between \"fitzroy\" and \"geelong\" on that date. If such an entry exists, we determine which team was playing at their home venue (to infer the traveling team).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nUpon examining the table, we find:\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Columns: \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"date\"\n  - Values: \"geelong\" (home), \"fitzroy\" (away), \"8 august 1981\"\n\nFrom this information:\n- The match between geelong and fitzroy occurred on August 8, 1981.\n- Geelong was the home team at VFL Park, implying that Fitzroy traveled to play against Geelong.\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE** because all conditions are satisfied:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
