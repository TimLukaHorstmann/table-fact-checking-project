The game played on February 21.\n2. The score of that game is 5 - 4.\n\nFirst, let's identify which row corresponds to the date \"February 21\" by looking at the 'february' column in the table:\n\n- Row 3 (index 2) has a value of 21 under the 'february' column.\n  \nNext, we verify the score for that row:\n\n- In the same row 3 (index 2), the 'score' column shows \"5 - 4.\"\n\nBoth parts of the claim are consistent with the data found in the table:\n1. The game on February 21 corresponds to row index 2.\n2. The score recorded for this game is indeed \"5 - 4,\" which matches the claimed score.\n\nSince both conditions match, the claim is verified as true.\n\nThe relevant cells that support this verification are:\n- Row index 2 in the 'february' column with value \"21.\"\n- Row index 2 in the 'score' column with value \"5 - 4.\"\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to analyze the table and check if there is a game played on February 24 with a score of \"5 - 4\". Let's break down the relevant columns:\n\n1. **Game Date**: We need to find the row where the date in the \"february\" column corresponds to February 24.\n2. **Score**: Once we identify the correct date, we should check if the score for that game is \"5 - 4\".\n\nLet's examine each row step-by-step:\n\n- **Row 1** (Game 54): Date is February 2, Score is \"1 - 2\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 2** (Game 55): Date is February 4, Score is \"5 - 1\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 3** (Game 56): Date is February 5, Score is \"5 - 1\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 4** (Game 57): Date is February 10, Score is \"4 - 1\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 5** (Game 58): Date is February 12, Score is \"2 - 1\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 6** (Game 59): Date is February 14, Score is \"6 - 2\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 7** (Game 60): Date is February 16, Score is \"2 - 5\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 8** (Game 61): Date is February 17, Score is \"2 - 5\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 9** (Game 62): Date is February 19, Score is \"3 - 4\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 10** (Game 63): Date is February 21, Score is \"5 - 4\". Not relevant.\n- **Row 11** (Game 64): Date is February 24, Score is \"3 - 1\". The date matches but the score does not match \"5 - 4\".\n- **Row 12** and beyond: Dates are after February 24, so they are irrelevant.\n\nThe row with the date February 24 has a score of \"3 - 1\", not \"5 - 4\".
