    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Sydney FC play at Adelaide Oval,\" we need to analyze the relevant columns in the table: specifically, the \"Home Team\" and \"Stadium Name\" columns. The goal is to determine if there's an instance where Sydney FC are listed as playing at Adelaide Oval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - \"Home Team\": This column tells us which team is hosting a particular match.\n   - \"Stadium Name\": This column indicates the venue of each match.\n\n2. **Scan for Sydney FC in Home Team Column**:\n   We need to check if there's any row where \"Sydney FC\" appears as the home team.\n\n3. **Check Corresponding Stadium Name**:\n   For any occurrence of \"Sydney FC\" in the \"Home Team\" column, we will verify what stadium is listed in that row under the \"Stadium Name\" column to see if it matches \"Adelaide Oval.\"\n\n### Examination of the Table:\n\n- Look through each row for the presence of \"Sydney FC\" in the \"Home Team\" column.\n\n  - **Row 18**: \n    - \"Home Team\": Sydney FC\n    - \"Stadium Name\": Adelaide Oval\n\nIn Row 18, Sydney FC is listed as playing at Adelaide Oval.
