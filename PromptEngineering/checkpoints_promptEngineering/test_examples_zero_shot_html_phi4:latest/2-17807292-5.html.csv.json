This directly contradicts the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The players do tie, but for fourth place, not third.\n- Their scores relative to par are \"+ 1\", not \"- 1\".\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are incorrect, we conclude that the entire statement is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nWe need to identify cells relevant to verifying the claim:\n\n1. **Place and Position**:\n   - Row 3, Column \"place\" for Sergio Garc\u00eda.\n   - Row 4, Column \"place\" for P\u00e1draig Harrington.\n   - Row 5, Column \"place\" for Charlie Wi.\n\n2. **Score Relative to Par**:\n   - Row 3, Column \"to par\" for Sergio Garc\u00eda.\n   - Row 4, Column \"to par\" for P\u00e1draig Harrington.\n   - Row 5, Column \"to par\" for Charlie Wi.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
