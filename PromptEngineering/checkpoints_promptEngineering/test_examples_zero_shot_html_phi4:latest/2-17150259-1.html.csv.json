We locate this date in the table under the \"date\" column.\n   \n2. **Competition Type Verification**: The claim specifies that it was a \"friendly\" competition. We check the \"competition\" column for this match to ensure it is labeled as \"friendly\".\n\n3. **Venue Verification**: The claim mentions the venue as \"lugo, emilia - romagna\". This should be verified against the \"venue\" column.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Locate the row with the date \"26 may 1999\":\n  - This corresponds to row index 16 in the table (starting from 0).\n\n- Check the competition type for this date:\n  - The cell under the \"competition\" column at row index 16 is labeled as \"friendly\".\n\n- Verify the venue name for this match:\n  - The cell under the \"venue\" column at row index 16 is listed as \"lugo, emilia - romagna\".\n\nAll components of the claim are verified against the table and found to be correct. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table, we need to examine each condition mentioned in the claim and check them with the relevant cells from the table:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim states \"26 May 1999\". We need to find a row where the date matches \"26 may 1999\".\n\n2. **Venue**: According to the claim, the venue is \"lugo , emilia - romagna\". This needs to be matched with the 'venue' column for the same row.\n\n3. **Competition**: The competition should be labeled as \"friendly\" in that row.\n\n4. **Result**: Finally, we need to check if the result of the match was \"2 - 4\".\n\nLet's verify these conditions against the table:\n\n- Row with index 11 (12th entry) has:\n  - Date: \"26 may 1999\"\n  - Venue: \"lugo , emilia - romagna\"\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Result: \"1 - 4\"\n\nUpon examination, we see that all conditions except the result match. The result in the table is \"1 - 4\", not \"2 - 4\" as claimed.\n\nTherefore, since one of the critical conditions (the result) does not align with the claim, the statement is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from this row that were used to verify the claim:\n\n- Date: Row index 11, Column name 'date'\n- Venue: Row index 11, Column name 'venue'\n- Competition: Row index 11, Column name 'competition'\n- Result: Row index 11, Column name 'result'\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
