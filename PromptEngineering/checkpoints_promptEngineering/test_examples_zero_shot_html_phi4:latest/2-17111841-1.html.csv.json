The relevant cells used to verify this include:\n\n- Row index 3 (since table indexing starts from 0, with row 4 as episode number 1 and so on)\n- Columns \"episode,\" \"original airdate,\" and \"viewers (millions)\" were checked.\n\nThus, the claim is verified as true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
