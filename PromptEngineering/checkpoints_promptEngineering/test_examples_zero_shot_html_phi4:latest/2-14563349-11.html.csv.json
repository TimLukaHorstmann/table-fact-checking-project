The time of the game was \"1:00 pm\".\n\nLet's examine each condition one by one:\n\n1. **Date Check**: In row 8, under the column \"date\", we have \"sun oct 29\". This matches with the claim.\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: In row 8, under the column \"opponent\", we see \"kansas city chiefs\". This matches the opponent mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Location Check**: In row 8, under the column \"location\", it states \"three rivers stadium\". This also matches with the location given in the claim.\n\n4. **Time Check**: Finally, in row 8, under the column \"time (et)\", the time is listed as \"1:00 pm\", which aligns perfectly with what was stated in the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are confirmed to be true based on the information from row 8 of the table, we can conclude that the entire claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n- Row index 8, column \"date\"\n- Row index 8, column \"opponent\"\n- Row index 8, column \"location\"\n- Row index 8, column \"time (et)\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"time (et)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the row index in the relevant cells is 7 because the data presented in HTML tables often starts with a header row followed by data rows starting from index 1 in terms of user perspective, but when accessed programmatically, it often begins at index 0. However, the table seems to be displayed without a separate header row, so we start counting from 0 for our data rows, making \"row_index\" equal to 7 for this particular case (14th row including the header if any).",
