The claim states: \"there be over 15 institution that play in the big ten challenge.\"\n\nLet's break down what needs to be verified:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim mentions \"institution\" and associates them with the \"Big Ten Challenge.\"\n   - We need to verify how many institutions are listed in the table.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - The table lists different sports teams along with various statistics such as wins, losses, home/away/neutral game outcomes.\n   - Each row corresponds to a team or an aggregate category (e.g., \"overall\").\n\n3. **Counting Institutions**:\n   - We need to count how many institutions are listed in the table rows. The relevant data is found under the column labeled \"institution.\"\n   - The \"Overall\" row should not be counted as an institution since it aggregates data.\n\n4. **Relevant Rows for Institution Count**:\n   - Each team name (excluding \"overall\") corresponds to an institution.\n   - We will count each unique team listed in the table, excluding rows that do not represent individual institutions.\n\n5. **Verification Steps**:\n   - Identify and count all rows corresponding to specific teams/institutions.\n   - Exclude any aggregate row like \"overall.\"\n\n6. **Counting Process**:\n   - The institution names are: \n     1. Boston College Eagles\n     2. Clemson Tigers\n     3. Duke Blue Devils\n     4. Florida State Seminoles\n     5. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\n     6. Maryland Terrapins\n     7.

Wake Forest Demon Deacons\n\n- There are exactly 13 institutions listed.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are only 13 institutions, the claim of \"over 15 institution\" is incorrect.\n   - Therefore, the answer to whether there are over 15 institutions in the table is \"FALSE.\"\n\n8. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are all rows with team names under the column \"institution,\" except for the \"overall\" row.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"institution\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be 4 team in the big ten challenge whose win and loss be the same,\" we need to analyze the provided table for teams where the number of wins is equal to the number of losses.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests that there are four teams with an equal number of wins and losses.\n   - We will check each team's \"wins\" and \"loss\" columns in the table.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - For each row (team), compare the values in the \"wins\" column to those in the \"loss\" column.\n   - Identify rows where these two values are equal.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - Boston College Eagles: Wins = 6, Losses = 1\n   - Clemson Tigers: Wins = 9, Losses = 5\n   - Duke Blue Devils: Wins = 12, Losses = 2\n   - Florida State Seminoles: Wins = 6, Losses = 8\n   - Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets: Wins = 4, Losses = 9\n   - Maryland Terrapins: Wins = 10, Losses = 4\n   - Miami Hurricanes: Wins = 2, Losses = 4\n   - North Carolina Tar Heels: Wins = 7, Losses = 7 (Equal)\n   - NC State Wolfpack: Wins = 5, Losses = 8\n   - Notre Dame Fighting Irish: Wins = 0, Losses = 0 (Equal)\n   - Pitt Panthers: Wins = 0, Losses = 0 (Equal)\n   - Syracuse Orange: Wins = 0, Losses = 0 (Equal)\n   - Virginia Cavaliers: Wins = 8, Losses = 5\n   - Virginia Tech Hokies: Wins = 3, Losses = 5\n   - Wake Forest Demon Deacons: Wins = 10, Losses = 3\n\n4. **Identifying Teams with Equal Wins and Losses**:\n   - North Carolina Tar Heels (Row Index 7)\n   - Notre Dame Fighting Irish (Row Index 9)\n   - Pitt Panthers (Row Index 10)\n   - Syracuse Orange (Row Index 11)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are indeed four teams where the wins and losses are equal.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For each of these four teams, both \"wins\" and \"loss\" columns are relevant.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
