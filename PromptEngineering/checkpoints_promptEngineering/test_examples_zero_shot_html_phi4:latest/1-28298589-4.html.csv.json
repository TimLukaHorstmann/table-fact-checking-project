    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about Washington winning against Syracuse in front of 62,418 fans at home, we need to verify each part of this statement using relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Match Participants**: \n   - The claim states that Washington played against Syracuse.\n   - From the table, on September 11 at 7:00 pm, Syracuse is listed as the visiting team and Washington as the home team.\n\n2. **Outcome of the Match**:\n   - The claim mentions Washington won against Syracuse.\n   - In the corresponding row for September 11 at 7:00 pm, under \"result\", it shows \"l 20 - 41\" indicating that Washington lost (since 'l' stands for loss) to Syracuse.\n\n3. **Attendance**: \n   - The claim states there were 62,418 fans.\n   - In the row for September 11 at 7:00 pm, under \"attendance\", it correctly shows 62,418.\n\n4. **Location**:\n   - The claim specifies this happened at Washington's home venue.\n   - For the September 11 game against Syracuse, the \"site\" is listed as \"Husky Stadium Seattle, WA\", confirming it was indeed Washington's home stadium.\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- While some elements of the claim are correct (the attendance and location), the key assertion that Washington won is false. The table shows that Washington lost to Syracuse.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare the attendance of games played at different times of the day: middle of the day (12:00 pm) and late afternoon/evening (1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, and 7:00 pm). The relevant data in the table includes the \"time\" and \"attendance\" columns.\n\n**Games at 12:00 PM (Middle of the Day):**\n- South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida: Attendance = 90612\n- Indiana State vs. Cincinnati: Attendance = 30807\n- Texas Southern vs. Connecticut: Attendance = 37359\n\nAverage attendance for games at 12:00 pm:\n\\[\n\\frac{90612 + 30807 + 37359}{3} \\approx 52926\n\\]\n\n**Games at 1:00 PM (Late Afternoon):**\n- New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh: Attendance = 50120\n\n**Games at 3:30 PM (Late Afternoon):**\n- Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville: Attendance = 51427\n\n**Games at 7:00 PM (Evening):**\n- No. 23 West Virginia vs. Marshall: Attendance = 41382\n- Syracuse vs. Washington: Attendance = 62418\n\nAverage attendance for games at 1:00 pm:\n\\[\n50120 \\quad (\\text{only one game})\n\\]\n\nAverage attendance for games at 3:30 pm:\n\\[\n51427 \\quad (\\text{only one game})\n\\]\n\nAverage attendance for games at 7:00 pm:\n\\[\n\\frac{41382 + 62418}{2} = 51900\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare these averages:\n\n- Average attendance at 12:00 pm \u2248 52926\n- Attendance at 1:00 pm = 50120\n- Attendance at 3:30 pm = 51427\n- Average attendance at 7:00 pm = 51900\n\nThe average attendance for games at 12:00 pm is higher than the attendance for each of the late afternoon and evening games.
