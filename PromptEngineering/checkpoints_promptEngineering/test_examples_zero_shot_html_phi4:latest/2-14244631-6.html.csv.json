The table includes rows with nations and their corresponding gold, silver, bronze, and total medals won.\n2. Each nation in the table (Mexico, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, South Korea) has a \"total\" column showing 1 medal each, except for the final row labeled \"total,\" which aggregates to 6 medals overall.\n\nThe relevant information to verify:\n- The claim involves checking if any country won more than one medal.\n- We focus on the 'total' column because it represents the cumulative number of medals a nation has won.\n\nNow, let's check each row for the total number of medals:\n- Mexico: Total = 1\n- United States: Total = 1\n- Brazil: Total = 1\n- Japan: Total = 1\n- Canada: Total = 1\n- South Korea: Total = 1\n\nSince all nations in the list have exactly one medal, no country has more than one medal. Therefore, it contradicts the claim that \"Canada won more than 1 medal.\" Thus, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify the number of medals each nation won:\n- Row indices: 0 (Mexico), 1 (United States), 2 (Brazil), 3 (Japan), 4 (Canada), 5 (South Korea).\n- Column name for verification: \"total\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
