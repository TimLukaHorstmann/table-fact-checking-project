    "resp": "To verify the claim about the table, we need to check each part of the statement against the data provided:\n\n1. **Highest Gain:**\n   - The claim states the highest gain is 232.\n   - From the table:\n     - Curtiss Brinkley has a gain of 1193.\n     - Doug Hogue has a gain of 232.\n     - Antwon Bailey has a gain of 227.\n     - Delone Carter has a gain of 141.\n     - Tony Fiammetta has a gain of 66.\n     - Rob Long has a gain of 24.\n     - Andrew Robinson has a gain of 35.\n     - Cam Dantley has a gain of 98.\n   - The highest gain is actually 1193 (Curtiss Brinkley), not 232. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Lowest Gain:**\n   - The claim states the lowest gain is 35.\n   - From the table:\n     - Rob Long has a gain of 24, which is lower than 35.\n   - The lowest gain is actually 24 (Rob Long), not 35. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n3. **Highest Long:**\n   - The claim states the highest long is 58 by Doug Hogue.\n   - From the table:\n     - Curtiss Brinkley has a long of 45.\n     - Doug Hogue has a long of 82.\n     - Antwon Bailey has a long of 39.\n     - Delone Carter has a long of 32.\n     - Tony Fiammetta has a long of 58.\n     - Rob Long has a long of 24.\n     - Andrew Robinson has a long of 9.\n     - Cam Dantley has a long of 20.\n   - The highest long is actually 82 (Doug Hogue), but the claim incorrectly attributes it to Doug Hogue as having a long of 58. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n4. **Lowest Long:**\n   - The claim states the lowest long is 20 by Andrew Robinson.\n   - From the table:\n     - Andrew Robinson has a long of 9.\n   - The lowest long is actually 9 (Andrew Robinson), not 20.
