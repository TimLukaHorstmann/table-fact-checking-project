    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"steven beaton have legs won of 18,\" we need to break down and analyze each part:\n\n1. **Name Consistency**: The table lists a player as \"steve beaton\" rather than \"steven beaton.\" This is an initial discrepancy between the name in the claim and the table.\n\n2. **Contextual Meaning**: The phrase \"have legs won of 18\" seems to imply that Steve Beaton has won 18 matches (or some comparable achievement such as legs). In darts, a player can win by scoring three sets of legs (best-of-21 points), but the exact interpretation here is that we're checking for a count of wins or similar achievements.\n\n3. **Checking Table Data**: \n   - We locate \"steve beaton\" in the table, which is at `row_index 9`.\n   - The second column, likely representing matches won or legs played, has a value of `2` for Steve Beaton.\n   - Another relevant column is the fifth one, labeled as having a value of `16`, possibly representing wins, games, or another metric related to performance.\n\n4. **Comparison with Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests \"18\" as the number of something won by Steven Beaton (likely legs). \n   - However, according to the table, Steve Beaton has values that are significantly lower than 18 in both columns examined (`2` and `16`).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the discrepancies in name spelling, column interpretations, and numerical mismatches, the claim does not hold true based on the data provided.\n\nThus, the correct JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Wins (or similar metric)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Legs Won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere, \"Wins (or similar metric)\" refers to the fifth column with a value of `16`, and \"Legs Won\" is the second column with a value of `2`.
