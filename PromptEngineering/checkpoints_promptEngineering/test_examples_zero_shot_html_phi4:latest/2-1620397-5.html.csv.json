    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"3 episodes of Doctor Who featuring a total of 3 characters\" is true or false, we need to evaluate each relevant entry in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Episodes:** The claim specifies \"3 episodes.\" We must locate three rows from the table.\n\n2. **Count Characters for Each Episode:** For these episodes, count the number of unique characters listed under the column \"featuring.\"\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Select Three Episodes\n\nWe'll start by picking any three rows since we need to check a total of three episodes from the table.\n\n- **Row 0** (6eb/a): The Elite\n  - Characters: Tegan, Nyssa, Dalek (3 characters)\n\n- **Row 1** (6eb/b): Hexagora\n  - Characters: Tegan, Nyssa (2 characters)\n\n- **Row 2** (6eb/c): The Children of Seth\n  - Characters: Tegan, Nyssa (2 characters)\n\n### Step 2: Count Total Characters\n\nNow, let's count the total number of unique characters across these three episodes:\n\n- From Row 0:\n  - Tegan\n  - Nyssa\n  - Dalek\n\n- From Rows 1 and 2:\n  - Tegan (already counted)\n  - Nyssa (already counted)\n\nThe unique characters from these rows are Tegan, Nyssa, and Dalek, totaling 3 unique characters.\n\n### Verification\n\nWe need to ensure that no other combination of three episodes results in a different total number of unique characters. However, since the claim only requires any valid set of three episodes with a total of 3 characters, our initial selection is sufficient:\n\n- **Row 0** (3 characters)\n- **Row 1 and Row 2 combined** contribute no additional unique characters beyond those already counted from Row 0.\n\nThus, this combination satisfies the claim. Therefore, the statement \"3 episodes of Doctor Who featuring a total of 3 characters\" is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are:\n\n- **Row 0**: Column \"featuring\"\n- **Row 1**: Column \"featuring\"\n- **Row 2**: Column \"featuring\"\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"featuring\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"featuring\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"featuring\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the release date average 1 every 2 month,\" we need to assess the frequency of releases based on the provided dates in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column for this analysis is \"released\" since it contains the months and years when each series was released.\n\n2. **Extract Release Dates**:\n   - October 2011\n   - November 2011\n   - December 2011\n   - May 2012\n   - June 2012\n   - July 2012\n   - August 2012\n   - September 2012\n\n3. **Calculate Time Intervals**:\n   - From October to November 2011: 1 month\n   - From November to December 2011: 1 month\n   - From December 2011 to May 2012: 5 months\n   - From May to June 2012: 1 month\n   - From June to July 2012: 1 month\n   - From July to August 2012: 1 month\n   - From August to September 2012: 1 month\n\n4. **Count Total Releases and Months**:\n   - Total releases = 8\n   - Time span from October 2011 to September 2012 = 11 months\n\n5. **Calculate Average Release Interval**:\n   - Average interval = Total time span / (Total releases - 1)\n   - Average interval = 11 months / 7 intervals \u2248 1.57 months per release\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"the release date average 1 every 2 month,\" which implies an average of 0.5 releases per month or a release every 2 months.\n   - Our calculation shows approximately 1 release every 1.57 months, not every 2 months.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because the calculated average release interval does not match the claimed interval.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\n\n- The relevant cells are those in the \"released\" column, corresponding to each row of data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"released\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
