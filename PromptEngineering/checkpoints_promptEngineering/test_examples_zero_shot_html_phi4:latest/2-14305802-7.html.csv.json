    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the opponent that played on March 28 be the Colorado Rockies,\" we need to examine specific cells in the provided HTML table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns and Row:**\n   - The column names relevant to this claim are \"march\" (to find the date) and \"opponent\" (to identify which team played).\n   - We will check each row for the value of March equaling 28 in the \"march\" column.\n\n2. **Examine the Table:**\n   - Look through the table rows to find where the \"march\" column has a value of 28.\n   - According to the HTML structure, we go row by row and check the values under the \"march\" column.\n\n3. **Find the Row with March = 28:**\n   - Checking each row:\n     - Rows do not match until we reach row index 13 (zero-based index), where the value in the \"march\" column is indeed 28.\n   \n4. **Check the Opponent for this Date:**\n   - In row index 13, check the corresponding \"opponent\" column to verify if it lists \"colorado rockies\".\n   - The \"opponent\" column in row index 13 also contains the value \"colorado rockies\".\n\n5. **Determine the Truth of the Claim:**\n   - Since both conditions are satisfied (the date is March 28 and the opponent listed is the Colorado Rockies), the claim is supported by the data.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim are in row index 13, specifically from the \"march\" column and the \"opponent\" column.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"the opponent that be present on March 24 be the colorado rockies,\" we must examine the table and identify relevant entries related to the date specified in the claim (March 24) and the opponent mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column for dates**: The table provides a column labeled 'march' which represents the day of the game that took place in March. \n\n2. **Check all rows for the day \"4\"**: Since the claim refers to March 24, we need to find entries where the value in the 'march' column is \"4\". This corresponds to games played on March 4.\n\n3. **Identify the opponent for these dates**:\n   - In row with index 2 (`<tr><td>63</td>`), the date 'march' is 4, and the opponent listed is \"montreal canadiens.\"\n   - There are no other entries in the table where the date 'march' is 4.\n\nSince there is no game recorded on March 24 in this table, it's impossible for the opponent on that day to be the Colorado Rockies or any team. Therefore, the claim cannot be true as per the given data.\n\nBased on these observations:\n- The relevant cells are those corresponding to the 'march' column with a value of \"4\" and their respective 'opponent' values.\n- This involves row 2 for checking the date and opponent.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"march\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
