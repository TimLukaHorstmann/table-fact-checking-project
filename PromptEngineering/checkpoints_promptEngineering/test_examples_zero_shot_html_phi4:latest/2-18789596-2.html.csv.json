We will examine each row's total score to see if China has the highest score.\n\n1. **Russia**: Total = 99.251\n2. **Spain**: Total = 98.334\n3. **Japan**: Total = 97.167\n4. **China**: Total = 96.334\n5. **United States**: Total = 95.500\n6. **Canada**: Total = 95.084\n7. **Italy**: Total = 93.751\n8. **Ukraine**: Total = 92.668\n9. **Netherlands**: Total = 91.667\n10. **Greece**: Total = 91.501\n11. **France**: Total = 90.333\n12. **Switzerland**: Total = 89.250\n\nUpon comparing the total scores, Russia has the highest score with 99.251, followed by Spain and Japan. China's score is 96.334, which is not the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"China scored the best in the event\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell for this evaluation is the \"total\" column for all teams, but specifically we need to consider China's row for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
