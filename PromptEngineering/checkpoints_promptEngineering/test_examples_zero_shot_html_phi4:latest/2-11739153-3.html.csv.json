This involves identifying which games had the most significant crowd and comparing those values.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The claim pertains to the number of attendees at a game, so the relevant column is \"attendance.\"\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data**:\n   - Row 0: October 4, 18,568\n   - Row 1: October 6, 18,568\n   - Row 2: October 10, 18,568\n   - Row 3: October 13, 12,088\n   - Row 4: October 14, 17,174\n   - Row 5: October 16, 14,239\n   - Row 6: October 20, 19,150\n   - **Row 7**: October 21, 18,568\n   - **Row 8**: October 24, 19,289\n   - Row 9: October 25, 16,839\n   - Row 10: October 28, 17,041\n   - Row 11: October 30, 18,568\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum Attendance**:\n   - The highest number in the \"attendance\" column is indeed 19,289 on October 24.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Data**:\n   - According to the extracted data, the claim that the highest attendance was 19,289 on October 24 is true.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The row with date \"October 24\" and column \"attendance\" matches the claimed highest number of attendees.\n   - Additionally, ensure no other dates have higher numbers by checking all attendance values, specifically focusing on any value greater than or equal to 19,289.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by examining all relevant cells in the \"attendance\" column.
