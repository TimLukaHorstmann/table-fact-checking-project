This indicates that he won two sets straight with scores of 6-4 each.\n- On 11 September 2011, the score was 6 - 4, 6 - 3. He also won two sets, but one set was closer with a score of 6-3.\n\nTo determine if his performance was \"slightly better\" on 27 June 2005 than on 11 September 2011, we consider:\n- The margin in each set: On 27 June, he won both sets by the same margin (2 games). On 11 September, one set was won by a larger margin (3 games), while the other was won by the same margin as one of the sets on 27 June.\n\nFrom this comparison, the claim that his score was \"slightly better\" on 27 June 2005 is not supported because:\n- Winning both sets by the exact same margin does not necessarily indicate a \"better\" performance compared to winning one set by a larger margin.\n- The term \"slightly better\" is subjective and typically would mean winning with less effort or resistance, which cannot be conclusively determined from just the scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim that \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin had a slightly better score on 27 June 2005 than on 11 September 2011 is not supported by the data.
