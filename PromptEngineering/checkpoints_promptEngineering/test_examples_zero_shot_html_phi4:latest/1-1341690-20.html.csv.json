We must check whether there is a district named \"Maryland 8\" in the table.\n\n3. **Result of Election**: The claim mentions \"re - elected\". We need to find if, where applicable, Parren Mitchell's election result was \"re-elected\".\n\nNow let's evaluate each relevant condition against the data:\n\n1. **Candidate Name**:\n   - There is a row with an incumbent named \"Parren Mitchell\" in \"Maryland 7\", not \"Maryland 8\". \n   - This indicates that while Parren Mitchell does exist in the table, it's associated with a different district.\n\n2. **District Name**:\n   - The table contains districts: Maryland 1, Maryland 2, Maryland 4, Maryland 6, and Maryland 7.\n   - There is no \"Maryland 8\" mentioned anywhere in the table.\n\n3. **Result of Election**:\n   - In \"Maryland 7\", Parren Mitchell was indeed re-elected as he ran unopposed according to the candidates' data.\n\nSince the claim specifies both a particular district (\"Maryland 8\") and an election result involving Parren Mitchell, but the table does not list a district named \"Maryland 8,\" the entire claim is false. There are no relevant cells in the table that satisfy all parts of the claim simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the answer is FALSE. The only relevant cell for checking the existence of Parren Mitchell and his result is from \"Maryland 7\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
