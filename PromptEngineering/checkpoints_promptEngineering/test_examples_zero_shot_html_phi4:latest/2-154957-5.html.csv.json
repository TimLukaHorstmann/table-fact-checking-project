    "resp": "To verify the claim \"ben frank have 30 cap for the hawke 's bay hurricane,\" we need to evaluate it against the table provided:\n\n1. **Player Name**: The claim mentions \"Ben Frank.\" In the table, there is a player named \"Ben Smith\" listed under the \"wing\" position.\n\n2. **Caps (Appearances)**: We need to find how many caps Ben Smith has. According to the table, he has 23 caps.\n\n3. **Team and Region**: The claim mentions \"Hawke's Bay Hurricane.\" In the table, we see that Israel Dagg is associated with Hawke's Bay and the Crusaders team, not a \"Hurricane\" team.\n\nSince Ben Smith does not match \"Ben Frank,\" he has 23 caps instead of 30, and there is no player named \"Ben Frank\" in the table or any association between Hawke's Bay and a Hurricane team, the claim cannot be verified as true. Thus, it must be false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify each part:\n\n- **Row for Ben Smith** (to check name, caps, and region): \n  - Row Index: 13\n  - Column Names: \"wing\", \"caps\" (23), \"region/team\" (Otago / Highlanders)\n\nThe correct JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"caps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"region/team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
