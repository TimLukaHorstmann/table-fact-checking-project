    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Mina Gerais play 15 and lost 9,\" we need to inspect specific cells in the provided table related to the team \"minas gerais.\" The relevant information includes the number of matches played (\"played\" column) and the number of matches lost (\"lost\" column).\n\n1. **Locate the row corresponding to \"minas gerais\":**\n   - By examining the \"team\" column, we identify that the row for \"minas gerais\" is at `row_index` 7.\n\n2. **Check the \"played\" value:**\n   - The cell under the \"played\" column in this row indicates that \"minas gerais\" played 15 matches. This matches part of the claim.\n\n3. **Check the \"lost\" value:**\n   - The cell under the \"lost\" column for \"minas gerais\" shows they lost 9 matches. However, according to the table, \"minas gerais\" actually lost 9 matches, which does not match the claimed 9 losses as per their row.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- **The claim states that \"minas gerais play 15 and lost 9\".**\n- From the table:\n  - Played: 15 (matches the claim)\n  - Lost: 9 (does not match the claim; the correct value is 9)\n\nThus, the entire claim is not fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- The \"played\" cell at `row_index` 7\n- The \"lost\" cell at `row_index` 7\n\nTherefore, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each team's record against two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Difference of 21**: We must find teams where the \"difference\" column equals 21.\n2. **Against less than 32**: Among those teams with a difference of 21, check if their \"against\" value is less than 32.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant columns in the table to verify these conditions:\n\n- The column names that matter are:\n  - \"position\"\n  - \"team\"\n  - \"difference\"\n  - \"against\"\n\nFor each team listed, we'll extract data from these two columns and check the conditions specified by the claim.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Team: Ypiranga - SP**\n   - Difference = 22 (Row Index 3)\n   - Against = 34\n   \n   This team has a \"difference\" of 22, which is greater than 21. Therefore, this team does not meet the first condition.\n\n2. **Verification of Other Rows**: \n   - We need to check if there are any other teams with a difference exactly equal to 21.\n   - Going through each row:\n     - Row Index 0: Difference = 43\n     - Row Index 1: Difference = 38\n     - Row Index 2: Difference = 35\n     - Row Index 3: Already checked (Difference = 22)\n     - Row Index 4: Difference = -6\n     - Row Index 5: Difference = -7\n     - Row Index 6: Difference = -18\n     - Row Index 7: Difference = -31\n     - Row Index 8: Difference = -30\n     - Row Index 9: Difference = -46\n\n   None of the teams have a \"difference\" of exactly 21.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince no team satisfies the condition of having a \"difference\" of 21, we do not need to check further for the second part of the condition. Consequently, there are zero teams that meet both criteria outlined in the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, as zero teams fulfill the conditions specified.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are those of Ypiranga - SP because it was the only team considered for a \"difference\" close to 21 (i.e., greater than or equal), making it necessary to include in the analysis.",
