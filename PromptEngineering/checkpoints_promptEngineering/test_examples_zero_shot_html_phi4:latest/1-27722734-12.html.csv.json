From the table, the first row shows:\n   - `date`: \"april 17\"\n\n2. **Team Identification**: The claim specifies the Los Angeles Lakers. In the context of basketball teams and historical knowledge, New Orleans refers to the New Orleans Hornets, not the Los Angeles Lakers. However, we need to verify this from the table data.\n   - `team`: \"new orleans\"\n\n3. **Season Verification**: The claim mentions the 2010-11 season. While the table does not explicitly mention the season, historical context tells us that during the 2010-11 NBA season, New Orleans played against Los Angeles in a playoff series. This is crucial for validating the claim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Index 0**:\n  - `date`: \"april 17\" (matches the date mentioned in the claim)\n  - `team`: \"new orleans\" (historically, New Orleans played against Los Angeles Lakers during this time)\n\nGiven these points, we can infer that although the table explicitly mentions \"New Orleans,\" it corresponds to a game where the Los Angeles Lakers were playing at home on April 17 during their 2010-11 season. Therefore, the claim is supported by historical context and the data provided.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

According to the table, there is one entry where `date` is \"April 20,\" which corresponds to `row_index` 1.\n\n- **Verify the location of the game on April 20:**  \n  In this identified row (`row_index` 1), check the column named `location attendance` for the venue. The value in this cell is \"staples center 18997.\"\n\nGiven these findings:\n\n- The game was indeed played on April 20.\n- It took place at the Staples Center.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the table's information.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n1.
