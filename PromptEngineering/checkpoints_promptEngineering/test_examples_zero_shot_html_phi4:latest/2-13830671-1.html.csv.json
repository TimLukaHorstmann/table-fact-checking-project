We must identify rows where the date is \"29 july\".\n\n2. **Home Team**: The claim specifies \"home team melbourne victory\". We need to find a row with both the date \"29 july\" and where \"melbourne victory\" appears in the \"home team\" column.\n\n3. **Score**: Finally, the claim mentions \"have a score of 1 - 3\". For the identified row(s) from previous steps, we must check if the \"score\" is \"1 - 3\".\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- The rows with the date \"29 july\" are row indices 9 and 10.\n  \n- In row index 9:\n  - \"home team\" column: \"new zealand knights\"\n  - This does not match \"melbourne victory\", so this row is irrelevant for our claim.\n\n- In row index 10:\n  - \"home team\" column: \"melbourne victory\"\n  - This matches the specified home team.\n  - \"score\" column: \"1 - 3\"\n  - This matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by row index 10, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThus, the relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- Row index 10, \"date\": \"29 july\"\n- Row index 10, \"home team\": \"melbourne victory\"\n- Row index 10, \"score\": \"1 - 3\"\n\nThe JSON object reflecting our findings would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
