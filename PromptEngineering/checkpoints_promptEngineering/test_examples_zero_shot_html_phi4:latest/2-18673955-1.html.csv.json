    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"there be no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7,\" we need to identify games played on October 30, 1977, and verify their corresponding week numbers in the table.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Date:**\n   - The date mentioned is \"October 30, 1977.\"\n\n2. **Find Relevant Entries:**\n   - Look for entries with the specified date in the \"date\" column.\n\n3. **Verify Week Numbers:**\n   - Check if any game on October 30, 1977, corresponds to a week number greater than 7.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Row 6** has the entry:\n  - `week`: 7\n  - `date`: \"October 30, 1977\"\n  - This is the only entry with this date in the table.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since there is only one game on October 30, 1977, and it corresponds to week 7, there cannot be a game listed for a week greater than 7 on that date.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as there are no games listed for a week number greater than 7 on October 30, 1977.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
