Locate the row where the date is \"august 24.\" This corresponds to the row at index 20 in the zero-based list of rows.\n2. Check the \"record\" column for this row.\n\nUpon examination:\n- The record for August 24 (row index 20) is \"79 - 50.\"\n\nThis matches the claim, which states that the record should be \"79 - 50\" on August 24.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. \n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the record on August 24 be 70 - 50\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant rows and columns in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - The row with the date \"August 24\" needs to be located.\n   - According to the data, this corresponds to the last row (17th row) of the table.\n\n2. **Check the Record Column:**\n   - We need to verify the contents of the \"Record\" column for that specific date.\n   - In the 17th row, the \"Record\" column value is \"79 - 50\".\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states that on August 24, the record should be \"70 - 50\".\n   - Comparing this to what we found in the table (\"79 - 50\"), they are not the same.\n\n4. **Determine Answer:**\n   - Since the value from the table does not match the claimed value of \"70 - 50\", the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cell for verifying this claim is the one in row 17 (August 24) and column \"Record\".\n\nThus, the JSON object that represents our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is zero-based, so the 17th row corresponds to an index of 16.",
