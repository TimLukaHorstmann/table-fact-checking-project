Still plausible as a location.\n   - **Coos Bay**: Coos Bay is a city in Oregon. It's an actual location.\n   - **South Beach**: South Beach refers to a neighborhood in Miami, Florida.

It's a recognizable location.\n   - **New York City (NYC)**: New York City is a well-known city in the United States.\n\nAll titles are either specific places or can be associated with specific locations.
