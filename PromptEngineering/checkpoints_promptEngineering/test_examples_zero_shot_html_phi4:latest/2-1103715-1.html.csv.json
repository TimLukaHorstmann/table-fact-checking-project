This converts to 3 hours and 2 minutes, which is indeed just under 3 hours (specifically, it's less than 3 hours).\n\n- Comparison of Times:\n  - Row for `game = 1`: Time is 3:44 (longer than 3:02).\n  - Row for `game = 2`: Time is 3:57 (longer than 3:02).\n  - Row for `game = 3`: Time is 3:37 (longer than 3:02).\n  - Row for `game = 4`: Time is 3:02.\n  - Row for `game = 5`: Time is 3:53 (longer than 3:02).\n  - Row for `game = 6`: Time is 3:48 (longer than 3:02).\n  - Row for `game = 7`: Time is 3:16 (longer than 3:02).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Game 4 occurred on October 23 and had a duration of 3 hours and 2 minutes, which is the shortest among all listed games.\n- Therefore, the claim \"game 4 have the shortest time of just under 3 hour on october 23\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this information include:\n- The `date`, `time` for Game 4 (`row_index = 3`).\n- All other `time` values across games to ensure no shorter duration exists.\n\nHere's the JSON object summarizing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"at edison international field of anaheim, october 20, the 2002 world series have its second long game,\" we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Date and Location**: Identify if there is a game on October 20 at Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n2. **Game Duration Order**: Determine if this game was the second longest in terms of duration.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps and check against the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Date and Location\n- Check each row for the date \"October 20\" and location \"Edison International Field of Anaheim.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 2 has \"date\": October 20 and \"location\": Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n\nThis confirms that there is indeed a game on October 20 at Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Game Duration Order\n- List all games with their durations from longest to shortest.\n  \nFrom the table:\n- Row 2, \"time\": 3:57 (357 seconds)\n- Row 5, \"time\": 3:53 (353 seconds)\n- Row 1, \"time\": 3:44 (324 seconds)\n- Row 6, \"time\": 3:48 (348 seconds)\n- Row 7, \"time\": 3:16 (196 seconds)\n- Row 4, \"time\": 3:02 (182 seconds)\n- Row 3, \"time\": 3:37 (217 seconds)\n\nOrder of durations from longest to shortest:\n1. Row 2: 357 seconds\n2. Row 5: 353 seconds\n3. Row 6: 348 seconds\n4. Row 1: 324 seconds\n5. Row 3: 217 seconds\n6. Row 7: 196 seconds\n7. Row 4: 182 seconds\n\nThe second longest game is indeed in row 2, with a duration of 357 seconds.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions are satisfied:\n- There is a game on October 20 at Edison International Field of Anaheim.\n- This game is the second longest.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- Row index 2 for \"date\", \"location\", and \"time\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
