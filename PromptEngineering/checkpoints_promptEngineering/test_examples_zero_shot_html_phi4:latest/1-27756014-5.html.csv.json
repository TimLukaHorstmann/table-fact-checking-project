The highest points scored by an individual player in a game during November.\n2. Whether this occurred on November 16 against the Trailblazers.\n\n**Analyzing the Table:**\n\nLet's check each row in the table for the \"high points\" column and identify the maximum value:\n\n- **November 2 (Game 4):** Corey Maggette scored 16 points.\n- **November 3 (Game 5):** Andrew Bogut scored 21 points.\n- **November 5 (Game 6):** John Salmons scored 22 points.\n- **November 6 (Game 7):** Andrew Bogut scored 19 points.\n- **November 9 (Game 8):** Brandon Jennings scored 19 points.\n- **November 10 (Game 9):** Corey Maggette scored 20 points.\n- **November 13 (Game 10):** John Salmons scored 26 points.\n- **November 16 (Game 11):** Brandon Jennings scored 31 points. The game was against the Los Angeles Lakers, not the Trailblazers.\n- **November 19 (Game 12):** Corey Maggette scored 20 points.\n- **November 20 (Game 13):** Brandon Jennings scored 25 points.\n- **November 24 (Game 14):** Keyon Dooling scored 18 points.\n- **November 26 (Game 15):** Brandon Jennings scored 25 points.\n\nFrom these observations, the maximum points scored by a single player in one game during November was indeed 31 points by Brandon Jennings on November 16. However, the claim incorrectly states that this high score occurred against the Trailblazers; it actually happened against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe part of the claim about the highest point score (31 points) is correct, but the game mentioned (against the Trailblazers) is incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim is false based on this discrepancy.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- The relevant cells are those that pertain to \"high points\" and games in November.\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
