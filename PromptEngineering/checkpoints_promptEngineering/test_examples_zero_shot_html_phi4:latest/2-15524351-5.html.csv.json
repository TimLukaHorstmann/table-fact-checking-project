    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate two main points from the given table:\n\n1. The number of games played in North Carolina.\n2. Whether all these games were held at the same stadium.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation\n\n**Step 1: Identify Games Played in North Carolina**\n\n- Look at the \"location\" column to determine which games took place in North Carolina. A game is considered to be played in North Carolina if the location text includes any mention of a city or region within North Carolina (e.g., \"winston-salem, nc\").\n\n**Step 2: Count and Verify Stadium Consistency**\n\n- Once the games are identified as having been played in North Carolina, count them.\n- Check if all these games were played at the same stadium by comparing their locations.\n\n### Evaluation\n\n**Relevant Rows from Table (using Row Index):**\n1. **Row 0**: Location - \"groves stadium winston-salem, nc\" \n2. **Row 4**: Location - \"groves stadium winston-salem, nc\"\n3. **Row 5**: Location - \"groves stadium winston-salem, nc\"\n4. **Row 7**: Location - \"williams-brice stadium columbia, sc\" (Not in NC)\n5. **Row 10**: Location - \"groves stadium winston-salem, nc\"\n6. **Row 11**: Location - \"groves stadium winston-salem, nc\"\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n- Games played in North Carolina: Rows 0, 4, 5, 10, and 11.\n- Total count of games in NC: 5 (not 7 as claimed).\n\n**Stadium Check for NC Games:**\n- All identified NC games were held at \"groves stadium winston-salem, nc\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that there are 7 games played in North Carolina and all at the same stadium. The table confirms only 5 games were played in North Carolina, not 7.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the deacon be shutout 3 time, but never by more than 10 point\" is true or false based on the table provided, we must first understand what the claim implies:\n\n1. **Shutout Definition**: A team being \"shut out\" means they did not score any points in a game.\n2. **Three Shutouts**: The claim asserts that the team had three games where they were shut out (scored 0 points).\n3. **Margin of Loss Condition**: When not shutout, the largest margin of loss should be no more than 10 points.\n\nNow let's verify each part using the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Identify Shutouts**:\n   - We check the \"result\" column to find games where the team scored 0 points.\n   - Relevant rows (indicated by their results) are:\n     - Row 3: `10 / 07 / 1972` vs Maryland, result \"l 0 - 23\"\n     - Row 6: `10 / 21 / 1972` vs North Carolina, result \"l 0 - 21\"\n     - Row 7: `10 / 28 / 1972` vs Clemson, result \"l 0 - 31\"\n\n   There are indeed three shutouts in the games mentioned above.\n\n2. **Check Margin of Loss**:\n   - For non-shutout games, we check if any game had a loss margin greater than 10 points.\n   - Non-shutout results from the table are:\n     - Row 0: `09 / 09 / 1972` vs Davidson, result \"w 26 - 20\" (win, not applicable)\n     - Row 1: `09 / 16 / 1972` vs SMU, result \"l 10 - 56\" (loss margin = 46 points)\n     - Row 2: `09 / 23 / 1972` vs Tennessee, result \"l 6 - 45\" (loss margin = 39 points)\n     - Row 4: `10 / 14 / 1972` vs NC State, result \"l 13 - 42\" (loss margin = 29 points)\n     - Row 8: `11 / 04 / 1972` vs South Carolina, result \"l 3 - 35\" (loss margin = 32 points)\n     - Row 9: `11 / 11 / 1972` vs Duke, result \"w 9 - 7\" (win, not applicable)\n     - Row 10: `11 / 18 / 1972` vs Virginia, result \"l 12 - 15\" (loss margin = 3 points)\n\n   The largest loss margin in these games is 46 points against SMU.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because:\n- There are three shutouts.\n- However, there was a game where the team lost by more than 10 points (specifically, they lost to SMU by 46 points).\n\nNow, let's compile this information into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
