The entries for this column show:\n  - Row 0: \"united states\"\n  - Row 1: \"united states\"\n  - Row 2: \"united states\"\n  - Row 3: \"united states\"\n  - Row 4: \"united states\"\n  - Row 5: \"united states\"\n  - Row 6: \"united states\"\n\n- Although it is true that all players listed are from the United States, there is no information given in the table about the year of the event being 2003 or that these players were participants in the 2003 PGA Championship.\n\nConsidering the above points:\n\n- The claim's specific reference to the \"2003 PGA Championship\" cannot be verified with the provided data since no information on the year or tournament is included.\n  \n- However, based solely on what can be checked (that all listed players are from the United States), that portion of the claim is true.\n\nThus, due to the lack of information about the 2003 PGA Championship in the table, the overall claim cannot be fully supported. Therefore, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant task is to compare the \"total\" values for all players and identify which one is the greatest.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**  \n   We are interested in the \"total\" column because the claim pertains to the highest score among the players.\n\n2. **Extract Values from Each Row:**\n   - Paul Azinger (1993): Total = 149\n   - Davis Love III (1997): Total = 149\n   - Mark Brooks (1996): Total = 181\n   - John Daly (1991): Total = 151\n   - Bob Tway (1986): Total = 151\n   - Jeff Sluman (1988): Total = 154\n   - Rich Beem (2002): Total = 157\n\n3. **Compare the Totals:**\n   We need to find out if 181 is indeed the highest total among these players:\n   - The smallest total is 149, which occurs for Paul Azinger and Davis Love III.\n   - The next higher totals are 151 (John Daly and Bob Tway), 154 (Jeff Sluman), 157 (Rich Beem).\n   - Mark Brooks has a total of 181.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since 181 is greater than all other totals listed, Mark Brooks does have the highest total score among the players.\n\n5. **Verify Row Indexes and Columns:**\n   The relevant cells to verify this claim are located in the \"total\" column:\n   - Mark Brooks (Row Index 2): Total = 181\n   - Paul Azinger (Row Index 0): Total = 149\n   - Davis Love III (Row Index 1): Total = 149\n   - John Daly (Row Index 3): Total = 151\n   - Bob Tway (Row Index 4): Total = 151\n   - Jeff Sluman (Row Index 5): Total = 154\n   - Rich Beem (Row Index 6): Total = 157\n\nThese cells confirm that the claim is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the given table and verify each condition in the claim against it.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim is: \"5 of the 7 2003 PGA Championship players have to par +11.\"\n\n1. **Year Check**: The claim mentions the year \"2003.\" We need to check if any player listed won in 2003.\n2. **Number of Players**: It states there are \"7\" players, which matches the number of rows in the table.\n3. **To Par Condition**: It claims that \"5 of the 7\" have a \"to par +11.\"\n\n### Table Verification:\nLet's verify each condition using the table:\n\n1. **Year Check**:\n   - The table does not list any player who won in the year 2003. All listed years are from 1986 to 2002.\n\n2. **Number of Players**:\n   - There are indeed 7 players listed, so this part of the claim matches the data.\n\n3. **To Par Condition**:\n   - We need to check how many players have \"to par +11.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - John Daly (1991): +11\n     - Bob Tway (1986): +11\n   - Only 2 players have a \"to par +11.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim about the year is false because no player in the table won in 2003.\n- The number of players with \"to par +11\" is also incorrect as per the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify these conditions, we need to check the following cells:\n\n1. **Year Check**: All entries in the \"year won\" column.\n2. **To Par Condition**: All entries in the \"to par\" column.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Row indices 0 to 6 (all rows) for the \"year won\" column.\n- Row indices 2, 3, and 4 for the \"to par\" column (where \"+11\" is listed).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
