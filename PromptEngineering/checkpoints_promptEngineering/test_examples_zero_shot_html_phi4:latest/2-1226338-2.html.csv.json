However, the provided table does not explicitly list entrants' names beyond team names. Therefore, we must assume that any specific claims about drivers like Marc Surer would require additional context or data outside of this table.\n\nNext, let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Count the number of times Marc Surer scored 0 points:**\n   - We need to identify rows where the points are 0 and check if these correspond to races where Marc Surer participated. However, without explicit driver names in the \"entrant\" column, we cannot directly associate any row with Marc Surer.\n\n2. **Count the number of times Marc Surer scored 4 points:**\n   - Similarly, identify rows where the points are 4 and check if these correspond to races where Marc Surer participated.\n\n3. **Compare the counts:**\n   - The claim states that Marc Surer scored 4 points one time less than he scored 0 points. This means the number of times he scored 4 points should be exactly one less than the number of times he scored 0 points.\n\nGiven the table:\n\n- Rows with 0 points:\n  - Year: 1979, Team: team ensign, Chassis: ensign n179\n  - Year: 1980, Team: team ats, Chassis: ats d3\n  - Year: 1980, Team: team ats, Chassis: ats d4\n  - Year: 1986, Team: barclay arrows bmw, Chassis: arrows a8\n\n- Rows with 4 points:\n  - Year: 1981, Team: ensign racing, Chassis: ensign n180b\n  - Year: 1981, Team: theodore racing team, Chassis: theodore ty01\n  - Year: 1983, Team: arrows racing team, Chassis: arrows a6\n\nWithout explicit information linking Marc Surer to any of these teams or entries in this table, we cannot accurately verify the claim.

Marc Surer raced with this team in 1985.\n  \n- In **1986**, \"Barclay Arrows BMW\" is listed with the chassis ARROWS A8 and engine BMW STR-4T/C. Again, Marc Surer raced for this team in 1986.\n\nNow let's verify the points:\n\n1.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points in his 4 races in 1982,\" we need to carefully analyze the provided table and identify relevant information.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim involves a driver named Marc Surer.\n   - It specifies that he scored 9 points across 4 races during the year 1982.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - We need to focus on entries from the year 1982, as specified in the claim.\n   - In the table, there are two rows for the year 1982:\n     - Row with `year = 1982`, `entrant = arrows racing team`, `chassis = arrows a4`, `engine = cosworth v8`, and `points = 3`.\n     - Another row with `year = 1982`, `entrant = arrows racing team`, `chassis = arrows a5`, `engine = cosworth v8`, and `points = 3`.\n\n3. **Checking for Marc Surer:**\n   - The table does not provide driver information directly; it only lists the teams, chassis, engines, and points.\n   - To verify if Marc Surer was involved in these races, additional external data about drivers for the Arrows Racing Team in 1982 is necessary.\n\n4. **Calculating Points for 1982:**\n   - Assuming Marc Surer drove for the Arrows Racing Team in both races (a common scenario for a single driver across multiple entries):\n     - Total points from both rows = 3 + 3 = 6 points.\n   - This total of 6 points does not match the claim of 9 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional information confirming Marc Surer's involvement in these races, and based on the table alone, we cannot conclude that he scored 9 points.\n   - The calculated points (6) do not support the claim of 9 points.\n\nThus, based on the data provided in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThe relevant cells are those from the year 1982 that contribute to the points calculation.",
