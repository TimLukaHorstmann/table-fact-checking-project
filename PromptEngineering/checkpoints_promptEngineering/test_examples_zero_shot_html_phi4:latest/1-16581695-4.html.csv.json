    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if it is true based on the information provided in the table. The claim states: \"the 15th episode in the third season have production code 315.\"\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. **The 15th Episode**: \n   - In the context of TV series tables like this, each entry typically represents an episode.\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the 15th episode.\n\n2. **In the Third Season**:\n   - The table is likely structured by seasons and episodes within those seasons.\n   - \"3rd season\" would correspond to rows where \"no in season\" equals 3 or subsequent numbers up until a new season starts (which would be indicated by a reset or increase of the \"no in season\" column).\n\n3. **Production Code 315**:\n   - We need to verify that this specific episode has the production code \"315.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- The \"no in series\" column indicates the overall episode number across all seasons.\n- The \"no in season\" column indicates the episode number within a particular season.\n\nTo find the 15th episode:\n- We look for where \"no in series\" equals 15. However, it seems like we need to check cumulative episodes across seasons.\n- From the table, the first two rows show episodes 1 and 2 of season 1, so they are not part of season 3.\n\nContinuing through the table:\n- Episodes 3 to 12 (rows 2 to 11) belong to season 1 as indicated by \"no in season\" numbers.\n- Row 12 starts with \"no in series\" = 13 and \"no in season\" = 1, indicating the start of season 2.\n- Continuing this logic:\n  - Episodes 13 to 26 (rows 12 to 25) belong to season 2.\n\nRow 25 has:\n- \"no in series\" = 26\n- \"no in season\" = 14\n\nRow 26 starts with:\n- \"no in series\" = 27\n- \"no in season\" = 1, indicating the start of season 3.\n\nContinuing further:\n- Episodes 27 to 41 (rows 26 to 40) belong to season 3.\n- The 15th episode of season 3 corresponds to row 39, as it starts with \"no in series\" = 41 and \"no in season\" = 15.\n\nFinally, check the production code for this row:\n- Row 39 has a \"production code\" of 315.\n\nThus, the claim is true.
