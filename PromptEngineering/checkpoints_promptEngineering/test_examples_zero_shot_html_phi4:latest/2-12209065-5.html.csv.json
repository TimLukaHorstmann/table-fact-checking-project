We need to ensure all these are considered in our count.\n\n3. **Count the Rows:**\n   - There are 20 rows listed under different dates in the table.\n   - On July 4, there are two separate game records against the Tigers, which adds an additional game for that day, bringing the total number of games played to 21.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The Baltimore Orioles indeed play a total of 21 games during July 1997 according to the data provided in the table.
