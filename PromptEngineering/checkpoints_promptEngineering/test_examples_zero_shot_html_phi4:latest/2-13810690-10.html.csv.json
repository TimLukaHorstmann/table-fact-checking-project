    "resp": "To verify the claim using the provided table, we need to check two parts:\n\n1. The Philadelphia Phillies played at least two double-header games in the 2008 season.\n2. They played two games on three consecutive days.\n\nLet's analyze each part of the claim step by step:\n\n### Part 1: Double-Header Games\n\nA double-header is indicated when \"Doubleheader\" column has entries that are not empty (i.e., they contain a number representing the game). We need to look for non-empty values in this column.\n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n- On **April 16**, there's a mention of `2` under the Doubleheader column, indicating a double-header.\n- On **June 23**, again there's a `1`, suggesting another part of a possible double-header.\n  \nThese entries suggest that at least two double-headers were played.\n\n### Part 2: Playing Two Games on Three Consecutive Days\n\nWe need to find instances where the Phillies had games scheduled on three consecutive days, playing two games on any two of those days. To determine this:\n- Check for back-to-back dates with games (indicated by non-empty cells) in the \"Opponent\" column.\n- Ensure that these cover a span of at least three consecutive calendar days.\n\nUpon reviewing:\n\n- **April 16**: The team played Game 1 and Game 2 as part of a double-header.\n- **April 17**: No game was scheduled (indicating rest).\n- **April 18**: Played against the Mets, satisfying the condition for two games in three days (Games on April 16 and April 18).\n\nThis pattern confirms that they played two games over a span of three consecutive days on April 16, 17, and 18.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are met:\n- The Phillies participated in at least two double-header games.\n- They also had instances where they played two games within three consecutive days.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Doubleheader\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Doubleheader\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Relevant Cells:**\n- **Row 6 (April 16)** and **Row 30 (June 23)** in the \"Doubleheader\" column are specifically relevant because they directly verify the double-header games part of the claim. These entries show instances of double-header play.\n  \nThese cells support the first part of the claim about double-headers, while observing game dates confirms the second part regarding playing two games over three consecutive days.",
