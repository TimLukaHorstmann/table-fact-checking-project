    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table concerning Johan Olsson (SWE) and Yuliya Chekaleva (RUS). The specific assertion in the claim is that \"Johan olsson ( swe ) 1 2 more silver than yuliya chekaleva ( rus ) do.\"\n\nLet's break down this evaluation step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Johan Olsson's Silver Medals:**\n   - Look for Johan Olsson (SWE) in the table.\n   - According to row with index 16, Johan Olsson (SWE) has \"3\" silver medals.\n\n2. **Identify Yuliya Chekaleva's Silver Medals:**\n   - Look for Yuliya Chekaleva (RUS) in the table.\n   - According to row with index 24, Yuliya Chekaleva (RUS) has \"0\" silver medals.\n\n3. **Compare the Number of Silver Medals:**\n   - Johan Olsson has 3 silver medals.\n   - Yuliya Chekaleva has 0 silver medals.\n   - The difference in their silver medals is \\(3 - 0 = 3\\).\n\n4. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Johan Olsson has \"1 2 more silver than\" Yuliya Chekaleva, which seems to be a typographical error. It likely intends to say \"2 more silver than.\"\n   - Since Johan Olsson actually has 3 more silver medals than Yuliya Chekaleva, the claim stating he has only 2 more is incorrect.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is not fully supported by the data.\n   - Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Johan Olsson's silver medals are in row index 16, column \"Silver\".\n   - Yuliya Chekaleva's silver medals are in row index 24, column \"Silver\".\n\nGiven these steps and analysis, here is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

For clarity, Yuliya Chekaleva has 0 silver medals.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data for Johan Olsson:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to \"johan olsson ( swe )\".\n   - According to the table, this is found at `row_index = 17`.\n   - Check the column for the number of silver medals:\n     - Johan Olsson has 3 silver medals.\n\n### Comparison\n\n- Yuliya Chekaleva has 0 silver medals.\n- Johan Olsson has 3 silver medals.\n\nThe claim states that Yuliya Chekaleva should have 2 more silver medals than Johan Olsson. However, in reality:\n- Yuliya Chekaleva has 0 silver medals.\n- Johan Olsson has 3 silver medals.\n\nThus, Yuliya Chekaleva does not have 2 more silver medals; she actually has fewer by 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is **FALSE**.

We find a total of 3 athletes with 2 silver medals, not 10 as claimed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because there are only 3 athletes who won 2 silver medals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Alexey Poltoranin (KAZ) won more medals than anyone else\" is true or false, we need to examine the table and focus on the \"total\" column for each athlete. The total represents the sum of gold, silver, and bronze medals.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify Alexey Poltoranin's row in the table:\n   - Row with `rank 25`: \"alexey poltoranin ( kaz )\"\n   - This row shows a total medal count of 2.\n\n2. Compare this total with other athletes' total medals:\n   - The highest number of total medals in the table is 5, held by Marit Bj\u00f8rgen (NOR) as per her row entry at rank 1.\n   - Other high totals are:\n     - Marit Bj\u00f8rgen: Total = 5\n     - Martin Johnsrud Sundby: Total = 4\n     - Petter Northug: Total = 3\n\n3. Conclude based on comparisons:\n   - Alexey Poltoranin's total of 2 medals is not the highest.\n   - Several athletes have a higher medal count than him.\n\nThus, the claim \"Alexey Poltoranin (KAZ) won more medals than anyone else\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are from:\n- Alexey Poltoranin: Total column in row with rank 25\n- Marit Bj\u00f8rgen: Total column in row with rank 1\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
