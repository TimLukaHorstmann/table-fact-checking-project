Identify the row where the column \"nickname\" has the value \"blue hose\". The table shows:\n   - In the 12th row (index 11), we find the entry for \"presbyterian college\" in \"clinton, south carolina\", with the nickname listed as \"blue hose\".\n\n2. Check the corresponding year they joined a conference by looking at the \"joined\" column value for this row. The table shows:\n   - In the same row (index 11), the \"joined\" year is listed as 1965.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied, we conclude that the claim is true.
