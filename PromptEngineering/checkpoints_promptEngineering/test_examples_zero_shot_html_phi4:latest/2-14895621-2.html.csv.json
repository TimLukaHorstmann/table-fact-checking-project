In the table, the relevant entries for the partner column have \"kang haeng - suk\".\n\n2. **Event Outcome**: The claim states that Hwang Sun finished first (i.e., 1st place). We need to find rows where the event outcome is \"1\" since this indicates a first-place finish.\n\n3. **Year Range**: The events must occur between 1982 and 1985, inclusive.\n\n4. **Different Venues**: There should be three distinct venues where Hwang Sun finished first with her partner Kang Haeng-Suk during these years.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- Row 1: Not relevant since it lists \"world championships\" in all columns.\n- Row 2: Outcome is \"3\", so not a first-place finish.\n- Row 3: Not relevant as it lists \"asian games\" in all columns.\n- Row 4: Outcome is \"1\", year is 1982, venue is \"new delhi , india\", partner is \"kang haeng - suk\". This satisfies the conditions for a first-place finish with Kang Haeng-Suk at one distinct venue.\n- Row 5: Not relevant as it lists \"other open tournaments\" in all columns.\n- Row 6: Outcome is \"1\", year is 1985, venue is \"india open\", partner is \"kang haeng - suk\". This satisfies the conditions for a first-place finish with Kang Haeng-Suk at another distinct venue.\n\nFrom this analysis, we find two instances where Hwang Sun finished first with Kang Haeng-Suk:\n\n- New Delhi, India in 1982\n- India Open in 1985\n\nThere are only two different venues where she finished first within the specified years, not three as claimed.
