    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must analyze each part of the statement against the data in the table:\n\n1. **First part of the claim:** \n   - \"The opponent in the final in 1998 in Rome be Gustavo Kuerten.\"\n   - We need to check if there was a final match in Rome in 1998 and whether Gustavo Kuerton was the opponent.\n   - From the table, the row for 1999 has the event in Rome with an opponent named Gustavo Kuerton. There is no entry for the year 1998 in Rome.\n\n2. **Second part of the claim:** \n   - \"The opponent in the final in 2001 at the Canada (Montreal) championship be Pete Sampras.\"\n   - We need to verify if there was a final match in Canada (Montreal) in 2001 and whether Pete Sampras was the opponent.\n   - The table shows that in 2001, the event in Canada (Montreal) had Andrei Pavel as the opponent. There is no mention of Pete Sampras.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The first part of the claim about 1998 Rome is false because there's no match in Rome for that year.\n- The second part about 2001 Montreal is also false due to incorrect opponent identification.\n\nThus, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's identify relevant cells from the table for verification:\n- For \"the opponent in the final in 1998 in Rome be Gustavo Kuerton,\" no cell matches this condition as there is no row with a match in 1998 in Rome.\n- For \"the opponent in the final in 2001 at Canada (Montreal) championship be Pete Sampras\":\n  - Row index 4 has details for the 2001 event in Canada (Montreal), relevant columns are `year`, `championship`, and `opponent in the final`.\n\nThe JSON response should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
