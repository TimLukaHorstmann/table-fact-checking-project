    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens never partner up in mixed doubles,\" we need to examine each row of the table for instances where both Edgar Michalowski is listed as a male participant in the men's doubles and Monika Cassens as a female participant in the women's doubles. We then check if they are paired together in the mixed doubles column.\n\nHere's how the verification process works:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where both Edgar Michalowski is listed under \"Men Doubles\" and Monika Cassens is listed under \"Women Doubles.\"\n\n2. **Check Mixed Doubles Column**: For each relevant row, verify if they are paired together in the \"Mixed Doubles\" column.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (1979)**: Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens both appear.\n  - Mixed Doubles: Thomas Mundt / Astrid Nippa\n  - They do not partner up here.\n\n- **Row 3 (1980)**: Edgar Michalowski appears, but not Monika Cassens.\n\n- **Row 4 (1981)**: Both Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens appear.\n  - Mixed Doubles: Thomas Mundt / Astrid Nippa\n  - They do not partner up here.\n\n- **Row 6 (1982)**: Edgar Michalowski appears, but not Monika Cassens.\n\n- **Row 7 (1983)**: Both Edgar Michalowski and Monika Cassens appear.\n  - Mixed Doubles: Edgar Michalowski / Monika Cassens\n  - They do partner up here.\n\nSince they are paired together in the mixed doubles event of 1983, the claim is false.
