    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two conditions using the table data:\n\n1. The game against Cliff Wright is one of three games that went for 3 rounds.\n2. All three of those games took place in Hammond, Indiana.\n\nLet's examine each condition step-by-step:\n\n### Condition 1: Games that went for 3 Rounds\n- **Cliff Wright**: Row 0 shows the match was a \"win\" with \"round\" as 3.\n- Other entries:\n  - **LC Davis** (Row 1): Round is 3.\n  - **Jonatas Novaes** (Row 2): Round is 3.\n\nThus, the games against Cliff Wright, LC Davis, and Jonatas Novaes all went for 3 rounds. This confirms that there are three such games, with Cliff Wright being one of them.\n\n### Condition 2: Location of those 3-round Games\n- **Cliff Wright**: The \"location\" in Row 0 is \"Hammond, Indiana, United States.\"\n- **LC Davis**: The \"location\" in Row 1 is \"Valparaiso, United States.\" This does not match \"Hammond, Indiana.\"\n- **Jonatas Novaes**: The \"location\" in Row 2 is \"Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States.\" This also does not match \"Hammond, Indiana.\"\n\nThe games against LC Davis and Jonatas Novaes did not take place in Hammond, Indiana.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince not all three of the 3-round games took place in Hammond, Indiana, the claim is false. \n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- For Cliff Wright (Row 0): \"round\" and \"location\"\n- For LC Davis (Row 1): \"round\" and \"location\"\n- For Jonatas Novaes (Row 2): \"round\" and \"location\"\n\nHere is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
