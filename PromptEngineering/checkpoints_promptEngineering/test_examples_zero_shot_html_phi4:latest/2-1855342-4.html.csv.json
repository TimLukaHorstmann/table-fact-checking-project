    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify it against the given table. The claim states: \"of the respondents for George H W Bush, 1% have no opinion.\"\n\nLet's break down the verification process:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: \n   - We are interested in the column named \"george h w bush\" because the claim is specifically about responses related to this president.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for 'No Opinion'**:\n   - The row corresponding to \"no opinion\" needs to be identified. In the table, it is found as follows:\n\n     | result        | barack obama | george h w bush | ronald reagan | jimmy carter | gerald ford | richard nixon |\n     |---------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|\n     | no opinion    | 1%           | 1%              | 1%            | 3%          | 6%          | 3%            |\n\n3. **Check the Value**:\n   - In the \"george h w bush\" column under the \"no opinion\" row, the value is indeed 1%.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that \"of the respondents for George H W Bush, 1% have no opinion\" matches exactly with what is shown in the table.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table, the answer to the claim's truthfulness is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells:\n\n- The cell at the intersection of the \"no opinion\" row and the \"george h w bush\" column contains the value 1%. In terms of indexing:\n  - The row index for \"no opinion\" is 5 (considering the first row \"result\" as index 0).\n  - The column name for George H W Bush is \"george h w bush\".\n\nThus, the relevant cell is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"george h w bush\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George H.W. Bush,\" we need to examine the table and identify relevant data.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions:\n- \"1 percent\"\n- \"respondents have no opinion\"\n- \"on George H.W. Bush\"\n\nFrom the table structure, it's clear that:\n- The rows represent different opinions or ratings (\"outstanding,\" \"above average,\" etc.), with one row for \"no opinion.\"\n- The columns represent various U.S. presidents.\n\nFirst, we locate the data related to \"no opinion.\" According to the table:\n\n| result        | Barack Obama | George H.W. Bush | Ronald Reagan | Jimmy Carter | Gerald Ford | Richard Nixon |\n|---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|\n| no opinion    | 1%           | 1%               | 1%            | 3%           | 6%          | 3%            |\n\nThis is found in the last row of the table.\n\nNext, we locate the data related to \"George H.W. Bush,\" which is a column titled \"george h w bush.\"\n\nBy examining these two specific parts:\n- The cell under the \"no opinion\" row and \"george h w bush\" column shows 1%.\n\nTherefore, according to the table, 1% of respondents indeed have no opinion on George H.W. Bush.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. \n\nThe relevant cell for verification is located at:\n- Row corresponding to \"no opinion\"\n- Column named \"george h w bush\"\n\nIn terms of index, assuming the first row (\"result\") is indexed as 0 and rows follow numerically (e.g., \"outstanding\" as row 1), \"no opinion\" would be row index 5. The column name for George H.W. Bush is explicitly given in the table headers.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"george h w bush\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
