    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Italy be only ranked number 6 because of a second more in their time,\" we need to consider two aspects:\n\n1. Italy is indeed ranked number 6.\n2. The reasoning that they are ranked number 6 due to having \"a second more\" in their time compared to other teams.\n\nFirst, let's verify the ranking and times from the table:\n\n- **Italy's Rank and Time**:\n  - Row 5 (row_index: 5) for Italy shows a rank of 6 with a time of 6:05.21.\n\nNext, we need to compare Italy's time against other teams' times to see if adding one second would have changed their ranking:\n\n- **Team Times in Order**:\n  - Rank 1: Slovenia, Time = 5:56.08\n  - Rank 2: Czech Republic, Time = 5:58.02\n  - Rank 3: Germany, Time = 5:58.72\n  - Rank 4: Netherlands, Time = 6:02.46\n  - **Rank 5**: Belarus, Time = 6:02.79\n  - **Italy (Rank 6)**, Time = 6:05.21\n\nTo determine if Italy could have ranked higher by having a time one second faster, we need to check if their adjusted time (6:04.21) would be better than the team in rank 5:\n\n- If Italy's time were 6:04.21, it would indeed surpass Belarus' time of 6:02.79, thus placing Italy at rank 5.\n\nThe claim is that Italy is ranked number 6 \"because\" of a second more in their time. Since reducing Italy\u2019s time by one second (to 6:04.21) changes their ranking from 6th to 5th, it supports the notion that having an additional second affects their rank.\n\nThus, the claim is supported as true based on the given data.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Row index 5 for \"rank\", \"time\" (Italy's information).\n- Row index 4 for \"time\" (Belarus' time to compare).\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
