    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze each part of the statement and check it against the data in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown\n\n1. **\"114 be play when point be 107\"**\n\n   - The term \"be play\" refers to the `played` column.\n   - The condition states that `points` should equal 107 when `played` equals 114.\n   - We need to check each row where `played` is 114 and see if any of those rows have `points` equal to 107.\n\n2. **\"when 1987 - 88 be 31\"**\n\n   - The term \"be 1987 - 88\" refers to the column for the year `1987 - 88`.\n   - The condition states that in a row where the `played` is 114, and `points` is 107, the value in the `1987 - 88` column should be 31.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Rows with `played` = 114:**\n\n  We identify all rows where `played` equals 114. These are rows:\n  \n  ```\n  Row Index | Team                      | Points\n  -------------------------------------------------\n  0         | independiente             | 139\n  1         | newell 's old boys        | 136\n  2         | san lorenzo               | 135\n  3         | racing club               | 132\n  4         | ferro carril oeste        | 107\n  5         | instituto de c\u00f3rdoba      | 97\n  6         | racing de c\u00f3rdoba         | 97\n  7         | platense                  | 98\n  ```\n\n- **Check for `points` = 107:**\n\n  Among these rows, we find that only row index 3 (`ferro carril oeste`) has `points` equal to 107.\n\n- **Verify `1987 - 88` value in the relevant row:**\n\n  For row index 3:\n  \n  ```\n  Row Index | Team            | 1987 - 88\n  ----------------------------------------\n  3         | ferro carril oeste | 33\n  ```\n\n  The value for `1987 - 88` is 33, not 31.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31\" is false because, although there is a row where `played` is 114 and `points` is 107, the value for `1987 - 88` in that row is not 31.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n\n- For `played` = 114: all rows with index 0 through 7.\n- For `points` = 107: specifically, row index 3.\n- For `1987 - 88` in the context of points being 107 and played being 114: row index 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1987 - 88\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
