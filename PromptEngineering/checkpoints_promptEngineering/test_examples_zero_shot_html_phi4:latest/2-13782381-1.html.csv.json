    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the average result for week 13 be l 28 - 17\", we need to focus on the following aspects:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant week**: The claim specifically mentions Week 13, so we will look at the entry corresponding to this week.\n\n2. **Check the game details for Week 13**:\n   - Locate the row in the table that corresponds to Week 13.\n   - Check the \"result\" column for the specific result of this game.\n   \n3. **Understand the claim about average**: The claim states an average, but it only provides one data point (the result for Week 13). Since there is no other week's result provided for comparison or calculation of an average, we can interpret the statement as implying that the result for Week 13 itself should be \"l 28 - 17\". Therefore, we need to verify if this matches exactly.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Look at Row 12 (since it is zero-indexed and Week 13 corresponds to index 12 in a list format), which is:\n     - Week: 13\n     - Result: l 28 - 17\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The result for Week 13 matches exactly with the claim of \"l 28 - 17\". Since there are no other data points provided or needed, the claim about the average (in this specific interpretation) is true.\n\n6. **Relevant cells**: The only relevant cell to verify this claim is in Row 12 under the \"result\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17\" is true or false, we need to verify the specific game results against the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Locate Week 12**: According to the table, week 12 corresponds to the row where:\n   - `week`: 12\n   - `date`: 1984-11-18\n   - `opponent`: Houston Oilers\n   - `result`: l 31 - 20\n   - `game site`: the astrodome\n   - `attendance`: 40141\n\n2. **Interpretation of Claim**: The claim suggests that for week 12, the game result should be \"28 - 17\" (implying a win or specific scores), which appears to be incorrect because:\n   - Week 12 actually lists the score as \"31 - 20\" with an 'l' indicating a loss.\n   \n3. **Relevance of Cells**: To verify, we need to check the relevant cells from week 12 that contain the game result and confirm it does not match the claimed scores:\n   - `result`: The actual result is \"l 31 - 20\", whereas the claim states an average or specific result of \"28 - 17\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the table clearly shows a different score (31 - 20) for week 12, and it indicates a loss rather than any form of win matching \"28 - 17,\" the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response indicates that the claim about week 12's result being \"28 - 17\" is false and identifies the specific cell relevant to this determination.",
