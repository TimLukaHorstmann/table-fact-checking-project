They played the Dallas Cowboys after their game against the New York Jets.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps and information from the table:\n\n- **Checking the game against the New York Jets**:\n  - In row 0, we find that there is a match on \"September 4, 2003\" with the opponent listed as \"New York Jets\". This confirms the first part of the claim.\n\n- **Checking the sequence of games against the Dallas Cowboys**:\n  - The game against the New York Jets (row 0) occurred in week 1.\n  - The next occurrence of a game against the Dallas Cowboys is found in row 8, during \"Week 9\" on \"November 2, 2003\". This confirms that their match against the Dallas Cowboys happened after the game against the New York Jets.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The claim states: \"in 2003, the Washington Redkins play the New York Jets before they play the Dallas Cowboys\".\n- We have verified that the Redskins did indeed play the New York Jets in week 1 and then played the Dallas Cowboys in week 9 of 2003.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are satisfied.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row 0: Contains information about the game against the New York Jets.\n  - Column \"opponent\" (or similar context for opponent name): Relevant to confirm they played the New York Jets.\n  \n- Row 8: Contains information about the game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n  - Column \"opponent\": Relevant to confirm they played the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe relevant cells are those from row 0 and row 8, specifically in the column that indicates the opponent of each game. \n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine how many games were played away from FedEx Field by the Washington Redskins in the year 2003 according to the table provided.\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"game site,\" as it indicates where each game was played. The home field for the Washington Redskins during that period was FedEx Field, so any game not listed as \"FedEx Field\" would be an away game.\n\nLet's examine each row and identify whether the game location is different from FedEx Field:\n\n1. Week 1: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n2. Week 2: Game site is \"georgia dome\" (away game).\n3. Week 3: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n4. Week 4: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n5. Week 5: Game site is \"lincoln financial field\" (away game).\n6. Week 6: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n7. Week 7: Game site is \"ralph wilson stadium\" (away game).\n8. Week 9: Game site is \"texas stadium\" (away game).\n9. Week 10: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n10. Week 11: Game site is \"ericsson stadium\" (away game).\n11. Week 12: Game site is \"pro player stadium\" (away game).\n12. Week 13: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n13. Week 14: Game site is \"giants stadium\" (away game).\n14. Week 15: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n15. Week 16: Game site is \"soldier field\" (away game).\n16. Week 17: Game site is \"fedex field\" (home game).\n\nFrom the analysis, the away games are located in:\n- Georgia Dome\n- Lincoln Financial Field\n- Ralph Wilson Stadium\n- Texas Stadium\n- Ericsson Stadium\n- Pro Player Stadium\n- Giants Stadium\n- Soldier Field\n\nThis totals to 8 away games.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"in 2003, the Washington Redskinds play 8 away games\" is correct.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the redskin play 10 home game in 2003\" is true or false, we need to focus on the column labeled \"game site\" and check which games were played at a home venue for the Redskins.\n\nFrom what we know about NFL teams' typical practice, a team's \"home\" field is where they usually host their home games. For Washington Commanders (formerly known as the Redskins), Fedex Field was their home stadium during 2003.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant row in the table:\n\n1. **Week 1**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n2. **Week 2**: Game site - Georgia dome (Away)\n3. **Week 3**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n4. **Week 4**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n5. **Week 5**: Game site - Lincoln financial field (Away)\n6. **Week 6**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n7. **Week 7**: Game site - Ralph wilson stadium (Away)\n8. **Week 9**: Game site - Texas stadium (Away)\n9. **Week 10**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n10. **Week 11**: Game site - Ericsson stadium (Away)\n11. **Week 12**: Game site - Pro player stadium (Away)\n12. **Week 13**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n13. **Week 14**: Game site - Giants stadium (Away)\n14. **Week 15**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n15. **Week 16**: Game site - Soldier field (Away)\n16. **Week 17**: Game site - Fedex field (Home)\n\nCounting the home games, we find:\n\n- Home Games: Weeks 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, and 17\n\nThis totals to 8 home games in 2003 for the Redskins.\n\nThus, the claim that they played \"10 home game\" is false.

This indicates that the team played at their home stadium.\n\n2. **Identify Away Games:** An away game is any game where the \"game site\" does not match \"fedex field\".\n\nNow, let's examine each row of the table:\n\n- **Home Games (FedEx Field):**\n  - Row 0: Week 1, Date: September 4, 2003, Game Site: FedEx Field\n  - Row 2: Week 3, Date: September 21, 2003, Game Site: FedEx Field\n  - Row 3: Week 4, Date: September 28, 2003, Game Site: FedEx Field\n  - Row 5: Week 6, Date: October 12, 2003, Game Site: FedEx Field\n  - Row 12: Week 13, Date: November 30, 2003, Game Site: FedEx Field\n  - Row 14: Week 15, Date: December 14, 2003, Game Site: FedEx Field (Note: This is an away game as the site is Giants Stadium)\n  - Row 16: Week 17, Date: December 27, 2003, Game Site: FedEx Field\n\nTotal home games = 6\n\n- **Away Games (Not FedEx Field):**\n  - Row 1: Week 2, Date: September 11, 2003, Game Site: Giants Stadium\n  - Row 4: Week 5, Date: October 19, 2003, Game Site: Lincoln Financial Field\n  - Row 6: Week 7, Date: October 26, 2003, Game Site: Raymond James Stadium\n  - Row 7: Week 8, Date: November 2, 2003, Game Site: Qualcomm Stadium\n  - Row 8: Week 9, Date: November 16, 2003, Game Site: Qwest Field\n  - Row 9: Week 10, Date: November 23, 2003, Game Site: Pro Player Stadium\n  - Row 10: Week 11, Date: December 7, 2003, Game Site: Soldier Field\n  - Row 11: Week 12, Date: December 21, 2003, Game Site: Giants Stadium\n\nTotal away games = 8\n\nAfter counting the home and away games, we find that the team played 6 home games and 8 away games.

Whether this attendance figure was higher than any other recorded in the table.\n\nFirstly, let's extract the relevant data from the table regarding the Redskins' games:\n- **December 14, 2003**: Played against Chicago Bears at Soldier Field with an attendance of 61,719.0.\n  \nNext, we compare this attendance number to all other recorded attendances for each game in the table:\n\n1. September 4, 2003: Attendance = 85,420.0\n2. September 14, 2003: Attendance = 70,241.0\n3. September 21, 2003: Attendance = 84,856.0\n4. September 28, 2003: Attendance = 83,632.0\n5. October 5, 2003: Attendance = 67,792.0\n6. October 12, 2003: Attendance = 85,490.0\n7. October 19, 2003: Attendance = 73,149.0\n8. November 2, 2003: Attendance = 64,002.0\n9.

December 27, 2003: Attendance = 76,766.0\n\nFrom this comparison, it is evident that the attendance on December 14, 2003, of 61,719.0 against the Chicago Bears was not the highest among any of the listed games.\n\nThe claim specifies \"the highest attendance for the redskin in 2003 december 14 against the cowboy.\" However, two issues arise:\n- The game on December 14, 2003, was against the Chicago Bears, not the Dallas Cowboys.\n- The attendance of 61,719.0 is not the highest recorded attendance.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are false.
