    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if the Caen circuit was commonly used as the Aintree circuit during the 1956 Formula One season based on the given table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - The claim involves two circuits: Caen and Aintree.\n   - We need to check how often each of these circuits is mentioned in the \"circuit\" column.\n\n2. **Examine the Table:**\n   - Look for rows where the circuit is either \"Caen\" or \"Aintree\".\n\n3. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - Count how many times \"Caen\" appears as a circuit.\n   - Count how many times \"Aintree\" appears as a circuit.\n\n4. **Compare Frequencies:**\n   - If \"Caen\" and \"Aintree\" appear with similar frequency, the claim might be supported.\n   - If \"Aintree\" appears significantly more often than \"Caen\", the claim is likely false.\n\n5. **Analysis of Table Data:**\n\n   - **Aintree Circuit:**\n     - Appears in rows 3 and 6:\n       - Row 3: xi barc aintree 200\n       - Row 6: i aintree 100\n\n   - **Caen Circuit:**\n     - Appears in row 9:\n       - Row 9: iv grand prix de caen\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - \"Aintree\" appears twice.\n   - \"Caen\" appears once.\n\nGiven that Aintree is mentioned more frequently than Caen, the claim that \"the Caen circuit be commonly use as the aintree circuit in the 1956 formula one season\" is not supported by the data. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
