    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Bob Beamon have recently set his long jump record,\" we need to verify if Bob Beamon's performance is recent according to the data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - The claim mentions Bob Beamon, so we should locate his entry in the table.\n   - We need to check the date of his record and compare it with other entries to determine if it is recent.\n\n2. **Locate Bob Beamon's Entry**:\n   - Bob Beamon's record is found in the second row of the table.\n   - The relevant columns for this claim are \"athlete\" (to identify Bob Beamon), \"date\" (to check when his record was set), and potentially \"mark\" to confirm it is indeed a record.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - From the table, we find that Bob Beamon's date of performance is October 18, 1968.\n   - This date is significantly earlier than all other dates in the table, indicating his performance was not recent relative to the other entries.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since October 18, 1968, is much older compared to other dates in the table (the most recent being June 7, 2009), Bob Beamon's record is not considered recent.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"Bob Beamon have recently set his long jump record\" is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this claim are in row index 1 (second row) under the columns \"athlete\" and \"date\".\n\nThe final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"4 athletes have a mark of 28 foot,\" we need to examine each row in the table under the column labeled `mark`. The goal is to find how many entries contain measurements equal to or greater than 28 feet. \n\nHere's a breakdown of relevant rows and their analysis:\n\n1. **Row Index 0**:\n   - Mark: \"8.95 m (29ft4\u00bcin)\"\n   - This is more than 28 feet, so it does not count towards the claim.\n\n2. **Row Index 1**:\n   - Mark: \"8.90 m (29ft2\u00bcin) a\"\n   - Also more than 28 feet.\n\n3. **Row Index 2**:\n   - Mark: \"8.87 m (29ft1in)\"\n   - More than 28 feet.\n\n4. **Row Index 3**:\n   - Mark: \"8.86 m (29ft0\u00bein) a\"\n   - Again, more than 28 feet.\n\n5. **Row Index 4**:\n   - Mark: \"8.74 m (28ft8in)\"\n   - Exactly 28 feet and 8 inches. This qualifies for the claim.\n\n6. **Row Index 5**:\n   - Mark: \"8.74 m (28ft8in) a\"\n   - Same as Row 4, qualifying for the claim.\n\n7. **Row Index 6**:\n   - Mark: \"8.74 m (28ft8in)\"\n   - As above, this also qualifies for the claim.\n\n8. **Row Index 7**:\n   - Mark: \"8.73 m (28ft7\u00bdin)\"\n   - This is still more than 28 feet.\n\n9. **Row Index 8**:\n   - Mark: \"8.71 m (28ft6\u00bein)\"\n   - More than 28 feet.\n\n10. **Row Index 9**:\n    - Mark: \"8.66 m (28ft4\u00bein)\"\n    - Exceeds 28 feet.\n\nBased on the analysis, there are three distinct rows (rows 4, 5, and 6) where the mark is \"8.74 m (28ft8in).\" Despite having two entries with this exact measurement in different conditions (marked by 'a' for affected), they count as separate instances. Therefore, a total of three athletes have marks that meet or exceed 28 feet.\n\nThe claim states that there are four such athletes, but our findings show only three. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mark\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mark\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Dwight Phillips be the first person to set a long jump record\" is true or false, we need to analyze the given table and focus on relevant data concerning Dwight Phillips' performance compared to others.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that Dwight Phillips was the first to set a long jump record. This implies that his recorded jump should be the earliest among all records listed in the table.\n\n2. **Relevant Data Points**:\n   - We need to consider the 'date' of each long jump record.\n   - We specifically check the date associated with Dwight Phillips and compare it with other entries to determine if it is the earliest.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - Row 6: Dwight Phillips, Date: June 7, 2009\n   - Other relevant rows for comparison:\n     - Row 0: Mike Powell, Date: August 30, 1991\n     - Row 2: Carl Lewis, Date: August 30, 1991\n     - Row 3: Robert Emmitan, Date: May 22, 1987\n     - Row 4: Larry Myricks, Date: July 18, 1988\n     - Row 5: Erick Walder, Date: April 2, 1994\n     - Row 7: Irving Saladino, Date: May 24, 2008\n     - Row 8: Iv\u00e1n Pedroso, Date: July 18, 1995\n     - Row 9: Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas, Date: June 2, 2007\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - The earliest date in the table is May 22, 1987 (Robert Emmitan).\n   - Dwight Phillips' record was set on June 7, 2009.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there are multiple records with dates earlier than June 7, 2009, Dwight Phillips did not set the first long jump record in this list.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 6: Date of Dwight Phillips' record.\n   - Rows with earlier dates (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) are relevant for comparison.\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
