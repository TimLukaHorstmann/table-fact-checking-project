    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the steps required:\n\n1. **Identify the Date of Birth in Question:**\n   - The claim mentions \"1975 - 07 - 14\" as a date of birth for a player.\n\n2. **Find Players with this Date of Birth:**\n   - Look through the 'date of birth' column to find any entries matching \"1975 - 07 - 14\".\n   - In row index 1, we have \"tam\u00e1s varga\" with this date of birth.\n\n3. **Check Player's Position:**\n   - The claim specifies that the player should be a \"cf\" (center forward).\n   - In row index 1, tam\u00e1s varga is listed as playing in position \"cb\" (central back).\n\nSince tam\u00e1s varga does not fulfill the requirement of being a \"cf\", we do not need to check further for height conditions. The claim does not hold true because no player with the specified date of birth is a \"cf\".\n\n4. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - To verify this, the relevant cells are those containing the 'date of birth', 'pos' (position), and 'height' for row index 1.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is FALSE. Here's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of birth\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each condition specified in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the \"cb\" player with the date of birth 1975-07-14:**\n   - We scan through the `date of birth` column for the entry \"1975 - 07 - 14\".\n   - We find this entry in the second row.\n   - We then check if the corresponding position (`pos`) in that row is \"cb\". In fact, it is.\n\n2. **Check the height of this player:**\n   - For the identified player (Tam\u00e1s Varga) from the previous step, we need to verify his height.\n   - The `height` for this player in the second row is listed as \"m (ft 4in)\".\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are met. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells that confirm this include:\n- Row index 1: `date of birth` column with value \"1975 - 07 - 14\".\n- Row index 1: `pos` column with value \"cb\".\n- Row index 1: `height` column with value \"m (ft 4in)\".\n\nHere is the JSON object representing this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of birth\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pos\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"height\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
