    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the model cvp501 hammer grade,\" we need to assess two conditions based on the data provided in the HTML table:\n\n1. The model should be \"cvp501.\"\n2. It should have a specific feature related to \"hammer grade.\" This can refer to either having a \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" or \"graded hammer three (gh3),\" which are the columns indicating different types of hammer grading.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the row for model cvp501:**\n   - The table includes a list of models as rows, with each column representing specific features.\n   - By scanning through the \"model\" column, we find that there is indeed a row where the model is \"cvp501.\"\n\n2. **Check the hammer grade conditions for model cvp501:**\n   - For the claim to be true, at least one of the following columns should have a \"yes\" for the model \"cvp501\":\n     - \"graded hammer (non gh3)\"\n     - \"graded hammer three (gh3)\"\n\nLet's examine the relevant row:\n\n- **Row Index 12**: This corresponds to the model \"cvp501.\"\n  - The column \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" has a value of \"yes\".\n  - The column \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" has a value of \"no\".\n\nSince the condition for having a \"graded hammer\" feature is satisfied by the column \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" being \"yes,\" the claim holds true for the model cvp501.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this are from row index 12 and columns \"graded hammer (non gh3)\" and \"graded hammer three (gh3).\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer (non gh3)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer three (gh3)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the relevant columns in the table:\n   - We are interested in the \"model\" column to find \"cvp501\".\n   - We also need to check the \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" column for its corresponding value when \"cvp501\" is found.\n\n2. Locate the row with the model \"cvp501\":\n   - Scan through the table rows under the \"model\" column.\n   - Find that in the 13th row, the entry under the \"model\" column is \"cvp501\".\n\n3. Check the value of \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" for this row:\n   - In the same row where the model is \"cvp501\", look at the corresponding cell in the \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" column.\n   - The value in this cell is \"no\".\n\n4. Verify the claim:\n   - The claim states that \"grade hammer three (gh3) with a model of cvp501 be yes\".\n   - However, as per the table data, for \"cvp501\", the \"graded hammer three (gh3)\" value is \"no\", which contradicts the claim.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Since the table shows \"no\" instead of \"yes\", the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- The relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n  - Row index corresponding to \"cvp501\": 12 (since indices typically start at 0).\n  - Column name for \"graded hammer three (gh3)\".\n\nThe JSON response reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"graded hammer three (gh3)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
