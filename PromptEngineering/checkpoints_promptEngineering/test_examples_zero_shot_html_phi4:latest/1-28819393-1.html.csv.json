Identify if any row in the table has an \"average % of vote per candidate\" value of 3.29.\n2. For such rows, check if the corresponding \"average votes per candidate\" is indeed 1416.0.\n\n### Relevant Table Information:\nWe focus on columns:\n- \"% of total vote\"\n- \"average % of vote per candidate\"\n- \"average votes per candidate\"\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with 3.29% Average:**\n   - Check the column \"average % of vote per candidate\" for a value of 3.29.\n\n2. **Verify Votes Correspondence:**\n   - For rows where \"average % of vote per candidate\" is 3.29, ensure that the corresponding \"average votes per candidate\" is 1416.0.\n\n### Examination:\n- From the table, the row with year \"2005\" has:\n  - \"average % of vote per candidate\": 3.29\n  - \"average votes per candidate\": 1416\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table for the year 2005, confirming that each candidate with a 3.29% average does indeed have 1416 votes on average.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"average % of vote per candidate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"average votes per candidate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object confirms the claim is true and specifies the relevant cells used to verify it.",
