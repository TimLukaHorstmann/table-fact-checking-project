    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"Richard Krajicek played in 25 championship tennis matches,\" we need to analyze the table data for each row where Richard Krajicek is indicated as either a winner or runner-up, indicating participation.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: \n   - We will look at rows with Richard Krajicek listed under \"Winner\" or \"Runner-up.\"\n\n2. **Count Matches**:\n   - Each row where Krajicek is mentioned corresponds to one match he played in. Count these rows.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - If the count of such rows equals 25, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Rows with Richard Krajicek as \"Winner\" or \"Runner-up\":**\n\n  1.

This corresponds to his total number of championships played according to the dataset.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Runner-Up Instances\n- We will identify instances where \"runner-up\" is mentioned:\n  - Row 5: runner-up on 10 August 1998 against Patrick Rafter.\n  - Row 15: runner-up on 1 November 1999 against Thomas Enqvist.\n  - Row 19: runner-up on 19 June 2000 against David Prinosil.\n\nFrom these observations, Richard Krajicek was a runner-up in **3 instances** out of the 20 championships he participated in. \n\n### Claim Verification:\nThe claim states that \"Richard Krajicek be runner - up 9 time in the 25 championship he play in.\" According to our analysis:\n\n- He played in 20, not 25, tournaments.\n- He was a runner-up 3 times, not 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **not supported** by the data.
