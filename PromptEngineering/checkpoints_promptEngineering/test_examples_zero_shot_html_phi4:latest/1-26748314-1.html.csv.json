The original air date for this episode is October 26, 2009.\n\nFirst, let's identify the row where the title matches \"how to succeed in bassness\". \n\n- Looking at the \"title\" column, we find that row 6 (index starting from 0) contains the episode \"how to succeed in bassness\".\n\nNext, we verify the original air date for this episode:\n\n- In row 6, under the \"original air date\" column, it is listed as October 26, 2009.\n\nBoth conditions match the claim. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
