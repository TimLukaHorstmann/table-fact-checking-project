    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. On August 13th, 1966, North Melbourne was an away team.\n2. On August 13th, 1966, Collingwood was a home team.\n\nLet's examine the relevant rows in the table to check these conditions.\n\n- **Row Index: 2**\n  - Home Team: Collingwood\n  - Away Team: North Melbourne\n  - Date: 13 August 1966\n\nThis row matches both parts of the claim:\n- The home team is indeed Collingwood.\n- The away team is indeed North Melbourne.\n- The date is 13 August 1966, which corresponds to the specified day.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied in this single row, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells for verifying the claim are from Row Index 2, specifically the \"home team\", \"away team\", and \"date\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
