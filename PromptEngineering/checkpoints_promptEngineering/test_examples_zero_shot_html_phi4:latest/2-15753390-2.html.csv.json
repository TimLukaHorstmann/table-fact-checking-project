    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Roger Dutton / Tony Wright receive 3 points for 8th place,\" we need to check two conditions from the table:\n\n1. The row corresponding to Roger Dutton / Tony Wright should be in 8th place.\n2. They should have received 3 points.\n\nLet's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- **Row Index and Place**: \n  - We find that \"Roger Dutton / Tony Wright\" is listed under the `rider` column at row index 7 (considering zero-based indexing). The `place` value for this row is 8, which matches the condition.\n\n- **Points**:\n  - In the same row (index 7), we check the `points` column and find that they received 3 points.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by the data in row index 7. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the 5th place BMW go at 82.32 mph,\" we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table: the position (place) and the associated speed for the relevant entry.\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to the 5th place**:\n   - According to the table, each row's first cell under \"place\" corresponds to its ranking.\n   - The 5th row has a value of `5` in the \"place\" column, which matches the claim about the position.\n\n2. **Check the machine type for this row**:\n   - In the same row (5th), we must confirm that the \"machine\" column indicates \"bmw.\"\n   - The 5th row has \"bmw\" listed under the \"machine\" column, satisfying the condition in the claim about the machine type.\n\n3. **Verify the speed for this row**:\n   - We need to ensure that the \"speed\" column contains \"82.32 mph,\" as stated in the claim.\n   - The 5th row lists \"82.32 mph\" under the \"speed\" column, which matches exactly with the speed mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied by the 5th row of the table, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- Row index: 4 (since indices typically start at 0 in programming contexts)\n- Columns: \"place\" (with value `5`), \"machine\" (with value `\"bmw\"`), and \"speed\" (with value `\"82.32 mph\"`)\n\nThe JSON object representing our conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"machine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, the only entry meeting the speed criterion has exactly 6 points, which does not satisfy the \"less than 6 points\" condition.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nNow let's compile the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row Index**: 5 (where the speed is 82.32 mph)\n- **Column Names**: \"speed\" and \"points\"\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"speed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The row index is adjusted by subtracting one from the table's row number because Python indices are zero-based.",
