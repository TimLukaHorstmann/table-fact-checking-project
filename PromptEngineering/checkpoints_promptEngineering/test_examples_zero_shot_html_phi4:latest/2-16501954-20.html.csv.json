The team name \"ec amberg.\"\n2. Their position in the standings being first (\"first position\").\n\n### Relevant Information from the Table:\n- We should verify if there is a row with \"position\" equal to 1.\n- Within that row, we must check if the \"name\" column corresponds to \"ec amberg.\"\n\n### Examination of Table Data:\nLet's extract and analyze the relevant data:\n\n- **Row Index 0 (First Row):**\n  - `position`: 1\n  - `name`: ec amberg\n\nGiven this information from row index 0, the position is indeed 1, and the name matches \"ec amberg.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe conditions of the claim are fully satisfied by the data in row index 0. Therefore, the claim that \"ec amberg have the first position\" is true.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This requires us to verify that the points for \"ec erkersreuth\" at position 3 are indeed 15.\n\nLet's examine these conditions using the table:\n\n- **Row Verification**:\n  - The first row (index 0) corresponds to position 1 with the team \"ec amberg\".\n  - The second row (index 1) corresponds to position 2 with the team \"ehc regensburg\".\n  - The third row (index 2) corresponds to position 3 with the team \"ec erkersreuth\".\n\n- **Points Verification**:\n  - In the third row, which is for \"ec erkersreuth\", the points column shows 15.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data in the table:\n\n1. \"ec erkersreuth\" is indeed at position 3.\n2. \"ec erkersreuth\" has 15 points.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 2, column name \"position\" for verifying the team's position.\n- Row index 2, column name \"name\" for confirming the team's identity as \"ec erkersreuth\".\n- Row index 2, column name \"points\" for checking the points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
