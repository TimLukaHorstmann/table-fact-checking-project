We will compare the values in the \"number built\" column for each row that corresponds to a \"chassis code\" to determine if \"w109.015\" has the lowest value.\n\nHere's how to evaluate:\n\n1. Identify all rows with their corresponding \"chassis code\" and \"number built\":\n   - Row 0: chassis code = w109.015, number built = 2.369\n   - Row 1: chassis code = w109.016, number built = 2.519\n   - Row 2: chassis code = w109.018, number built = 6.526\n   - Row 3: chassis code = w109.056, number built = 9.483\n   - Row 4: chassis code = w109.057, number built = 2.533\n\n2.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the specific statement: \n\n\"300sel 3.5 have 2.957 fewer number built than the model with the highest number built.\"\n\nWe'll break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Model '300sel 3.5':**\n   - This is found in the row where \"model\" is \"300sel 3.5\". \n   - According to the table, this corresponds to:\n     - `row_index`: 3\n     - \"number built\": 9.483\n\n2. **Find the Model with the Highest Number Built:**\n   - We need to compare the \"number built\" values across all models in the table.\n   - The values are:\n     - For \"300sel\" (w109.015): 2.369\n     - For \"300sel\" (w109.016): 2.519\n     - For \"300sel 6.3\": 6.526\n     - For \"300sel 3.5\": 9.483\n     - For \"300sel 4.5\": 2.533\n\n   - The highest \"number built\" is 9.483 for the model \"300sel 3.5\".\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - According to the claim, we need to check if \"300sel 3.5\" has 2.957 fewer than the model with the highest number built.\n   - Since \"300sel 3.5\" itself is the model with the highest number built (9.483), the difference in \"number built\" between it and any other model would not be 2.957.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim implies there should be a model with a higher \"number built\" than \"300sel 3.5\", which isn't possible as its own value is the highest.\n   - Therefore, the statement that \"300sel 3.5 have 2.957 fewer number built than the model with the highest number built\" is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- The cells relevant to verifying this claim are those containing the \"number built\" values for all models:\n  - For \"300sel\" (w109.015): `row_index`: 0, \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n  - For \"300sel\" (w109.016): `row_index`: 1, \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n  - For \"300sel 6.3\": `row_index`: 2, \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n  - For \"300sel 3.5\": `row_index`: 3, \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n  - For \"300sel 4.5\": `row_index`: 4, \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"number built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"number built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
