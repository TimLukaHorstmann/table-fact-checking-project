    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the UNWTO region of Asia and tourist arrivals in 2012 versus 2011, we must carefully examine the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n- **Claim:** \"In the UNWTO region of Asia, 57.7 million international tourist arrivals (2012) which be less than in 2011.\"\n\nThe claim makes two assertions:\n1. There were 57.7 million international tourist arrivals in Asia in 2012.\n2. This number is claimed to be less than that of 2011.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to the UNWTO region \"Asia\":**\n   - The third row (index 2) corresponds to \"China,\" which belongs to the \"Asia\" region according to the table.\n\n2. **Check the number of international tourist arrivals for 2012:**\n   - Column: \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"\n   - From row 2, we find the value is \"57.7 million.\"\n\n3. **Check the number of international tourist arrivals for 2011:**\n   - Column: \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"\n   - From row 2, the value is \"57.6 million.\"\n\n4. **Determine if the 2012 arrivals are less than in 2011:**\n   - Compare the values: 57.7 million (2012) vs. 57.6 million (2011).\n   - Clearly, 57.7 million is greater than 57.6 million.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that tourist arrivals in Asia decreased from 2011 to 2012 is false because the number of tourists increased slightly from 57.6 million in 2011 to 57.7 million in 2012.\n\n### JSON Response:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2011)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells include the international tourist arrivals for both years for China in the Asia region, which allow us to verify the claim.",
