    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"center Randy Andreachuk be drafter first\" is true or false, we need to verify two key parts of this statement using the given HTML table:\n\n1. **Position Verification**: Check if Randy Andreachuk's position is indeed \"center\".\n2. **Draft Round Verification**: Determine if Randy Andreachuk was drafted in the first round (round 1).\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row for Player Name**:\n   - We locate Randy Andreachuk in the table. The player name appears in the second column (\"player\").\n   - From the HTML table, we find that Randy Andreachuk is listed on row index 2 (third row).\n\n2. **Check Position**:\n   - In row index 2, check the \"position\" column to confirm if it states \"center\".\n   - The position for Randy Andreachuk in this row is indeed \"center\".\n\n3. **Check Draft Round**:\n   - We need to determine if Randy Andreachuk was drafted first.\n   - Check the \"round\" column for row index 2.\n   - Randy Andreachuk was drafted in round 4.\n\nSince Randy Andreachuk was not drafted in the first round, but rather in the fourth round, the claim is false. We have confirmed that he is a center, but he was not drafted first.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- The cells relevant to verifying this claim are:\n  - Row index 2, Column \"player\" (to identify Randy Andreachuk).\n  - Row index 2, Column \"position\" (to verify his position as a center).\n  - Row index 2, Column \"round\" (to check the round he was drafted).\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
