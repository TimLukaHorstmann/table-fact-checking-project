This row is not related to Chip Beck.\n- **Row 2** shows:\n  - The player name is \"Chip Beck\".\n  - His score is listed as \"75 + 73 + 68 + 65 = 281\", which confirms the claim about his score.\n  - He earned $47,646, matching the amount stated in the claim.\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are verified by Row 2:\n- Chip Beck's score is indeed 281.\n- The money he made is $47,646.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim \"Chip Beck make 47646 with his socre of 281\" is true based on the table data.\n\nBelow is the JSON response indicating this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
