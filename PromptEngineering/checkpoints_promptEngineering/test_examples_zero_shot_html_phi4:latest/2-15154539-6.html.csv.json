    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if exactly six games were decided by a margin of one goal during the 1998-99 FA Cup as per the table provided.\n\nThe relevant part of the claim is \"6 game be 1 by only 1 point.\" In football terms, this means that six matches had a scoreline where the winning team won by just one goal. This can happen in two ways:\n1. A match with a final score such as 2-1 or 3-2 (home win) or 1-0 or 2-3 (away win).\n2. A tie that went to extra time and ended with the same scoring margins mentioned above.\n\nLet's analyze each row in the table where there is a \"score\" column, which will contain the results of games:\n\n1. Row 1: Sheffield Wednesday vs Chelsea - Score 0 - 1\n   - Result decided by one point (Chelsea won by 1 goal).\n\n2. Row 2: Everton vs Coventry City - Score 2 - 1\n   - Result decided by one point (Everton won by 1 goal).\n\n3. Row 3: Newcastle United vs Blackburn Rovers - Score 0 - 0\n   - No winner, no point difference.\n\n4. Row labeled \"replay\" (Row 3): Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle United - Score 0 - 1\n   - Result decided by one point (Newcastle won by 1 goal).\n\n5. Row 4: Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers - Score 4 - 1\n   - Not decided by a single point.\n\n6. Row 5: Manchester United vs Fulham - Score 1 - 0\n   - Result decided by one point (Manchester United won by 1 goal).\n\n7. Row 6: Huddersfield Town vs Derby County - Score 2 - 2\n   - No winner, no point difference.\n\n8. Row labeled \"replay\" (Row 6): Derby County vs Huddersfield Town - Score 3 - 1\n   - Result decided by one point (Derby won by 1 goal).\n\n9. Row 7: Arsenal vs Sheffield United - Score 2 - 1\n   - Result decided by one point (Arsenal won by 1 goal).\n\n10. Row labeled \"replay\" (Row 7): Arsenal vs Sheffield United - Score 2 - 1\n    - Again, result decided by one point.\n\n11. Row 8: Leeds United vs Tottenham Hotspur - Score 1 - 1\n    - No winner, no point difference.\n\n12. Row labeled \"replay\" (Row 8): Tottenham Hotspur vs Leeds United - Score 2 - 0\n    - Result decided by two points, not one.\n\nUpon reviewing the results, we find that six matches were indeed decided by a margin of one goal:\n- Sheffield Wednesday vs Chelsea\n- Everton vs Coventry City\n- Blackburn Rovers (replay) vs Newcastle United\n- Manchester United vs Fulham\n- Derby County (replay) vs Huddersfield Town\n- Arsenal vs Sheffield United\n\nNote that the second replay for Arsenal vs Sheffield United is also decided by one point, but since it's a replay of an earlier tie that was already counted once, we only count unique ties. Therefore, six games meet the criteria stated in the claim.\n\nThus, the claim \"6 game be 1 by only 1 point during the 1998 - 99 fa cup\" is TRUE based on the given table data.\n\nRelevant cells for this verification include all rows that have scores indicating a one-goal margin. These are rows with indices: 0 (row 1), 1 (row 2), 3 (replay of row 3), 4 (row 4 - excluded as it was not by one point), 5 (row 5), 6 (replay of row 6), and 7 (row 7).

This indicates that Manchester United (the home team) scored 1 goal and Fulham (the away team) scored 0 goals.\n   - The scores are not equal; one team has 1 goal while the other has 0.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false because the scores for both teams in tie no 5 are not the same.\n\nHere are the relevant cells used to verify the claim:\n\n- Row index 4 (corresponding to \"tie no\" 5)\n- Column name \"score\"\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all the replay game happen in the same day\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table.\n\n1. **Identify Replay Games**: We should look for rows where the 'tie no' column has the value \"replay\". These are the games that were replays.\n2. **Check Dates for Replays**: For each replay game identified, check the 'attendance' column to see on which day it occurred.\n\nLet's evaluate each replay:\n\n- **First Replay**:\n  - Row: The first row with \"replay\" is row index 3 (0-based indexing).\n  - Date: 24 February 1999.\n  \n- **Second Replay**:\n  - Row: The next row with \"replay\" is row index 6.\n  - Date: 24 February 1999.\n\n- **Third Replay**:\n  - Row: The last replay row is row index 10.\n  - Date: 23 February 1999.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that two replays happened on 24 February 1999 and one on 23 February 1999. Since not all replay games occurred on the same day, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's compile the relevant cells:\n\n- Row index 3, column 'attendance'.\n- Row index 6, column 'attendance'.\n- Row index 10, column 'attendance'.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
