    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Jamie Whincup's highest grid be 1,\" we need to focus on Jamie Whincup\u2019s entry in the table and specifically look at his grid position.\n\nThe relevant cell for this task is found in the row corresponding to Jamie Whincup, which is located at row index 0. In this row, we are interested in the \"grid\" column since it indicates the starting grid position of the driver.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- For Jamie Whincup (row index 0), the value in the \"grid\" column is 1. This means his starting grid position was indeed 1.\n\nSince the claim specifically states that Jamie Whincup's highest grid position is 1, and from the data provided he started at grid position 1, this satisfies the condition of having a highest grid position of 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the information in the table. The relevant cell for verifying this claim is:\n\n- Row index: 0\n- Column name: \"grid\"\n\nGiven these observations, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE.\"\n\nHere's the required JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table, let's break down and analyze the claim: \n\nThe claim states: \"the jim beam race team do 5 lap on 1 time occasion.\"\n\nThis can be interpreted as follows:\n- We are looking for an entry in the table where the Jim Beam racing team completed 5 fewer laps than the total (since \"+ 5 laps\" means they finished 5 laps behind).\n- This should occur exactly once (\"on 1 time occasion\").\n\nNow, let's verify this against the table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: \n   - We need to check entries where \"team\" is \"jim beam racing\".\n   \n2. **Filter Based on Lap Count**:\n   - Find entries for Jim Beam racing team and see if any of them are \"+ 5 laps\".\n\n3. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Ensure this condition occurs exactly once.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The entry with `\"team\": \"jim beam racing\"` includes:\n  - `Mark Skaife` who has `+ 5 laps`\n  - `Will Davison` who completed `5` laps\n\n4. **Check Specific Condition**:\n   - Mark Skaife is listed as \"+ 5 laps\", which matches the condition of being 5 laps behind.\n\n5. **Verify Occurrence**:\n   - Only Mark Skaife from Jim Beam racing team has a status of \"+ 5 laps\".\n\nThus, the claim is supported because there is exactly one occurrence where the Jim Beam race team completed 5 fewer laps than the total.\n\nThe relevant cells are those for Mark Skaife:\n\n- Row index: 12\n- Relevant column names: \"name\" and \"time\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON object with the result and relevant cells would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
