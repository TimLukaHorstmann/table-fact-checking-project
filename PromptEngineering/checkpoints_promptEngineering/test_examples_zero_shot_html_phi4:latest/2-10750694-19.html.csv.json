We need to check the \"crowd\" column for all rows and identify if Geelong's match has the highest number.\n\n2. **Match Result**: The claim says Geelong beat Carlton. This means we should check the scores in the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns for the row corresponding to Geelong vs. Carlton.\n\n3. **Venue**: The claim specifies that the match was at Kardinia Park, so we need to verify this information from the \"venue\" column.\n\n4. **Date**: Finally, the date mentioned in the claim is August 30, 1952. We should ensure this matches the \"date\" column for the row of interest.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions:\n\n- **Largest Crowd**:\n  - Hawthorn vs. North Melbourne: 6000\n  - Footscray vs. South Melbourne: 20723\n  - Collingwood vs. Melbourne: 18753\n  - St Kilda vs. Fitzroy: 9000\n  - Richmond vs. Essendon: 28000\n  - Geelong vs. Carlton: 49107\n\n  The largest crowd is indeed for the match between Geelong and Carlton, with a crowd of 49107.\n\n- **Match Result**:\n  - Home team (Geelong) score: 10.17 (77)\n  - Away team (Carlton) score: 3.14 (32)\n\n  Geelong beat Carlton as their score is higher.\n\n- **Venue**: \n  - The venue for the match between Geelong and Carlton is Kardinia Park, which matches the claim.\n\n- **Date**:\n  - The date for this match is August 30, 1952, aligning with the claim.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are verified against the table data.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if Geelong scored the least number of points in their game against Carlton and verify if this score is 27 points less than any other team's score on the same day.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Extract Scores from the Table:**\n   - Each team\u2019s score is given in a format like \"8.11 (59)\", where the number in parentheses represents the total points scored.\n   - We need to convert these scores into total points for comparison.\n\n2. **Convert Scores to Total Points:**\n   - Hawthorn: 8.11 (59) \u2192 59 points\n   - North Melbourne: 12.10 (82) \u2192 82 points\n   - Footscray: 13.13 (91) \u2192 91 points\n   - South Melbourne: 8.13 (61) \u2192 61 points\n   - Collingwood: 13.14 (92) \u2192 92 points\n   - Melbourne: 10.11 (71) \u2192 71 points\n   - St Kilda: 10.12 (72) \u2192 72 points\n   - Fitzroy: 8.18 (66) \u2192 66 points\n   - Richmond: 15.11 (101) \u2192 101 points\n   - Essendon: 11.10 (76) \u2192 76 points\n   - Geelong: 10.17 (77) \u2192 77 points\n   - Carlton: 3.14 (32) \u2192 32 points\n\n3. **Identify the Least Points Scored:**\n   - The least number of points scored by a team is 32, by Carlton.\n\n4. **Check Geelong\u2019s Score:**\n   - Geelong scored 77 points.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Geelong scored the least number of points, which is incorrect because Carlton scored fewer points (32 vs. 77).\n   - Additionally, Geelong's score is not 27 points less than any other team\u2019s score. The difference between Geelong\u2019s score (77) and the lowest score (Carlton\u2019s 32) is 45 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because:\n- Carlton scored fewer points than Geelong.\n- Geelong\u2019s score is not 27 points less than any other team's score.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- Row 5: Geelong's score of 77 points.\n- Row 6: Carlton's score of 32 points.\n- All rows for comparison to check if any team scored fewer than 77 points and the differences between scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
