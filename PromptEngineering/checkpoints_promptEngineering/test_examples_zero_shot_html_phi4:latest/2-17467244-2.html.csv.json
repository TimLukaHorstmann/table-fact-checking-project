    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in the sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final, tisha venturini play 4 match at gavle,\" we need to analyze relevant information from the table.\n\n### Steps for Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevance:**\n   - The claim mentions the \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup final.\" We should check if this event is represented in the table.\n   - It specifies Tisha Venturini, so we need to verify her participation.\n   - The number of matches played by her at a specific location (G\u00e4vle) must be confirmed.\n\n2. **Examine Table Rows:**\n   - The first row for \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\" appears as a heading or summary without detailed data.\n   - Subsequent rows (1 to 6) provide match details for this event.\n\n3. **Check Match Details:**\n   - For each relevant row, check the columns `location` and `lineup` to determine if Tisha Venturini played in matches at G\u00e4vle.\n\n4. **Row Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** Date is 1995-06-06, Location: G\u00e4vle, Lineup: start\n     - Tisha Venturini started the match.\n   - **Row 2:** Date is 1995-06-08, Location: G\u00e4vle, Lineup: start\n     - Tisha Venturini started this match as well.\n   - **Row 3:** Date is 1995-06-10, Location: Helsingborg, Lineup: start\n     - Match location is not G\u00e4vle, but she played.\n   - **Row 4:** Date is 1995-06-13, Location: G\u00e4vle, Lineup: 80' (Cromwell)\n     - Tisha Venturini started the match and was replaced at the 80th minute.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTisha Venturini played in 4 matches during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup at G\u00e4vle.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim about Tisha Venturini's career is true, we need to verify whether three specific matches ended in a draw on the dates mentioned: June 6, 1995; July 25, 1996; and July 10, 1999.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows by Date**:\n   - First, locate each row in the table that corresponds to the specified dates.\n   \n2. **Check Result Column**:\n   - For each identified date, check if the match result is a draw. In this context, a draw means the result should be equal for both teams (e.g., \"3 - 3\").\n\n### Detailed Verification:\n\n1. **Date: 1995-06-06**\n   - Locate row with `date = 1995-06-06`.\n   - Check `result` column in this row.\n   - Result is `3 - 3`, which indicates a draw.\n\n2. **Date: 1996-07-25**\n   - Locate row with `date = 1996-07-25`.\n   - Check `result` column in this row.\n   - Result is `0 - 0`, which indicates a draw.\n\n3. **Date: 1999-07-10**\n   - Locate row with `date = 1999-07-10`.\n   - Check `result` column in this row.\n   - Result is `0 - 0 (pso 5 - 4)`. The match was tied after regular time, and the final decision was made through a penalty shootout. Thus, it's not considered a draw for the purposes of regular play results.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that three matches ended in a draw on these dates. While two of them did indeed end as draws, the third (1999-07-10) does not qualify as a draw under standard interpretations since it was decided by penalties after a tie.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For `1995-06-06`: Row index 1, column \"result\".\n- For `1996-07-25`: Row index 10, column \"result\".\n- For `1999-07-10`: Row index 14, column \"result\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Confirm if this game took place on June 10, 1995.\n\nLet's go through each step systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Highest Scoring Game\n\n- We will examine the \"result\" column to find any entries with more than four goals in total.\n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 2 (Match ID 1): Result is \"3 - 3\", which sums up to 6 goals.\n- Row 3 (Match ID 2): Result is \"2 - 0\", totaling 2 goals.\n- **Row 4 (Match ID 3):** Result is \"4 - 1\", totaling 5 goals. This matches the condition for five total goals.\n- Row 5 (Match ID 4): Result is \"4 - 0\", totaling 4 goals.\n- Other rows either have fewer than five goals or are headers/descriptive rows, not actual match results.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Date of this Game\n\nWe found that row 4 has a total score of 5 goals. Now we need to check if this game occurred on June 10, 1995.\n\n- Row 4 (Match ID 3) has the date \"1995 - 06 - 10\", which matches the claim's specified date.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are met by row 4 of the table:\n1. The highest scoring game in terms of total goals is indeed a match with 5 goals scored.\n2.

The table consists of multiple rows that represent football matches from various tournaments: \n   - Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup\n   - Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament\n   - USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup\n\n2.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each piece of information provided in the claim against the corresponding data in the table:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim states \"1996 - 08 - 01\". We will look for this date in the \"date\" column.\n2. **Location**: The claim specifies \"athens, ga\", which should be checked against the \"location\" column.\n3. **Lineup**: The claim mentions \"start\", indicating player participation that should match the \"lineup\" column's content.\n4. **Result**: It states a result of \"2 - 1\". We need to verify this in the \"result\" column.\n5. **Competition Type**: Finally, the competition is described as \"gold medal match\", which we will confirm by checking the \"competition\" column.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table for these criteria:\n\n- The first header row and its duplicate content are not relevant to our check because they only contain titles repeated across rows.\n  \n- Rows 1 through 6 correspond to matches from the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. We skip these since their dates do not match \"1996 - 08 - 01\".\n\n- Row 7 is also skipped as it belongs to a different event and date (\"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\" group stage).\n\n- Rows 8 through 10, again from the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament, do not match the specified date.\n\n- **Row 11**:\n  - Date: \"1996 - 07 - 01\", which does not match.\n  \n- **Row 12**:\n  - Date: \"1996 - 08 - 01\", which matches our claim.\n  - Location: \"athens, ga\", matches the claim.\n  - Lineup: \"start\", matches the claim.\n  - Result: \"2 - 1\", matches the claim.\n  - Competition: \"gold medal match\", matches the claim.\n\nSince all aspects of the claim are verified as true in Row 12, we conclude that the claim is fully supported by the data provided in this row. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
