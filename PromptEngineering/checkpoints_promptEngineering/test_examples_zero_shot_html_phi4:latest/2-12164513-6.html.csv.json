We need to find this date in the table.\n\n2. **Score Condition**: It claims a score of \"9 - 7\". This corresponds to either the \"Score\" column for the home team or the away team.\n\n3. **Player and Record Condition**: The claim specifies that \"Wright (14 - 7)\" was involved. We need to find this in the \"Home Winning Pitcher\" column, which lists the pitcher's name followed by their win-loss record in parentheses.\n\nLet's check these conditions step-by-step:\n\n- **Date Check**: Locate September 13 in the \"Date\" column.\n  \n- **Score Check**: Verify if the score is \"9 - 7\" for any game on September 13. This could be either as a home or away team score.\n\n- **Pitcher Record Check**: Ensure that \"Wright (14 - 7)\" matches the entry in the \"Home Winning Pitcher\" column for the relevant row.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n1. **Row with Date September 13**:\n   - The date is listed as \"September 13\".\n   \n2. **Score Verification**:\n   - The score on this date is \"9 - 7\".\n\n3. **Pitcher Record Verification**:\n   - The home winning pitcher for this game is listed as \"Wright (14 - 7)\".\n\nAll conditions in the claim are satisfied by the information in the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"leiter (9 - 7) lose the game attended by 29704 crowd,\" we need to verify the details given in the claim against the data provided in the table. Here's how we'll break it down:\n\n1. **Check for \"Leiter (9 - 7)\"**: \n   - We are looking for a row where Leiter's win-loss record is \"(9 - 7)\". According to the table, this occurs twice:\n     - On September 6 against Montreal with the record \"(9 - 6)\"\n     - On September 21 against Montreal with the record \"(9 - 8)\"\n\n2. **Check if Leiter Lost**:\n   - The claim states that Leiter lost the game. In baseball data, a pitcher's loss is recorded under the \"Loss\" column.\n   - For both relevant instances (September 6 and September 21), Leiter did not have a recorded loss (\"n/a\"), meaning he did not lose either game.\n\n3. **Check for Attendance of 29704**:\n   - The claim mentions an attendance of 29,704 people. In the table, this specific attendance figure appears once on September 24 against Chicago with an attendance listed under the \"Revenue\" column.\n   - However, neither of Leiter's games (with the \"(9 - 7)\" record) had an attendance of 29,704.\n\nBased on these checks:\n- There is no game where Leiter has a win-loss record of \"(9 - 7)\", loses the game, and has an attendance of 29,704.\n  \nThus, the claim does not hold true according to the data provided in the table.

This means it was a win for Leiter before this game; hence, he would have recorded his 7th loss in a subsequent game.\n   - On September 21, the entry is \"6 - 1\" with Leiter having a record of \"9 - 8\", but the opponent is Montreal and attendance is 3,839.
