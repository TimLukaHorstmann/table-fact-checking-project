    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tatjana Maria lost all of her games in the Australian Open\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to examine Tatjana's performance at the Australian Open from 2007 through 2012.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - The row corresponding to the \"Australian Open\" needs to be examined.\n   - We are interested in columns representing each year from 2007 to 2012, as well as the overall career win-loss record for this tournament.\n\n2. **Examine Each Year's Performance at the Australian Open:**\n   - In the table under the \"Australian Open\" row:\n     - The column labeled \"2007\" shows \"a\", indicating Tatjana did not play or participated but didn't progress past initial rounds.\n     - The column for \"2008\" also shows \"a\".\n     - Similarly, the columns for 2009 and 2011 show \"a\".\n     - In 2010, she reached the \"1r\" (first round).\n     - For 2012, the entry is again \"a\".\n\n3. **Interpretation of Entries:**\n   - The entry \"a\" typically means 'not applicable' or that she did not participate in that year's event or was eliminated before recording any wins.\n   - The entry \"1r\" indicates she played and lost at the first round.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Wins and Losses for Australian Open:**\n   - According to her career win-loss record for the Australian Open, it shows \"0 - 3\".\n   - This means over these years, Tatjana Maria did not win any matches (0 wins) but had 3 losses at this tournament.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since she has no wins and three recorded losses in her appearances at the Australian Open from 2007 to 2012, it is correct to say that Tatjana lost all of her games there during these years.\n   \nBased on the above analysis, the claim is supported by the table.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The letter `a` means absent or did not participate. A single win (`1`) in the career record indicates that there was one victory at Wimbledon.\n\n#### For French Open:\n- We look at the row for \"french open\":\n  - Yearly results: `a`, `a`, `a`, `2r`, `a`, `a`\n  - Career win-loss: `1 - 2`\n\nIn the case of the French Open, `2r` indicates reaching the second round. Again, `a` means absent or did not participate. A career win-loss record of `1 - 2` shows one victory at the French Open.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim states that she won once at both Wimbledon and the French Open.\n- Both tournaments show a single win in their respective \"career win-loss\" columns, supporting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are from the rows corresponding to Wimbledon and the French Open career statistics:\n\n1. **Wimbledon** - Career Win-Loss\n   - Row Index: 2\n   - Column Name: `career win - loss`\n\n2. **French Open** - Career Win-Loss\n   - Row Index: 1\n   - Column Name: `career win - loss`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Her participation and success vary significantly across tournaments and years. Given her career win-loss record (4-12) over these six years, it suggests that there might be room for improvement before expecting better results in future events.\n\nThus, the claim that \"she probably need to work on her craft before the next year of event\" appears to be well-supported by the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The cells relevant to this analysis include all yearly performance data (columns 2007-2012) and the overall career win-loss row.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and understand what it states. The claim mentions a win-loss record of \"6 and 10\" during the Open tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) over several years from 2007 to 2012.\n\nLet's break down the relevant information:\n\n1. **Understanding Tournament Results:**\n   - Each tournament row has results for each year from 2007 to 2012.\n   - The \"career win - loss\" column at the end of each tournament row shows cumulative wins and losses across these years.\n   - For instance, in the Australian Open row:\n     - Career win-loss is `0 - 3`, indicating 0 wins and 3 losses.\n\n2. **Win-Loss Calculation:**\n   - We need to sum up all the wins and losses from each tournament's \"career win - loss\" column.\n   - This will give us the total number of wins and losses over the specified period across all tournaments.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Wins and Losses:**\n   - Australian Open: 0 wins, 3 losses\n   - French Open: 1 win, 2 losses\n   - Wimbledon: 1 win, 4 losses\n   - US Open: 2 wins, 3 losses\n\n   Summing these up:\n   - Total Wins = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n   - Total Losses = 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 12\n\nThe claim states a win-loss record of \"6 and 10\", but our calculation shows the total is \"4 and 12\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- The entire \"career win - loss\" column for each tournament (rows 1 to 4).\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"career win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
