This document is about the role of the Church in the modern world.\n   - It states that according to this document, the church's sole purpose is for the kingdom of God to come and for the salvation of humanity.

It only provides demographic statistics concerning Catholics in various regions.\n   - Therefore, none of the cells in the table are relevant to verifying the specific religious claim about Vatican II's \"Gaudium et Spes.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion on Truth Value**:\n   - Since the claim is a theological one and the table does not provide any information or data that could verify or refute this claim, we cannot use the table to determine its truth value.\n   - The task is only about verifying the claim with respect to the given table, which means evaluating whether the table provides evidence for or against it.\n\nGiven these points, the correct response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\n- **Answer**: FALSE \u2014 because the table does not contain any relevant information to verify the theological claim.\n- **Relevant Cells**: An empty list, as none of the cells are pertinent to the claim.",
