    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"barwa international campos team be champion in 2008\" is true or false, we must examine the table provided and identify the relevant information for verification.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Year:**\n   - The claim specifies the year 2008. We need to locate this year in the \"season\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Row:**\n   - Find the row where the season is 2008.\n\n3. **Check the Team Champion Column:**\n   - Within the identified row, examine the \"team champion\" column to see which team is listed as the champion for that year.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - Compare the value found in the \"team champion\" column for the year 2008 with the claim that states \"barwa international campos team be champion.\"\n\n### Verification:\n\n- Locate the row where `season` is 2008:\n  - This corresponds to the fourth row (index 3) of the table.\n  \n- Check the value in the \"team champion\" column for this row:\n  - The value listed is \"barwa international campos team.\"\n\n- Compare this with the claim:\n  - The claim states that \"barwa international campos team be champion in 2008,\" which matches exactly with what is found in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row Index:** 3 (corresponding to the year 2008)\n- **Column Name:** \"team champion\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the result and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Lucas Di Grassi places third in 2008\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant row and column from the provided HTML table.\n\n1. **Identify the Year**: The claim refers to the year 2008.\n2. **Locate the Row for 2008**: In the table, rows are indexed starting from 0:\n   - Row index 0 corresponds to the year 2005\n   - Row index 1 corresponds to the year 2006\n   - Row index 2 corresponds to the year 2007\n   - **Row index 3 corresponds to the year 2008** (this is where we need to focus)\n\n3. **Identify the Column for Third Place**: According to the table headers:\n   - The \"third\" column corresponds to the third place position.\n\n4. **Check the Value in the Relevant Cell**: \n   - In row index 3, under the \"third\" column, the value is \"Lucas Di Grassi (barwa int campos team)\".\n   \nSince Lucas Di Grassi is indeed listed as placing third in 2008, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\", and the relevant cell for verification is located at row index 3 under the \"third\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"third\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the highest season with barwa international campos team as champion be 2010\" is true or false, we need to verify two aspects from the table:\n\n1. Identify if \"barwa international campos team\" has ever been listed as the \"team champion.\"\n2. Check if any of these instances occurred in a year higher than 2010.\n\nFirstly, let's find out when \"barwa international campos team\" was the champion:\n- From the table, we can see that \"barwa international campos team\" is listed as the \"team champion\" for the season 2008.\n\nSecondly, check if there are any seasons higher than 2010 where this team was a champion:\n- We do not find \"barwa international campos team\" as the \"team champion\" in any year after 2008.\n\nThus, the highest season (year) when \"barwa international campos team\" was champion is indeed 2008. Therefore, the claim that it could be 2010 is false since there are no instances of them being champions post-2008 and certainly not in 2010 or any higher year.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- The row for the season 2008 where \"barwa international campos team\" is listed as \"team champion.\"\n- The rows for seasons after 2008 to confirm no other instances of them being champions, particularly focusing on 2010.\n\nHere are the relevant cell details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
