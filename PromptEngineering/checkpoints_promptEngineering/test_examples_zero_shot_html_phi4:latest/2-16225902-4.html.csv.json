    "resp": "To verify the claim about the table provided in HTML format, we need to examine whether 10 players tied for third place at the event specified by the claim.\n\n### Breakdown of Claim Verification:\n\n1. **Event Mentioned**: The claim specifies \"2005 open championship.\" However, the information regarding the year or specific tournament is not directly visible from the table. We'll proceed based on the data provided in the table alone since we don't have additional context about events or years.\n\n2. **Checking for Tied Third Place**:\n   - The relevant column to check for placement is the \"place\" column.\n   - The claim states that 10 people tied for third place. In golf, ties are usually indicated with a notation such as 't3' (for tied-third).\n   \n3. **Identifying Relevant Rows in Table**:\n   - We need to identify rows where the \"place\" is marked as \"t3\".\n   - Each row starting from index 2 (since HTML tables typically start indexing from 0) through index 12 has a \"place\" value of \"t3\".\n\n4. **Counting Players with \"t3\"**:\n   - There are 11 entries in the table marked with \"t3\", which means there are 11 players tied for third place.\n\n5. **Determining if Claim is True or False**:\n   - The claim states that 10 people tied for third place.\n   - Since we have counted 11 players tied for third place, the claim does not match the data from the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of the table, the correct determination is that the claim is FALSE because there are actually 11 people who tied for third place according to the table, not 10 as stated in the claim. \n\nNow we need to provide a list of relevant cells (specifically \"place\" column entries marked as \"t3\") with their respective row indices.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
