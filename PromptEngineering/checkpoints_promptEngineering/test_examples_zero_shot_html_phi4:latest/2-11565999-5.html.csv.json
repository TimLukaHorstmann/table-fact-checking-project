    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about track 9's song title being \"just a little bit\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Track 9:** The table contains information for multiple tracks listed in rows 0 through 22 (using zero-based indexing). We are interested in track 9.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Columns:**\n   - **Track Column:** This column indicates which track number each row corresponds to.\n   - **Song Title Column:** This column lists the song titles corresponding to each track.\n\n3. **Verify Track Number and Song Title:**\n   - Locate the row where the \"track\" value is 9. From the table, this is in row index 8 (using zero-based indexing).\n   - Check the \"song title\" for that particular row (row index 8) to verify if it matches the claim.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - The value in the \"track\" column at row index 8 is indeed 9.\n     - The value in the \"song title\" column at row index 8 is \"just a little bit.\"\n\nThe information from these cells supports the claim that for track number 9, the song title is \"just a little bit.\" Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nThus, the relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- The cell in the \"track\" column at row index 8.\n- The cell in the \"song title\" column at row index 8.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Song Title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding track 23's song title in the provided table, we need to evaluate specific pieces of information from the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"track 23 has a title: just a little bit.\"\n\n1. **Identify Track Number**: The relevant row for track 23 can be located by looking at the `track` column.\n2. **Check Song Title**: Once the correct row (for track 23) is identified, we need to verify the value in the `song title` column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Locate Track 23**:\n   - The table's rows are labeled starting from 0 for the first entry.\n   - Track numbers start at 1 and increment by one in each row. Therefore, track 23 corresponds to the 22nd row (since indexing starts at 0).\n\n2. **Verify Song Title for Track 23**:\n   - Check the `song title` column of the 22nd row.\n   - The value found there is \"he'll have to go.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that track 23 has a song titled \"just a little bit.\"\n   - However, according to the table, track 23's song title is actually \"he'll have to go.\"\n   - Therefore, the claim does not match the information from the table.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is false. The relevant cells in the table that were checked are:\n\n- Row index: 22 (corresponding to track number 23)\n- Column names: `track` and `song title`\n\n### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis response provides the answer to the claim's validity and identifies the specific cells in the table that were examined to verify the information.",
