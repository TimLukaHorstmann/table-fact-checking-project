We are looking for the row corresponding to the Netherlands.\n2. Within that row, we are interested in the column labeled \"bronze\" to see how many medals were won.\n\nNow, let\u2019s locate and examine the relevant data:\n\n- The row corresponding to the Netherlands is the first row under `<tbody>`:\n  - Rank: 1\n  - Nation: netherlands\n  - Gold: 4\n  - Silver: 3\n  - Bronze: 4\n  - Total: 11\n\nIn this row, we can see that the number of bronze medals recorded for the Netherlands is indeed 4.\n\nThus, comparing this to the claim, which states \"the total number of bronze from the Netherlands be 4,\" confirms that the claim is accurate based on the data available in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n- Answer: TRUE\n\nThe relevant cell for verifying this information corresponds to:\n- Row Index: 0 (since indexing starts at 0 for the first row under `<tbody>`)\n- Column Name: \"bronze\"\n\nThus, the JSON object representing the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
