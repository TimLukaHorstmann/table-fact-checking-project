    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding live births per year in a specified period using the provided table, we need to focus on two main aspects: the specific period mentioned in the claim and the number of live births for that period.\n\n1. **Period Verification**:\n   - The claim states \"from 1975 to 1980\".\n   - In the table, each row corresponds to a five-year interval (e.g., 1950-1955). \n   - Therefore, we need to identify the period corresponding to 1975-1980. \n\n2. **Live Births Verification**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct row for the period 1975-1980, we must check the value under \"live births per year\" to verify if it is 3,624,000.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Locate the Correct Period Row:**\n   - The table has a column labeled \"period\", with rows corresponding to:\n     - 1950-1955\n     - 1955-1960\n     - 1960-1965\n     - 1965-1970\n     - 1970-1975\n     - **1975-1980**\n     - 1980-1985\n     - 1985-1990\n     - 1990-1995\n     - 1995-2000\n     - 2000-2005\n\n   - The row corresponding to \"1975-1980\" is the sixth one (row index 5, if starting from zero).\n\n2. **Check Live Births Value:**\n   - In the identified row for the period 1975-1980:\n     - Check the value in the column \"live births per year\". \n     - The table shows this value as 3,757,000.\n\n3. **Comparison with Claimed Value:**\n   - The claim states there are 3,624,000 live births per year for this period.\n   - However, based on the table, it is actually 3,757,000.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"there be 3,624,000 live birth per year in the period from 1975 to 1980\" does not match the data provided in the table. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- The cell containing \"live births per year\" for the row corresponding to the period 1975-1980.\n\nThus, the JSON object would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"live births per year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"period\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
