    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Johnny Herbert is among the 5 drivers that win a race\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine the relevant column and entries.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - The relevant column for verifying who won races is the \"winning driver\" column.\n\n2. **List of Winning Drivers**:\n   - We will list all unique drivers mentioned in this column.\n   \n3. **Count Wins for Each Driver**:\n   - Count how many times each driver appears as a winner in the table.\n   \n4. **Verify Claim**:\n   - Check if Johnny Herbert is among these winners and ensure he has won at least one race.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Unique Drivers Who Won Races**: \n  - Michael Schumacher\n  - Damon Hill\n  - Jean Alesi\n  - Johnny Herbert\n\n- **Count of Wins**:\n  - Michael Schumacher: 7 wins (rows 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16)\n  - Damon Hill: 3 wins (rows 2, 10, 17)\n  - Jean Alesi: 1 win (row 6)\n  - Johnny Herbert: 1 win (row 8)\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - Johnny Herbert won one race (British Grand Prix) and thus is among the top drivers who have won races.\n  - The list of winners includes five unique names if we consider at least five distinct drivers overall. However, since there are only four unique winners here, the statement \"among the 5 drivers that win a race\" would be misleading in terms of numbers but true about inclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nJohnny Herbert is indeed among the drivers who have won a race according to the table, fulfilling the claim conditionally based on his presence within the context of actual results. Although the total number of distinct winners is four, the statement focuses on inclusion rather than specific count beyond five.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- **Row 6**: Johnny Herbert wins at Japanese Grand Prix (column: winning driver)\n- Other rows where winners are identified to confirm he's among them.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
