Specifically, the claim states there is only one building proposed with fewer than 20 floors, identified as \"265 laurier avenue w\" located in downtown. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Proposed Buildings**: We need to find all rows where the `status` column is \"proposed\".\n2. **Check Number of Floors**: For each proposed building, check if the number of floors (`floors` column) is less than 20.\n3. **Verify Location and Building Name**: Ensure that the only building meeting these criteria (proposed status and fewer than 20 floors) matches the location \"downtown\" and name \"265 laurier avenue w\".\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row Analysis**:\n  - Row 0: \"richcraft - dow honda site tower i\", `location`: little italy, `floors`: 48, `status`: proposed\n  - Row 1: \"richcraft - dow honda site tower ii\", `location`: little italy, `floors`: 48, `status`: proposed\n  - Row 4: \"claridge - 1040 somerset street\", `location`: hintonburg, `floors`: 39, `status`: proposed\n  - **Row 11**: \"265 laurier avenue w\", `location`: downtown, `floors`: 19, `status`: proposed (matches the criteria)\n  \n- Only Row 11 has a building with fewer than 20 floors and is in the proposed status. No other row meets both these conditions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that there is only one proposed building with fewer than 20 floors, specifically \"265 laurier avenue w\" in downtown, is correct.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row 11, `building`: 265 laurier avenue w\n- Row 11, `location`: downtown\n- Row 11, `floors`: 19\n- Row 11, `status`: proposed\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"building\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thus, they are not under construction.\n\n2. **Identify buildings that are \"under construction\"**:\n   - From the table, buildings with status \"under construction\" are:\n     - 150 elgin (23 floors)\n     - claridge plaza iii (28 floors)\n     - tribeca i (27 floors)\n     - tribeca ii (27 floors)\n     - claridge plaza iv (28 floors)\n\n3. **Determine the tallest building under construction**:\n   - The tallest among these is \"claridge plaza iii\" and \"claridge plaza iv\", both having 28 floors.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since neither of the \"richcraft - dow honda site tower\" entries are under construction, they cannot be considered as the tallest building currently under construction.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For status verification of \"richcraft - dow honda site tower i\":\n  - Row index: 0, Column name: \"status\"\n- For status verification of \"richcraft - dow honda site tower ii\":\n  - Row index: 1, Column name: \"status\"\n\n- Buildings under construction (to identify the tallest):\n  - Row index: 8, Column name: \"floors\" (\"150 elgin\")\n  - Row index: 9, Column name: \"floors\" (\"claridge plaza iii\")\n  - Row index: 11, Column name: \"floors\" (\"tribeca i\")\n  - Row index: 12, Column name: \"floors\" (\"tribeca ii\")\n  - Row index: 13, Column name: \"floors\" (\"claridge plaza iv\")\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"status\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that most of these buildings have a \"proposed\" status.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows for Little Italy**:\n   - We will look at the 'location' column to find entries labeled as \"little italy\".\n\n2. **Extract Status for Each Building in Little Italy**:\n   - For each building found in Little Italy, we will check its 'status'.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Buildings with Different Statuses**:\n   - We count how many buildings have a \"proposed\" status.\n   - Compare this number to the total number of buildings in Little Italy.\n\n4. **Determine if Most Buildings are Proposed**:\n   - If more than half of the buildings in Little Italy have a \"proposed\" status, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Buildings in Little Italy** (row indices and status):\n  - Row 0: \"richcraft - dow honda site tower i\", Status: proposed\n  - Row 1: \"richcraft - dow honda site tower ii\", Status: proposed\n  - Row 2: \"claridge icon\", Status: approved\n  - Row 6: \"soho italia\", Status: approved 30 stories / height increase proposed\n\n- **Count of Buildings by Status**:\n  - Proposed: 2 buildings (Row 0 and Row 1)\n  - Approved: 2 buildings (Row 2 and Row 6)\n\nThere are a total of 4 buildings in Little Italy.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data in the table concerning buildings located in the Centretown neighborhood and their respective number of floors.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We are interested in rows where the `location` column specifies \"centretown\".\n   - From the given table, we have three buildings located in Centretown:\n     - Nepean Tower\n     - Tribeca I\n     - Tribeca II\n\n2. **Extract Number of Floors for Each Building:**\n   - For each building identified in step 1, note down the number of floors from the `floors` column.\n\n3. **Compare the Number of Floors:**\n   - Nepean Tower has 27 floors.\n   - Tribeca I has 27 floors.\n   - Tribeca II also has 27 floors.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the three buildings in Centretown have different numbers of floors.\n   - As all three identified buildings (Nepean Tower, Tribeca I, and Tribeca II) have the same number of floors (27), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to provide the relevant cells from the table that were used in this verification:\n     - For Nepean Tower (`row_index` 13): `floors` column value is 27.\n     - For Tribeca I (`row_index` 11): `floors` column value is 27.\n     - For Tribeca II (`row_index` 12): `floors` column value is 27.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because the three buildings in Centretown do not have different numbers of floors; they all have 27 floors.
