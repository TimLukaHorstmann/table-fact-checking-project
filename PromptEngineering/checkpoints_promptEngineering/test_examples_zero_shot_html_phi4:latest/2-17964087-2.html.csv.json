    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Victor Lo Yik-Kee being the youngest at appointment is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table. The key information needed includes the age at appointment for each individual and specifically identify the age of Victor Lo Yik-Kee.\n\nHere are the steps and observations:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column \"age at appointment\" provides the necessary information about how old each person was when they were appointed.\n\n2. **Extract Ages**:\n   - For each row in the table, extract the value under the \"age at appointment\" column.\n   \n3. **Check Victor Lo Yik-Kee's Age**:\n   - Locate Victor Lo Yik-Kee in the table: He is listed with a romanised name of \"lo yik-kee, victor\".\n   - Note his age at appointment: 55.\n\n4. **Compare Ages**:\n   - Compare Victor's age (55) to all other ages in the \"age at appointment\" column.\n   - The ages are as follows:\n     - Chan Chi-Yuen, Paul: 28\n     - Cheung, Raymond Man-Tou: 46\n     - Choy Siu-Min, Linda: 37\n     - Lo Yik-Kee, Victor: 55\n     - Mok Yee-Tuen, Zandra: 35\n     - Ng Kit-Shuen, Katherine: 34\n     - Tsui Ying-Wai, Caspar: 31\n     - Yip Kan-Chuen, Frankie: 38\n     - Young Chit-On, Jeremy: 32\n\n5. **Determine the Youngest**:\n   - The youngest age at appointment is 28 (Chan Chi-Yuen, Paul).\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Since Victor Lo Yik-Kee's age at appointment is 55 and there are younger ages in the list (with 28 being the minimum), the claim that he was the youngest when appointed is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - We need to identify all cells related to the \"age at appointment\" column for comparison.\n   - Victor Lo Yik-Kee's specific cell in this column, as well as all others, are relevant.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"age at appointment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
