Our goal is to identify all tournaments played on a hard surface and confirm if Syros is indeed the only one.\n\nHere's how we systematically evaluate this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The column `surface` contains information about whether a tournament was played on clay or another type of surface.\n   - We need to check each row for entries in the `surface` column and determine if any match \"hard\" (as opposed to \"clay\").\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Look through the rows and identify which tournaments were played on a hard surface.\n\n3. **Relevant Rows Check**:\n   - For each row, check the value of `surface` and note the corresponding tournament name if it is \"hard\".\n\n4. **Determine Uniqueness**:\n   - After identifying all tournaments with a hard surface, verify that Syros is indeed the only one.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Row 3 (index 2): Tournament is \"syros,\" Surface is \"hard.\"\n- All other rows have the surface listed as \"clay.\"\n\nFrom this examination:\n- The tournament played on a hard surface is \"syros\" and there are no other entries for a different surface.\n\nThus, the claim that the Syros tournament was the only one with a hard surface is supported by the data in the table. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify the claim are those where `surface` is checked:\n- Row 3 (index 2) has \"syros\" under `tournament` and \"hard\" under `surface`.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
