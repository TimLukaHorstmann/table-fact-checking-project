Identify whether there is an episode in season 13.\n2. Check if any episodes from season 13 have William Malone listed as the director.\n\nFrom the HTML table provided, each row represents an individual episode with columns such as `series`, `season`, `director (s)`, and others. To verify the claim:\n\n- First, locate any rows where the `season` column has a value of \"13.\"\n- Then check those specific rows to see if the `director (s)` column lists \"William Malone.\"\n\n### Step-by-step verification:\n\n1. **Locate Season 13:**\n   - We need to find episodes that belong to season 13 by examining the `season` column.\n   - The table contains data from season 1 through season 21. There are no entries for season 13.\n\n2. **Director Verification:**\n   - Even if there were an entry for season 13, we would further check the `director (s)` column to confirm whether \"William Malone\" is listed as a director.\n   - However, since season 13 does not exist in the table, this step becomes unnecessary.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- There are no episodes listed under season 13, which directly contradicts the claim that there is a season 13 directed by William Malone.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim \"season 13 be direct by william malone\" cannot be true because there are no entries for season 13 in the table. \n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- **Note**: The `row_index` is listed as `null` because there are no relevant rows for season 13.",

This episode originally aired on January 22, 1990.\n\nLet's examine each condition with respect to the data in the table:\n\n- **Checking for the episode title and director:**\n  - We need to locate the row where the column \"title\" has the value \"interior loft\".\n  - The relevant row is:\n    ```\n    <tr>\n      <td>37</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>interior loft</td>\n      <td>ken wiederhorn</td>\n      <td>david braff</td>\n      <td>january 22 , 1990</td>\n    </tr>\n    ```\n  - In this row, the column \"director (s)\" has the value \"ken wiederhorn\", confirming that Ken Wiederhorn is indeed the director of \"interior loft\".\n\n- **Checking for the original air date:**\n  - Again in the same row, the column \"original air\" shows \"january 22 , 1990\".\n  - This confirms the episode originally aired on January 22, 1990.\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are verified as true using data from the relevant row (row index 16):\n\n- The title is \"interior loft\"\n- The director is Ken Wiederhorn\n- The original air date is January 22, 1990\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the table.
