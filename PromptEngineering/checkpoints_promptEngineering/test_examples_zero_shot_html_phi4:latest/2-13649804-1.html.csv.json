    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the lowest championship score was 206 by Fred Funk in 1984,\" we need to analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Scores:** The column with scores is labeled \"Score.\"\n\n2. **Locate Fred Funk's Entry and Score:**\n   - Fred Funk appears in the row where \"Year\" is 1984.\n   - In that row, the score listed under the \"Score\" column is 206.\n\n3. **Check Other Scores for Comparison:** We need to ensure no other scores are lower than 206 in any year:\n   - The lowest possible score mentioned in the table (excluding ties) is 205, which appears multiple times (e.g., for Robert Thompson in 1986 and John Jackson in 1980).\n\n4. **Consider Tied Scores:** \n   - There are instances of tied scores with \"po\" (presumably meaning a playoff or tie). These include:\n     - Darrell Kestner: 210 po in 1987\n     - Darrell Kestner: 213 po in 1982\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the lowest non-tied score is 205, and Fred Funk's score of 206 was not lower than any other non-tied score, the claim that his score is the \"lowest\" is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The row with Fred Funk (1984) for verification.\n- Other rows where the lowest scores are recorded to ensure no score below 206.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Bruce Zabriski scored 284 at Thorny Lea Golf Club,\" we must examine the relevant information in the table. Specifically, we need to check:\n\n1. If Bruce Zabristki's name appears on the list of players.\n2. The score he achieved and whether it was 284.\n3. The location where this event occurred, specifically if it was at Thorny Lea Golf Club.\n\n### Verification Process\n\n1. **Player Name:**\n   - We need to locate \"Bruce Zabristki\" in the table under the column named `Name`. \n\n2. **Score Check:**\n   - After finding Bruce Zabristki's row, check the score recorded for him in that year to verify if it is 284.\n\n3. **Location Check:**\n   - Also, confirm that this event took place at Thorny Lea Golf Club by checking the corresponding location entry.\n\n### Relevant Information from the Table\n\n- In the row with \"Bruce Zabristki,\" we find:\n  - `Year`: 1984\n  - `Name`: Bruce Zabristki\n  - `Location`: Thorny Lea Golf Club, Brockton, Massachusetts\n  - `Score`: 206\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that Bruce Zabristki scored 284 at Thorny Lea Golf Club. However:\n\n- The actual score recorded for Bruce Zabristki in the table is 206.\n- Although he did play at Thorny Lea Golf Club, the claimed score of 284 is incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this verification process, the claim is **FALSE** as the score does not match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
