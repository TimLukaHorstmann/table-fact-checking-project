    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"all of the constituencies have 3rd SNP's place 2003,\" we need to verify the values in the column labeled \"SNP 's place 2003\" for each row within the given table.\n\nHere are the steps for verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The relevant column based on the claim is \"SNP 's place 2003.\"\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - For each constituency (each row in the table), examine the value under the \"SNP 's place 2003\" column.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim asserts that for all constituencies, the SNP was placed 3rd in the year 2003.\n   - We need to check if this is indeed true for every row.\n\n4. **Examine the Data**:\n   - Row 1 (Galloway & Upper Nithsdale): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 2 (Tweeddale, Ettrick & Lauderdale): \"SNP 's place 2003\" is not provided (implicitly not 3rd)\n   - Row 3 (Cumbernauld & Kilsyth): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 4 (Kilmarnock & Loudoun): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 5 (Dundee West): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 6 (Western Isles): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 7 (Glasgow Govan): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 8 (Aberdeen Central): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 9 (Linlithgow): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 10 (West Renfrewshire): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n   - Row 11 (Paisley South): \"SNP 's place 2003\" = 2nd\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - In none of the rows is the value in the \"SNP 's place 2003\" column equal to 3rd.\n   - Therefore, the claim that all constituencies have SNP in 3rd place is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells for verifying this claim are those under the column \"SNP 's place 2003,\" specifically from row index 0 through 11.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON output reflecting our findings would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"SNP 's place 2003\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
