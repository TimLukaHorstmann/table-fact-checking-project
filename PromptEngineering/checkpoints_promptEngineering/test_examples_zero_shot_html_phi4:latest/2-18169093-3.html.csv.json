    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the golf scores table, we need to focus on two key components of the claim:\n\n1. **Number of Players Tied for a Specific Place:** The claim states there are \"8 players that tie for 9th place.\" We must verify whether eight players indeed share this position.\n\n2. **The Specific Position in Question:** The claim refers to the 1981 Open Championship, but since no explicit date information is present within the table itself, we will assume the context applies directly to the data given without additional historical verification beyond what is provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Players Tied for a Specific Place\nWe start by examining the \"place\" column in the table to find where players are tied for the same rank. \n\n- We observe that there are different place ranks indicated as \"t1\", \"t3\", and \"t9\". The label \"t9\" implies a tie at 9th place.\n\n#### Step 2: Count Players Tied at \"t9\"\nNext, we count how many players have the rank \"t9\":\n\n- **Row Indices with 't9':** We find that rows from index 8 to 15 (inclusive) all list players with \"t9\" as their place.\n  - These indices correspond to the following player entries:\n    - Row 8: Howard Clark\n    - Row 9: Ben Crenshaw\n    - Row 10: David Jagger\n    - Row 11: Mark James\n    - Row 12: Greg Norman\n    - Row 13: Arnold Palmer\n    - Row 14: Bill Rogers\n    - Row 15: Sam Torrance\n\nThus, there are indeed 8 players listed as tied for \"t9\".\n\n### Relevant Cells Identification\nFor the verification process, we need to identify relevant rows and columns:\n\n- **Relevant Column:** The column \"place\" is crucial because it indicates whether players share a rank.\n- **Relevant Rows:** All rows from index 8 through 15 are pertinent since they contain entries for players tied at 9th place.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis, the claim that \"in the 1981 open championship there be 8 player that tie for 9th\" is supported by the data in the table.

We need to confirm if there were exactly two players who scored 72 and verify whether they are indeed tied for first place.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant sections of the table:\n\n- The scores that match or better than par (indicated by \"e\" for even) are:\n  - Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez and Nick Job both have a score of 70 (\"e\").\n  \n- Players with a score of 71 (+1 to par):\n  - Isao Aoki, David Graham, Tony Jacklin, Johnny Miller, Simon Owen, and Hal Sutton (a), all tied at this position.\n\n- The players with a score of 72 are:\n  - Howard Clark, Ben Crenshaw, David Jagger, Mark James, Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, and Sam Torrance.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"in the 1981 open championship no player finish under par except isao aoki,\" we need to verify two conditions from the given table:\n\n1. No other player finished under par (which means having scores better than or equal to the standard score of 'par').\n2. Isao Aoki is the only one who did not finish exactly at par.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant entry in the table:\n\n- The column \"to par\" indicates how much a player scored relative to par:\n  - \"e\" stands for even, meaning the player finished at par.\n  - \"+1\", \"+2\", etc., indicate scores above par.\n\nNow let's go through the table row by row to check these conditions:\n\n1. Row 0 (place: t1): \n   - Player: Vicente Fern\u00e3\u00a1ndez\n   - Country: Argentina\n   - Score: 70\n   - To Par: e (indicating par, not under par)\n\n2. Row 1 (place: t1):\n   - Player: Nick Job\n   - Country: England\n   - Score: 70\n   - To Par: e (indicating par, not under par)\n\n3. Row 2 (place: t3):\n   - Player: Isao Aoki\n   - Country: Japan\n   - Score: 71\n   - To Par: +1 (above par, not under par)\n\n4. Rows 3 to 8 (place: t3): \n   - These players all scored \"+1\" indicating they finished above par.\n\n5. Rows 9 to 15 (place: t9):\n   - All these players also scored \"+2\", indicating they too finished above par.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- No player finished under par; all scores are either at or above par.\n- Isao Aoki did not finish under par, but rather +1 over par.\n\nSince no player finished under par and the claim incorrectly implies that Isao Aoki was an exception by finishing under par when he actually finished +1 over par, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe only relevant row that needs checking for this specific context is Isao Aoki (row index 2) to confirm his score relative to par.",

Therefore, we should see if these two players are listed in the top position with a score of 72.\n\nNow let's analyze the table:\n\n- **Winning Score Verification**:\n  - Looking through the table, there is no player with \"t1\" place having a score of 72.\n  - The players with \"t1\" place have scores of 70 and are tied for first place in terms of position (not by score).\n\n- **Isao Aoki's Score**: \n  - Isao Aoki is listed under \"t3\", meaning he is three places behind the leaders, with a score of 71.\n\n- **David Graham's Score**:\n  - David Graham also appears under \"t3\" and has a score of 71.\n\nFrom these observations:\n\n- The winning score was not 72; it was actually 70.\n- Neither Isao Aoki nor David Graham is tied for the win with a score of 72.
