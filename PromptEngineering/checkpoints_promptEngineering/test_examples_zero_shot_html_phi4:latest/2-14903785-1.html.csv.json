Let us examine each relevant row:\n\n1. **Year 2001**: \n   - The entry is \"natia marianaschwili tschachoian gaiane\". This matches part of the claim for the year 2001 but does not require verification beyond this point, as we are concerned with years after 2001.\n\n2. **Year 2002**:\n   - The entry under \"women's doubles\" is \"no competition\". Since there was no competition in women's doubles, it cannot be said that Natia and Gaiane won.\n\n3. **Year 2003**:\n   - Similarly, the entry for this year is also \"no competition\", meaning there was no winner to verify against the claim.\n\n4. **Year 2004**:\n   - The entry under \"women's doubles\" is \"natela mirianaschwili ina davidowa\". Natia and Gaiane are not listed here, so they did not win this year either.\n\n5. **Year 2005**:\n   - Here, the winners are \"natela mirianaschwili ina davidowa\".
