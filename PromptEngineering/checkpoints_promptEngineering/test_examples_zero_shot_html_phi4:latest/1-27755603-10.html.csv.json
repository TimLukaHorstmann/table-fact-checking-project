Identify all games played from March 1 to March 26 (inclusive).\n2. Check the \"high points\" column for each game to see if Rodney Stuckey's name appears as the player with the most points scored.\n3. Count how many times Rodney Stuckey led in scoring.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Game 62** (March 1): High points are scored by Rodney Stuckey (25).\n- **Game 63** (March 2): Austin Daye is the high scorer (22).\n- **Game 64** (March 4) to Game 71 (March 23): Check each game, but none list Rodney as the high scorer except for:\n  - **Game 70** (March 20): High points are scored by Rodney Stuckey (22).\n\nRodney Stuckey appears in the \"high points\" column twice, specifically on March 1 and March 20.

Whether this is indeed the lowest attendance compared to all other games listed in the table.\n\nLet's examine each relevant condition based on the provided data:\n\n1. **Attendance for March 20 against Atlanta:**\n   - From the row with `game` number 70:\n     - Date: March 20\n     - Team: Atlanta\n     - Location Attendance: Philips Arena, 17580\n\n2. **Comparing this attendance to others:**\n   - We need to look at the \"location attendance\" column for each game and compare the numbers.\n   - Here are the attendances listed in the table:\n     - March 1, Milwaukee: 11364\n     - March 2, Minnesota: 13122\n     - March 6, Washington: 17506\n     - March 9, San Antonio: 18581\n     - March 11, Oklahoma City: 18203\n     - March 12, Denver: 19155\n     - March 16, Toronto: 15166\n     - March 18, New York: 22076\n     - **March 20, Atlanta: 17580**\n     - March 23, Miami: 22076\n     - March 25, Cleveland: 19907\n     - March 26, Indiana: 19216\n\nFrom the above list, we can see that the lowest attendance is indeed for the game on March 1 against Milwaukee with an attendance of 11364.
