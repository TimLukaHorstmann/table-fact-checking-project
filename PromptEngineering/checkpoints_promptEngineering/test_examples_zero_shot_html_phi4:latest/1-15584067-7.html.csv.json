Whether this episode had 1.81 million US viewers.\n\nLet's examine each condition:\n\n### Condition 1: Episode Written by Erica Montolfo-Bura\n- Look through the \"written by\" column to find entries with the name \"Erica Montolfo-Bura.\"\n\n### Condition 2: Viewership of 1.81 Million\n- Check the \"us viewers (million)\" column for any episode having exactly 1.81 million viewers.\n\nNow, let's apply these conditions:\n\n#### Relevant Entries in the Table:\n- **Row 1**: \n  - \"written by\" = \"mara brock akil\"\n  - \"us viewers (million)\" = \"2.54\"\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - \"written by\" = \"erica montolfo-bura\"\n  - \"us viewers (million)\" = \"1.81\"\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - \"written by\" = \"marcos luevanos\"\n  - \"us viewers (million)\" = \"2.12\"\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - \"written by\" = \"kenya barris\"\n  - \"us viewers (million)\" = \"Not relevant\"\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - \"written by\" = \"erica montolfo-bura\"\n  - \"us viewers (million)\" = Not directly relevant as the viewer count is not specified here.\n\n- **Row 15**: \n  - \"written by\" = \"jenifer rice-genzuk henry\"\n  - \"us viewers (million)\" = \"2.50\"\n\n- **Row 16**:\n  - \"written by\" = \"erica montolfo-bura\"\n  - \"us viewers (million)\" = Not directly relevant as the viewer count is not specified here.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that in Row 2, Erica Montolfo-Bura wrote an episode which had exactly 1.81 million US viewers.
