Mac Bennett plays in a defensive position.\n2. There are exactly two players drafted who play in a defensive position.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Mac Bennett's Position:**\n   - Look at the row where \"Mac Bennett\" is listed and check his position to see if it is indeed \"defence.\"\n   - From the table, Mac Bennett is listed as playing in defense. This supports part one of the claim.\n\n2. **Count Players Playing in Defensive Positions:**\n   - We need to count how many players are drafted to play in a defensive position.\n   - The column relevant for this task is \"position.\"\n\n3. **Check Each Row in the Table:**\n   - Inspect each row's \"position\" entry to determine if it is a defensive role.\n\n#### Detailed Inspection:\n\n- **Row 1 (Louis Leblanc)**:\n  - Position: Center (not defense)\n\n- **Row 2 (Joonas Nattinen)**:\n  - Position: Center (not defense)\n\n- **Row 3 (Mac Bennett)**:\n  - Position: Defence (this matches the claim's condition for Mac Bennett being a defensive player)\n\n- **Row 4 (Alexander Avtsin)**:\n  - Position: Right Wing (not defense)\n\n- **Row 5 (Gabriel Dumont)**:\n  - Position: Center (not defense)\n\n- **Row 6 (Dustin Walsh)**:\n  - Position: Center (not defense)\n\n- **Row 7 (Michael Cichy)**:\n  - Position: Center (not defense)\n\n- **Row 8 (Petteri Simila)**:\n  - Position: Goalie (while a goalie is technically on the defensive side, it's not typically categorized under \"defense\" in this context unless specified.
