    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. The highest number of points scored in a single match is 3.\n2. The match with the highest score was a draw.\n\nLet's analyze the table data to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row by Row Analysis:**\n\n  - Row 0 (30 May 1993): Score = 1 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 1 (6 June 1993): Score = 3 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 2 (31 October 1993): Score = 1 - 1, Result = draw\n  - Row 3 (27 March 1996): Score = 0 - 1, Result = loss\n  - Row 4 (24 April 1996): Score = 0 - 3, Result = loss\n  - Row 5 (12 March 1997): Score = 1 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 6 (11 June 1997): Score = 13 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 7 (19 June 1997): Score = 2 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 8 (28 June 1997): Score = 3 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 9 (6 July 1997): Score = 2 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 10 (22 November 1997): Score = 1 - 1, Result = draw\n  - Row 11 (29 November 1997): Score = 2 - 2, Result = draw\n  - Row 12 (14 December 1997): Score = 0 - 0, Result = draw\n  - Row 13 (16 December 1997): Score = 0 - 1, Result = loss\n  - Row 14 (19 December 1997): Score = 1 - 0, Result = win\n  - Row 15 (21 December 1997): Score = 0 - 6, Result = loss\n  - Row 16 (23 February 2000): Score = 3 - 0, Result = win\n\n- **Checking the Conditions:**\n\n  1. The highest score in any match is 13 - 0 from row 6. Therefore, the claim that the most points scored in a match is 3 is incorrect.\n\n  2. The matches with scores involving 3 points are:\n     - Row 1: 3 - 0 (win)\n     - Row 4: 0 - 3 (loss)\n     - Row 8: 3 - 0 (win)\n     - Row 16: 3 - 0 (win)\n\n   None of these matches were draws.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false. The most points scored in a match was 13, and no draw had a total score of 3 points.\n\n- **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n  For verifying both conditions, we focus on rows with scores involving high numbers or draws:\n\n  - Row 6 (11 June 1997): Score = 13 - 0\n  - Rows involving scores with 3 points:\n    - Row 1: Score = 3 - 0\n    - Row 4: Score = 0 - 3\n    - Row 8: Score = 3 - 0\n    - Row 16: Score = 3 - 0\n\n- **JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"almost none of the match play be during the year 1997,\" we need to analyze the matches listed in the table and see how many occurred in 1997.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Extracting Relevant Data**: We are interested in the `date` column, as it will help us determine when each match took place.\n2. **Identifying Matches in 1997**:\n   - The dates provided in the table include several entries for the year 1997. Let's count them:\n\n     | Date               | Year |\n     |--------------------|------|\n     | 12 March 1997      | 1997 |\n     | 11 June 1997       | 1997 |\n     | 19 June 1997       | 1997 |\n     | 28 June 1997       | 1997 |\n     | 6 July 1997        | 1997 |\n     | 22 November 1997   | 1997 |\n     | 29 November 1997   | 1997 |\n     | 14 December 1997   | 1997 |\n     | 16 December 1997   | 1997 |\n     | 19 December 1997   | 1997 |\n     | 21 December 1997   | 1997 |\n\n3. **Counting Matches in 1997**: There are a total of 11 matches listed for the year 1997.\n\n4. **Total Number of Matches**:\n   - By counting all entries in the table, there are 16 matches in total (from rows 0 to 15).\n\n5. **Calculating Proportion of Matches in 1997**:\n   - \\( \\text{Proportion} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Matches in 1997}}{\\text{Total Number of Matches}} = \\frac{11}{16} \\approx 0.6875 \\)\n\n6. **Evaluating the Claim**: The claim states \"almost none\" of the matches occurred in 1997, which implies that very few or nearly zero matches took place in that year. However, approximately 69% of the matches occurred in 1997.\n\nSince a significant proportion (about 69%) of the matches happened in 1997, the claim is clearly false.\n\n**Conclusion**: The answer is \"FALSE\" because there were indeed many matches in 1997.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
