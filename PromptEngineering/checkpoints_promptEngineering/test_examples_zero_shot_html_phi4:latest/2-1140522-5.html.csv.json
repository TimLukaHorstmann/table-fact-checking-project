Otherwise, it cannot.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- Row 1: \"fs10\" with \"b - b\" built from 1948 to 1949 (does not include 1952).\n- Row 2: \"fs12\" with \"b - b\" built from 1952 to 1954 (includes 1952, but power output is NaN).\n- Row 5: \"ff16\" with \"b - b\" built in 1950 (does not include 1952).\n- Row 6: Another \"ff16\" with \"b - b\" built in 1950.\n- Row 7: \"frs - 16\" with \"b - b\" built in 1952 (includes 1952, but power output is NaN).\n\nAfter checking all entries:\n- The only entry that matches the year 1952 and has a \"b - b\" wheel arrangement is row 7 (\"frs - 16\").\n- However, the \"power output\" for this row is NaN.\n\nSince no row meets all criteria (specifically having a non-NaN power output), the claim cannot be supported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wheel arrangement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"build date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"power output\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wheel arrangement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"build date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"power output\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
