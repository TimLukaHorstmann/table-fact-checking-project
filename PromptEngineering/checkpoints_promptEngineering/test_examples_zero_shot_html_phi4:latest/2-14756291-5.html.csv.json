    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the total number of draw for bridgenorth be 0\", we need to inspect the relevant data in the table provided.\n\nThe claim focuses on the row corresponding to \"bridgenorth\" and specifically mentions the \"draws\" column, which indicates the number of draws. The table is structured such that each team has its own row with columns representing different statistics: wins, byes, losses, draws, and against.\n\nLet's examine the relevant data:\n\n1. **Row Identification**: \n   - We need to find the row where \"bridgenorth\" is listed.\n   - In the table, \"bridgenorth\" appears in the first row (row index 0).\n\n2. **Column Identification**:\n   - The column of interest is \"draws,\" which indicates how many draws the team has had.\n\n3. **Extracting Data**:\n   - For \"bridgenorth\", located at row index 0, we check the value in the \"draws\" column.\n   - According to the table, the number of draws for \"bridgenorth\" is listed as 0.\n\nBased on this examination:\n\n- The claim states that the total number of draws for Bridgenorth should be 0. \n- The data shows exactly that\u2014Bridgenorth has 0 draws.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table, and it is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON representation with the relevant cell identified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"draws\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
