    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify each component of the statement against the provided HTML table.\n\nThe claim states: \"during the johnson v moraga event there be 2.4 million viewer.\"\n\nLet's break down this statement:\n\n1. **Event Identification**: The claim refers to an event named \"johnson vs moraga.\" We must find this specific event in the table.\n\n2. **Date Verification (Optional for claim)**: Although not explicitly required by the claim, knowing when the event occurred can further verify accuracy. However, it's not necessary unless there are conflicting events with similar names or other discrepancies.\n\n3. **Viewership Number**: The critical part of the claim is that \"there be 2.4 million viewer.\" We need to confirm if this exact number of viewers corresponds to the \"johnson vs moraga\" event in the table.\n\nNow, let's locate and verify these components in the table:\n\n- Locate the row for the event \"johnson vs moraga\":\n  - By scanning the rows under the \"event\" column, we find that \"johnson vs moraga\" is listed on April 20, 2013.\n\n- Check the viewership number:\n  - In the same row where the event \"johnson vs moraga\" is identified, look at the \"viewers\" column.\n  - The table shows that this event had \"3.7 million\" viewers.\n\nThe claim specifies \"2.4 million viewer,\" but according to our verification from the table, the correct number of viewers for the \"johnson vs moraga\" event is \"3.7 million.\"\n\nSince there is a discrepancy between the stated number of viewers in the claim and the actual data from the table, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nIdentify the relevant cells needed to make this determination:\n- The row index for \"johnson vs moraga\" is 7 (as indexing typically starts at 0).\n- The column names involved are \"event\" and \"viewers.\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cells would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
