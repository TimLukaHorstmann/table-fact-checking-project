This matches the claim.\n\n2. **\"...a match play smaller than 13...\":**\n   - We need to check the \"match play\" column for the same row (2002 - 03 season).\n   - The first row shows a value of 2 in the \"match play\" column, which is indeed less than 13.\n\n3. **\"...and 7 event\":**\n   - We need to check the \"events\" column for this same row.\n   - The first row has a value of 7 in the \"events\" column, matching the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are verified against the table and found to be true, we conclude that the entire claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For the \"cashes\" condition: row index 0 (first row) and column name \"cashes\".\n- For the \"match play\" condition: row index 0 and column name \"match play\".\n- For the \"events\" condition: row index 0 and column name \"events\".\n\nBased on this analysis, we construct the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"match play\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"6 cash have earnings of 39380,\" we need to verify two key conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify a season with exactly 6 \"cashes.\"\n2. Check if the corresponding \"earnings\" for that season is 39,380.\n\nLet's examine each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0 (2002 - 03):** \n  - Cashes: 6\n  - Earnings: 9,500\n\n- **Row 1 (2003 - 04):**\n  - Cashes: 15\n  - Earnings: 45,850\n\n- **Row 2 (2004 - 05):**\n  - Cashes: 19\n  - Earnings: 56,675\n\n- **Row 3 (2005 - 06):**\n  - Cashes: 22\n  - Earnings: 130,270\n\n- **Row 4 (2006 - 07):**\n  - Cashes: 20\n  - Earnings: 148,425\n\n- **Row 5 (2007 - 08):**\n  - Cashes: 18\n  - Earnings: 108,900\n\n- **Row 6 (2008 - 09):**\n  - Cashes: 18\n  - Earnings: 174,680\n\n- **Row 7 (2009 - 10):**\n  - Cashes: 16\n  - Earnings: 85,570\n\n- **Row 8 (2010 - 11):**\n  - Cashes: 9\n  - Earnings: 33,690\n\n- **Row 9 (2011 - 12):**\n  - Cashes: 10\n  - Earnings: 39,380\n\n- **Row 10 (2012 - 13):**\n  - Cashes: 10\n  - Earnings: 113,259\n\nFrom this examination:\n\n- Row 0 has 6 \"cashes,\" but the earnings are 9,500.\n- No other row with exactly 6 \"cashes.\"\n- The only occurrence of earnings being 39,380 is in Row 9 (2011 - 12), which has 10 \"cashes.\"\n\nSince there is no season where 6 \"cashes\" correspond to earnings of 39,380, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are from:\n- **Row 0:** \"Cashes\" and \"Earnings\"\n  \nThus, the JSON object reflecting the outcome is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
