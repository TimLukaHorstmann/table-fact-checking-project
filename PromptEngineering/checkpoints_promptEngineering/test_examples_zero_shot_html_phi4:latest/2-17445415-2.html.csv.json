    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim about Kelly Dullanty's record based on the provided table, we need to analyze specific conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. **Overall Record of 4 - 2**: The claim states that Kelly Dullanty has an overall record of 4 wins and 2 losses.\n\n2. **Wins First 4 Fights**: The claim specifies that Kelly won their first four fights before losing subsequent ones.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim\n\n1. **Overall Record Verification**:\n   - Count the number of \"win\" rows in the table.\n   - Count the number of \"loss\" rows in the table.\n\n2. **Sequence of Wins and Losses**:\n   - Check the sequence of outcomes (win or loss) for each fight based on the order they appear in the table.\n\n### Analysis Using the Table\n\n- The table consists of 6 entries, each representing a match outcome with columns detailing the result (\"res\"), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location.\n\n#### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Count Wins and Losses**:\n   - Wins: \n     - Row 3: \"win\", Record: 4-0\n     - Row 4: \"win\", Record: 3-0\n     - Row 5: \"win\", Record: 2-0\n     - Row 6: \"win\", Record: 1-0\n   - Losses:\n     - Row 1: \"loss\", Record: 4-2\n     - Row 2: \"loss\", Record: 4-1\n\n   Total Wins = 4, Total Losses = 2. This matches the claimed record of 4 wins and 2 losses.\n\n2. **Check Sequence**:\n   - The sequence of results is as follows (in order from row 6 to row 1):\n     - Row 6: \"win\" (Record: 1-0)\n     - Row 5: \"win\" (Record: 2-0)\n     - Row 4: \"win\" (Record: 3-0)\n     - Row 3: \"win\" (Record: 4-0)\n     - Row 2: \"loss\" (Record: 4-1)\n     - Row 1: \"loss\" (Record: 4-2)\n\n   The first four matches are wins, followed by two losses. This sequence supports the claim that Kelly Dullanty won their first four fights and then lost the rest.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The column does not specify strikes, so it's not fully confirmed.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - `res`: win\n  - Method is \"decision\", not relevant.\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - `res`: win\n  - Method: \"tko (strikes)\"\n  - Event: \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare\"\n  - This row matches the criteria for a TKO by strikes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- We have identified only one confirmed fight won by TKO due to strikes:\n  - Row 5: \"kotc 3 - knockout nightmare\"\n\n- There is no second instance of a win by TKO (strikes) under the same event, as Row 3 does not specify strikes.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is false because there is only one confirmed fight won by TKO due to strikes, and it does not repeat under the same event.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
