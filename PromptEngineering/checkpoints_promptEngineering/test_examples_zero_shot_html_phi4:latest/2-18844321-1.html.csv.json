However, since we only have one match involving Cambridge University, and it is not possible for multiple teams to score against them in a single match, this part of the claim cannot be true.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- **Row 0**: \"opposing team\" is \"cambridge university,\" and the score \"against\" is 12. This indicates that Cambridge University scored 12 points, not that they were scored against.\n  \n- **Other Rows**: Check each row for teams scoring exactly 12:\n  - Row 3: London Counties scored 12.\n  - Row 4: Munster scored 12.\n  - Row 7: Wales scored 12 (but this is a test match, not involving Cambridge University).\n  - Row 24: Barbarians scored 16.\n\nThus, only three teams (London Counties, Munster, and Wales) scored exactly 12 points in any match. However, none of these matches were against Cambridge University.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"there be 4 team that score exactly 12 against cambridge university\" is false because no team scored 12 points against Cambridge University, and only one such match exists involving Cambridge University.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"all match hold in november in twickenham , london be tour match,\" we need to check two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify matches held at Twickenham, London during November 1978.\n2. Verify if these matches are classified as \"tour match.\"\n\nLet's go through the relevant rows of the table:\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Date: 28 October 1978\n  - Venue: Twickenham, London\n  - Status: Tour match\n  - This row is not in November, so it doesn't meet the first condition.\n\n- **Row 11**:\n  - Date: 25 November 1978\n  - Venue: Twickenham, London\n  - Status: Test match\n  - This row meets the first condition (November and venue), but fails the second condition (it's a test match).\n\nSince there is at least one match in November at Twickenham that is not a tour match, the claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells to verify this:\n\n- Row 11, \"date\": 25 November 1978\n- Row 11, \"venue\": Twickenham, London\n- Row 11, \"status\": Test match\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
