    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and focus on entries related to the sport of \"w gymnastics\" in 2007.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"w gymnastics,\" so we need to find any rows where the column \"sport\" contains this value.\n   - Additionally, since the claim refers to events occurring in 2007, we should focus only on entries with dates from that year.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - Review each row's date and sport columns to check for entries related to \"w gymnastics\" during 2007.\n   - The table rows are as follows (with relevant information highlighted):\n     - Row 0: Date is September 4, 2007; Sport is m golf.\n     - Row 1: Date is September 8, 2007; Sport is volleyball.\n     - Row 2: Date is September 9, 2007; Sport is w soccer.\n     - Row 3: Date is September 15, 2007; Sport is football.\n     - Row 4: Date is November 10, 2007; Sport is m cross country.\n     - Row 5: Date is November 10, 2007; Sport is w cross country.\n     - Row 6: Date is December 5, 2007; Sport is w basketball.\n     - Row 7: Date is December 7, 2007; Sport is w swimming.\n     - Row 8: Date is December 8, 2007; Sport is m basketball.\n     - Row 9: Date is December 9, 2007; Sport is wrestling.\n     - **Row 10: Date is February 22, 2008; Sport is w gymnastics.** (This row contains \"w gymnastics\" but not in 2007.)\n     - Row 11: Date is March 7, 2008; Sport is w gymnastics. (Also not in 2007.)\n\n3. **Determine the Earliest Date for \"w gymnastics\":**\n   - There are two rows with \"w gymnastics\" as the sport, but both dates fall in 2008.\n   - Therefore, there are no entries for \"w gymnastics\" in 2007.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no entry for \"w gymnastics\" in 2007, it cannot be the earliest date for that sport in that year.\n   - Thus, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - We only needed to check rows with \"w gymnastics,\" but since they are not from 2007, no cells from those rows are relevant.\n\nThe JSON response based on this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"wrestling be the sport with the latest date in 2008,\" we need to examine all entries within the table for sports dates and determine if wrestling has the latest date specifically within the year 2008.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: Look at the 'date' column to find all records from 2008.\n2. **Find Latest Date in 2008**:\n   - Compare the dates of events that occurred in 2008 and determine which one is latest.\n3. **Check Wrestling Record**:\n   - Confirm if wrestling's date matches this latest date, or if another sport has a later date.\n\n### Analyze Table Data:\n\n1. Filter out records with dates in 2008:  \n   - February 22, 2008 (W Gymnastics)\n   - March 7, 2008 (W Gymnastics)\n   - April 1, 2008 (Softball)\n\n2. The latest date among these is **April 1, 2008** for Softball.\n\n3. Verify wrestling event:\n   - Wrestling occurred on December 9, 2007, which does not fall in 2008.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Wrestling's date of occurrence is not within 2008, and hence cannot be the latest sport date in that year.\n- The sport with the latest date in 2008 is Softball (April 1, 2008).\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because wrestling does not have a record in 2008, let alone being the last one.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For dates in 2008: \n  - February 22, 2008\n  - March 7, 2008\n  - April 1, 2008\n\n- Wrestling's date:\n  - December 9, 2007 (for reference).\n\nThe following JSON object represents the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
