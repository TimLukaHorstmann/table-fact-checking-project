    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim about the `at90s1200` chip having a frequency of 12 MHz, we need to verify the relevant information from the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row**: First, locate the row where the `chip` column has the value `at90s1200`. This is found in the first row (`row_index = 0`).\n\n2. **Check Frequency Column**: In this row, examine the `frequency` column to see if it matches the claim of being 12 MHz.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The `frequency` value for `at90s1200` is listed as \"12\". This indicates a frequency of 12 MHz.\n   \n4. **Conclusion**: Since the table confirms that the `at90s1200` chip has a frequency of 12, the claim is supported.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the claim is \"TRUE\", and the relevant cell for verification is located at `row_index = 0` in the `frequency` column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"pdip - 20 be the package when eeprom be less than 128 on 1 occasion,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table for each row:\n1. The EEPROM value must be less than 128.\n2. When this condition is met, check if the corresponding package value is \"pdip - 20.\"\n\nLet's examine each row in the provided HTML table:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - EEPROM: 64 (which is less than 128)\n   - Package: pdip - 20\n   - This row satisfies both conditions.\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - EEPROM: 128 (not less than 128)\n   - The first condition is not met, so this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - EEPROM: 128 (not less than 128)\n   - The first condition is not met, so this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - EEPROM: 128 (not less than 128)\n   - The first condition is not met, so this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - EEPROM: 256 (not less than 128)\n   - The first condition is not met, so this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - EEPROM: 256 (not less than 128)\n   - The first condition is not met, so this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\n7. **Row 6:**\n   - EEPROM: 512 (not less than 128)\n   - The first condition is not met, so this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\n8. **Row 7:**\n   - EEPROM: 512 (not less than 128)\n   - The first condition is not met, so this row is irrelevant for the claim.\n\nUpon reviewing all rows, we find that only Row 0 satisfies both conditions:\n- EEPROM value is less than 128.\n- Package is \"pdip - 20.\"\n\nThe claim states that the package should be \"pdip - 20\" when EEPROM is less than 128 on one occasion. Since this condition is satisfied exactly once (in Row 0), the claim is true.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"eeprom\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"package\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
