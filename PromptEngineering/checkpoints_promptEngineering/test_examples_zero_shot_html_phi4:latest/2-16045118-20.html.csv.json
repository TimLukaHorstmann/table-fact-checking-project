Angela Bassett in 1994\n2. Jennifer Hudson in 2007\n3. Mo'Nique in 2010\n4. Octavia Spencer in 2012\n\nThese are the only wins listed up to and including 2012.\n\nThe total number of wins by black actresses until 2012 is 4, not 7 as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim \"until 2012, black actresses have only won 7 Golden Globes\" is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells that show these wins:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thus, there is no drought here.\n   - The longest actual gap in the Best Actress - Musical or Comedy category identified above is 19 years, not 6 years (between 1975 and 1994).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim does not hold true since:\n- There was a nomination every year from 1962 to 1968.\n- The longest drought for any relevant category between nominations in Best Actress - Musical or Comedy is actually 19 years, not 6 years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nRelevant cells include rows with nomination years for those categories involved in calculating these gaps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Since both categories listed have only one win each, neither is less common than the other based solely on these results.\n\nTherefore, the claim as stated (\"the least common Golden Globe for a black actress to win be best actress\") cannot be definitively supported by this data since there are ties in uncommonness between the two categories.
