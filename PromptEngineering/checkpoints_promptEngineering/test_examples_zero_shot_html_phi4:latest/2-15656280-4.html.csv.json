    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main conditions against the table:\n\n1. Identify players who have scored exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup.\n2. Among those identified players, check if they have also scored 3 or more goals in the Play-Offs.\n\nLet's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Find Players with Exactly 2 Goals in the FA Cup\n\nWe need to scan through each row and identify the relevant entries where the \"fa cup\" column equals 2. The rows that meet this condition are:\n- Paul Barnes (Row Index: 0) - FA Cup = 2\n- Christian Moore (Row Index: 9) - FA Cup = 2\n\n### Step 2: Check Play-Offs Goals for These Players\n\nNext, we check the \"play - offs\" column for these players to see if any have scored 3 or more goals.\n\n#### Player Analysis:\n1. **Paul Barnes** (Row Index: 0)\n   - Play-Offs = 1\n   - Since Paul Barnes has only 1 goal in play-offs, he does not meet the condition of scoring 3 or more.\n\n2. **Christian Moore** (Row Index: 9)\n   - Play-Offs = 0\n   - Christian Moore scored 0 goals in play-offs, so this player also does not meet the condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo players with exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup have scored 3 or more goals in the play-offs. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are from rows where \"fa cup\" equals 2 and checking their respective \"play - offs\" values:\n\n- Row Index: 0 (Paul Barnes) with columns \"fa cup\" and \"play - offs\"\n- Row Index: 9 (Christian Moore) with columns \"fa cup\" and \"play - offs\"\n\nThus, the JSON response should be:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
