    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"western oval be not include in the 6 venue use on july 6 1957,\" we need to identify all unique venues listed for matches held on this date.\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data**: Focus on the \"venue\" column, as it lists where each match took place. Each row represents a different match that occurred on July 6, 1957.\n\n2. **List All Venues**:\n   - Row 0: Arden Street Oval\n   - Row 1: Western Oval\n   - Row 2: Lake Oval\n   - Row 3: MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground)\n   - Row 4: Windy Hill\n   - Row 5: Glenferrie Oval\n\n3. **Count Unique Venues**: From the list above, we have six unique venues:\n   - Arden Street Oval\n   - Western Oval\n   - Lake Oval\n   - MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground)\n   - Windy Hill\n   - Glenferrie Oval\n\n4. **Verify Claim**: The claim states that \"western oval be not include in the 6 venue use on july 6 1957.\" However, we have identified Western Oval as one of the six venues used.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Western Oval is indeed included among the venues, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells are those from the \"venue\" column for each row, as they provide the information needed to verify the claim.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
