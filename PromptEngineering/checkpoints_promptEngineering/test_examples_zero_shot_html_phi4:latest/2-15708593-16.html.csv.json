At 10:00, one of the shows is \"dating in the dark\".\n2. At 9:30, for that same row, the show should be \"the bachelorette\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Locate \"dating in the dark\" at 10:00**:\n   - We need to find rows where the value under the \"10:00\" column is \"dating in the dark\".\n   - By examining the table, we find that this occurs in Row 2.\n\n2. **Check the show at 9:30 for the identified row**:\n   - For Row 2, check the value under the \"9:30\" column.\n   - The value is \"the bachelorette\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe conditions of the claim are met for Row 2 where \"dating in the dark\" appears at 10:00 and \"the bachelorette\" appears at 9:30.

Identify if there is a show called \"dating in the dark\" at 10:00 PM.\n2. Check if \"the bachelorette\" is scheduled immediately after this time slot.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant part of the table:\n\n- **Column Header**: The times listed are 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30, and 10:00.

However, it confirms that \"the bachelorette\" ends before the 10:00 PM slot.\n\nSince \"the bachelorette\" finishes at 9:30 and there is no additional time slot listed beyond 10:00 PM in the table, we cannot confirm if \"the bachelorette\" airs after 10:00 PM.
