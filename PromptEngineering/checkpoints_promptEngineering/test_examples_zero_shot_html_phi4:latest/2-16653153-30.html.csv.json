    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"South Dragons win the most games in the season,\" we need to determine which column in the table reflects the number of wins for each team. The table provides several columns, including \"lost,\" \"% won,\" and other statistics related to game performance.\n\n1. **Column Analysis**:\n   - \"lost\": This column indicates how many games each team has lost.\n   - \"% pts\" and \"% won\": These are percentage metrics that don't directly indicate the number of wins.\n   - \"last 5\", \"streak\", \"home\", and \"away\": These columns provide additional performance details but not direct win counts.\n\n2. **Determine Wins**:\n   - Since we know the total number of games played by each team isn't explicitly given, we can infer it indirectly if there is a standard number of games in the season (e.g., 20 games). However, without this information, we'll use the \"lost\" column to calculate wins.\n   - Assuming each team plays an equal number of games, say \\( N \\), then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Wins} = N - \\text{Lost}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Wins for Each Team**:\n   - South Dragons: Lost 8 games\n   - Melbourne Tigers: Lost 10 games\n   - New Zealand Breakers: Lost 12 games\n   - Perth Wildcats: Lost 13 games\n   - Townsville Crocodiles: Lost 13 games\n   - Adelaide 36ers: Lost 15 games\n   - Wollongong Hawks: Lost 19 games\n   - Sydney Spirit: Lost 19 games\n   - Cairns Taipans: Lost 19 games\n   - Gold Coast Blaze: Lost 22 games\n\n4. **Determine the Team with Most Wins**:\n   - Calculate wins for each team assuming \\( N = 20 \\) (since it's a reasonable assumption given the context of sports leagues):\n     - South Dragons: \\( 20 - 8 = 12 \\)\n     - Melbourne Tigers: \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n     - New Zealand Breakers: \\( 20 - 12 = 8 \\)\n     - Perth Wildcats: \\( 20 - 13 = 7 \\)\n     - Townsville Crocodiles: \\( 20 - 13 = 7 \\)\n     - Adelaide 36ers: \\( 20 - 15 = 5 \\)\n     - Wollongong Hawks: \\( 20 - 19 = 1 \\)\n     - Sydney Spirit: \\( 20 - 19 = 1 \\)\n     - Cairns Taipans: \\( 20 - 19 = 1 \\)\n     - Gold Coast Blaze: \\( 20 - 22 = -2 \\) (not possible, indicating they played more than 20 games)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - South Dragons have the highest calculated wins with 12.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table provides several columns related to teams' performance:\n\n1. **lost**: Number of games lost by a team.\n2. **last 5**: Result of the last 5 games (e.g., \"4 - 1\" means 4 wins and 1 loss in the last 5 games).\n3. **streak**: Current win/loss streak, not directly helpful for total wins.\n4. **home** and **away**: Home and away game records, which can be used to calculate total wins.\n5. **% pts** and **% won**: These are percentages that do not give direct counts of games won.\n\nThe most relevant columns to determine the number of wins are \"lost\" and either \"home\" or \"away\", as we can infer wins from these figures if we know the total number of games played, but this isn't directly provided. Instead, we will compute wins using the combination of home and away records:\n\n- For each team, calculate total games played by summing their wins and losses (from both home and away columns).\n- Calculate total wins for each team as follows:\n  - Wins at home = First number in \"home\" column\n  - Losses at home = Second number in \"home\" column\n  - Wins away = First number in \"away\" column\n  - Total wins = (Wins at home) + (Wins away)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total wins for each team:\n\n- **South Dragons**: Home Wins = 13, Away Wins = 9; Total Wins = 13 + 9 = 22\n- **Melbourne Tigers**: Home Wins = 11, Away Wins = 9; Total Wins = 11 + 9 = 20\n- **New Zealand Breakers**: Home Wins = 10, Away Wins = 8; Total Wins = 10 + 8 = 18\n- **Perth Wildcats**: Home Wins = 11, Away Wins = 6; Total Wins = 11 + 6 = 17\n- **Townsville Crocodiles**: Home Wins = 12, Away Wins = 5; Total Wins = 12 + 5 = 17\n- **Adelaide 36ers**: Home Wins = 12, Away Wins = 3; Total Wins = 12 + 3 = 15\n- **Wollongong Hawks**: Home Wins = 9, Away Wins = 2; Total Wins = 9 + 2 = 11\n- **Sydney Spirit**: Home Wins = 9, Away Wins = 2; Total Wins = 9 + 2 = 11\n- **Cairns Taipans**: Home Wins = 5, Away Wins = 6; Total Wins = 5 + 6 = 11\n- **Gold Coast Blaze**: Home Wins = 6, Away Wins = 2; Total Wins = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nFrom these calculations, it is clear that the **South Dragons** have won the most games with a total of 22 wins.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gold coast blaze have the best record in the season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant statistics from the table provided.\n\nThe key metrics for evaluating a team's performance typically include:\n- The number of games lost (lower is better).\n- The percentage of points (% pts) (higher is better).\n- The win percentage (% won) (higher is better).\n\nLet's evaluate these metrics for each team:\n\n1. **South Dragons**: \n   - Lost: 8\n   - % Pts: 110.25\n   - % Won: 73.33\n\n2. **Melbourne Tigers**:\n   - Lost: 10\n   - % Pts: 106.47\n   - % Won: 66.67\n\n3. **New Zealand Breakers**:\n   - Lost: 12\n   - % Pts: 106.08\n   - % Won: 60.00\n\n4. **Perth Wildcats**:\n   - Lost: 13\n   - % Pts: 102.06\n   - % Won: 56.67\n\n5. **Townsville Crocodiles**:\n   - Lost: 13\n   - % Pts: 99.26\n   - % Won: 56.67\n\n6. **Adelaide 36ers**:\n   - Lost: 15\n   - % Pts: 100.92\n   - % Won: 50.00\n\n7. **Wollongong Hawks**:\n   - Lost: 19\n   - % Pts: 95.03\n   - % Won: 36.67\n\n8. **Sydney Spirit**:\n   - Lost: 19\n   - % Pts: 94.51\n   - % Won: 36.67\n\n9. **Cairns Taipans**:\n   - Lost: 19\n   - % Pts: 93.57\n   - % Won: 36.67\n\n10. **Gold Coast Blaze**:\n    - Lost: 22\n    - % Pts: 93.45\n    - % Won: 26.67\n\nThe \"best record\" is typically defined by the fewest losses and highest win percentages. Comparing all teams:\n\n- The team with the fewest losses (8) is South Dragons.\n- In terms of win percentage, South Dragons also lead with 73.33%.\n- Gold Coast Blaze has the most losses (22) and the lowest win percentage (26.67).\n\nTherefore, the claim \"gold coast blaze have the best record in the season\" is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n1. The number of games lost for all teams.\n2. The % pts for all teams.\n3. The % won for all teams.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cell indices:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"% won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"% pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"% won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
