    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to examine the table data and verify whether the last game of the season occurred on 11 February 2006.\n\n### Analyzing the Claim:\n- The claim states: \"the last game of the season happen on 11 february 2006.\"\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n1. **Identify the Date Column**: We need to look at the column labeled \"Date\" in the table.\n2. **Examine All Dates**: Check each entry under the \"Date\" column to identify the latest date, as this will indicate the last game of the season.\n3. **Compare with Claimed Date**: Compare the identified latest date with 11 February 2006.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n- Let's examine the dates in the table:\n\n  - Row 0: 21 August 2005\n  - Row 1: 10 September 2005\n  - ...\n  - Row 20: 11 February 2006\n  - ...\n  - Row 33: 7 May 2006\n\nFrom this list, we see that the date 7 May 2006 (Row 33) is later than 11 February 2006 (Row 20). Therefore, the last game of the season did not occur on 11 February 2006; it occurred later in the season.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is incorrect because the last game of the season happened on 7 May 2006, not 11 February 2006. Thus, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\nTo verify this conclusion, we need the relevant rows and column that contain date information:\n\n- Row 20: Date Column (11 February 2006)\n- Row 33: Date Column (7 May 2006)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
