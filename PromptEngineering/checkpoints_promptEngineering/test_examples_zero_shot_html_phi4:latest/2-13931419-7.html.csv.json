    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check two specific aspects of the table based on the information given in the claim: \n\n1. **Date and Teams Involved:** The claim states a game between \"the blue and penguin\" on \"march 20.\" We must verify if there is a record for this date with these teams.\n2. **Score of the Game:** If such a game exists, we need to check whether the score was indeed \"2 - 4\" as claimed.\n\nLet's examine the table step-by-step:\n\n- The claim specifies the date \"march 20\" and involves the teams \"blue and penguin.\"\n  \n1. **Finding the Row:**\n   - Look for a row where the `date` column is \"march 20.\" \n   - According to the table, there is indeed such a row:\n     - Date: March 20\n     - Visitor: blues\n     - Home: penguins\n\n2. **Checking the Score:**\n   - In this row, the `score` is listed as \"2 - 4,\" which matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n  \n3. **Verifying Teams Involved:**\n   - The visitor team on March 20 was the \"blues,\" and the home team was the \"penguins.\" This setup aligns with the order mentioned in the claim (\"the blue and penguin\").\n\nThus, both conditions of the claim (date, teams involved, and score) are satisfied by examining the row corresponding to March 20. \n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The relevant row index for verification is the one where `date` is \"march 20,\" which is the 9th row in zero-indexed terms (since table rows typically start from zero).\n- Relevant columns are `date`, `visitor`, `home`, and `score`.\n\nThe final JSON answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the game between the Kings and the Penguins on March 20 having a score of \"2 - 4,\" we need to verify specific details from the table:\n\n1. **Date Check**: We first identify the row corresponding to \"march 20.\" This is crucial because the claim specifically references this date.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**: For the row with the date \"march 20,\" we need to check which teams played against each other. The claim involves the Kings and the Penguins, so one of these teams must be listed in either the \"visitor\" or \"home\" columns for that row.\n\n3. **Score Verification**: Finally, if both conditions above are satisfied, we verify the score reported in that row matches \"2 - 4.\"\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- The date \"march 20\" corresponds to the 9th row (index starting at 0).\n- In this row:\n  - The \"visitor\" column lists \"blues.\"\n  - The \"home\" column lists \"penguins.\"\n  - The \"score\" column shows \"2 - 4.\"\n\nThe claim states that the game involved the Kings and Penguins, but from the table, we see it was actually between the Blues and Penguins.
