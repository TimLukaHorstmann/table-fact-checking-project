    "resp": "To verify the claim \"no club have play more than 42 time,\" we need to check if any of the clubs in the table have played more than 42 matches. The relevant column here is likely \"Matches Played\" or a similar column that indicates the number of games each club has participated in.\n\nIn the given table, it appears there isn't an explicit \"Matches Played\" column labeled as such, but we can infer from context and typical football league tables that the first two columns (usually representing matches played) are relevant. Typically:\n\n- The first column would represent either home or away games.\n- The second column could be the sum of these values, representing total matches.\n\nThe table shows each club's number of matches in both columns is 42, which suggests they have all played exactly 42 matches. Therefore, no club has exceeded this number.\n\nHere are the steps to confirm:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The first two columns seem to be related to match counts (home and away or similar).\n2. **Check Each Row**: For each row, verify that both columns show a value of 42.\n3. **Conclusion**: If all rows have these values as 42, the claim is true.\n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- All clubs have played exactly 42 matches according to the first two columns.\n- No club has played more than 42 matches.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Matches Played 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The column names \"Matches Played 1\" and \"Matches Played 2\" are placeholders for the actual column headers in your table.
