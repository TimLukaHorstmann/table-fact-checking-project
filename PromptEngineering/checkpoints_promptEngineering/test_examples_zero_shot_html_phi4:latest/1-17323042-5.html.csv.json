The record at this point was 2 - 4.\n  \n- Second occurrence of a game against Orlando:\n  - **Row 15**: Date is November 26, the team lost (L) again with a score of 94 - 96. The record after this loss became 7 - 8.\n\nThis confirms that the second loss to Orlando occurred as stated in the claim.\n\n#### Part 2: Record After Second Loss\n\n- **Row 15**: After losing to Orlando on November 26, the record is indeed listed as 7 - 8.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the data provided. The team lost to Orlando for a second time and their record dropped to 7 - 8 after this loss.\n\nThus, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the team's record when playing Orlando on November 28th, we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify if there is a game against Orlando on November 28.\n2. Check the team's record at that point in time.\n\nLet\u2019s examine each condition step by step:\n\n### Condition 1: Game Against Orlando on November 28\n- Locate the row with \"November 28\" under the `date` column.\n- Verify if the `team` is listed as \"orlando\" for this game date.\n\nFrom the table, we find:\n- Row 15 has a `date` of \"november 26\" against \"orlando\".\n- Row 16 has a `date` of \"november 28\", but the `team` is listed as \"boston\".\n\nThus, on November 28, the game was not played against Orlando; it was against Boston.\n\n### Condition 2: Record Check\nEven though the first condition fails, let's check what the record would be on November 26 (last game against Orlando) to assess if any part of this is relevant:\n- On November 26th, as per Row 15, when playing Orlando, the team's `record` was \"7 - 8\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim states that the record was \"7 - 8\" on November 28 during a game against Orlando. However, there was no such game on that date; instead, it was against Boston. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- Row 15: `date` column (November 26) and `record` column (7 - 8).\n- Row 16: `date` column (November 28) and `team` column (\"boston\").\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
