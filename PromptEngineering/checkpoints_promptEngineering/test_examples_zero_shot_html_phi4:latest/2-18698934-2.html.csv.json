    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"none of the competition be friendly\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each row in the given table and check the value in the \"competition\" column.\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Competition: \"2010 hong kong - macau interport\"\n   - This is not \"friendly\".\n\n2. **Row 1**: \n   - Competition: \"friendly\"\n   - This matches \"friendly\", contradicting the claim.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Competition: \"friendly\"\n   - This matches \"friendly\", further contradicting the claim.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Competition: \"friendly\"\n   - This also matches \"friendly\", continuing to contradict the claim.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Competition: \"friendly\"\n   - This matches \"friendly\", again contradicting the claim.\n\nThe claim states that none of the competitions should be \"friendly\". However, rows 1 through 4 all have the competition listed as \"friendly\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells to verify this are from columns under \"competition\" in rows 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
