Determine which of these games had the highest attendance and check if it occurred on December 21 against the Trail Blazers as an away game.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant entry from the table for the Denver Nuggets:\n\n- **December 5 vs. Lakers (Home)**: Attendance = 19155\n- **December 6 at Mavericks (Away)**: Attendance = 20155\n- **December 8 vs. Kings (Home)**: Attendance = 15493\n- **December 12 vs. Hornets (Home)**: Attendance = 13337\n- **December 15 at Spurs (Away)**: Attendance = 18797\n- **December 16 vs. Trail Blazers (Home)**: Attendance = 13678\n- **December 20 vs. Rockets (Home)**: Attendance = 16157\n- **December 21 at Trail Blazers (Away)**: Attendance = 20644\n- **December 23 vs. Kings (Home)**: Attendance = 15055\n- **December 26 vs. Bucks (Home)**: Attendance = 18701\n- **December 28 vs. Warriors (Home)**: Attendance = 20001\n- **December 30 at Warriors (Away)**: Attendance = 19362\n\nNow, let's compare the attendances:\n\n- The highest attendance is 20644 on December 21 for the game against the Trail Blazers as an away game.\n\nThe claim states that the highest attendance was indeed on December 21 at their away game against the Trail Blazers.

On 5 December, vs Lakers: Attendance = 19155\n2. On 6 December, @ Mavericks (away game): Attendance is not relevant.\n3. On 8 December, vs Kings: Attendance = 15493\n4.

The claim makes two assertions:\n\n1. **The game took place on December 20, 2007**.\n2. **The Nuggets scored 112 points in that game, described as their highest home total for December 2007**.\n\nLet's evaluate these one by one using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Verification Steps\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Game:**\n   - Look at each row to find the entry where \"date\" is \"20 december 2007\", \"visitor\" is \"rockets\", and \"home\" is \"nuggets\".\n   - This corresponds to row index 8 in the table.\n\n2. **Score Verification:**\n   - In row index 8, under the \"score\" column, we see the entry \"111 - 112\". The Nuggets are listed as the home team scoring 112 points.\n   \n3. **Determine if It's Their Highest Home Total for December 2007:**\n   - We must check all other games where the Nuggets were the home team in December and compare their scores.\n   - Relevant rows are those where \"home\" is \"nuggets\":\n     - Row index 2: Score = 122 (against Mavericks)\n     - Row index 4: Score = 105 (against Hornets)\n     - Row index 8: Score = 112 (against Rockets)\n     - Row index 10: Score = 106 (against Kings)\n     - Row index 12: Score = 125 (against Bucks)\n     - Row index 14: Score = 124 (against Warriors)\n\n   - From this list, the highest score is 125 points against the Bucks on December 26th.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the Nuggets scored their highest home total of 112 points against the Rockets.
