    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to identify the relevant rows and columns from the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit.\" This involves checking two conditions:\n1. The payout for \"four aces\" when playing with 5 credits.\n2. The payout for \"four aces\" when playing with 1 credit.\n\nLet's break down the table to find these values:\n\n- Look for the row corresponding to \"four aces.\"\n- Within this row, check the column labeled \"5 credits\" for the payout at 5 credits.\n- Similarly, check the column labeled \"1 credit\" for the payout at 1 credit.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The row for \"four aces\" is found in the fifth position (index 4 if zero-indexed).\n- In this row:\n  - The value under \"5 credits\" is 800.\n  - The value under \"1 credit\" is 160.\n\nBoth conditions match the claim: \"four ace win 800 credit at 5 credit but only 160 credit at 1 credit.\"\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table data.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
