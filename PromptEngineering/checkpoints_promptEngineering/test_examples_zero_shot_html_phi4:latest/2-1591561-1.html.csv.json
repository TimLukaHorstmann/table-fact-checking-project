    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze each part of the claim in relation to the table:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The aircraft with the tail number c9 - bad have an unknown number of fatalities.\"\n\n1. **Tail Number Identification**: \n   - We need to find a row where the \"tail number\" column matches \"c9 - bad\".\n\n2. **Fatalities Check**:\n   - Once we identify the correct row, check the \"fatalities\" column to see if it contains \"unknown\".\n\n### Table Examination:\n\n1. **Row by Row Search for Tail Number \"c9 - bad\":**\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Location: quelimane\n     - Aircraft: lockheed l - 14\n     - Tail number: cr - aav\n     - Fatalities: unknown\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - Location: lagoa p\u00e1ti\n     - Aircraft: ju - 52\n     - Tail number: unknown\n     - Fatalities: unknown\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Location: louren\u00e7o marques\n     - Aircraft: f27 - 200\n     - Tail number: cr - aib\n     - Fatalities: 3 / 3\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Location: quelimane\n     - Aircraft: boeing 737 - 200\n     - Tail number: c9 - bab\n     - Fatalities: 0 / 110\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Location: lichinga\n     - Aircraft: boeing 737 - 200\n     - Tail number: c9 - bad\n     - Fatalities: 0 / 108\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Location: off maputo\n     - Aircraft: boeing 747sp\n     - Tail number: zs - spf\n     - Fatalities: 0 / 66\n\n2. **Verification of Claim Against Row 4 (Tail Number \"c9 - bad\")**:\n   - In Row 4, the \"fatalities\" are recorded as \"0 / 108\", which indicates a known number of fatalities, not unknown.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the aircraft with tail number \"c9 - bad\" has an unknown number of fatalities. However, from the table, we see that this aircraft has a known number of fatalities (0 out of 108).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 4, Column: \"tail number\"\n- Row 4, Column: \"fatalities\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tail number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
