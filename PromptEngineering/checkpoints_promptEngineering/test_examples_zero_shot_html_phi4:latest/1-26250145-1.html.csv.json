Since there is no explicit mention of contestants' names apart from their song choices and outcomes (like \"advanced\" or \"safe\"), we need to deduce from the context:\n\n- The table does not list performances in reverse order explicitly.\n- Without explicit contestant data, this assumption relies solely on the context given by the claim.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- If \"no one\" is listed as Didi Benami's last performance (without any subsequent entries for her), then it could be considered true that this was indeed her final song choice.\n  \nGiven only this row matches all conditions set by the claim, we conclude:\n\n- The row at index 2 satisfies the condition regarding the song and artist.\n- There are no further entries after this one in the table listing \"no one,\" implying it could be her last performance.\n\nThus, based on the given data and the structure of the table with the assumptions made about the contest progression:\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify two main conditions based on the given table:\n\n1. **\"terrified be one of the song she sing\"**:\n   - We must check if \"Terrified\" is listed as a \"song choice\" in any row.\n\n2. **\"in the week with a bollywood theme\"**:\n   - We need to verify whether any row has \"Bollywood\" listed under the \"theme\" column.\n\nLet's analyze each condition:\n\n1. **Checking for \"terrified\" as a song choice:**\n   - In the table, we find an entry in the second row where the \"song choice\" is \"Terrified.\" \n     - Relevant cell: Row 1 (index starting at 0), Column \"song choice\"\n\n2. **Checking for a \"Bollywood\" theme:**\n   - We need to look through all rows under the \"theme\" column to see if any entry reads \"Bollywood.\"\n   - After checking each row, there is no mention of a \"Bollywood\" theme in any row.\n\nSince the second condition (\"in the week with a bollywood theme\") is not met (no row has \"Bollywood\" as the theme), the claim cannot be fully supported. Therefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are those related to verifying both parts of the claim:\n\n- For \"terrified\" as a song choice: Row 1, Column \"song choice\"\n- For checking themes (even though none are Bollywood, we note the columns checked): Rows 0 through 8, Column \"theme\"\n\nHere is the JSON output based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
