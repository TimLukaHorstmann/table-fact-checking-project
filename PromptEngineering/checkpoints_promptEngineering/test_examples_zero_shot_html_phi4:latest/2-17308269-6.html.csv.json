    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ann Strother (g) be from Connecticut\" is true or false based on the given HTML table, we need to examine relevant data.\n\n1. **Identify Ann Strother in the Table**: \n   - The player of interest, \"Ann Strother (g),\" appears in row 5 of the table.\n   \n2. **Check Relevant Columns**:\n   - We are interested in two specific columns for this claim: \"nationality\" and \"college / country / team.\"\n   - Nationality is checked to determine if she is from Connecticut, as Connecticut is a state within the United States.\n\n3. **Examine Column Values for Ann Strother**:\n   - In row 5, under the \"nationality\" column, it states \"united states.\" This indicates that Ann Strother's nationality is the United States, but does not specify her specific home state.\n   - Under the \"college / country / team\" column in the same row, it lists \"connecticut,\" which likely refers to the University of Connecticut, a well-known college.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies that Ann Strother is from Connecticut. While her nationality being \"united states\" aligns with her being American, and attending or being associated with \"Connecticut\" could suggest a connection, it does not definitively prove she is originally from the state of Connecticut.\n   - The table provides an association with Connecticut through her college, but not explicitly that she was born there or considers it her home.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- **Answer**: Since the table does not provide explicit evidence that Ann Strother is specifically \"from\" Connecticut (as opposed to merely having a connection through education), we conclude the claim is not fully supported by the data.\n  \n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - Row index for Ann Strother is 5.\n  - Relevant columns are \"nationality\" and \"college / country / team.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Ann Strother, we need to examine two conditions outlined in the claim:\n\n1. **Ann Strother's nationality is \"Connecticut\".**\n2. **She never played for Indiana Fever.**\n\nLet's evaluate these using the data provided in the table.\n\n### Condition 1: Nationality of Ann Strother\n- We look at the row where Ann Strother appears, which is row index 5.\n- The relevant column here is \"nationality\".\n- According to the table:\n  - Row Index: 5\n  - Column Name: nationality\n  - Value: united states\n\nThe claim says her nationality is \"Connecticut,\" but the table shows it as \"united states.\" Therefore, this condition of the claim is false.\n\n### Condition 2: Former WNBA Team of Ann Strother\n- We again refer to row index 5 where Ann Strother's information is listed.\n- The relevant column here is \"former wnba team\".\n- According to the table:\n  - Row Index: 5\n  - Column Name: former wnba team\n  - Value: indiana fever\n\nThe claim states she never played for Indiana Fever, but the table explicitly lists Indiana Fever as her former WNBA team. This condition is also false.\n\nSince neither of the conditions in the claim are true based on the data provided, we conclude that the entire claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON representation with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
