This corresponds to the last row in the table provided.\n\n2. **Checking the Score:**\n   - On December 26, the score listed is \"2 - 3\".\n     - The format \"Visitor - Home\" indicates Pittsburgh (home) scored 2 and St. Louis (visitor) scored 3.\n     - This does not match the claim of \"St. Louis 3 , Pittsburgh 2\". The scores are reversed in terms of visitor-home.\n\n3. **Checking the Points:**\n   - On December 26, the points column shows 20, which matches the claim that Pittsburgh has accumulated 20 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The score part of the claim is incorrect because it reverses the actual scores.\n- The date and points parts are correct.\n\nTherefore, since not all conditions in the claim match the table data, the answer to whether the claim is true is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n1. **Row index 12:**\n   - Column \"date\" (to verify it matches December 26).\n   - Column \"score\" (to check the actual scores were 2-3, not 3-2).\n   - Column \"points\" (to confirm points accumulated is indeed 20).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the game on December 21, we need to examine several conditions in the table:\n\n1. The date must be December 21.\n2. Pittsburgh must host Minnesota.\n3. The attendance for this game should be 5307 people.\n4. After this game, the points accumulated by Pittsburgh should be 18.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions one-by-one using the data from the table:\n\n- **Date**: Locate the row where the date is December 21. This corresponds to the last row of the table provided.\n\n- **Home Team (Pittsburgh)**: Check if Pittsburgh is listed as the home team in this row. In the table, for December 21, it shows that Minnesota is the visitor and Pittsburgh is indeed the home team.\n\n- **Attendance**: Verify if the attendance for this game matches the claim of 5307 people. According to the table, on December 21, the attendance is indeed listed as 5307.\n\n- **Points Accumulated**: Confirm whether after this game, Pittsburgh's points total should be 18. From the row with date December 21:\n  - The score column shows \"3 - 1\" in favor of Minnesota.\n  - The record changes to \"6 - 18 - 6\", which indicates a loss for Pittsburgh (because their losses increased from 17 to 18).\n  - The points column is listed as 18, consistent with the claim.\n\nAll conditions outlined by the claim are satisfied according to the table data. Therefore, the claim that \"18 point be accumulate on december 21 when pittsburgh host minnesota in front of a crowd of 5307\" is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification from this row (index 10) are:\n- date: December 21\n- home: Pittsburgh\n- visitor: Minnesota\n- attendance: 5307\n- points: 18\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
