    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must analyze the table and check each row for conditions specified in the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"1 be the number of touchdown when the average be less than 2.6.\" This translates to checking if there are rows where:\n1. The value in the 'average' column is less than 2.6.\n2. Correspondingly, the value in the 'touchdowns' column must be exactly 1.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - 'average': 4.0 (not less than 2.6)\n  - Not relevant for the claim since the average is not less than 2.6.\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - 'average': 5.4 (not less than 2.6)\n  - Not relevant for the claim since the average is not less than 2.6.\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - 'average': 8.2 (not less than 2.6)\n  - Not relevant for the claim since the average is not less than 2.6.\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - 'average': 2.7 (not less than 2.6)\n  - Not relevant for the claim since the average is not less than 2.6.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - 'average': 2.6 (equal to, but not less than 2.6)\n  - Not relevant for the claim since the average is not less than 2.6.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are no rows where the average is less than 2.6. Consequently, there cannot be a case where touchdowns equal 1 under the condition of having an average less than 2.6.\n\nThus, the claim is false because no such row exists that satisfies both conditions specified in the claim.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion are:\n- Row 3: 'average' and 'touchdowns'\n- Row 4: 'average' and 'touchdowns'\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"average\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"touchdowns\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
