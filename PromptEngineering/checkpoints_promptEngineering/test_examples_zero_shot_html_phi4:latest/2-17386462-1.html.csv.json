    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check the column related to the number of games lost for each team in the table.\n\nThe relevant column here is \"Draws\" because typically:\n- The total number of games played by each team can be calculated as: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Games Played} = \\text{Wins} + \\text{Draws} + \\text{Losses}\n  \\]\n- Given the table does not directly provide losses, we calculate them using:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Losses} = \\text{Total Games Played} - (\\text{Wins} + \\text{Draws})\n  \\]\n- From the table, we know each team played 42 games.\n\nWe need to identify which team has lost the highest number of games and verify if it matches the claim that Matlock Town lost 23 games.\n\nLet's calculate losses for relevant teams:\n\n1. **Matlock Town** (Row 21):\n   - Wins = 12\n   - Draws = 23\n   - Losses = \\(42 - (12 + 23) = 7\\)\n\n2. Check other rows to ensure no team has more than 23 losses:\n   - Row 20 (Morecambe): \n     - Wins = 11, Draws = 22\n     - Losses = \\(42 - (11 + 22) = 9\\)\n   - Row 19 (Tamworth):\n     - Wins = 9, Draws = 23\n     - Losses = \\(42 - (9 + 23) = 10\\)\n\nNo team has more than 7 losses based on the calculations above. Thus, Matlock Town does not have the highest number of losses, and certainly not 23.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON output with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Draws\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Draws\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Draws\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
