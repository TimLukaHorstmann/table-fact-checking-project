From the table, we find this in Row 8.\n  \n- **Verification**:\n  - In Row 8, under the column labeled \"theme\", the entry is \"the rolling stones\", which matches our first condition.\n  - In Row 8, under the column labeled \"order\", the entry is \"6\", which satisfies the second condition of Katie being number 6 in order.\n\nThe claim specifies that for the Rolling Stones theme, Katie was number 6 in order. The table confirms this information with Row 8 having both conditions satisfied. Thus, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's format this into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Row indices are zero-based.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to verify two specific conditions from the given table:\n\n1. Identify whether \"big girls don't cry\" is listed as a song choice.\n2. Verify if Stevie Wonder is identified as the original artist for that song.\n\nLet's break down each step based on the information in the provided HTML table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n#### 1. Finding \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" in the Song Choice Column\nWe need to locate a row where the \"song choice\" column has the value \"big girls don't cry\". \n\nFrom the table:\n- In the 11th row (index 10, since indexing starts at 0), we see that the song choice is indeed \"big girls don't cry\".\n\n#### 2. Checking the Original Artist for That Song\nNow, verify if the original artist associated with \"big girls don't cry\" in the same row is \"stevie wonder\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- In the 11th row (index 10), the column \"original artist\" lists \"fergie\", not Stevie Wonder.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the song choice should be \"big girl don't cry\" and the original artist should be Stevie Wonder. While the song choice matches, the original artist does not match the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo support this conclusion, we identify the relevant cells used in our verification:\n\n- **Song Choice:** The cell containing \"big girls don't cry\" (row index 10, column name \"song choice\").\n- **Original Artist:** The cell containing \"fergie\" for that song (row index 10, column name \"original artist\").\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **\"9 be katie 's order number when the theme be the rolling stone\"**:\n   - First, identify if there is a row where \"katie\" appears in any column (likely within the context of names or related information).\n   - Then, verify if this occurs during the stage with \"the rolling stones\" as the theme.\n   - Finally, check if the order number associated with this combination is 9.\n\nLet's break down these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Katie's Row**: \n   - The table does not explicitly list participants' names in any column. However, based on common understanding of such tables, \"order\" numbers typically correspond to participants' performances.\n   - We need to infer which row might be associated with a participant named Katie.\n\n2. **Check for Theme \"The Rolling Stones\"**:\n   - Look through the table for rows where the theme is \"the rolling stones\".\n\n3. **Verify Order Number**:\n   - For the row(s) identified in step 1 and 2, check if the order number is 9.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The row with the theme \"The Rolling Stones\" is:\n  ```html\n  <tr>\n    <td>top 12</td>\n    <td>the rolling stones</td>\n    <td>wild horses</td>\n    <td>the rolling stones</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>safe</td>\n  </tr>\n  ```\n\n- The order number for this row is 6, not 9.\n\nSince the table does not provide explicit participant names and there's no indication of Katie in any context, we cannot definitively associate her with any specific row. Moreover, even if we assume a hypothetical association, the order number when \"the rolling stones\" was the theme is 6, not 9.\n\nThus, based on the information provided:\n\n- The claim that \"Katie's order number is 9 when the theme is 'The Rolling Stones'\" is **FALSE**.\n- The relevant cells for verifying this are those related to the row with the theme \"The Rolling Stones\".\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
