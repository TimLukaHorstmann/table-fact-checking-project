These are relevant to verify this part of the claim if \"lichuan\" was present.\n\n3. **Checking total population:**\n   - For both identified rows with a 4.83% population, we check the sixth column (Total Population).\n   - The first row has a Total Population of 388035.\n   - The third row has a Total Population of 387965.\n\nSince \"lichuan\" is not found in any of the rows, regardless of the presence of the percentage or total population values, the claim cannot be supported by the table. Thus, the answer to whether the claim is true is \"FALSE\".\n\nThe relevant cells for verification are those related to checking the percentage and total population values, as these provide context to why \"lichuan\" was not found:\n\n- **Row 0 (Lichuan County)**:  \n  - Column % Population with value \"4.83%\"\n  - Column Total Population with value \"388035\"\n\n- **Row 2 (Lichuan District)**:\n  - Column % Population with value \"4.83%\"\n  - Column Total Population with value \"387965\"\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"% Population\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Total Population\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"% Population\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Total Population\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Wulingyuan has the largest Tujia population compared to other counties in Hunan.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions using the table data provided:\n\n### Step 1: Verify if Wulingyuan is in Hunan\n- From the table, locate entries that belong to \"Hunan\" under the column representing provinces.\n- The relevant rows for Hunan are:\n  - Row 3: Zhangjiajie, Wulingyuan, 41.91, Tujia\n  - Rows 15 through 21 contain other counties within Hunan.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Wulingyuan has the largest Tujia population in Hunan\n- Focus on rows with \"Tujia\" as their ethnicity.\n- For each row where the province is \"Hunan,\" compare the population figures:\n  - Row 3: Wulingyuan, 41.91 (Tujia)\n  - Row 16: Shuangpai, 40.63 (Tujia) \n  - Row 11: Xiangxi, Luxi, 40.643 (Tujia)\n\nWulingyuan has the highest population value of 41.91 among Tujia counties in Hunan.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince Wulingyuan indeed has the largest Tujia population listed for Hunan province and is confirmed to be a county within that province, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"County\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Population (%)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Population (%)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Population (%)\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThe selected cells help verify both the location of Wulingyuan within Hunan and its status as having the largest Tujia population compared to other counties in the province.",
