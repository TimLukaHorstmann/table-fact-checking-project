She plays for a team called \"McGill\" during the 2012 season.\n\nLet's evaluate these one by one against the data in the table:\n\n- **Player's Name**: In row 9, we have the entry \"jessica quinones,\" which matches \"Jessica Quinones\" in the claim.\n  \n- **Number**: In the same row (row 9), the number is listed as 26, which aligns with the number mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Team Name**: For the team name, we see \"far eastern\" in the table for Jessica Quinones. The claim states she plays for a team called \"McGill,\" which does not match the information in the table.\n\n- **Season**: Both the claim and the table indicate the 2012 season, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nBased on these checks, we find that while the player's name, number, and season match the claim, the team name does not. Therefore, the claim is false because Jessica Quinones played for \"Far Eastern,\" not \"McGill.\"\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- The entire row 9 (index 9) to check all conditions related to Jessica Quinones.\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
