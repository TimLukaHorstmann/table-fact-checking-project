The MCG's attendance of 21,744 is not the second highest but rather the fourth.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"MCG venue have 2nd most attendance in the 1965 season\" is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying this claim include those containing the crowd numbers and venues:\n\n- Princes Park: Attendance = 34,945\n- Victoria Park: Attendance = 31,370\n- Lake Oval: Attendance = 23,979\n- MCG: Attendance = 21,744\n\nHere is the JSON object with the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We need to find the row where Geelong is playing as an away team and compare their score with North Melbourne's score when they are also an away team.\n\n2. **Locate Scores**:\n   - **Geelong**: Look for the row where Geelong is listed under \"away team\" and note their score.\n   - **North Melbourne**: Similarly, find the row where North Melbourne is listed as the \"away team\" and note their score.\n\n3. **Extract Scores from Table**:\n   - From the table:\n     - **Row 3 (Carlton vs. Geelong)**: \n       - Carlton (home team) scored 8.11 (59)\n       - Geelong (away team) scored 9.11 (65)\n     - **Row 0 (Melbourne vs. North Melbourne)**:\n       - Melbourne (home team) scored 11.14 (80)\n       - North Melbourne (away team) scored 10.12 (72)\n\n4. **Compare Scores**:\n   - Geelong's score as an away team: 9.11 (65)\n   - North Melbourne's score as an away team: 10.12 (72)\n   - Convert these scores to points for comparison:\n     - Geelong: \\(9 \\times 6 + 11 \\times 1 = 54 + 11 = 65\\)\n     - North Melbourne: \\(10 \\times 6 + 12 \\times 1 = 60 + 12 = 72\\)\n\n5. **Determine the Truth of the Claim**:\n   - Geelong's score (65) is less than North Melbourne's score (72).\n\nThus, the claim \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team\" is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For Geelong: Row 3, columns \"away team score\"\n   - For North Melbourne: Row 0, columns \"away team score\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
