Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The cells relevant to verifying the first part are Row 3's \"home team\" and \"home team score\".\n- For the second part, it involves Row 3's \"away team\" and \"away team score\".\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the claim and verify each part against the table:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"All date in the table for the 1964 VFL season take place on 22 August 1964.\"**\n   - Check the \"date\" column for all rows to ensure they are \"22 August 1964\".\n\n2. **\"The lowest crowd is 14151 at the venue junction oval.\"**\n   - Check the \"crowd\" column to find the minimum value and verify it matches 14151.\n   - Ensure that this minimum crowd number corresponds with the \"venue\" being \"junction oval\".\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Date Verification:**\n   - All rows have the date \"22 August 1964\". This satisfies the first part of the claim.\n\n2. **Lowest Crowd Verification:**\n   - The \"crowd\" values are:\n     - Row 0: 20555\n     - Row 1: 16800\n     - Row 2: 15500\n     - Row 3: 27100\n     - Row 4: 21895\n     - Row 5: 14151\n\n   - The lowest crowd is indeed 14151, which occurs in row 5.\n\n3. **Venue for Lowest Crowd:**\n   - In row 5, the \"venue\" is \"brunswick street oval\", not \"junction oval\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim about all dates being on \"22 August 1964\" is true.\n- However, the claim that the lowest crowd of 14151 is at \"junction oval\" is false. It actually occurs at \"brunswick street oval\".\n\nTherefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For date verification: All rows in the \"date\" column.\n- For crowd and venue verification: Row 5 in both the \"crowd\" and \"venue\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
