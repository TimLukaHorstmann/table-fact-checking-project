    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there are exactly six players selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the specified range of picks (43-63).\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Picks:** We focus on rows where \"pick\" values fall between 43 and 63.\n\n2. **Check NHL Team for Each Pick:** For each relevant pick, check if the \"nhl team\" is \"philadelphia flyers\".\n\n3. **Count the Occurrences:** Count how many times \"philadelphia flyers\" appears in the specified range.\n\nLet's go through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Pick 43, NHL Team is \"philadelphia flyers\".\n- Row 1: Pick 44, NHL Team is \"new jersey devils\".\n- Row 2: Pick 45, NHL Team is \"chicago black hawks\".\n- Row 3: Pick 46, NHL Team is \"minnesota north stars\".\n- Row 4: Pick 47, NHL Team is \"philadelphia flyers\".\n- Row 5: Pick 48, NHL Team is \"los angeles kings\".\n- Row 6: Pick 49, NHL Team is \"detroit red wings\" (original table had a typo).\n- Row 7: Pick 50, NHL Team is \"washington capitals\".\n- Row 8: Pick 51, NHL Team is \"new york rangers\".\n- Row 9: Pick 52, NHL Team is \"ottawa senators\".\n- Row 10: Pick 53, NHL Team is \"montreal canadiens\".\n- Row 11: Pick 54, NHL Team is \"toronto maples leafs\".\n- Row 12: Pick 55, NHL Team is \"vancouver canucks\".\n- Row 13: Pick 56, NHL Team is \"st louis blues\".\n- Row 14: Pick 57, NHL Team is \"quebec nordiques\".\n- Row 15: Pick 58, NHL Team is \"vancouver canucks\".\n- Row 16: Pick 59, NHL Team is \"washington capitals\".\n- Row 17: Pick 60, NHL Team is \"buffalo sabres\".\n- Row 18: Pick 61, NHL Team is \"boston bruins\".\n- Row 19: Pick 62, NHL Team is \"new york islanders\".\n- Row 20: Pick 63, NHL Team is \"edmonton oilers\".\n\nFrom the above, we see that the Philadelphia Flyers have made picks in rows 0 and 4 within the specified range. This totals to two picks.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false as there are only two picks by the Philadelphia Flyers, not six.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
