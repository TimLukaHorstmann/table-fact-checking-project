    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the Essendon home game crowd size, we need to examine the relevant data in the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - The claim specifically mentions \"the home game of essendon\" and states a crowd size of 12,865.\n   - To verify this, we must locate the row where Essendon is listed as the \"home team.\"\n   - Once located, check the value in the \"crowd\" column to confirm if it matches the claimed number.\n\n2. **Locate Essendon's Home Game**:\n   - From the table data provided, observe each row under the \"home team\" column.\n   - Find the row where the \"home team\" is listed as Essendon.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Crowd Size**:\n   - Identify the corresponding entry in the \"crowd\" column for that row to verify if it matches 12,865.\n\n4. **Confirm Each Condition**:\n   - Ensure both conditions of the claim are satisfied: \n     - The team playing at home is Essendon.\n     - The crowd size recorded is 12,865.\n\n### Relevant Data Extraction\n\n- **Row Identification**: In the table, Essendon appears as a \"home team\" in row index 2 (third row).\n- **Crowd Size Check**:\n  - For row 2, under the \"crowd\" column, the value provided is 12,865.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied by this data. Therefore, the claim about Essendon's home game crowd size being small and exactly 12,865 is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- **Row Index**: The relevant row index where Essendon plays as a \"home team\" is 2.\n- **Column Names**:\n  - \"home team\" for confirming it\u2019s Essendon (row 2).\n  - \"crowd\" for verifying the size of 12,865 (row 2).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, the claim about Essendon's home game having a small crowd of 12,865 is TRUE.
