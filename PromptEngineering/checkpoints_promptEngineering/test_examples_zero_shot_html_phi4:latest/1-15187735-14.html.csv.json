    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify the relevant information provided in the claim against the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"segment c for netflix s07e05 show as sandwich s cookie.\"\n\nThis claim can be broken down into three parts that we need to validate:\n1. **Netflix Episode**: The episode identifier is `s07e05`.\n2. **Series and Episode Number**: It corresponds to the row where `series ep` is `14 - 05` and `episode` is `174`.\n3. **Segment C Content**: For this particular episode, segment c should be \"sandwich s cookie\".\n\n### Table Verification:\n1. **Netflix Column Check**:\n   - Look for the row where the `netflix` column has the value `s07e05`.\n\n2. **Series and Episode Number Check**:\n   - Ensure that the same row also matches `series ep` as `14 - 05` and `episode` as `174`.\n\n3. **Segment C Content Check**:\n   - Verify if the `segment c` column in this row contains \"sandwich s cookie\".\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n- The table shows that for the row with `series ep` as `14 - 05`, `episode` as `174`, and `netflix` as `s07e05`, the `segment c` is indeed listed as \"sandwich s cookie\".\n\nThus, all conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data in the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is fully supported by the information in the table. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"series ep\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"netflix\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"segment c\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
