This information is found under the \"high points\" column.\n   \n3. **Count Occurrences**: Count how many times Carmelo Anthony appears as the leading scorer.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Game 1 (Row 0)**: Carmelo Anthony - 42 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 2 (Row 1)**: Carmelo Anthony - 30 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 3 (Row 2)**: Ty Lawson - 22 points (Carmelo is not the leading scorer)\n- **Game 4 (Row 3)**: Carmelo Anthony - 37 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 5 (Row 4)**: Carmelo Anthony - 30 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 6 (Row 5)**: Carmelo Anthony - 27 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 7 (Row 6)**: Carmelo Anthony - 22 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 8 (Row 7)**: Carmelo Anthony - 50 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 9 (Row 8)**: Carmelo Anthony - 30 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 10 (Row 9)**: Carmelo Anthony - 27 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 11 (Row 10)**: Carmelo Anthony - 22 points (leading scorer)\n- **Game 12 (Row 11)**: Carmelo Anthony - 30 points (leading scorer)\n\nCounting the occurrences, Carmelo Anthony is listed as the leading scorer in 11 out of the 13 games.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that Carmelo Anthony was the leading scorer in \"10 out of 13\" games. Since he led in 11 games, this means the claim is actually understating his performance by one game but still meets the condition of being the leader in at least 10 games.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the claim can be considered true because it requires Carmelo Anthony to lead in a minimum of 10 games, which he did.
