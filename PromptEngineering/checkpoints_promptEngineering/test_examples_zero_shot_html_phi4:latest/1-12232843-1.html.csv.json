Identify the year in which Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey compete as a women's doubles team.\n2. Identify the year in which Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles.\n\n### Step 1: Find Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey\n\n- We need to look at the \"womens doubles\" column to find when Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey are listed together as a team.\n- By examining each row under the \"womens doubles\" column, we find that they compete in the year 2009.\n\n### Step 2: Find Jamie Van Hooijdonk\n\n- We need to look at the \"mens singles\" column to find when Jamie Van Hooijdonk is listed as a competitor.\n- By examining each row under the \"mens singles\" column, we find that he competes in the year 2009.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince both Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey compete in women's doubles and Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles in the same year (2009), the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n- Row index 10, column \"womens doubles\" for Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n- Row index 10, column \"mens singles\" for Jamie Van Hooijdonk.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be zero woman 's double team that compete when jamie van hooijdonk compete,\" we need to determine if there is a year in which Jamie Van Hooijdonk won the men's singles while also checking if another women's doubles team competed in the same season.\n\n1. Identify the row where \"jamie van hooijdonk\" won the men's singles:\n   - This occurs in the 2009 row as shown by the table:\n\n     ```\n     | season | mens singles   | womens singles | mens doubles                 | womens doubles               | mixed doubles      |\n     |--------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n     | 2009   | jamie van hooijdonk | sarah thomas    | martyn lewis matthew hughes | kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey | martyn lewis vikki jones |\n     ```\n\n2. Check the women's doubles team for that year (2009):\n   - The winning team is \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\"\n\n3. Since there is a women's doubles team listed for 2009, the claim that no women\u2019s double team competed in the same season as Jamie Van Hooijdonk is false.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of the relevant cells:\n- The row index for 2009 is 9 (since it starts from 0).\n- The column \"mens singles\" at this row indicates Jamie Van Hooijdonk as the winner.\n- The column \"womens doubles\" shows that a team did indeed compete.",
