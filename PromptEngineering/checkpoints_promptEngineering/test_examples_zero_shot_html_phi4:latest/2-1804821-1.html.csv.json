    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the knight named Gallop, we need to verify two specific conditions from the table:\n\n1. The external weapon for Gallop should be \"two shortswords\".\n2. The shield animal for Gallop should be \"falcon\".\n\nLet's examine each condition in detail:\n\n### Condition 1: External Weapon\n- We need to locate the row corresponding to the knight named \"Gallop\" and check the value in the \"external weapon\" column.\n- From the table, we find:\n  - Row 6 (considering zero-based indexing), Knight: Gallop, External Weapon: sword\n- The claim states that the external weapon should be \"two shortswords\", but it is actually just a \"sword\".\n\n### Condition 2: Shield Animal\n- Again, locate the row for the knight named \"Gallop\" and check the value in the \"shield animal\" column.\n- From the table, we find:\n  - Row 6 (zero-based indexing), Knight: Gallop, Shield Animal: cerberus\n- The claim states that the shield animal should be \"falcon\", but it is actually a \"cerberus\".\n\nSince neither of the conditions in the claim are met based on the data from the table, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For the external weapon condition:\n  - Row index: 6\n  - Column name: \"external weapon\"\n- For the shield animal condition:\n  - Row index: 6\n  - Column name: \"shield animal\"\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"external weapon\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"shield animal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
