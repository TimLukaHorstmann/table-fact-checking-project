    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"the show, remember me, have 20 episode in it's series,\" we need to analyze specific columns from the table related to the title and numbering of episodes.\n\n1. **Identify Episodes Titled \"Remember Me\":**\n   - Look at the `title` column to find entries matching \"remember me\".\n   - The entry for \"remember me\" is found in row 20 with a lowercase 'r' as seen in the table. However, since titles are generally case-insensitive for this purpose, we consider it valid.\n\n2. **Check Episode Numbering:**\n   - Check the `no in series` column to determine the episode number of \"remember me\".\n   - The row 20 entry has a value of `20` in the `no in series` column.\n\n3. **Interpretation of Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the show, remember me, have 20 episode in it's series\". This can be interpreted as implying that \"remember me\" is either the 20th episode or there are 20 episodes up to and including \"remember me\".\n   - Given that `no in series` for \"remember me\" is `20`, this means \"remember me\" is indeed the 20th episode, thus fulfilling the condition implied by the claim.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row 20, Column: `title`\n- Row 20, Column: `no in series`\n\nThe information supports the claim. Therefore, we conclude that the answer is \"TRUE\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote: The row index is zero-based.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to interpret it correctly and verify against the data in the table. The claim states: \"of all of the series that be list the lowest number of episode of 1 series be 11.\" \n\nFirst, let's clarify what this claim is likely intended to mean:\n\n- It seems to assert that among all listed episodes, the one with the lowest number of episodes (or a specific count) in the entire series is exactly 11. This could refer to either \"no in season\" or \"no in series.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the table based on this interpretation:\n\n1. **Column: \"no in series\"**\n   - This column contains values from 11 to 23 for each row, indicating that there are at least 23 episodes (as the highest number is 23). Therefore, no episode has a total count of only 11 within this series.\n\n2. **Column: \"no in season\"**\n   - The values range from 1 to 13, representing the episode numbers within each season rather than across the entire series.\n   - This means that there are at least two seasons since the maximum value for \"no in season\" is 13, indicating a second season started after 12 episodes.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The lowest number of episodes listed under \"no in series\" is 11, which aligns with one part of the claim.\n- However, the claim seems to suggest that this is the overall count for an entire series or something similar, but from the data, it's clear that there are more than 11 total episodes (up to at least 23).\n  \nThus, while \"no in series\" does start at 11, it does not mean the series has only 11 episodes; rather, it means episode 11 is included.\n\nTherefore, the claim as interpreted (\"the lowest number of episode of 1 series be 11\") does not accurately describe the table. The table shows a series with more than 11 episodes.\n\nHence, the correct answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow let's specify which cells are relevant for this conclusion:\n\n- We need to look at all entries in both the \"no in season\" and \"no in series\" columns to understand the total count of episodes.\n  \nRelevant cells:\n- For column \"no in series\": All rows from index 0 through 22, as they give us the full episode range within this data set.\n- For column \"no in season\": All rows from index 0 through 12 (as the next entry starts a new sequence at index 21), to see that there are more than just one season.\n\nThus, here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
