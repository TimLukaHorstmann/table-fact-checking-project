The song \"missarna\" is performed by \"blond.\"\n2. \"Missarna\" is placed immediately after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\"\n\nLet's go through each condition with reference to the relevant rows and columns in the table.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the performer of \"missarna\"\n\n- Find the row where the song \"missarna\" appears.\n  - The row for \"missarma\" is row index 10:\n    - Artist: `wille craaford`\n    - Song: `missarna`\n\nThe claim states that \"blond\" performed \"missarma,\" but according to the table, it was performed by \"wille craaford.\" Therefore, this condition fails.\n\n### Step 2: Verify placement order\n\nEven though the first condition failed, let's still verify if \"missarma\" is placed right after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\"\n\n- Find the row where the song \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" appears.\n  - The row for \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\" is row index 3:\n    - Artist: `n - mix`\n    - Song: `d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5`\n\n- Check the place of this song and the subsequent one:\n  - Place for \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5\": `2nd` (row index 3)\n  - Next row, which is row index 4:\n    - Artist: `wille craaford`\n    - Song: `missarna`\n    - Place: `3rd`\n\nThe placement of \"missarma\" is indeed right after \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough the song \"missarma\" is placed correctly in relation to \"d\u00e4r en \u00e4ngel h\u00e4lsat p\u00e5,\" it was not performed by \"blond.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this evaluation are:\n- Row index 10 for verifying the performer of \"missarna.\"\n- Rows indices 3 and 4 for checking the placement order.\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
