    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"player Larry Mize and D A Weibring tie for 5th place,\" we need to analyze the relevant data in the provided table. The claim involves checking two players, their scores, and their placements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - **Larry Mize**: According to the table:\n     - Row Index 4\n     - Country: United States\n     - Score: 69 + 67 + 72 = 208\n     - To Par: -5\n     - Place: t5\n\n   - **D A Weibring**: According to the table:\n     - Row Index 5\n     - Country: United States\n     - Score: 71 + 69 + 68 = 208\n     - To Par: -5\n     - Place: t5\n\n2. **Verify Claims about Placement and Scores:**\n   - Both Larry Mize and D A Weibring are listed with a placement of \"t5,\" indicating they tie for the 5th position.\n   - Their scores are both calculated to be 208, and their \"To Par\" is listed as \"-5.\"\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Data:**\n   - Since both players have identical placements (\"t5\"), scores (208), and performance relative to par (-5), they indeed tie for the 5th place.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells in the Table:**\n   - For Larry Mize:\n     - Row Index: 4, Column Name: \"place\"\n     - Row Index: 4, Column Name: \"score\"\n     - Row Index: 4, Column Name: \"to par\"\n\n   - For D A Weibring:\n     - Row Index: 5, Column Name: \"place\"\n     - Row Index: 5, Column Name: \"score\"\n     - Row Index: 5, Column Name: \"to par\"\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Larry Mize and Scott Simpson be tie for 5th place\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant information in the table regarding their placements.\n\n1. **Identify Larry Mize's Placement:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row index 4 corresponds to Larry Mize.\n     - The \"place\" column value for this row is \"t5\", indicating a tie for 5th place.\n   \n2. **Identify Scott Simpson's Placement:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row index 3 corresponds to Scott Simpson.\n     - The \"place\" column value for this row is \"t2\", indicating a tie for 2nd place.\n\nFrom these observations, we see that Larry Mize is indeed tied for 5th place, but Scott Simpson is tied for 2nd place.

Identify the row for Fred Couples:\n   - We find Fred Couples listed as player at position \"8\" (7th index since indexing starts from 0).\n\n2. Check his score in the \"score\" column:\n   - His recorded score is \"72 + 67 + 71 = 210\".\n\n3. Compare the given claim against the actual data:\n   - The claim states that Fred Couples have a score larger than 210.\n   - However, according to the table, Fred Couples' score is exactly 210.\n\nSince his score is not larger than 210 but equal to it, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cell information needed for this determination includes:\n\n- Row index for Fred Couples: 7 (since we start counting from 0)\n- Column name: \"score\"\n\nThus, the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
