    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Jacqueline Du Bief's performance and score, we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Placings:** The claim states that Jacqueline Du Bief earned 14 placings.\n2. **Total Score:** It also claims her total score was 188.67.\n\nWe will look at each condition by identifying relevant cells in the table related to Jacqueline Du Bief and check if they match what is stated in the claim.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Find Jacqueline Du Bief's Entry:**\n   - We need to locate her row in the table. By examining the \"name\" column, we find that Jacqueline Du Bief appears on row 2 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Verify Placings:**\n   - Once we locate the correct row for Jacqueline Du Bief, we check the \"placings\" column to verify if it shows a value of 14.\n   - In row 2, under the \"placings\" column, there is indeed an entry of 14.\n\n3. **Verify Total Score:**\n   - Next, we need to ensure that her total score matches the claim of 188.67.\n   - For this, we check the \"total\" (or \"score\") column in row 2 and confirm if it shows a value of 188.67.\n   - In row 2, under the \"total\" column, there is an entry of 188.67.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (placings = 14 and total score = 188.67), we can conclude that the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- The row index for Jacqueline Du Bief is 2.\n- Relevant columns checked:\n  - \"placings\" column, showing a value of 14.\n  - \"total\" (or \"score\") column, showing a value of 188.67.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object representing our findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"placings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
