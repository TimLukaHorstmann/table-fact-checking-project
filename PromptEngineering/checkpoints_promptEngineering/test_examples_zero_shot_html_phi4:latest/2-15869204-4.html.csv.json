    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the highest rebound total for a player in one game be 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table data, we need to examine the \"high rebounds\" column across all rows.\n\nThe process involves:\n\n1. Reviewing each entry in the \"high rebounds\" column.\n2. Identifying the maximum rebound count for any single player mentioned in that column.\n3. Checking whether this maximum value is 13 or less.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row 0:** Jerome Williams with 16 rebounds\n- **Row 1:** Antonio Davis with 12 rebounds\n- **Row 2:** Jerome Williams with 13 rebounds\n- **Row 3:** Jerome Williams with 13 rebounds\n- **Row 4:** Antonio Davis with 11 rebounds\n- **Row 5:** Chris Bosh, Antonio Davis, Jerome Williams (8 each)\n- **Row 6:** Antonio Davis with 10 rebounds\n- **Row 7:** Antonio Davis and Jerome Williams (9 each)\n- **Row 8:** Antonio Davis with 11 rebounds\n- **Row 9:** Chris Bosh, Vince Carter, Jerome Williams (6 each)\n- **Row 10:** Antonio Davis with 8 rebounds\n- **Row 11:** Chris Bosh with 10 rebounds\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- The highest rebound total for a player in one game is 16 (Jerome Williams in Row 0).\n\nSince the claim states that the highest number of rebounds by any player should be 13, and we found an instance where a player had 16 rebounds, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n- **Row 0:** \"high rebounds\" column (Jerome Williams with 16 rebounds)\n- **Row 2:** \"high rebounds\" column (Jerome Williams with 13 rebounds)\n- **Row 3:** \"high rebounds\" column (Jerome Williams with 13 rebounds)\n\nHere is the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if the highest attendance for a single game recorded in the table is indeed 19,800.\n\nThe relevant column here is \"location attendance\" since it contains information about the number of attendees at each game. We will examine this column across all rows and identify the maximum value to see if it matches or exceeds 19,800 as claimed.\n\nLet's extract the attendance data from each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Attendance = 15,869\n2. Row 1: Attendance = 17,556\n3. Row 2: Attendance = 20,173\n4. Row 3: Attendance = 16,888\n5. Row 4: Attendance = 14,082\n6. Row 5: Attendance = 18,997\n7. Row 6: Attendance = 17,317\n8. Row 7: Attendance = 19,547\n9. Row 8: Attendance = 19,800\n10. Row 9: Attendance = 13,755\n11. Row 10: Attendance = 17,702\n12. Row 11: Attendance = 11,730\n13. Row 12: Attendance = 13,375\n14. Row 13: Attendance = 14,585\n\nFrom the above data, we observe that the highest attendance recorded is 20,173 in row 2. Thus, while 19,800 was a high attendance figure and occurred in row 8, it wasn't the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the highest attendance for a single game be 19800\" is false because there's at least one game with higher attendance (20,173).\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those under the column \"location attendance\" corresponding to each game entry in the table.
