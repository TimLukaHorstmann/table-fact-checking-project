    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the game \"spy vs spy,\" we need to verify two specific conditions from the table: whether it is in the \"arcade\" genre and if it was available on the Amstrad CPC platform.\n\n1. **Genre Check:**\n   - We look for the entry with the title \"spy v spy.\" The corresponding row in the table is at `row_index` 14.\n   - In this row, under the column \"genre,\" the value listed is \"arcade / strategy.\"\n   - The claim specifies \"arcade\" as the genre. Since \"arcade / strategy\" includes \"arcade,\" this part of the claim is supported.\n\n2. **Platform Check:**\n   - We continue examining the same row (`row_index` 14) for platform availability.\n   - In the column labeled \"amstrad cpc,\" the value is \"n/a.\"\n   - The claim states that it was available on Amstrad CPC, but since the table lists \"n/a\" (not applicable), this part of the claim is not supported.\n\nSince both conditions need to be true for the entire claim to hold, and one condition (\"available on Amstrad CPC\") is false, we conclude that the overall claim is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- The cell indicating the genre at `row_index` 14 under \"genre\" supports part of the claim.\n- The cell indicating platform availability at `row_index` 14 under \"amstrad cpc\" contradicts part of the claim.\n\nGiven this analysis, here is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"genre\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"amstrad cpc\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
