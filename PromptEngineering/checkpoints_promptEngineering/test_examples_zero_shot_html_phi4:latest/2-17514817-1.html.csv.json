    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim \"west berkshire brewery 's dr hexter healer beer win 3 gold medal between 1995 and 2009,\" we need to focus on verifying two main parts:\n\n1. The association of \"dr hexter's healer\" with \"west berkshire brewery.\"\n2. The number of gold medals won by \"dr hexter's healer\" within the specified years (1995-2009).\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n#### Part 1: Association Check\nThe claim refers to a specific beer, \"dr hexter healer,\" but does not specify if it belongs to \"west berkshire brewery.\" The table only lists beer names and their achievements without mentioning the breweries. Therefore, we cannot confirm this association from the given data.\n\n#### Part 2: Gold Medal Count for \"Dr Hexter's Healer\"\nWe need to count how many gold medals were won by \"dr hexter's healer\" between 1995 and 2009:\n\n- **Row 15** (Year: 2008): \"dr hexter 's healer\" - Prize: \"gold medal,\" Category: \"best local beer.\" Relevant for counting.\n  \n- **Row 18** (Year: 2009): \"dr hexter 's healer\" - Prize: \"gold medal,\" Category: \"best local beer.\" Relevant for counting.\n  \n- **Row 19** (Year: 2009): \"dr hexter 's healer\" - Prize: \"gold medal,\" Category: \"in category.\" Relevant for counting.\n\nThese are the only entries involving \"dr hexter's healer\" that list a \"gold medal\" as the prize between 1995 and 2009. The count is three gold medals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The table does not provide information on whether \"dr hexter's healer\" belongs to \"west berkshire brewery,\" so we cannot confirm this part of the claim.\n- However, it confirms that \"dr hexter's healer\" won exactly three gold medals between 1995 and 2009.\n\nGiven the missing information about the brewery association in the table, we cannot fully support the entire claim as true.
