First leg score contribution = 1.\n   - Row 7 (\"cementarnica\"): Score is `2 - 0`. First leg score contribution = 2.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Scores:**\n   - Total for Team 1 in the first leg = 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 23.\n   - Total for Team 2 in the first leg = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2.\n\n4. **Combine Totals:**\n   The total score for all first legs combined is `23 - 2`.\n\n5. **Compare with Claim:**\n   The claim states the total should be `20 - 1`. Our calculated total is `23 - 2`.\n\nSince the calculated total does not match the claimed total, the statement is FALSE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   All rows under the \"1st leg\" column are relevant to verify this calculation.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to examine each team's score in the \"2nd leg\" column of the table and check if it matches the conditions stated: six teams have a score with one goal (1), one match is tied, and the rest are losses.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **sloga jugomagnat vs. pobeda**: 2nd leg score is \"0 - 1\". This is a loss for sloga jugomagnat.\n- **pelister vs. sileks**: 2nd leg score is \"3 - 5\". This is a loss for pelister.\n- **rabotni\u010dki vs. \u0161kendija hb**: 2nd leg score is \"1 - 2 ( aet )\". This is a loss for rabotni\u010dki and involves one goal scored by them.\n- **belasica vs. bregalnica \u0161tip**: 2nd leg score is \"1 - 1\". This is a tie match, involving one goal from belasica.\n- **karaorman vs. borec mhk**: 2nd leg score is \"1 - 4\". This is a loss for karaorman and involves one goal scored by them.\n- **vardar vs. napredok**: 2nd leg score is \"2 - 0\". This is a win for vardar, not involving any team scoring exactly one goal in this match.\n- **alumina vs. ba\u0161kimi**: 2nd leg score is \"1 - 4\". This is a loss for alumina and involves one goal scored by them.\n- **cementarnica vs. mad\u017eari solidarnost**: 2nd leg score is \"6 - 0\". This is a win for cementarnica, not involving any team scoring exactly one goal in this match.\n\nNow let's count:\n1. Teams with a score of 1: rabotni\u010dki (1-2), belasica (1-1), karaorman (1-4), and alumina (1-4). There are four teams, not six.\n2. Ties in the 2nd leg: belasica vs. bregalnica \u0161tip (1-1).\n3. Losses in the 2nd leg with one goal scored by the team: rabotni\u010dki (1-2), karaorman (1-4), and alumina (1-4). These are three instances.\n\nThe claim states there should be six teams that have a score of one, but we found only four.
