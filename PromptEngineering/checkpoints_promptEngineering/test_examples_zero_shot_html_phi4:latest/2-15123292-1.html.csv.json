Confirm whether this game was on September 27, 1953, and against the Chicago Cardinals.\n\nLet's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n- **Attendance Values**:\n  - Week 1 (September 27, 1953) vs. Chicago Cardinals: Attendance = 16,055\n  - Week 2 (October 2, 1953) vs. Philadelphia Eagles: Attendance = 19,099\n  - Week 3 (October 11, 1953) vs. New York Giants: Attendance = 26,241\n  - Week 4 (October 18, 1953) vs. Cleveland Browns: Attendance = 33,963\n  - Week 5 (October 25, 1953) vs. Baltimore Colts: Attendance = 34,031\n  - Week 6 (November 1, 1953) vs. Cleveland Browns: Attendance = 47,845\n  - Week 7 (November 8, 1953) vs. Chicago Cardinals: Attendance = 19,654\n  - Week 8 (November 15, 1953) vs. Chicago Bears: Attendance = 21,392\n  - Week 9 (November 22, 1953) vs. New York Giants: Attendance = 16,887\n  - Week 10 (November 29, 1953) vs. Pittsburgh Steelers: Attendance = 17,026\n  - Week 11 (December 6, 1953) vs. Philadelphia Eagles: Attendance = 21,579\n  - Week 12 (December 13, 1953) vs. Pittsburgh Steelers: Attendance = 22,057\n\n- **Identify the Least Attendance**:\n  The least attendance is 16,055, which occurred in Week 1 on September 27, 1953.\n\n- **Verify Opponent and Date**:\n  In Week 1 (row index 0), the date was indeed September 27, 1953, and the opponent was the Chicago Cardinals. \n\nThus, both conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n1. The least attended game was on September 27, 1953.\n2.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the washington redskins have a winning record during the 1953 season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the results of each game listed in the table. A winning record means more wins than losses (and ties do not count as either).\n\nLet's go through each row and examine the 'result' column:\n\n1. **Week 1:** Result = \"w 24 - 13\" (Win)\n2. **Week 2:** Result = \"t 21 - 21\" (Tie)\n3. **Week 3:** Result = \"w 13 - 9\" (Win)\n4. **Week 4:** Result = \"l 30 - 14\" (Loss)\n5. **Week 5:** Result = \"l 27 - 17\" (Loss)\n6. **Week 6:** Result = \"l 27 - 3\" (Loss)\n7. **Week 7:** Result = \"w 28 - 17\" (Win)\n8. **Week 8:** Result = \"l 27 - 24\" (Loss)\n9. **Week 9:** Result = \"w 24 - 21\" (Win)\n10. **Week 10:** Result = \"w 17 - 9\" (Win)\n11. **Week 11:** Result = \"w 10 - 0\" (Win)\n12. **Week 12:** Result = \"l 14 - 13\" (Loss)\n\nNow, let's count the number of wins, losses, and ties:\n\n- Wins: 6\n- Losses: 5\n- Ties: 1\n\nA winning record requires more wins than losses. In this case, there are 6 wins and 5 losses, which means the Washington Redskins have a winning record for the season.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are in the 'result' column across all rows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
