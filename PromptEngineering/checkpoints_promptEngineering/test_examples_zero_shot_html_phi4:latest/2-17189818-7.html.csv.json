    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to check if Peter Leko's scores for Jermuk and Nalchik match those stated in the claim: a score of 100 for Jermuk and 140 for Nalchik.\n\nFirst, identify the row corresponding to Peter Leko. Based on the table:\n\n- Peter Leko is listed under \"Peter Leko (HUN)\" with the region code \"(HUN)\". The row index for Peter Leko is 1.\n  \nNext, locate the scores for Jermuk and Nalchik:\n\n- **Jermuk:** \n  - In row 1, column \"Jermuk\", the value is `100`. This matches the claim.\n\n- **Nalchik:**\n  - In row 1, column \"Nalchik\", the value is `140`. This also matches the claim.\n\nSince both scores align with those given in the claim, the statement is fully supported by the data.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing the verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Jermuk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Nalchik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Nalchik with 4 played, a RL qual, and 100 Jermuk be less than 140,\" we need to interpret and verify each component of this statement using the provided table.\n\n1. **Nalchik with 4 played**: We are looking for entries related to Nalchik that have \"4\" in the last column (Games Played). The entry for Vugar Gashimov shows:\n   - Games Played: 4\n\n2. **RL qual**: This refers to players who qualified through Rapid and Blitz. In the table, this is represented by the column labeled \"Category.\" We need to find entries with category \"rl\" that also match the Nalchik condition.\n   - Vugar Gashimov has a Category of \"rl.\"\n\n3. **100 Jermuk**: The entry for Jermuk should have 100 in the corresponding cell. This is found under the Games Played column.\n   - Levon Aronian shows: \n     - Nalchik: 100\n     - Games Played: 4\n\nNow, we need to combine these conditions:\n- Find an RL qualified player (rl) who played at Nalchik and scored less than 140 points there.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Vugar Gashimov is an RL qualifier with a score of 100 in Nalchik.\n- Levon Aronian, also qualifying through Rapid and Blitz, has a score of 139.5 (noted as 139\u00bd) at Nalchik.\n\nBoth players satisfy the conditions:\n- Played 4 games in Nalchik\n- Qualified via RL\n- Scored less than 140 points at Nalchik\n\nThus, the claim is verified as TRUE based on these relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Nalchik\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Nalchik\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Games Played\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
