    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only district to list Mac Sweeney as incumbent is Texas 14\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data in the table. Specifically, we will check:\n\n1. The rows where Mac Sweeney appears as an incumbent.\n2. Ensure that there are no other districts besides Texas 14 where he is listed.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n1. **Locate Mac Sweeney in the Table:**\n   - We need to find any row(s) where Mac Sweeney is listed as an incumbent.\n   \n2. **Identify His District:**\n   - For each occurrence of Mac Sweeney, identify which district he represents.\n\n3. **Check for Uniqueness:**\n   - Verify if there is only one such instance and that it corresponds to Texas 14.\n\n### Detailed Examination\n\n- **Row with Mac Sweeney as Incumbent:**  \n  We locate the row where \"Mac Sweeney\" appears under the \"Incumbent\" column. In this table, he appears in:\n  - Row Index: 19\n  - Column Name: \"Incumbent\"\n  - District (from \"District\" column): Texas 14\n\n- **Check for Other Occurrences:**  \n  We need to ensure that Mac Sweeney does not appear as an incumbent in any other row. By scanning all rows, we see no other appearance of his name under the \"Incumbent\" column.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince Mac Sweeney is listed only once and it is indeed Texas 14, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell for verification is:\n\n- Row Index: 19\n- Column Name: \"Incumbent\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Incumbent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding Henry B. Gonzalez being unopposed in his election for the Texas district seat, we need to analyze the relevant data from the provided HTML table.\n\nThe specific claim states:\n\"Henry B. Gonzales be unopposed with no 1 vie for his seat.\"\n\nThis involves verifying two main conditions:\n1. Henry B. Gonzalez's incumbency.\n2. Whether he was indeed unopposed in his election, meaning no one else contested against him for the same position.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Henry B. Gonzales:**\n   - We need to locate the row that corresponds to \"Henry B. Gonzalez\" within the table.\n   - From the table provided:\n     ```\n     | texas 20 | henry b gonzalez | democratic | 1961 | re - elected | henry b gonzalez (d) unopposed |\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Incumbency and Unopposed Status:**\n   - The row for Henry B. Gonzalez shows he is from the \"democratic\" party, was first elected in 1961, and in this election cycle, he was re-elected.\n   - Most importantly, the cell under the \"candidates\" column states \"henry b gonzalez (d) unopposed,\" confirming that there were no other candidates running against him.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The data confirms that Henry B. Gonzalez was indeed unopposed in this election cycle for his district seat.\n   - Thus, the claim is fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row Index: 19 (since indexing typically starts at zero)\n- Column Name: \"incumbent\" to confirm he held office\n- Column Name: \"candidates\" to verify there were no other candidates\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE based on the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"candidates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We must check if Ken Hendrix was indeed the sole opponent against Albert Bustamante.\n3. The relevant information is found under the row where \"Albert Bustamante\" is listed as the incumbent.\n\n**Steps to verify:**\n\n- Locate the row with \"Albert Bustamante\" in the \"Incumbent\" column.\n  - Row index for this entry is 22.\n  \n- Check the \"Candidates\" column of that row:\n  - The content is \"albert bustamante (d) 90.7% ken hendrix ( l ) 9.3%\"\n  - This indicates there were two candidates: Albert Bustamante and Ken Hendrix.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim states that Ken Hendrix was the only other candidate, which is supported by the table since no additional candidates are mentioned.\n  \nThus, the claim is fully supported by the information in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Candidates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Marvin Leath (D) unopposed be the candidate who be vie for Henry B. Gonzalez' seat,\" we need to analyze several aspects of the given table and how they relate to the claim.\n\n1. **Identify the district associated with Marvin Leath**: \n   - According to the table, Marvin Leath is listed under \"district\": Texas 25, as per his row in the table.\n   \n2. **Identify the district associated with Henry B. Gonzalez**:\n   - From the table, Henry B. Gonzalez is represented in district: Texas 20.\n\n3. **Determine if Marvin Leath was unopposed**:\n   - The claim mentions that Marvin Leath (D) was \"unopposed.\" According to the row for Texas 25, the \"Candidates\" column confirms that he was indeed \"unopposed.\"\n\n4. **Check who vied for Henry B. Gonzalez's seat**:\n   - In district: Texas 20, Henry B. Gonzalez is listed as the incumbent and also \"unopposed.\" Thus, there were no other candidates vying for this particular seat.\n\n5. **Analyze the claim against these findings**:\n   - The claim implies that Marvin Leath was running in the election for Henry B. Gonzalez\u2019s seat. However, the table clearly shows Marvin Leath represented Texas 25 and Henry B. Gonzalez represented Texas 20. Therefore, they were associated with different districts.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since Marvin Leath did not vie for Henry B. Gonzalez's seat (as they are in different districts), the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this conclusion:\n- For Marvin Leath: Row 25 (\"district\": \"Texas 25\", \"Candidates\": \"Marvin Leath (D) unopposed\")\n- For Henry B.
