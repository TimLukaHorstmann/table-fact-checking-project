    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the relationships between mountain peaks mentioned in it and verify them against the data provided in the table. The claim is:\n\n\"The alpine peak Finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2 be mont blanc 's parent while mont blanc be the parent peak of arcalod.\"\n\nWe will break this down into two parts:\n1. \"Finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2 be Mont Blanc's parent.\"\n2. \"Mont Blanc be the parent peak of Arcalod.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation\n\n#### Part 1: Finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2 as Mont Blanc's Parent\n- **Find Finsteraarhorn:** Look for entries in the table mentioning \"Finsteraarhorn\". \n- Relevant row: Row 30 with `row_index` of 29 (since indices start from 0), where `Mountain` is \"finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2\" and `Parent Peak` is \"monte rosa\".\n- **Check Parent Relationship:** Finsteraarhorn's parent peak is listed as \"monte rosa\", not Mont Blanc. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n#### Part 2: Mont Blanc as Arcalod's Parent\n- **Find Arcalod:** Look for entries in the table mentioning \"Arcalod\".\n- Relevant row: Row 27 with `row_index` of 26, where `Mountain` is \"arcalod\" and `Parent Peak` is \"monte rosa\".\n- **Check Parent Relationship:** Arcalod's parent peak is listed as \"monte rosa\", not Mont Blanc. Therefore, this part of the claim is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth parts of the claim are incorrect based on the data from the table. Thus, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells that help verify this conclusion include:\n- For Finsteraarhorn: `row_index` 29 and column names \"Mountain\" (for \"finsteraarhorn 1 / mb 2\") and \"Parent Peak\" (for \"monte rosa\").\n- For Arcalod: `row_index` 26 and column names \"Mountain\" (for \"arcalod\") and \"Parent Peak\" (for \"monte rosa\").\n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Mountain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Parent Peak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Mountain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Parent Peak\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
