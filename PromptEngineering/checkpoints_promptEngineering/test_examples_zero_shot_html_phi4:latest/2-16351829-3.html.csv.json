This will give us the matches where neither team scored.\n\n- Row index 18: Crystal Palace vs. Wimbledon (0 - 0)\n- Row index 28: Arsenal vs. Sheffield United (1 - 1) [not relevant]\n- Row index 30: Stoke City vs. Nottingham Forest (1 - 1) [not relevant]\n- Row index 29: Hereford United vs. Tottenham Hotspur (1 - 1) [not relevant]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Tie Number\nIn each case with a \"0 - 0\" score, identify if there is a replay row following it and check the order to determine which match number corresponds to this scenario:\n\n- **Match #19** has a \"replay\" row (row index 19) indicating that Crystal Palace was indeed the home team in the initial tie (row index 18).\n\n### Step 3: Verify Crystal Palace as Home Team for the Highest Tie Number\nFrom our findings, Match #19 is the only match with a \"0 - 0\" score and a subsequent replay. We need to ensure there are no higher numbered matches with similar conditions.\n\n- Checking through all other rows, we find no other matches beyond Match #19 that have a \"0 - 0\" outcome followed by a replay.\n\n### Conclusion\nCrystal Palace is indeed the home team for the highest tie number (Match #19) where the score was \"0 - 0\".\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE**.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"when Wigan Athletic be the away team, 4 goal be score in the match\" is true or false based on the provided data table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Check each row of the table to see if Wigan Athletic played as the away team.\n\n2. **Examine Goals Scored**: For any matches where Wigan Athletic was the away team, check how many total goals were scored in those matches (sum of both teams' scores).\n\n3. **Assess the Claim**:\n   - If there is a match where Wigan Athletic played as the away team and exactly 4 goals were scored in that match, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the data:\n\n- **Row 1**: Wigan Athletic vs. Millwall\n  - Home: Millwall (3)\n  - Away: Wigan Athletic (2)\n  - Total goals scored = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- We find that in this match, Wigan Athletic was indeed the away team but 5 goals were scored, not 4.\n\nThere are no other rows in which Wigan Athletic is listed as the away team. Therefore, there are no matches where exactly 4 goals were scored when Wigan Athletic played as the away team.\n\nSince we have found a match where Wigan Athletic was the away team and the total goals scored do not equal 4, the claim is false. We only need to consider row 1 for verifying this claim.\n\nHere's the JSON object that represents our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Away\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object includes the relevant cells from row 1 to verify that Wigan Athletic was indeed the away team and check the total goals scored in that match.",
