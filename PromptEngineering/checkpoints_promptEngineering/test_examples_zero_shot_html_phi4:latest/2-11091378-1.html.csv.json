We need to verify each condition against the corresponding cell values in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Date Check**:\n   - Locate the row where the date is January 29.\n   - From the table, identify that this corresponds to `row_index` 3 (since indexing typically starts at 0).\n\n2. **Place Check**:\n   - Verify that in `row_index` 3, the place is Oakland.\n   - The cell value for \"place\" in this row is indeed \"oakland\".\n\n3. **Standing Check**:\n   - Confirm that the standing for `row_index` 3 is 3rd.\n   - The cell value for \"standing\" in this row is \"3rd\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the table data:\n\n- The date matches (January 29).\n- The place matches (Oakland).\n- The standing matches (3rd).\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells that were checked for this determination are:\n- For `row_index` 3, \"date\" column: January 29\n- For `row_index` 3, \"place\" column: Oakland\n- For `row_index` 3, \"standing\" column: 3rd\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"standing\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

According to the claim's requirement for all subsequent weeks (from Week 2 onwards) to have a standing of 3rd, failing even once invalidates the claim.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the claim is false.
