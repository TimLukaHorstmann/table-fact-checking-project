Looking at the table, under row index 4 (which corresponds to \"chapter five: dressed to kill\"), the column \"weekly rank for living\" indeed contains the value 8.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The title in the claim is incorrect due to a missing 'ed' in \"dressed\".\n- The weekly rank provided in the claim matches the data in the table.\n\nSince the episode title in the claim does not match exactly with what is present in the table, this discrepancy makes the entire claim false.
