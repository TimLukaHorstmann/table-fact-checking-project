    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"October 30, 1988 result in the lowest attendance for the season\" is true or false, we need to examine the attendance figures for each game in the table and identify if the game on October 30, 1988, has the lowest number.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** We focus on the \"date\", \"attendance\", and \"result\" columns since these are directly related to verifying the claim about attendance figures on a specific date.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures:**\n   - October 30, 1988 (Row 9): Attendance = 67352\n   - Compare this figure with other games in the season:\n     - Week 1 (Row 0): 38087\n     - Week 2 (Row 1): 35989\n     - Week 3 (Row 2): 38163\n     - Week 4 (Row 3): 36800\n     - Week 5 (Row 4): 32170\n     - Week 6 (Row 5): 25018\n     - Week 7 (Row 6): 26947\n     - Week 8 (Row 7): 25956\n     - Week 9 (Row 8): 56892\n     - Week 10 (Row 9): **67352** (October 30, 1988)\n     - Week 11 (Row 10): 67070\n     - Week 12 (Row 11): 14020\n     - Week 13 (Row 12): 49498\n     - Week 14 (Row 13): 39889\n     - Week 15 (Row 14): 37778\n\n3. **Find the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - The lowest attendance is found in Week 12, November 27, 1988 (Row 11) with an attendance of 14020.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since October 30, 1988, does not have the lowest attendance for the season (it has a higher attendance than November 27, 1988), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row Index and Column Name for each relevant row's \"attendance\" are needed to verify this:\n     - October 30, 1988: Row Index = 9, Column Name = \"Attendance\"\n     - November 27, 1988 (lowest attendance): Row Index = 11, Column Name = \"Attendance\"\n\nThus, the JSON output with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
