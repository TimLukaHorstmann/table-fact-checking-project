    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify two specific details from the table:\n\n1. Identify the rider in the third position.\n2. Check if this rider has a time of 1:19.02.8.\n\nLet's break down the process step-by-step using the information provided in the HTML table format:\n\n- The table includes columns for `place`, `rider`, `country`, `machine`, `speed`, `time`, and `points`.\n- Each row represents a different rider, with their respective details such as their position (place), name (rider), country of origin, machine used, speed achieved, time recorded, and points awarded.\n\nThe claim states: \"the rider in third position have a time of 1:19.02.8\".\n\n**Verification Process:**\n\n1. **Identify the Third Position Rider:**  \n   - Look at the `place` column for the row where `place` is equal to 3.\n   - The relevant row has the following data:\n     - Place: 3\n     - Rider: Gunter Bartusch\n     - Country: East Germany\n     - Machine: MZ\n     - Speed: 85.93 mph\n     - Time: 1:19.02.8\n     - Points: 10\n\n2. **Check the Time for the Third Position:**  \n   - From the same row, check the `time` column.\n   - The time recorded is indeed 1:19.02.8.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied as follows:\n- The rider in the third position is Gunter Bartusch.\n- This rider has a time of 1:19.02.8.\n\nSince both parts of the claim match the data from the table, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\nTo provide the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n- The `row_index` for Gunter Bartusch (third position) in the zero-indexed format is 2.\n- Relevant columns to verify this information are `place` and `time`.\n\nThus, we extract the following relevant cells:\n- From `place` column: Row index 2\n- From `time` column: Row index 2\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Fred Launchbury's performance in the race, we must examine several specific pieces of information from the provided table:\n\n1. **Rider Name**: We need to confirm whether \"Fred Launchbury\" is indeed a rider mentioned in the table.\n2. **Country**: The claim states that Fred Launchbury is from East Germany. We will verify this by checking his country entry in the table.\n3. **Speed**: Finally, we must verify if Fred Launchbury achieved a speed of 84.25 mph.\n\nNow let's analyze these elements:\n\n- By examining the table, we find Fred Launchbury listed as a rider in row 5:\n  - The `rider` column for this row contains \"fred launchbury.\"\n  - The `country` column for this row contains \"united kingdom,\" not \"east germany\" as claimed.\n  - The `speed` column confirms that his speed is indeed 84.25 mph.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude:\n- Fred Launchbury did reach a speed of 84.25 mph.\n- However, he is from the United Kingdom, not East Germany.\n\nSince one part of the claim (the country) does not match the information in the table, the entire claim must be considered false.\n\nThus, the JSON response indicating the relevant cells for verification and the final answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rider\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"speed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
