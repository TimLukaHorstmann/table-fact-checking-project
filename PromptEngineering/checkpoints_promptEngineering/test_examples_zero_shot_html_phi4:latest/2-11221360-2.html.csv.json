According to the table:\n   - The row with opponent \"takeshi inoue\" has a method listed as \"ko (punch)\" and is marked as a loss.\n\n2. **Find Draw Matches**:  \n   Identify any match that ended in a draw by checking the `res` column for entries labeled as \"draw\". According to the table:\n   - The row with opponent \"ed newalu\" is labeled as a draw.\n\n3. **Check Tournament Names**:  \n   We need to verify if these two matches (the KO loss and the draw) occurred in the same tournament. This involves comparing the `event` column for both rows.\n   - For the KO loss, the event is \"shooto\".\n   - For the draw match, the event is \"pip - east vs west\".\n\n4. **Verify Claim**:  \n   The claim states that a knockout (`ko`) loss does not occur in the same tournament as a drawn match. Based on our findings:\n   - The KO loss happened during the \"shooto\" event.\n   - The draw occurred during the \"pip - east vs west\" event.\n\nSince these two events are different, the claim holds true: there is no overlap between the tournaments for the knockout loss and the drawn match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the conditions of the claim are satisfied.

We will check the \"method\" column for these records to ascertain if the claims match.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Locate Daisuke Ishizawa's Record:**\n   - Find the row where the opponent is \"daisuke ishizawa.\"\n   - In this table, it corresponds to Row 4.\n   - Check the method of defeat in Column \"method\": \n     - The record states: \"decision (unanimous).\"\n\n2. **Locate Manabu Inoue's Record:**\n   - Find the row where the opponent is \"manabu inoue.\"\n   - This corresponds to Row 9.\n   - Check the method of victory in Column \"method\":\n     - The record states: \"decision (majority).\"\n\n### Comparison:\n- The defeat against Daisuke Ishizawa was by a \"decision (unanimous).\"\n- The outcome against Manabu Inoue was by a \"decision (majority).\" \n- These methods are different.\n\nThus, the claim that Usui defeated both opponents in the same manner is false. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells to verify this information include:\n- Row 4, Column \"method\" for Daisuke Ishizawa.\n- Row 9, Column \"method\" for Manabu Inoue.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
