    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if \"Cesare Perdisa\" has a time/retired value of \"+ 6 lap\" in the table.\n\n1. Identify the row where the driver is \"Cesare Perdisa\":\n   - According to the table, Cesare Perdisa appears in row index 6 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. Check the relevant column for this row:\n   - We are interested in the \"time / retired\" column.\n\n3. Verify the value in the identified cell:\n   - The cell at row index 6 and column \"time / retired\" contains the value \"+ 6 laps\".\n\nThe claim states \"Cesare Perdisa have a time / retire of + 6 lap\". The table entry matches this except for a minor difference: it says \"+ 6 laps\" instead of \"+ 6 lap\". However, in context, this is typically understood as equivalent.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.
