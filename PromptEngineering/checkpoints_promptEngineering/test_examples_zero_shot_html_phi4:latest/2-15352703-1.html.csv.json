    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is true or false, we need to carefully inspect the table for the specific draft pick number and its corresponding college.\n\n1. **Locate Draft Pick Number 155**: We search the 'pick' column for the value 155.\n   - The relevant row where the 'pick' is 155 is:\n     - Row index: 5\n     - Pick: 155\n\n2. **Check the College for Draft Pick Number 155**: Once we have identified the correct row, we need to verify the college associated with this draft pick.\n   - In row index 5, the 'college' column lists \"arizona\".\n\n3. **Verify Against Claim**: The claim states that draft pick number 155 comes from \"arizona university\". The table shows it as simply \"arizona\".\n   - Assuming \"arizona\" refers to Arizona State University or the University of Arizona, this could be considered consistent with the claim's intent, but it lacks explicit mention of a specific university name.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the table mentions \"arizona\" without specifying which institution (e.g., Arizona State University or University of Arizona), and considering typical naming conventions in such tables, we interpret \"arizona\" as referring to a relevant university within Arizona. Thus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Arizona be the college who have the last draft pick,\" we need to determine if the player from Arizona was selected in the final round of this table.\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant information:\n\n1. We need to find the highest round number.\n2. Determine which college has a player selected in that round.\n3. Check if any player from that college is picked last (highest pick number) within that round.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- The maximum round value in this table is 11, as seen from the row with `round` 11 and `pick` 293.\n- In round 11, the college associated with a player is \"northwestern state , la\" (Al Edwards), not Arizona.\n  \nNext, let's look at any players from Arizona:\n- Glenn Parker was picked in round 3 with pick number 70.\n- John Nies was picked in round 6 with pick number 155.\n\nNeither of these picks are in the last round (round 11).\n\nThus, no player from Arizona was drafted in the last round. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells that support this conclusion:\n\n1. The row indicating the highest round: `{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"}`\n2.
