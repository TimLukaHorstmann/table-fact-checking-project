Identify all matches involving Horia Tec\u0103u:\n   - We look for the column labeled \"partnering\" in the table, as this indicates the partner of a player. In our case, Horia Tec\u0103u is mentioned in row 4.\n\n2. Check if the opponent information aligns with the claim:\n   - The relevant columns are \"opponents in final,\" which lists the opponents faced in the final match.\n   - For row 4 (Horia Tec\u0103u), the opponents listed in the \"opponents in final\" column are \"marcelo melo andr\u00e9 s\u00e1.\"\n\nThe claim specifically states that Horia Tec\u0103u's final opponent was \"Marcelo Melo and Andr\u00e9 S\u00e1,\" which directly matches the information from the table.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of these relevant cells:\n\n- The row where Horia Tec\u0103u is mentioned as a partner (Row 4) contains the opponents listed as \"marcelo melo andr\u00e9 s\u00e1.\"\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE. \n\nHere is the JSON representation with the relevant cells for this determination:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partnering\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents in final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
