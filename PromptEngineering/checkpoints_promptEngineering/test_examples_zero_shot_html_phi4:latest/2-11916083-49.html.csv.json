The issue price for this composition in 2008 is $94.95.\n\nLet's break down the steps and identify the relevant cells from the table that contain this information:\n\n- **Year**: We need to find the entry corresponding to the year 2008.\n- **Theme (which includes 'amethyst crystal')**: Locate the row with \"amethyst crystal\" as its theme.\n- **Composition**: Check if the composition for this entry is \"99.99% silver\".\n- **Issue Price**: Verify that the issue price for this entry is $94.95.\n\nUpon examining the table, we find:\n\n1. The year 2008 corresponds to rows 2 and 3.\n2. In row 2, the theme is \"amethyst crystal\", matching our search criteria.\n3. For row 2:\n   - The composition is indeed listed as \"99.99% silver\".\n   - The issue price is given as $94.95.\n\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by this entry.\n\nNow we can specify the relevant cells for these verifications:\n\n- **Row index**: 2 (considering a 0-based index)\n- **Columns**:\n  - \"theme\" contains \"amethyst crystal\".\n  - \"composition\" is \"99.99% silver\".\n  - \"issue price\" is $94.95.\n\nWith this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"composition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
