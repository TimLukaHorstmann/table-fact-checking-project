    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"3 of their first 5 draft picks were defensemen,\" we need to analyze the table and focus on two main criteria: \n1. The position of each player in terms of the draft pick number.\n2. Whether the player is a defenseman, indicated by \"(d)\" in their name.\n\n### Steps for Evaluation:\n\n#### Relevant Data Extraction:\n- We must look at the first 5 rows since these correspond to the first 5 draft picks (round and pick numbers).\n- For each row, we check if the position of the player includes \"(d)\", which stands for defenseman.\n\n#### Analysis by Row:\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Pick number: 11\n   - Player: Brad Marsh (d)\n   - Position: Defenseman (indicated by \"(d)\")\n   \n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Pick number: 47\n   - Player: Tim Bernhardt (g)\n   - Position: Goalie (indicated by \"(g)\")\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Pick number: 64\n   - Player: Jim Macrae (f)\n   - Position: Forward (indicated by \"(f)\")\n\n4. **Row 3**: \n   - Pick number: 80\n   - Player: Gord Wappel (d)\n   - Position: Defenseman (indicated by \"(d)\")\n   \n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Pick number: 97\n   - Player: Greg Meredith (d)\n   - Position: Defenseman (indicated by \"(d)\")\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Out of the first 5 picks, players in rows 0, 3, and 4 are defensemen.\n- Therefore, 3 out of their first 5 draft picks are indeed defensemen.\n\n#### Relevant Cells for Verification:\nWe need to verify the \"pick\" numbers and the player positions (specifically checking for \"(d)\"), so we focus on these columns:\n\n1. Row 0: \"pick\" column value is 11, and \"player\" includes \"(d)\".\n2. Row 3: \"pick\" column value is 80, and \"player\" includes \"(d)\".\n3.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the table data, we need to break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. **Last Name Condition**: The claim mentions a player whose last name is 'Macrae'.\n2. **First Name Condition**: It also mentions a player whose first name is 'Macrae'.\n\nLet's analyze the table row by row for these conditions.\n\n### Table Analysis\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Player: \"brad marsh (d)\"\n  - Last Name: 'marsh' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'brad' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Player: \"tim bernhardt (g)\"\n  - Last Name: 'bernhardt' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'tim' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Player: \"jim macrae (f)\"\n  - Last Name: 'macrae' (Matches the condition)\n  - First Name: 'jim' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Player: \"gord wappel (d)\"\n  - Last Name: 'wappel' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'gord' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Player: \"greg meredith (d)\"\n  - Last Name: 'meredith' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'greg' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Player: \"dave hindmarch (c)\"\n  - Last Name: 'hindmarch' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'dave' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Player: \"dave morrison (rw)\"\n  - Last Name: 'morrison' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'dave' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Player: \"doug todd (rw)\"\n  - Last Name: 'todd' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'doug' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Player: \"mark green (c)\"\n  - Last Name: 'green' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'mark' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 9**:\n  - Player: \"bob sullivan (lw)\"\n  - Last Name: 'sullivan' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'bob' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n- **Row 10**:\n  - Player: \"bernhardt engelbrecht (g)\"\n  - Last Name: 'engelbrecht' (Does not match 'macrae')\n  - First Name: 'bernhardt' (Does not match 'macrae')\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The table contains a player, Jim Macrae, whose last name is 'Macrae', satisfying the first condition.\n- However, there is no player whose first name is 'Macrae'. Therefore, the second part of the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, since not all conditions in the claim are met, the overall claim is FALSE. The relevant cell for the last name condition is Row 2 (player column).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
