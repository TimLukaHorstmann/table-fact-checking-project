    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Gary Beach be 1 of 4 winner of a Tony Award,\" we need to examine each relevant entry in the provided table and determine if Gary Beach is listed as a winner for any Tony Award categories.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe claim involves two parts:\n1. **Identification of Gary Beach as a nominee**: We check if there is an entry where \"Gary Beach\" appears under the column labeled \"nominee.\"\n2. **Checking the result as 'won'**: For any row where \"Gary Beach\" is listed as a nominee, we must ensure that the \"result\" column indicates \"won.\"\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Locate Gary Beach in the Table**:\n   - The table lists nominees and results under Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards categories.\n   - We need to focus on rows related to the \"Tony Award\" (since the claim specifically mentions a Tony Award).\n\n2. **Check Result for Gary Beach**:\n   - Identify any row with \"tony award\" in the \"award\" column where \"gary beach\" is listed under \"nominee.\"\n   - Check if the corresponding \"result\" is \"won.\"\n\n### Relevant Rows from the Table:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Column: `award` = \"tony award\"\n  - Column: `category` = \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\"\n  - Column: `nominee` = \"gary beach\"\n  - Column: `result` = \"nominated\"\n\nUpon examining the table, we find that Gary Beach is listed as a nominee for the Tony Award under the category \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical,\" but his result was \"nominated,\" not \"won.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there is no instance where Gary Beach won a Tony Award according to the data provided, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
