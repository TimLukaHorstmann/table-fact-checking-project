    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"David Bielkheden have lose every match that end with a tko or ko across his career,\" we need to examine each row in the table and identify matches ending with either a TKO (Technical Knockout) or KO (Knockout), checking if these resulted in losses for David Bielkheden.\n\nHere are the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Ending with TKO or KO:**\n   - Look at the \"Winner\" column to check for wins and the \"Method\" column for matches ending in TKO or KO.\n   \n2. **Check if These Resulted in Losses:**\n   - A match should be considered a loss for David Bielkheden if he is not listed as the winner when the method is TKO or KO.\n\n3. **Verification Process:**\n   - For each row where the \"Method\" indicates either TKO or KO, check if David Bielkheden was not the winner (i.e., his name does not appear in the \"Winner\" column).\n\nLet's examine each relevant cell:\n\n- Row 5: The method is KO. The winner is \"fn 2 - fight night 2,\" and David Bielkheden wins this match.\n- Row 9: The method is TKO. The winner is \"shooto finland - capital punishment 2,\" indicating a win for David Bielkheden.\n- Row 11: The method is Submission (strikes), not relevant to the claim.\n\nThere are no instances where a match ended with a KO or TKO, and David Bielkheden lost. Therefore, the claim that \"David Bielkheden have lose every match that end with a tko or ko across his career\" is false because there are no matches he lost by either method in the table provided.\n\nNow let's format this conclusion into the requested JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
