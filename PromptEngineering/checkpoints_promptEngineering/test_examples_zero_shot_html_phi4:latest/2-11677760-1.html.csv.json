An entry in that row under the \"Player\" column matching \"jr reid.\"\n\nFirst, identify relevant rows by inspecting the \"Year\" column:\n- The only row with the year \"1985 - 1986\" corresponds to \"row_index\": 1.\n\nNext, check if the \"Player\" for this year matches \"jr reid\":\n- In the \"row_index\": 1, the \"Player\" is listed as \"jr reid.\"\n\nSince both conditions are met (the year and player match), the claim is supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is \"TRUE,\" with relevant cells being from row index 1 for both \"Year\" and \"Player\" columns.\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
