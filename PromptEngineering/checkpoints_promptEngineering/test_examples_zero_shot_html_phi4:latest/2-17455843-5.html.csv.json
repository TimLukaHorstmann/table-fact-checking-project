    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table data, we need to assess whether the statement \"the biggest margin of victory comes when Everton defeats Tottenham Hotspur 6 - 0\" is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Match Results:**  \n   The table contains various match results along with scores. We need to check the score column (`score`) for any match involving Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n2. **Check Matches Involving Everton:**  \n   - Look through each row to find a match where Everton is either listed as \"home team\" or \"away team\".\n   - Row 12 shows that Everton played against Crystal Palace with a score of \"6 - 0\". Thus, Everton's biggest margin in the given data is 6 goals when they defeated Crystal Palace.\n\n3. **Check Matches Involving Tottenham Hotspur:**  \n   - Look through each row to find a match where Tottenham Hotspur is either listed as \"home team\" or \"away team\".\n   - Row 7 shows that West Bromwich Albion played against Tottenham Hotspur with a score of \"1 - 0\". There is no record in the table of Everton playing against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n4. **Assess the Claimed Match:**  \n   The claim specifies an event where Everton defeats Tottenham Hotspur 6 - 0, which does not appear anywhere in the table. Hence, this specific match result is unsupported by the data provided.\n\n5. **Determine the Largest Margin of Victory:**\n   - From our checks, the largest margin recorded in the table was Everton's 6-0 victory over Crystal Palace.\n   - There is no instance of a 6-0 scoreline involving Tottenham Hotspur, let alone with them being defeated by Everton.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE** as there is no match where Everton defeats Tottenham Hotspur 6 - 0. The largest margin mentioned in the table is unrelated to the claimed teams and result.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table that help verify the solution:\n\n- Row 7: Home Team = West Bromwich Albion, Score = 1 - 0, Away Team = Tottenham Hotspur.\n- Row 12: Home Team = Crystal Palace, Score = 0 - 6, Away Team = Everton.\n\nThese are the rows where we identify the involvement of both mentioned teams and scores. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
