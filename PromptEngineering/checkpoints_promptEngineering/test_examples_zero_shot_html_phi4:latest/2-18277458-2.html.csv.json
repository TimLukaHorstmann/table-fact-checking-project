    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the lowest ticket price be 17.50\" against the provided table of data, we need to focus on identifying the column that lists the ticket prices and examine each value in this column for the minimum (lowest) price.\n\nThe relevant details from the table are as follows:\n\n1. Identify the column that contains ticket prices:\n   - The third column is titled \"Ticket Price ($)\" which indicates it contains the information needed to evaluate the claim about ticket prices.\n\n2. Extract and examine all values in this column for their minimum value:\n   - Review each row's ticket price value under this column.\n   - Collect these values: \n     - 17.50 (row index 4)\n     - 20 / 18.50 (row index 5, the lowest component here is 18.50)\n     - 22.50 / 21.00 (row index 6, the lowest component here is 21.00)\n     - 25.00 (row index 7)\n     - 27.50 (row index 8)\n     - 30.00 (row index 9)\n     - 32.50 / 31.00 (row index 10, the lowest component here is 31.00)\n     - 17.50 (row index 11)\n     - 20 / 18.50 (row index 12, the lowest component here is 18.50)\n     - 22.50 / 21.00 (row index 13, the lowest component here is 21.00)\n     - 25.00 (row index 14)\n     - 27.50 (row index 15)\n     - 30.00 (row index 16)\n     - 32.50 / 31.00 (row index 17, the lowest component here is 31.00)\n     - 18.50 (row index 18)\n     - 20 / 18.50 (row index 19, the lowest component here is 18.50)\n     - 22.50 / 21.00 (row index 20, the lowest component here is 21.00)\n     - 25.00 (row index 21)\n     - 27.50 (row index 22)\n     - 30.00 (row index 23)\n     - 32.50 / 31.00 (row index 24, the lowest component here is 31.00)\n     - 18.50 (row index 25)\n     - 20 / 17.50 (row index 26, the lowest component here is 17.50)\n     - 22.50 / 21.00 (row index 27, the lowest component here is 21.00)\n     - 25.00 (row index 28)\n     - 27.50 (row index 29)\n     - 30.00 (row index 30)\n     - 32.50 / 31.00 (row index 31, the lowest component here is 31.00)\n     - 19.25 / 17.05 (row index 32, the lowest component here is 17.05)\n     - 17.50 (multiple rows: row indices 33, 34, 35, and 36)\n\n3. Identify the minimum value:\n   - Among all ticket prices extracted, the absolute lowest value is 17.05 which occurs at row index 32.\n\n4. Compare this with the claim \"the lowest ticket price be 17.50\":\n   - The presence of a lower price (17.05) than 17.50 invalidates the claim that 17.50 is the lowest ticket price in the dataset.\n\nTherefore, based on the data:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because there is a ticket price listed as 17.05, which is lower than 17.50.\n  \nRelevant cells include all rows with the \"Ticket Price ($)\" column value and specifically the row where the minimum occurs:\n- Row indices containing 17.50: 4, 11, 26, 33, 34, 35, 36\n- Row index containing the lowest price (17.05): 32\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"Ticket Price ($)\"}  \n  ]\n}\n```",
