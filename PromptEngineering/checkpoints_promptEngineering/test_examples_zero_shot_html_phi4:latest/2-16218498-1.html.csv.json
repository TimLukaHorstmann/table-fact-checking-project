    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check the \"1st leg\" column in the table and count how many teams have the same score during the first leg of their matches.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the scores from the \"1st leg\" column:\n\n1. Botswana defence force xi vs mbabane highlanders: 1 - 1\n2. Arsenal (maseru) vs eleven arrows fc: 3 - 0\n3. CD el\u00e1 nguema vs primeiro de agosto: 2 - 3\n4. LPRC oilers vs mighty blackpool: 1 - 0\n5. ASC police vs as real bamako: 1 - 1\n6. Port autonome vs sporting clube da praia: 0 - 0\n7. Saint-george sa vs al ittihad: 2 - 1\n8. Saint-louis fc vs young africans: 1 - 3\n9. Sahel sc vs postel sport: 2 - 1\n10. Tourbillon fc vs forces arm\u00e9es ca: 0 - 0\n\nNow, let's identify the scores and count how many times each appears:\n\n- 1 - 1: Appears in rows 0 and 4\n- 3 - 0: Appears in row 1\n- 2 - 3: Appears in row 2\n- 1 - 0: Appears in row 3\n- 0 - 0: Appears in rows 5 and 9\n- 2 - 1: Appears in rows 6 and 8\n- 1 - 3: Appears in row 7\n- 0 - 3: Does not appear (error in original data for CD el\u00e1 nguema vs primeiro de agosto)\n- 2 - 1: Already counted above\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see:\n\n- The score \"1 - 1\" appears twice.\n- The score \"0 - 0\" appears twice.\n- The score \"2 - 1\" appears twice.\n\nSince there are three different scores that appear more than once, the claim that \"there be more than 2 team that have the same score during the 1st leg\" is true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"1st leg\": 1 - 1\n- Row 4, Column \"1st leg\": 1 - 1\n- Row 5, Column \"1st leg\": 0 - 0\n- Row 9, Column \"1st leg\": 0 - 0\n- Row 6, Column \"1st leg\": 2 - 1\n- Row 8, Column \"1st leg\": 2 - 1\n\nThe JSON object with the answer and relevant cells is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
