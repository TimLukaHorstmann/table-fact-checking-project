We need to find this specific record in the table.\n- Upon inspecting the table, we see:\n  - On April 6, 2008, the entry under the \"record\" column is \"23 - 54\".\n\n### Condition 2: Verifying the Game Details\n- The claim mentions that on April 6, 2008, the Rockets defeated the Clippers with a score of 105-79.\n- From the table:\n  - On April 6, 2008:\n    - The \"visitor\" column shows \"rockets\".\n    - The \"score\" column indicates \"105 - 79\", which matches the claim that the Rockets scored 105 points and the Clippers 79.\n    - The \"home\" column confirms it was the Clippers' home game.\n\nBoth conditions are met: the table confirms that on April 6, 2008, the Clippers lost to the Rockets with a score of 105-79, resulting in their record changing to \"23 - 54\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Thus, the answer is \"TRUE\". The relevant cells from the table are identified as follows:\n\n1. Row corresponding to April 6, 2008:\n   - \"record\" column: value \"23 - 54\"\n   - \"visitor\" column: value \"rockets\"\n   - \"score\" column: value \"105 - 79\"\n   - \"home\" column: value \"clippers\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The attendance must never climb above 21,000.\n\nLet's examine the \"attendance\" column for each game and check these conditions:\n\n- **April 2, 2008:** Attendance is 10,392. This satisfies both conditions (not less than 10,000 and not more than 21,000).\n- **April 3, 2008:** Attendance is 12,707. This satisfies both conditions.\n- **April 6, 2008:** Attendance is 17,932. This satisfies both conditions.\n- **April 8, 2008:** Attendance is 19,060. This satisfies both conditions.\n- **April 10, 2008:** Attendance is 20,084.

This satisfies both conditions.\n- **April 16, 2008:** Attendance is 18,386.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main points against the table data:\n\n1. On April 6, 2008, the Rockets beat the Clippers with a score of 105 - 79.\n2. After this game, the Clippers' record was 23 - 54.\n\nLet's break down these checks:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n#### Check 1: Game Details on April 6, 2008\n- **Row Index:** The third row (0-based index) corresponds to April 6, 2008.\n- **Visitor Team:** \"rockets\" \u2014 This confirms the Rockets were visiting.\n- **Score:** \"105 - 79\" \u2014 The first number is the visitor's score, and since they won, this means the Rockets beat the Clippers.\n- **Home Team:** \"clippers\" \u2014 Confirms that the Clippers were the home team.\n\n#### Check 2: Record after April 6 Game\n- **Row Index:** Again, we refer to the third row for record information.\n- **Record:** \"23 - 54\" \u2014 This indicates the Clippers' win-loss record following their loss to the Rockets on this date.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to verify these points are:\n\n1. Row Index 2, Column \"visitor\"\n2. Row Index 2, Column \"score\"\n3. Row Index 2, Column \"home\"\n4.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the table's relevant columns and rows to verify if Al Thornton indeed led the scoring on April 2 and April 15 of 2008 with scores of 26 and 21 points respectively.\n\n### Relevant Columns:\n- **date**: To identify games played on specific dates.\n- **leading scorer**: To confirm who scored the most points in each game and how many they scored.\n  \n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the rows corresponding to April 2, 2008, and April 15, 2008**:\n   - Look for these dates within the \"date\" column.\n\n2. **Check the leading scorer on those specific dates**:\n   - For each identified date, verify who was recorded as the \"leading scorer\" and their score.\n\n### Detailed Evaluation:\n\n- **April 2, 2008:**\n  - The row with `date` as \"april 2 , 2008\" (row index 0) indicates that Al Thornton is the leading scorer with 21 points.\n  \n- **April 15, 2008:**\n  - The row with `date` as \"april 15 , 2008\" (row index 6) shows that Al Thornton was again the leading scorer but with 26 points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Al Thornton led the scoring on April 2 and April 15, 2008, with scores of 21 and 26 respectively.

    "resp": "To verify the claim about the basketball game on April 16, 2008, we need to check several conditions against the table provided:\n\n1. **Date**: The claim specifies April 16, 2008.\n2. **Teams Involved**: Clippers and Rockets are said to have played each other.\n3. **Game Result**: The score mentioned is Rockets losing 75-93.\n4. **Location Context**: It states that the game was at both teams' \"own home.\"\n\nLet's examine these one by one against the relevant data:\n\n1. **Date Check**:\n   - Row index 7 corresponds to April 16, 2008.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**:\n   - The 'visitor' column for this row lists \"clippers,\" indicating that Clippers were away.\n   - The 'home' column lists \"rockets,\" confirming Rockets were the home team.\n\n3. **Game Result Check**:\n   - The score is listed as \"75 - 93\" in favor of Clippers, matching the claim of Rockets losing 75-93.\n\n4. **Location Context**:\n   - The table indicates that the game was at the Rockets' venue since they are listed as the home team.\n   - There's no indication or record that this was at both teams' \"own home,\" which is practically impossible in a standard sports league context.\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- The first three conditions (date, teams involved, and score) match perfectly with the claim.\n- However, the statement that the game took place at \"their own home\" for both teams is false. It was only the Rockets' home venue.\n\nThus, due to the incorrect assertion about the location context in the claim, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
