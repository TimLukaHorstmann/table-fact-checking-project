Specifically, \"vancouver grizzlies\" or \"memphis grizzlies.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Seasons for Vancouver Grizzlies:**\n   - Look for entries labeled as \"vancouver grizzlies.\" These are:\n     - Rows 0 to 11.\n\n2. **Identify Seasons for Memphis Grizzlies:**\n   - Look for entries labeled as \"memphis grizzlies.\" These are:\n     - Rows 12 to 18.\n\n3. **Check the Transition Year:**\n   - The transition from \"vancouver grizzlies\" to \"memphis grizzlies\" should occur between these sets of rows.\n   - From Row 11 (2006-07), it's clear that there is no data for 2001 under \"vancouver grizzlies.\"\n   - Row 12 starts with the \"2004-05\" season as \"memphis grizzlies,\" suggesting a transition before this year.\n\n4. **Determine the Transition Year:**\n   - The last entry for \"vancouver grizzlies\" is in Row 11 (\"2006-07\").\n   - The first entry for \"memphis grizzlies\" is in Row 12 (\"2004-05\").\n   - Therefore, the transition must have occurred between these seasons.\n   - Since the table does not list a season for 2001 under \"vancouver grizzlies,\" it implies that the move happened before the 2004-05 season began.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states the move was in 2001, which is consistent with the absence of a \"vancouver grizzlies\" entry for the 2001-02 season and the presence of a \"memphis grizzlies\" entry starting from the 2004-05 season.\n   - Therefore, the claim that the team moved in 2001 is supported by the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row Indexes**:\n  - Row 11: Last row for \"vancouver grizzlies\" (2006-07).\n  - Row 12: First row for \"memphis grizzlies\" (2004-05).\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two specific conditions:\n\n1. Whether the most losses in a single season by the Grizzlies occurred during the 1996-97 season.\n2. If they lost exactly 59 games that season.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant rows from the table for each year of interest:\n\n1. **For the 1995-96 season:**\n   - Losses (column \"Losses\"): 57\n   - Total Games (row indicates a typical NBA season has 82 games)\n\n2. **For the 1996-97 season:** \n   - Losses (column \"Losses\"): 59\n\n3. **For other seasons in Vancouver:**\n   - 1997-98: Losses = 60\n   - 1998-99: Losses = 50\n   - 1999-00: Losses = 51\n   - 2000-01: Losses = 51\n\n4. **For Memphis seasons (after the team moved):**\n   - 2006-07: Losses = 60\n   - 2007-08: Losses = 60\n   - 2012-13 is not relevant as it has fewer losses.\n\nBy comparing all of these, we find that the Grizzlies lost more games in the 1997-98 season (60 losses) than they did in the 1996-97 season (59 losses).\n\nThus, the claim \"the most loss the grizzly ever suffer in a season happen in the 1996 - 97 season\" is false because there was another season with more losses.\n\nWe'll mark the relevant rows and columns as follows:\n- For checking the maximum number of losses: the column \"Losses\" and all seasons.\n- Specifically for 1996-97: row index 2, column \"Losses\".\n- Also note the row where a higher loss was recorded (row index 3, column \"Losses\").\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
