The relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"Region 4\" (contains March 15, 2007)\n- Row 0, Column \"Region 2\" (contains February 19, 2007)\n- Row 0, Column \"episodes\" (contains the number of episodes)\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"region 4\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"region 2\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
