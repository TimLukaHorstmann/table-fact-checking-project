    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the episode title 'trafton' aired 3 weeks after the episode title 'waste - part 2'\", we need to extract and compare relevant information from the table provided. Specifically, we must determine the airdate for both episodes titled 'trafton' and 'waste - part 2', and then verify if 'trafton' indeed aired exactly three weeks after 'waste - part 2'.\n\n**Step-by-step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Airdate of 'Waste - Part 2':**\n   - Locate the row where the column \"title\" contains \"waste - part 2\".\n   - From the table, we find this episode in the second row.\n   - The airdate listed for 'waste - part 2' is September 15, 1971.\n\n2. **Identify the Airdate of 'Trafton':**\n   - Locate the row where the column \"title\" contains \"trafton\".\n   - From the table, we find this episode in the seventeenth row.\n   - The airdate listed for 'trafton' is January 10, 1972.\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**\n   - Compare the two dates: September 15, 1971 (for 'waste - part 2') and January 10, 1972 (for 'trafton').\n   - Calculate how many weeks are between these two dates:\n     - From September 15 to October 15 is 1 week.\n     - From October 15 to November 15 is another week (total of 2 weeks).\n     - From November 15 to December 15 is another week (total of 3 weeks).\n     - From December 15 to January 10 is less than a full week, adding more days but not completing another week.\n   - The total time difference is more than three weeks.\n\nSince the airdate of 'trafton' does not fall exactly three weeks after the airdate of 'waste - part 2', the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- Row index 1, column \"title\" and \"airdate\" (for 'waste - part 2').\n- Row index 16, column \"title\" and \"airdate\" (for 'trafton').\n\nThus, the JSON object reflecting this conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"airdate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Gunnar Hellstrom directed all of the Gunsmoke episodes of the 1972 season,\" we must analyze each episode listed for the 1972 season within the table, checking if Gunnar Hellstrom is credited as director and ensuring no other directors are mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the Episodes of the 1972 Season**: The relevant rows include seasons starting from \"17\" to \"23\", representing episodes aired in January 1972 through March 1972:\n   - Row 16: Episode title \"no tomorrow\"\n   - Row 17: Episode title \"hidalgo\"\n   - Row 18: Episode title \"tara\"\n   - Row 19: Episode title \"one for the road\"\n   - Row 20: Episode title \"the predators\"\n   - Row 21: Episode title \"yankton\"\n   - Row 22: Episode title \"blind man 's buff\"\n   - Row 23: Episode title \"alias festus haggin\"\n\n2. **Check the Director for Each Episode**:\n   - For episode \"hidalgo\" (Row 17), Gunnar Hellstrom is listed as the director.\n   - Check other episodes from Row 16 to Row 23:\n     - \"no tomorrow\" directed by Irving J Moore\n     - \"tara\" directed by Bernard Mceveety\n     - \"one for the road\" directed by Bernard Mceveety\n     - \"the predators\" directed by Bernard Mceveety\n     - \"yankton\" directed by Vincent Mceveety\n     - \"blind man 's buff\" directed by Herb Wallerstein\n     - \"alias festus haggin\" directed by Vincent Mceveety\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since Gunnar Hellstrom only directed the episode \"hidalgo,\" and all other episodes were directed by different individuals, the claim is false.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are those that contain information about directors for each of these episodes in 1972.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
