This is the first win.\n- **Row 5**: `winner` on 11 October 2010 in Tiburon, US. Second win.\n- **Row 6**: `winner` on 13 November 2011 in Loughborough, UK. Third win.\n\nThe first winning match is recorded as occurring in Granby, Canada, not Baton Rouge, LA, US. Thus, the claim that Kamke's first win was in Baton Rouge, LA, is false.\n\nNow let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The `outcome` cell for Row 4 to verify it's a win.\n- The `date` cell for Row 4 to confirm chronological order and details of the first win.\n- The `tournament` cell for Row 4 to check the location of the first win.\n\nThe JSON object summarizing this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
