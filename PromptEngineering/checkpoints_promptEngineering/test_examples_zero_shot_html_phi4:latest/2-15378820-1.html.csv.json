The relevant column here is \"result.\"\n\n- **Week 1**: \n  - Game result: W 34 - 13\n  - Margin: 34 - 13 = +21\n\n- **Week 2**:\n  - Game result: W 30 - 24\n  - Margin: 30 - 24 = +6\n\n- **Week 3**:\n  - Game result: W 30 - 13\n  - Margin: 30 - 13 = +17\n\n- **Week 4**:\n  - Game result: W 24 - 7\n  - Margin: 24 - 7 = +17\n\n- **Week 5**:\n  - Game result: L 26 - 24\n  - Margin: 24 - 26 = -2 (loss)\n\n- **Week 6**:\n  - Game result: L 38 - 24\n  - Margin: 24 - 38 = -14 (loss)\n\n- **Week 7**:\n  - Game result: W 44 - 7\n  - Margin: 44 - 7 = +37\n\n- **Week 8**:\n  - Game result: L 42 - 31\n  - Margin: 31 - 42 = -11 (loss)\n\n- **Week 9**:\n  - Game result: W 31 - 14\n  - Margin: 31 - 14 = +17\n\n- **Week 10**:\n  - Game result: L 20 - 13\n  - Margin: 13 - 20 = -7 (loss)\n\n- **Week 11**:\n  - Game result: W 20 - 7\n  - Margin: 20 - 7 = +13\n\n- **Week 12**:\n  - Game result: W 27 - 24\n  - Margin: 27 - 24 = +3\n\n- **Week 13**:\n  - Game result: W 22 - 21\n  - Margin: 22 - 21 = +1\n\n- **Week 14**:\n  - Game result: L 40 - 17\n  - Margin: 17 - 40 = -23 (loss)\n\n- **Week 15**:\n  - Game result: W 21 - 14\n  - Margin: 21 - 14 = +7\n\n- **Week 16**:\n  - Game result: W 26 - 17\n  - Margin: 26 - 17 = +9\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Maximum Victory Margin\n\nFrom the calculated margins, we find that the largest margin of victory is indeed +37 points. This occurred in Week 7.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Game with Specific Opponent and Score\n\nThe claim also specifies a game against the Giants with the score 44-7, which matches exactly the result recorded for Week 7:\n\n- **Week 7**: \n  - Date/Week: \"their greatest margin of victory\"\n  - Result: W 44 - 7\n  - Opponent: \"Giant\" (New York Giants)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are verified by the table data:\n1. The greatest margin of victory is +37.\n2. This occurred in a game against the Giants with a score of 44-7.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Additionally, the score does not match 44-7.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim about the greatest margin of victory being 37 points is correct based on the game against the New York Giants. However, the specific details about October 26, 1980, are incorrect as it was actually a loss with a different score. Therefore, the overall claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

By scanning the \"attendance\" column, we see the figures are: 62042, 51943, 74970, 45161, 51982, 44826, 50397, 60639, 46406, 51435, 50248, 63013, 51567, 48556, 49980, and 51785.\n  - The smallest attendance is indeed **44,826**.\n\n- **Game against Oakland Raiders Check**:\n  - We need to find the row where the \"opponent\" is \"Oakland Raiders\".\n  - There are two entries for games against the Oakland Raiders: Week 2 (home game) and Week 6 (road game).\n  - In Week 6, the attendance matches **44,826**, confirming it's the smallest crowd.\n\n- **Result Check**:\n  - For Week 6, where the opponent is \"Oakland Raiders\" with an attendance of 44,826, the result column shows \"l 38 - 24\".\n  - This indicates a loss (\"l\"), not a win.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The smallest crowd was indeed 44,826.\n- It occurred during a road game against the Oakland Raiders.\n- However, the Chargers lost that game, contradicting the claim of winning.\n\nThus, the claim is false. Now, let's identify the relevant cells from the table for verification:\n\n- **Row Index 6** (Week 6):\n  - \"attendance\": 44826\n  - \"opponent\": Oakland Raiders\n  - \"result\": l 38 - 24\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
