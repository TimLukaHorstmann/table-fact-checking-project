    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to examine each row in the table for the \"decision\" column and verify whether \"ellis\" appears as the decision-maker for every game listed.\n\nThe claim states: \"isaac have the decision in every game when detroit be home or nashville be home.\" However, based on the provided data, it seems there's a typo since all entries mention \"ellis\" instead of \"isaac.\" We will proceed by checking if \"ellis\" is indeed listed for each game, as that aligns with the table.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Date: April 10\n   - Visitor: Nashville\n   - Score: 1 - 3\n   - Home: Detroit\n   - Decision: ellis\n   - Attendance: 20066\n   - Series: 0 - 1\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Date: April 12\n   - Visitor: Nashville\n   - Score: 2 - 4\n   - Home: Detroit\n   - Decision: ellis\n   - Attendance: 20066\n   - Series: 0 - 2\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Date: April 14\n   - Visitor: Detroit\n   - Score: 3 - 5\n   - Home: Nashville\n   - Decision: ellis\n   - Attendance: 17113\n   - Series: 1 - 2\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Date: April 16\n   - Visitor: Detroit\n   - Score: 2 - 3\n   - Home: Nashville\n   - Decision: ellis\n   - Attendance: 17113\n   - Series: 2 - 2\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Date: April 18\n   - Visitor: Nashville\n   - Score: 2 - 1\n   - Home: Detroit\n   - Decision: ellis\n   - Attendance: 20066\n   - Series: 2 - 3\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Date: April 20\n   - Visitor: Detroit\n   - Score: 3 - 0\n   - Home: Nashville\n   - Decision: ellis\n   - Attendance: 17113\n   - Series: 2 - 4\n\nIn each row, the \"decision\" column contains \"ellis,\" confirming that \"ellis\" has the decision in every game listed.\n\nSince the claim refers to \"isaac,\" which is not mentioned in any row, and given that \"ellis\" appears consistently instead, the statement about \"isaac\" having the decision is false based on the data provided. However, if we interpret the intent of the claim as verifying whether one person (mistakenly referred to as \"isaac\") has the decision for every game, then it would be true.\n\nGiven the literal interpretation of the claim regarding \"isaac,\" the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
