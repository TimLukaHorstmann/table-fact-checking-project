From the table:\n   - Row index 2 has \"collingwood\" as the home team, \"richmond\" as the away team, with the venue listed as \"victoria park\".\n\n2. **Check Crowd Sizes**: Extract and compare all crowd sizes for that specific date (28 July 1928):\n   - Arden Street Oval: 11000\n   - Western Oval: 14000\n   - Victoria Park: 30000\n   - Princes Park: 10000\n   - MCg: 13562\n   - Lake Oval: 16000\n\n3. **Rank the Crowd Sizes**: Sort these values to determine their order:\n   - Princes Park: 10000\n   - Arden Street Oval: 11000\n   - MCg: 13562\n   - Western Oval: 14000\n   - Lake Oval: 16000\n   - Victoria Park: 30000\n\n4. **Determine the Third Smallest**: From this sorted list:\n   - The third smallest crowd size is 13562 at \"MCg\".\n\n5. **Verify Claim Against Calculation**: The claim states that \"Victoria Park\" has the third smallest crowd.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"mcg venue have a higher crowd than lake oval,\" we need to extract and compare the crowd sizes for games played at these two venues from the provided table.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - The row where `venue` is \"mcg\" corresponds to Melbourne playing against Fitzroy.\n   - The row where `venue` is \"lake oval\" corresponds to South Melbourne playing against Essendon.\n\n2. **Extract Crowd Data:**\n   - For the match at \"mcg,\" check the \"crowd\" column which shows a value of 13,562.\n   - For the match at \"lake oval,\" check the \"crowd\" column which shows a value of 16,000.\n\n3. **Compare Crowd Sizes:**\n   - The crowd size for \"mcg\" is 13,562.\n   - The crowd size for \"lake oval\" is 16,000.\n   - Since 13,562 (mcg) is less than 16,000 (lake oval), the claim that the mcg venue had a higher crowd than lake oval is false.\n\n4. **Determine Relevant Cells:**\n   - For \"mcg,\" the relevant cell is in row index 4 of the table under the column \"crowd.\"\n   - For \"lake oval,\" the relevant cell is in row index 5 of the table under the column \"crowd.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for verifying this are from row indices 4 and 5 of the \"crowd\" column.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
