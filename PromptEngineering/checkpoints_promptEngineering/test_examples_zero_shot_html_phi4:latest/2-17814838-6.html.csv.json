    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the lowest attendance in the FA Cup is true or false, let's break down the steps needed to verify it:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The claim states a specific attendance number (5406) for a match between Kettering Town and Fulham.\n\n2. **Locate the Match in the Table:** We need to find this particular match within the table:\n   - The \"home team\" column should show \"kettering town.\"\n   - The \"away team\" column should show \"fulham.\"\n   - This corresponds to row 13 based on the HTML provided.\n\n3. **Check Attendance Value:** Once we locate the correct row, we check the attendance value in that row:\n   - For row 13, the \"attendance\" is indeed listed as 5406.\n\n4. **Verify if it's the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - We must now scan through all the entries to ensure there is no other match with an attendance lower than 5406.\n   - Review each entry in the \"attendance\" column for every row, ensuring that none are less than 5406.\n\n5. **Scan All Attendance Values:**\n   - Row 1 (43524), Row 2 (37918), Row 3 (75014), Row 4 (18639), Row 5 (10112), Row 6 (15957), Row 7 (20079), Row 8 (17357), Row 9 (41137), Row 10 (13517), Row 11 (18294), Row 12 (6635), Row 14 (10006), Row 15 (32035), Row 16 (29001), and Row 17 (18013) all have attendance values greater than or equal to 5406.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The lowest recorded attendance is indeed 5406 for the match between Kettering Town and Fulham, as no other match has a lower attendance figure.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data, making it true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 13's \"attendance\" cell.\n- All attendance values from other rows must also be checked to confirm this is the lowest value, though these are not individually listed as relevant for the final determination since their values support the conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The inclusion of Row 12 is to explicitly verify the comparison with the next lowest attendance value (6635), confirming that 5406 is indeed the smallest.",
