Check the value in the \"venue\" column corresponding to this row, which is located in the fifth column of the table.\n\nLet's identify these relevant cells from the HTML table:\n\n- The row where \"home team\" is \"st kilda\" is at `row_index` 2 (since indexing starts from 0).\n- In this row, the value for the \"venue\" column is \"junction oval.\"\n\nThis confirms that the venue for St Kilda as a home side is indeed Junction Oval. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The cell in `row_index` 2 and `column_name` \"home team\"\n- The cell in `row_index` 2 and `column_name\" venue\"\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The home team's score should be 19.11 (125).\n2.
