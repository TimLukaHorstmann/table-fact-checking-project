    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rob thomas wrote the song 'credit where credit's due'\" is true or false based on the provided HTML table, we need to carefully analyze the relevant information in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - The claim involves two main components: \n     - The writer of a specific work titled \"Credit Where Credit's Due.\"\n     - Rob Thomas as the person responsible for writing it.\n   \n2. **Examine the Table for \"Credit Where Credit's Due\":**\n   - Locate the row in the table where the title is \"credit where credit 's due.\" This corresponds to row 1 (indexing starts from 0, so this is the second row).\n   - Check the column labeled \"written by\" (or similar) to determine who wrote it. \n\n3. **Verify Rob Thomas's Involvement:**\n   - Look at the \"written by\" column for the entry in row 1.\n   - The table shows that \"rob thomas\" is listed under the \"written by\" column for this episode.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Claim Accuracy:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions Rob Thomas as the writer of the song titled \"credit where credit's due.\"\n   - However, the table does not provide any information about a \"song\"; it only indicates who wrote the episode.\n   - Therefore, while Rob Thomas did write this particular work (an episode), there is no evidence in the table to suggest that he wrote a song with the same title.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The claim as stated (\"rob thomas wrote the song\") cannot be verified from the data provided since the table does not mention songs.\n   - Therefore, based on the information available and the specific wording of the claim regarding writing a \"song,\" the answer is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON response with the relevant cell:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object identifies that while Rob Thomas did write the episode titled \"credit where credit 's due,\" there is no information in the table to confirm he wrote a song with the same name.",
