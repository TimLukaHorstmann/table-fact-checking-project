    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each part of the statement against the data provided in the HTML table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"The player ranked higher than 3rd...\"**\n   - The rank \"higher than 3rd\" means ranks 1, 2.\n   \n2. **\"...with earnings of 3315502\"**\n   - We need to find a player with earnings equal to 3315502.\n\n3. **\"...have 29 win.\"**\n   - We check if the player with earnings of 3315502 has 29 wins.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Players Ranked Higher than 3rd:**\n   - Rank 1: Jack Nicklaus\n   - Rank 2: Tom Watson\n\n2. **Check Earnings for These Players:**\n   - Jack Nicklaus (Rank 1) has earnings of 4976980.\n   - Tom Watson (Rank 2) has earnings of 4701629.\n\n3. **Compare Earnings to 3315502:**\n   - Neither Jack Nicklaus nor Tom Watson have earnings of 3315502.\n\n4. **Conclusion for the Claim:**\n   - No player ranked higher than 3rd has earnings of 3315502.\n   - Thus, there is no need to check wins for such a player since none exists with those specific criteria.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Since no player matches the earnings criterion in ranks higher than 3rd, we only need to consider the cells that confirm this lack of match:\n  - Row index 0, column \"earnings\" (to verify Jack Nicklaus's earnings).\n  - Row index 1, column \"earnings\" (to verify Tom Watson's earnings).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
