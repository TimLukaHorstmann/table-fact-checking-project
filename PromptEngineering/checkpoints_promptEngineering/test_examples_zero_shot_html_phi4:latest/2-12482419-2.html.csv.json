Identify seasons where the Games Back (GB) is exactly 5.\n2. Calculate the win percentage for those identified seasons.\n3. Determine if the average win percentage equals 0.535.\n\nThe table provides the necessary data, and we can extract this information step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Seasons with GB of 5\n\nWe need to find all rows in the \"GB\" column where the value is exactly 5:\n- Row index 10 has a GB of 5.\n- Row index 21 has a GB of 5.\n\nThese are the relevant seasons based on the GB condition.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Win Percentage for Identified Seasons\n\nThe win percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Win Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Wins}}{\\text{Wins} + \\text{Losses}}\n\\]\n\nUsing this formula, we calculate for each identified row:\n- **Row index 10**: Wins = 77, Losses = 67\n  - Win Percentage = \\( \\frac{77}{77 + 67} = \\frac{77}{144} \\approx 0.5347 \\)\n  \n- **Row index 21**: Wins = 71, Losses = 73\n  - Win Percentage = \\( \\frac{71}{71 + 73} = \\frac{71}{144} \\approx 0.4931 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Average Win Percentage\n\nCalculate the average of these win percentages:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Win Percentage} = \\frac{0.5347 + 0.4931}{2} = \\frac{1.0278}{2} = 0.5139\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated average win percentage for seasons with a GB of 5 is approximately 0.514, not 0.535 as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"GB\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"GB\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Losses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
