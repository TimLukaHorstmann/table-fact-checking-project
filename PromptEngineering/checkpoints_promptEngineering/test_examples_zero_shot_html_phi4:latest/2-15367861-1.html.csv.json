    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point,\" we need to focus on two main pieces of information from the table for the team \"corinthians\":\n\n1. The number of losses recorded by \"corinthians.\"\n2. The total points scored by \"corinthians.\"\n\nThe relevant columns in the table are:\n- `team`: To identify \"corinthians.\"\n- `lost`: To determine the number of games \"corinthians\" lost.\n- `points`: Since each win gives 3 points, we can infer wins (and thus goals scored) from this column.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row for \"corinthians\":\n  - `team`: corinthians\n  - `lost`: 10 (they have 10 losses)\n  - `points`: 22\n\nNext, let's deduce if they could have scored over 25 points based on their total points. The formula for calculating points in a league is typically:\n\n\\[ \\text{Points} = (\\text{Wins} \\times 3) + (\\text{Draws} \\times 1) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Total games played: 22\n- Lost games: 10\n- Drawn games: 2\n\nThus, the number of wins is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Wins} = \\text{Played} - \\text{Lost} - \\text{Drawn} = 22 - 10 - 2 = 10 \\]\n\nNow calculate points from these statistics:\n- Points from wins: \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n- Points from draws: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n\nTotal calculated points: \\(30 + 2 = 32\\), but the table shows they have only 22 points. This discrepancy suggests that not all wins resulted in a full 3-point gain, likely due to scoring rules or errors.\n\nSince the team has lost 10 games and scored only 22 points (indicating fewer than 8 wins if each win gave exactly 3 points), it's impossible for \"corinthians\" to have scored over 25 points without having losses. Therefore, the claim is false because they indeed had losses.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- The row index for \"corinthians\": 5\n- Columns: `team`, `lost`, and `points`\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
