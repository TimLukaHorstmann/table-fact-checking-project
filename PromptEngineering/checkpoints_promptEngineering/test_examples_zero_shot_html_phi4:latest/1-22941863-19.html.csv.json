    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check two conditions in Stage 9 of the table:\n\n1. Whether there is a winner named \"fabian cancellara.\"\n2. Whether there is \"no award\" in the sprint classification.\n\nLet's analyze these specific rows and columns from the table:\n\n- **Stage 9:**\n  - Winner: fabian cancellara\n  - Sprint Classification: enrico gasparotto\n\nNow, let's check the conditions:\n1. The winner in Stage 9 is indeed \"fabian cancellara,\" which satisfies the first part of the claim.\n2. However, the sprint classification does not have \"no award\"; instead, it lists \"enrico gasparotto\" as the winner.\n\nSince both conditions must be true for the claim to hold, and the second condition (sprint classification having no award) is false, the entire claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells in Stage 9 that support this evaluation are:\n- Winner column\n- Sprint Classification column\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"sprints classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
