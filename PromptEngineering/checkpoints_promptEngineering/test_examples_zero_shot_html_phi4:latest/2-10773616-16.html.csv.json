Row 0: \n   - Home Team: Geelong\n   - Away Team: Hawthorn\n   - Away Team Score: 7.6 (48)\n   \n2. Row 1:\n   - Home Team: Collingwood\n   - Away Team: South Melbourne\n   - Away Team Score: 13.12 (90)\n\n3.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the table and verify specific conditions:\n\n1. Identify which venues are associated with home teams scoring higher than away teams.\n2. Check if \"kardinia park\" is one of these venues.\n\nLet's analyze the data row by row where we can compare scores:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Home Team: geelong, Score: 13.12 (90)\n  - Away Team: hawthorn, Score: 7.6 (48)\n  - Venue: kardinia park\n  - The home team scored higher than the away team.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team: collingwood, Score: 12.16 (88)\n  - Away Team: south melbourne, Score: 13.12 (90)\n  - Venue: victoria park\n  - The home team did not score higher than the away team.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team: carlton, Score: 10.16 (76)\n  - Away Team: essendon, Score: 11.14 (80)\n  - Venue: princes park\n  - The home team did not score higher than the away team.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team: richmond, Score: 10.18 (78)\n  - Away Team: melbourne, Score: 15.4 (94)\n  - Venue: punt road oval\n  - The home team did not score higher than the away team.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home Team: north melbourne, Score: 9.14 (68)\n  - Away Team: footscray, Score: 9.14 (68)\n  - Venue: arden street oval\n  - The scores are equal; home team did not score higher.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team: st kilda, Score: 13.14 (92)\n  - Away Team: fitzroy, Score: 9.15 (69)\n  - Venue: junction oval\n  - The home team scored higher than the away team.\n\nFrom this analysis, we identify that in rows 0 and 5, the home teams scored higher than the away teams. We have two venues with these characteristics:\n- kardinia park (row 0)\n- junction oval (row 5)\n\nSince \"kardinia park\" is one of exactly two venues where the home team scored higher than the away team, it cannot be part of a group of three or more such venues as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the statement that \"kardinia park be 1 of 3 venue where the home team score be higher than the away team score\" is false. Only two venues meet this condition.\n\nNow, let's provide the relevant cells for this verification:\n\n- Row 0, columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", and \"venue\".\n- Row 5, columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", \"away team score\", and \"venue\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
