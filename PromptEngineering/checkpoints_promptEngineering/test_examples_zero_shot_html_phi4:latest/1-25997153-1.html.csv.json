This should be the immediate next episode.\n  - **Row Index 42:** Title is \"Red All Over\".

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim that together episodes 1 and 2 in the season have more U.S. viewers than any two-episode combination, we need to carefully examine the relevant data from the table provided:\n\n### Analyzing the Table\n\nThe table shows multiple episodes with columns indicating episode number (Ep #), title, director, writers, air date, production code, and US viewers (in millions). To verify the claim, our focus is on the \"US viewers\" column.\n\n### Steps to Verify the Claim\n\n1. **Identify Episodes 1 and 2:**\n   - Episode 1 has 14.99 million U.S. viewers.\n   - Episode 2 has 13.57 million U.S. viewers.\n   - Total for episodes 1 and 2: \\(14.99 + 13.57 = 28.56\\) million.\n\n2. **Compare with All Other Two-Episode Combinations:**\n   - Calculate the total viewership for each pair of consecutive episodes.\n   - Identify any two-episode combination that exceeds 28.56 million U.S. viewers.\n\n### Relevant Calculations\n\n- Episode 1 + Episode 2 = 14.99 + 13.57 = 28.56\n- Check other combinations:\n  - Episode 3 + Episode 4 = 13.36 + 12.90 = 26.26\n  - Episode 4 + Episode 5 = 12.90 + 13.34 = 26.24\n  - Episode 5 + Episode 6 = 13.34 + 14.20 = 27.54\n  - Episode 6 + Episode 7 = 14.20 + 13.82 = 28.02\n  - Episode 7 + Episode 8 = 13.82 + 15.21 = 29.03 (exceeds 28.56)\n  - Continue this process for all combinations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUpon calculating, the combination of episodes 7 and 8 has a total of 29.03 million U.S. viewers, which is greater than the combined viewership of episodes 1 and 2 (28.56 million).\n\nThus, the claim that \"together episode 1 and 2 in the season have more US viewer than any 2 episode combine\" is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are those containing the U.S. viewers data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"US viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object provides the answer to the claim and lists the relevant cells used in the verification process.",
