    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"tie no 8 be with the away team, wrexham\" is true or false, we need to verify two key aspects of the table:\n\n1. Check whether the \"away team\" for tie number 8 is indeed Wrexham.\n2. Ensure that the match information is correctly associated with tie number 8.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown using the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- First, locate row index corresponding to \"tie no\" 8 in the table. The rows are indexed from 0 for the first entry under each column heading.\n  \n- Row index 7 corresponds to \"tie no\" 8 because:\n  - Row 0 corresponds to tie no 1,\n  - Row 1 corresponds to tie no 2,\n  - Row 2 is a replay (not part of sequential ties),\n  - Row 3 corresponds to tie no 3,\n  - Row 4 corresponds to tie no 4,\n  - Row 5 corresponds to tie no 5,\n  - Row 6 corresponds to tie no 6,\n  - Finally, row 7 corresponds to tie no 8.\n\n- Check the \"away team\" column for row index 7. The table states:\n  - Home Team: Birmingham City\n  - Score: 1 - 3\n  - Away Team: Wrexham\n\nThe claim specifically mentions that for tie number 8, the away team is indeed Wrexham. This matches exactly with the data in the \"away team\" column at row index 7.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the table data, and we can conclude it as TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": -1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}  // Replay row index is not directly numbered\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The replay row is referenced with a special marker (-1) since it does not have a numerical index.",
