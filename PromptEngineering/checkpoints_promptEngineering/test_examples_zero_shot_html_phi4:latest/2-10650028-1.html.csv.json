    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Shawn Wiggins be be the first wide receiver to get draft,\" we need to examine two key conditions from the table:\n\n1. **Position Check**: Identify if Shawn Wiggins is listed as a \"wide receiver.\"\n2. **Draft Order Check**: Determine whether Shawn Wiggins was drafted before any other player with the position of \"wide receiver.\"\n\nLet's go through these steps using the information provided in the table:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Position\n- Locate Shawn Wiggins' row and check if his \"position\" is \"wide receiver.\"\n  - **Row Index**: 7 (as tables typically start indexing from 0)\n  - **Column Name**: \"position\"\n  - **Value**: \"wide receiver\"\n\nThis confirms that Shawn Wiggins is indeed a wide receiver.\n\n### Step 2: Check Draft Order for Wide Receivers\n- Compare the \"round\" and \"overall\" values of all players with the position \"wide receiver\" to see if any player was drafted before Shawn Wiggins.\n  - **Shawn Wiggins**: Round 9, Overall 239 (Row Index: 7)\n  - Check other rows for a \"wide receiver\":\n    - **Michael Jackson**:\n      - **Position**: \"wide receiver\"\n      - **Round**: 6\n      - **Overall**: 141\n      - **Row Index**: 4\n\nFrom the table, Michael Jackson was drafted in Round 6 with an overall pick of 141. This is clearly before Shawn Wiggins, who was drafted in Round 9 with an overall pick of 239.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince Michael Jackson was a wide receiver and was drafted before Shawn Wiggins, the claim that \"Shawn Wiggins be be the first wide receiver to get draft\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- **For Position Check** (Row Index: 7, Column Name: \"position\")\n- **For Draft Order of Michael Jackson** (Row Index: 4, Column Name: \"round\")\n- **For Draft Order of Michael Jackson** (Row Index: 4, Column Name: \"overall\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
