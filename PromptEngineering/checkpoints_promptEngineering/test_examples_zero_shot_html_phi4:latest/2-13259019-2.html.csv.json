    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two main aspects from the table:\n\n1. **Identify the game played at Soldier Field after Week 10**: We need to find out which week's game was played at Soldier Field and ensure it occurs after Week 10.\n\n2. **Verify the result of that game**: Once identified, we check if the result matches \"w 31 - 29\".\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The column for the \"game site\" will help us find the location where each game was played.\n- The column for the \"result\" will provide the outcome of each game.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1. **Locate Soldier Field in the Table**:\n   - Check each row to see which game was played at \"soldier field\".\n\n2. **Check the Week Number**:\n   - Ensure that this game occurs after Week 10.\n\n3. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Confirm that the result of this game is \"w 31 - 29\".\n\n### Examination of Relevant Rows\n\n- **Row Index 9 (Week 10)**:\n  - Game Site: \"soldier field\"\n  - Result: \"w 31 - 29\"\n\nThe game at Soldier Field occurred in Week 10, not after Week 10. Therefore, the claim that a game was played at Soldier Field after Week 10 with the result \"w 31 - 29\" is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there are no games at Soldier Field after Week 10, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
