    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Fred Funk and John Adams' scores, we need to analyze their respective entries in the table.\n\n1. Identify Fred Funk's score:\n   - From the row where \"fred funk\" is listed (6th row), his total score is \"70 + 72 + 67 = 209\".\n\n2. Identify John Adams' score:\n   - From the row where \"john adams\" is listed (5th row), his total score is \"70 + 70 + 69 = 209\".\n\n3. Compare their scores to evaluate the claim:\n   - The claim states that Fred Funk's score is 6 strokes higher than John Adams' score.\n   - Both have a total score of 209, which means there is no difference in their scores; hence Fred Funk's score is not higher.\n\n4. Conclusion based on comparison:\n   - Since both players have the same total score (209), the claim that Fred Funk's score is 6 strokes higher than John Adams' score is false.\n\n5. Identify relevant cells from the table:\n   - For Fred Funk, we consider the row with his name and column \"score\": Row 6, Column \"score\".\n   - For John Adams, we consider the row with his name and column \"score\": Row 5, Column \"score\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object representing the conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
