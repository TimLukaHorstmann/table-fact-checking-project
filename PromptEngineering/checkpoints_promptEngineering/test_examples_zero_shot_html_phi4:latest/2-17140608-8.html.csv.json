    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Ray Allen (30) have the most points in a game over 59\", we need to analyze the \"high points\" column for each row corresponding to games numbered 49 through 60, as these rows are associated with the dates from February 1 to February 27. The claim specifically mentions Ray Allen scoring 30 points.\n\nHere\u2019s how to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: We need to examine the \"high points\" column because it contains information about players' scores in each game.\n\n2. **Check if Ray Allen scored 30 points**: The claim states that Ray Allen scored 30 points, which we can verify directly from the table.\n\n3. **Determine if this score is the highest for games over 59**: We need to check all rows where the \"game\" number is greater than 59 (i.e., game numbers 60) and compare their \"high points\" values to see if Ray Allen's score of 30 points is indeed the highest.\n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze each row:\n\n- **Game 49**: Paul Pierce scored 36.\n- **Game 50**: Paul Pierce scored 29.\n- **Game 51**: Ray Allen scored 22.\n- **Game 52**: Paul Pierce scored 26.\n- **Game 53**: Kevin Garnett scored 26.\n- **Game 54**: Paul Pierce scored 30.\n- **Game 55**: Paul Pierce scored 31.\n- **Game 56**: Paul Pierce scored 20.\n- **Game 57**: Rajon Rondo scored 32.\n- **Game 58**: Ray Allen scored 26.\n- **Game 59**: Paul Pierce scored 20.\n- **Game 60**: Ray Allen scored 30.\n\nFrom this analysis, we observe that:\n\n- In game 60, Ray Allen did score 30 points.\n- However, in game 55, Paul Pierce scored 31 points, which is higher than Ray Allen's 30 points.\n\nThus, the claim \"Ray Allen (30) have the most points in a game over 59\" is FALSE because there was a game (game 60) where he scored 30 points, but it wasn't the highest score for games over 59. Paul Pierce had a higher score of 31 in game 55.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n\n- Row index 54: \"Paul Pierce (30)\"\n- Row index 55: \"Paul Pierce (31)\"\n- Row index 60: \"Ray Allen (30)\"\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 54, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 55, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
