    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the starting times of the games in the given table, we need to analyze the relevant data provided within the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"the first game start at 14:00 and the second game start at 14:00.\"\n\n#### Steps for Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - The column that specifies when each game starts is labeled as \"time\".\n\n2. **Extract Row Data**:\n   - We need to review all rows in the table to identify the starting times and order of games.\n\n3. **Ordering Games by Time**:\n   - We will list out the games based on their starting time, which are recorded in the \"time\" column.\n   \n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - Determine if the first two listed games (in chronological order) start at 14:00 as claimed.\n\n#### Extracted Data from Table:\n\n- **Row 0**: Game starts at 10:00\n- **Row 1**: Game starts at 12:00\n- **Row 2**: Game starts at 15:00\n- **Row 3**: Game starts at 14:00\n- **Row 4**: Game starts at 14:00\n\n#### Ordered Games by Start Time:\n1. **First Game** (10:00): Toronto Eagles vs High Park Demons\n   - Row Index: 0, Column Name: \"time\"\n2. **Second Game** (12:00): Toronto Rebels vs Toronto Downtown Dingos\n   - Row Index: 1, Column Name: \"time\"\n3. **Third and Fourth Games** (14:00): Ottawa Swans vs Etobicoke Kangaroos and Guelph Gargoyles vs Hamilton Wildcats\n   - Row Indexes: 3, 4; Column Name: \"time\"\n4. **Fifth Game** (15:00): Broadview Hawks vs Central Blues\n   - Row Index: 2, Column Name: \"time\"\n\n#### Conclusion:\n- The first game starts at 10:00 and the second game starts at 12:00, not at 14:00.\n- Therefore, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n#### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n1. Row 0, Column \"time\" (First Game's time)\n2. Row 1, Column \"time\" (Second Game's time)\n\nHere is the JSON output representing the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
