    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each part of the statement:\n\n1. **Athlete Name**: The claim mentions \"athlete visa hongisto\". We need to find an athlete with this name in the table.\n\n2. **Nationality**: It states that the athlete is from \"finland\". We must verify if the nationality for the found athlete matches Finland.\n\n3. **Lane Number**: The claim specifies lane number 9. We need to check which lane Visa Hongisto is running in.\n\nLet's evaluate each relevant part using the table:\n\n- **Finding Athlete Name and Nationality**:\n  - In the third row, we find \"visa hongisto\" under the \"athlete\" column.\n  - The same row shows \"finland\" under the \"nationality\" column. This confirms that Visa Hongisto is indeed from Finland.\n\n- **Checking Lane Number**:\n  - The lane number for Visa Hongisto in the third row is 3, as indicated under the \"lane\" column.\n\nThe claim states that Visa Hongisto is in lane number 9. However, according to the table, he is actually in lane number 3. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Row index 2 (third row) contains:\n  - \"athlete\" column: \"visa hongisto\"\n  - \"nationality\" column: \"finland\"\n  - \"lane\" column: 3\n\nThese cells are necessary to verify both the athlete's identity and nationality, as well as his lane number.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lane\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, from the data:\n- 20.39 (Wallace Spearmon) is **not** greater than 20.63 (Rondell Sorillo).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe condition in the claim is not satisfied because 20.39 is less than 20.63.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim's truthfulness is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index for Wallace Spearmon: 1 (`time` column)\n- Row index for Rondell Sorillo: 3 (`time` column)\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
