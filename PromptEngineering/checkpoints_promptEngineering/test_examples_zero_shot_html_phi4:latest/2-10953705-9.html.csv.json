    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify each part of the statement against the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Candidate and Riding**:\n   - The claim states \"the riding for the candidate Patricia Cordner.\"\n   - We look at the rows where the candidate's name matches \"patricia cordner\" and check the corresponding \"riding\".\n   - In row 10, we find that the riding is indeed \"selkirk-interlake\".\n\n2. **Votes**:\n   - The claim mentions that Patricia Cordner gained 9506 votes.\n   - We need to verify this number against the \"votes\" column for the same row where Patricia Cordner's name appears (row 10).\n   - In row 10, the votes are listed as 9506.\n\n3. **Rank**:\n   - While the claim does not explicitly mention rank, it implies that Patricia Cordner is associated with a specific ranking by mentioning her in this context.\n   - For completeness, we can check the \"rank\" column for any discrepancies or additional validation, though it's not directly required to validate the claim as stated. In row 10, the rank is \"2nd\".\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied according to the data in the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion are:\n\n- Row index 10, column \"riding\" for verifying the riding.\n- Row index 10, column \"votes\" for verifying the number of votes.\n- Optional check: Row index 10, column \"rank\" confirms no contradictory information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"riding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"votes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
