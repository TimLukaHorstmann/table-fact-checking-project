    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no lifetime India distributor share is given earlier than 2009\" is true or false, we need to inspect the relevant data in the provided table. Specifically, we should focus on two columns: \"year\" and \"lifetime india distributor share.\"\n\nThe procedure involves checking each row of the table to see if any movie listed has a release year before 2009. If such a movie exists, the claim is false because there would be a lifetime India distributor share given for a movie released earlier than 2009.\n\nLet's evaluate the rows:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Movie \"chennai express\" - Year: 2013\n2. **Row 2**: Movie \"ek tha tiger\" - Year: 2012\n3. **Row 3**: Movie \"3 idiots\" - Year: 2009\n4. **Row 4**: Movie \"yeh jawaani hai deewani\" - Year: 2013\n5. **Row 5**: Movie \"dabangg 2\" - Year: 2012\n6. **Row 6**: Movie \"bodyguard\" - Year: 2011\n7. **Row 7**: Movie \"dabangg\" - Year: 2010\n8. **Row 8**: Movie \"rowdy rathore\" - Year: 2012\n9. **Row 9**: Movie \"agneepath\" - Year: 2012\n10. **Row 10**: Movie \"ready\" - Year: 2011\n\nUpon reviewing each row, we observe that the earliest release year listed is 2009 (for \"3 idiots\"). None of the movies were released before 2009.\n\nThus, the claim \"no lifetime India distributor share is given earlier than 2009\" holds true for this data set. Therefore, our answer to whether the claim is true or false is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table needed to verify this claim are those in the \"year\" column across all rows since we only care about ensuring no movie has a year before 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Although this is not earlier than 2009, it has a lifetime India distributor share of 99,02,00000, which is non-zero.\n  \nNo other rows have a release year less than 2009. Therefore, there are no movies listed that were released before the year 2009.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there are no movies in the table with a release year earlier than 2009, the claim that their \"lifetime India share be 0\" is vacuously true because there are no cases to contradict it.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant column for this analysis is \"year,\" as we need to check if any movie was released before 2009.\n- No specific row has a year earlier than 2009, so technically no row needs to be checked for the distributor share being zero.\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThe claim is considered true due to the absence of any movies released before 2009 in the table, making the condition vacuously satisfied.",
