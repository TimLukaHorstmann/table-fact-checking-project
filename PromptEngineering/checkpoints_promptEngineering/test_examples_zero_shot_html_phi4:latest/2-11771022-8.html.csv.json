    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Florida plays Pittsburgh in the game with the lowest attendance,\" we need to identify the games involving Florida and Pittsburgh, and then compare their attendances.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look for rows where either `visitor` or `home` is \"pittsburgh\" and also involves \"florida.\"\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Values:**\n   - For these identified games, extract the attendance numbers to determine which game had the lowest attendance.\n\n3. **Compare Attendances:**\n   - Compare the attendance values of all relevant games to confirm if the Florida vs. Pittsburgh game has the lowest attendance.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Date: March 6\n  - Visitor: Pittsburgh\n  - Home: Florida\n  - Attendance: 17012\n\nThis is the only game between Florida and Pittsburgh listed in the table.\n\n4. **Find the Game with Lowest Attendance:**\n   - Compare attendance values from all rows:\n     - March 2: 15314\n     - March 4: 16478\n     - March 6: 17012 (Florida vs. Pittsburgh)\n     - March 8: 16614\n     - March 12: 15233\n     - March 14: 19321\n     - March 16: 15704\n     - March 20: 18546\n     - March 22: 18502\n     - March 25: 16110\n     - March 27: 17301\n     - March 29: 17832\n\nThe game with the lowest attendance is on March 12, with an attendance of 15233.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the Florida vs. Pittsburgh game does not have the lowest attendance (it has 17012), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Attendance for all games to determine the lowest.\n- Specific attendance for the Florida vs. Pittsburgh game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
