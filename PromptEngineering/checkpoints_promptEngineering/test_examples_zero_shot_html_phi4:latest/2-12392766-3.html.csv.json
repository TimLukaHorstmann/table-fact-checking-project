    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Russia do not receive any bronze medal\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant information in the table provided.\n\n1. **Locate Russia's Row:**\n   - We identify the row corresponding to Russia by looking at the \"nation\" column. According to the table, Russia is listed as the second entry (rank 2).\n\n2. **Check Bronze Medals for Russia:**\n   - In the same row where Russia is listed, we look at the \"bronze\" column to see how many bronze medals were awarded to Russia.\n\n3. **Verification from Table:**\n   - The table shows that under the \"bronze\" column for Russia (rank 2), there are 9 bronze medals recorded.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim Against Data:**\n   - The claim states that Russia did not receive any bronze medals, which directly contradicts the data in the table, as Russia actually received 9 bronze medals.\n\nTherefore, based on this examination of the relevant cells:\n\n- The answer is \"FALSE\" because the claim does not match the data.\n- The relevant cell to verify this claim is the one at row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed) and column name \"bronze.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
