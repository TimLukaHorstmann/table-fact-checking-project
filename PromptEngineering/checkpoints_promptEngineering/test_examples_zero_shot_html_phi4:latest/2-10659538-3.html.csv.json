This game corresponds to Week 8 with a record of 6 - 1.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Check Attendance:** \n   - Locate the row in the table where the \"attendance\" column has the value `66189.0`.\n   - In the provided HTML, this is at row index 6 under the attendance field for Week 7 (the opponent is New Orleans Saints).\n\n2. **Verify Corresponding Details:**\n   - At row index 6, check if the \"week\" column has a value of `8` and \"record\" has a value of `6 - 1`.\n   - The details at row index 6 are:\n     - Week: 7\n     - Record: 6 - 1\n\n3. **Cross-check for Week 8:**\n   - Find the row where the \"week\" column is `8`. \n   - This corresponds to row index 7.\n   - Details at row index 7:\n     - Attendance: Not provided (marked with a blank)\n     - Record: Also not applicable since there's no data for Week 8\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The attendance of 66189 belongs to Week 7, not Week 8. \n- There is no entry for Week 8 in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"66189 crowd attend the game with a record of 6 - 1 on week 8\" is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
