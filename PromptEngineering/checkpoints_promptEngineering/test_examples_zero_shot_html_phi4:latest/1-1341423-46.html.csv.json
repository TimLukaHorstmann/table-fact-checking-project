    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Norman Sisisky be re-elected after 1982\", we need to verify if Norman Sisisky was indeed re-elected and whether this occurred after he first got elected in 1982.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row for Norman Sisisky:**\n   - The table lists district, incumbent, party, first elected year, results, and candidates.\n   - We look at each row to find where \"Norman Sisisky\" is listed as an incumbent.\n\n2. **Find the details about Norman Sisisky in the table:**\n   - In the third row:\n     - `district`: Virginia 4\n     - `incumbent`: Norman Sisisky\n     - `party`: Democratic\n     - `first elected`: 1982\n     - `results`: Re-elected\n     - `candidates`: Norman Sisisky (D) unopposed\n\n3. **Verify the claim conditions:**\n   - The claim states that he must be \"re-elected after 1982.\"\n   - He was first elected in 1982.\n   - The row indicates that he is re-elected, and since there's no specific election year provided, we assume this refers to an election cycle following his initial election. \n\n4. **Determine if the claim holds:**\n   - Norman Sisisky was indeed re-elected, as indicated by \"re-elected\" in the results.\n   - The term \"after 1982\" suggests that it should occur after his first election year (1982). Since he is noted as re-elected without specifying the exact year beyond indicating a cycle following 1982, and given there are no other years specified for this election cycle, we can infer he was re-elected in an election cycle post-1982.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim \"Norman Sisisky be re-elected after 1982\" is supported by the information provided.\n   - Therefore, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells for verification:**\n   - Row index 3 (0-based indexing) contains all relevant information.\n     - `row_index`: 3\n     - Relevant column names are:\n       - `incumbent`: Norman Sisisky\n       - `first elected`: 1982\n       - `results`: Re-elected\n\nBased on the analysis, here is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
