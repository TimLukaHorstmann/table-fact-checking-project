The most likely candidate is the first numerical column following any header row, which typically represents scores or points in such tables.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The column headers are not explicitly provided, but based on common tabular structures for sports leagues or similar competitions, it's reasonable to assume that the first numerical column after any potential header is related to points.\n- The first number in this column is 71 (row index 0), which corresponds to the team \"Morecambe.\"\n- Subsequent numbers are: 54, 50, 46, 42, 41, 39, 38, 37, 35, 34, 33, 33, 32, and 25.\n\nNow, let's verify if all these values fall within the specified range of 25 to 71:\n\n- The number 71 is included in the range (as it is the upper bound).\n- All other numbers are less than or equal to 71.\n- The smallest number is 25, which is also included in the range.\n\nSince every number in this column falls within the specified range of 25 to 71, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
