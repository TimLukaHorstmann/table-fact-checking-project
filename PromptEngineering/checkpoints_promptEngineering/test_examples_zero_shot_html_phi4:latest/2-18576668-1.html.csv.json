This involves checking both dates within each row against the specified claim.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: We will check the \"date\" column for any events that occur in 2003.\n2. **Analyze each entry**:\n   - Check if the event's date falls entirely within the year 2003, i.e., no part of the date range should extend into another year.\n\nThe table entries to consider for analysis:\n\n- Row with \"season\" as \"2002 - 03\":\n  - Date: \"25 - 26 January 2003\"\n  - This event is entirely within 2003.\n  \n- Row with \"season\" as \"2002 - 03\":\n  - Date: \"12 - 13 July 2003\"\n  - This event is entirely within 2003.\n\nWe now need to check the rest of the table for any other events in 2003:\n\n- No further rows have dates that fall within the year 2003. Events from subsequent years (like \"11 - 13 June 2004\") do not fit within this period.\n\nGiven these observations, there are no additional gameplay events listed in 2003 apart from the two specified dates (\"25 - 26 January 2003\" and \"12 - 13 July 2003\").\n\nThe claim is thus fully supported by the data in the table.

The event type should be \"invitational.\"\n2. It should occur in the year \"2005\" (which corresponds to both seasons 2004-05 and 2005).\n3. The location should be \"Los Angeles.\"\n4. There should not be any other invitational events outside of this specific occurrence.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n1. **Identify all rows with the event type as \"invitational\":**\n   - We need to scan through the table and find rows where the \"event type\" column is labeled \"invitational.\"\n\n2. **Verify the conditions for each invitational event found:**\n   - Check if any of these events occur in 2005.\n   - Check the location of these events.\n\n3. **Confirm that it matches the claim's specific details:**\n   - The only match should be in Los Angeles during 2005.\n\n**Verification using the table data:**\n\n- From the provided HTML, we identify one row where the \"event type\" is \"invitational\":\n  - Row Index 15 has:\n    - Event Type: \"invitational\"\n    - Season: \"2005\"\n    - Location: \"Los Angeles\"\n\nThis matches perfectly with the conditions stated in the claim. There are no other rows labeled as \"invitational,\" which means that there is indeed only one invitational event, and it occurs in Los Angeles during 2005.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data.

We need to assume that \"season 5\" refers to the events from the year \"2004 - 05.\"\n\n2. **Identify Last Four Events in Season 5**: Look for events listed under the years \"2004\" and \"2005,\" as they would logically encompass the season from \"2004 - 05.\" We will focus on the last four entries within these years.\n\n3. **Check Locations of These Events**: Verify if all four of these events were held in Los Angeles or London.\n\n### Steps:\n\n- **Identify Relevant Entries**:\n  - The relevant years for \"season 5\" are \"2004\" and \"2005.\"\n  - From the table, the entries under these years are:\n    - 2003 - 04: Nationals (Osaka)\n    - 2003 - 04: Grand Prix (Kuala Lumpur)\n    - 2005: Grand Prix (Seattle)\n    - 2005: Invitational (Los Angeles)\n    - 2005: Pro Tour (London)\n    - 2005: Pro Tour (Los Angeles)\n\n- **Last Four Events**:\n  - The last four events under the years \"2004\" and \"2005\" are:\n    1. 2005: Invitational in Los Angeles\n    2. 2005: Pro Tour in London\n    3. 2005: Pro Tour in Los Angeles\n\n- **Check Locations**:\n  - The locations for these events are:\n    1. Los Angeles\n    2. London\n    3. Los Angeles\n\nThe third event is missing, so we include the next one from \"2003 - 04\":\n4. 2003 - 04: Grand Prix in Kuala Lumpur\n\nSince not all four of these events were held in Los Angeles or London (one was in Kuala Lumpur), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row indices and column names for the last four events:\n  - Row index 14, Column \"Grand Prix\": Kuala Lumpur\n  - Row index 15, Column \"Invitational\": Los Angeles\n  - Row index 16, Column \"Pro Tour\": London\n  - Row index 17, Column \"Pro Tour\": Los Angeles\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Grand Prix\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Invitational\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Pro Tour\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Pro Tour\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
