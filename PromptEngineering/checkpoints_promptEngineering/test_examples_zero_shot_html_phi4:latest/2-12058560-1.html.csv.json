We then calculate the point difference for these wins, as this will reveal the largest margin of victory.\n\nThe relevant columns from the table are:\n- \"date\": To understand when each game occurred.\n- \"opponent\": Provides context but not necessary for determining margins.\n- \"home / away\": Indicates if the team played at home or away.\n- \"field\": The venue of the match.\n- **\"result\"**: Crucial to identifying wins and calculating point differences.\n\nLet's calculate the margin of victory for each win:\n\n1. May 20 vs. Rattlers: Result is 'w 12 - 11'. Margin = 12 - 11 = 1\n2. May 27 vs. Riptide: Result is 'w 18 - 6'. Margin = 18 - 6 = 12\n3. June 3 vs. Pride: Result is 'w 16 - 15'. Margin = 16 - 15 = 1\n4. June 10 vs. Machine: Result is 'w 13 - 12 ot'. Margin = 13 - 12 = 1\n5. June 17 vs. Lizards: Result is 'w 13 - 12'. Margin = 13 - 12 = 1\n6. July 8 vs. Pride (away): Result is 'w 17 - 7'. Margin = 17 - 7 = 10\n7. July 20 vs. Lizards: Result is 'w 10 - 8'. Margin = 10 - 8 = 2\n8. July 27 vs. Bayhawks: Result is 'w 22 - 11'. Margin = 22 - 11 = 11\n9. August 5 vs. Rattlers (away): Result is 'w 18 - 13'. Margin = 18 - 13 = 5\n10. August 12 vs. Bayhawks (away): Result is 'w 20 - 12'.
