Whether Cape Town is listed as the location in any year prior to or including 1996.\n     b. Confirm that Cape Town is indeed listed as the location for the year 1996.\n\n2. **Relevant Columns**:\n   - The \"year\" column will help us identify the specific row(s) corresponding to each year.\n   - The \"location\" column will provide information about where the tournament was held in those years.\n\n3. **Verification Process**:\n   - We need to inspect all rows of the table up to and including the year 1996 to check if Cape Town appears as a location before or during that year.\n   - Specifically, we examine each row for the \"location\" value to see if it matches \"Cape Town, South Africa.\"\n\n4. **Table Inspection**:\n   - For years prior to 1996 (i.e., 1993, 1994, and 1995), check the \"location\":\n     - 1993: Orlando, Florida, USA\n     - 1994: Dorado, Puerto Rico\n     - 1995: Shenzhen, China\n   - For the year 1996:\n     - The location is listed as Cape Town, South Africa.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Cape Town does not appear in any row prior to 1996 and appears first in 1996, the claim that \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1996\" is TRUE.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - For year 1996: \n     - Row index: 3\n     - Column name: \"location\"\n   - To ensure Cape Town has not appeared earlier, we also check the locations for previous years:\n     - Row indices: 0, 1, 2 (for years 1993, 1994, and 1995)\n     - Column name: \"location\"\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
