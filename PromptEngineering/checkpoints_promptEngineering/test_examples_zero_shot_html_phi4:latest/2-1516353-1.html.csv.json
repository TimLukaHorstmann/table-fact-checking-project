The event was \"The Open Championship.\"\n2. In the year 1901, there was indeed a \"5 shot lead\" after 54 holes.\n\nLet's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Row Identification:** \n  - For the year 1901, we look at row index 0 (as indexing starts from 0).\n\n- **Column Verification:**\n  - **Year Column:** To confirm it is indeed the year 1901. This corresponds to `row_index` 0 and `column_name` \"year\".\n  - **Championship Column:** To ensure it matches \"The Open Championship\". This also corresponds to `row_index` 0 and `column_name` \"championship\".\n  - **54 holes Column:** We need to check the lead, which should be a \"5 shot lead\". This corresponds to `row_index` 0 and `column_name` \"54 holes\".\n\nNow let's verify these details in the table:\n- For row index 0 (year 1901):\n  - The year is indeed 1901.\n  - The championship mentioned is \"the open championship\".\n  - The 54 holes column shows a \"5 shot lead\".\n\nSince all parts of the claim are confirmed by the data in the specified cells, we conclude that the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row index 0, Column name \"year\"\n- Row index 0, Column name \"championship\"\n- Row index 0, Column name \"54 holes\"\n\nThus, the JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"54 holes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the open championship in 1908 have a 6 shot lead for 54 hole.\"\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points**:\n   - We need data from the row corresponding to the year 1908.\n   - Specifically, we should check two columns:\n     - `year`: To confirm it is indeed 1908.\n     - `54 holes`: To see if it mentions a \"6 shot lead.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row**:\n   - From the table structure in the HTML provided, the rows are indexed starting from 0.\n\n3. **Examine the Year Column**:\n   - We check the row where the `year` is \"1908\".\n\n4. **Verify the 54 Holes Lead**:\n   - In this row for the year 1908, confirm if the value in the `54 holes` column matches \"6 shot lead.\"\n\n### Verification:\n\n- The table structure indicates that the rows are indexed from 0 to 4 corresponding to the years 1901, 1905, 1906, 1908, and 1910.\n  \n- **Row with Year 1908**:\n  - `row_index` is 3 (since it's the fourth row).\n  - Check the `year` column: It states \"1908\".\n  - Check the `54 holes` column: It shows \"6 shot lead.\"\n\nBoth conditions are met, confirming that in 1908, there was indeed a \"6 shot lead\" for the 54 holes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is true based on the provided table data.
