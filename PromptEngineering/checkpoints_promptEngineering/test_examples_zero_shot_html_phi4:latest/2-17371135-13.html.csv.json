    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the game on May 24, we need to verify several details from the table:\n\n1. **Date Check**: The date for this row is indeed \"may 24\", which matches the claim.\n\n2. **Home Team Check**: According to the table, the home team listed in this row (\"home\" column) is \"chicago\". This supports part of the claim that Chicago played as the home team.\n\n3. **Visitor Team Check**: The visitor team listed in this row (\"visitor\" column) is \"detroit\", which means Detroit was the away team.\n\n4. **Decision (Decider)**: In the \"decision\" column, it lists \"conklin\". This matches the claim that Conklin was the decider for this game.\n\nAll parts of the claim have been verified using relevant cells in the table. Therefore, the entire statement is supported by the data provided.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are as follows:\n- For the date: Row index 3, column \"date\"\n- For identifying the home team: Row index 3, column \"home\"\n- For identifying the visitor team (to ensure it matches the opponent): Row index 3, column \"visitor\"\n- For verifying the decision/decider: Row index 3, column \"decision\"\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Conklin won the decision when Chicago hosted Detroit\" is true based on the table provided, we need to examine specific conditions:\n\n1. Identify instances where Chicago is listed as the host (i.e., under the \"home\" column).\n2. Check if in those instances, Conklin is named as the decision-maker (i.e., under the \"decision\" column).\n\nLet's break down the table row by row and look for these conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Visitor: Chicago\n  - Home: Detroit\n  - Decision: Osgood\n  - Since Detroit is home, this does not satisfy our condition of Chicago hosting.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Visitor: Chicago\n  - Home: Detroit\n  - Decision: Osgood\n  - Again, Detroit is home, so this doesn't meet the condition either.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Visitor: Detroit\n  - Home: Chicago\n  - Decision: Osgood\n  - This row satisfies the first part of our condition (Chicago is hosting), but Conklin did not make the decision; instead, it was Osgood.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Visitor: Detroit\n  - Home: Chicago\n  - Decision: Conklin\n  - Here, Chicago is hosting, and Conklin made the decision. This satisfies both parts of our condition.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Visitor: Chicago\n  - Home: Detroit\n  - Decision: Osgood\n  - Detroit is home in this instance, so it doesn't meet our criteria.\n\nBased on these observations, there is indeed one instance (Row 4) where Conklin made the decision when Chicago was hosting Detroit. Thus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row 4, Column \"home\" (to confirm Chicago as home)\n- Row 4, Column \"decision\" (to confirm Conklin)\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Chicago is listed as the home team in this row, making them the away team on the next occasion when they play against Detroit.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - `Visitor`: Chicago\n  - `Decision`: Osgood\n  - Conclusion: This row meets the first condition but not the second one.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we see that there is no single instance where both conditions are met simultaneously\u2014specifically, there is no game listed where Chicago is the away team and Conklin is the decider. \n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 3 (for checking if Conklin was a decider):\n  - `row_index`: 3\n  - `column_name`: \"decision\"\n\nHence, we conclude that the claim is not supported by any row in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
