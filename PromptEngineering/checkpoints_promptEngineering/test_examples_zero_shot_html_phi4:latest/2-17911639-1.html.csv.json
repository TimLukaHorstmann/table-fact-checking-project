    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"euro 2000 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 0,\" we need to inspect each row in the provided table and check two conditions:\n\n1. The `competition` column should have the value \"euro 2000 qualifying.\"\n2. The `score` column should contain the exact string \"3 - 0.\"\n\nLet's go through each relevant row of the table step-by-step:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - `date`: \"5 june 1999\"\n  - `venue`: \"tofiq bahramov stadium , baku\"\n  - `score`: \"3 - 0\" \n  - `result`: \"4 - 0\"\n  - `competition`: \"euro 2000 qualifying\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied for row 0. The `competition` is indeed \"euro 2000 qualifying,\" and the `score` is \"3 - 0.\"\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - `date`: \"18 august 1999\"\n  - `venue`: \"dynamo samarkand stadium , samarkand\"\n  - `score`: \"3 - 1\" \n  - `result`: \"5 - 1\"\n  - `competition`: \"friendly\"\n\nThe first condition is not met here because the `competition` is \"friendly,\" and the second condition fails as well since the `score` is \"3 - 1.\"\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - `date`: \"4 september 1999\"\n  - `venue`: \"tofiq bahramov stadium , baku\"\n  - `score`: \"1 - 0\" \n  - `result`: \"1 - 1\"\n  - `competition`: \"euro 2000 qualifying\"\n\nAlthough the `competition` is \"euro 2000 qualifying,\" the `score` does not match \"3 - 0.\"\n\n- **Row 3** to **Row 5**:\n  - These rows either have different competitions or scores that do not satisfy both conditions.\n\nGiven our analysis, only row 0 satisfies both conditions required by the claim. Therefore, we conclude that the claim is true based on this evidence.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table for this evaluation are:\n\n- Row index 0, `competition` column\n- Row index 0, `score` column\n\nNow, let's format this in JSON as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Euro 2001 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 1,\" we need to examine the relevant data from the provided table.\n\nThe claim consists of two main conditions:\n1. The competition should be \"Euro 2001 qualifying.\"\n2. The score should be \"3 - 1.\"\n\nWe will verify these conditions against each row in the table:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Competition: \"euro 2000 qualifying\"\n  - Score: \"3 - 0\"\n  This does not match either condition.\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Score: \"3 - 1\"\n  The score matches, but the competition does not. \n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Competition: \"euro 2000 qualifying\"\n  - Score: \"1 - 0\"\n  Neither condition is met.\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Score: \"1 - 0\"\n  Neither condition is met.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Competition: \"2002 world cup qualification\"\n  - Score: \"2 - 0\"\n  Neither condition is met.\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Competition: \"friendly\"\n  - Score: \"0 - 1\"\n  Neither condition is met.\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, we find that no row meets both conditions simultaneously. Specifically:\n- There is no entry with \"Euro 2001 qualifying\" as a competition.\n- Although there is an entry with a score of \"3 - 1,\" it corresponds to a friendly match and not \"Euro 2001 qualifying.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying this include those from Row 1:\n- The cell at row index 1, column \"score\" (for checking if the score was \"3 - 1\").\n- The cell at row index 1, column \"competition\" (to verify that it's not \"Euro 2001 qualifying\").\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
