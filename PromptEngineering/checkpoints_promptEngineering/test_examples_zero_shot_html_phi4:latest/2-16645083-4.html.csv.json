However, its basketball score is 0, which does not satisfy the condition of having a non-zero basketball score.\n\nSince no school fulfills all three conditions simultaneously (bask > 0, indoor track = 0, swim = 5), the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells for \"Wright State\" as it has two out of the three criteria:\n\n- Basketball (row index 6, column name 'bask')\n- Indoor Track (row index 6, column name 'indoor track')\n- Swimming (row index 6, column name 'swimming')\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bask\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"indoor track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"swimming\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This is done by finding the school name \"green bay.\"\n   - Green Bay is located in the third row of the table (index 2).\n\n2. **Identify Volleyball Column**:\n   - Identify which column represents volleyball.\n   - In the header row, the \"volleyball\" column is in the ninth position.\n\n3. **Check the Value for Volleyball at Green Bay**:\n   - Look at the cell where the third row (Green Bay) intersects with the ninth column (\"volleyball\").\n   - The value in this cell is 1.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"they do not play volleyball in green bay.\"\n   - Since Green Bay has a recorded number of 1 for volleyball, it implies they do participate in volleyball to some extent.\n   - Therefore, the claim that they do not play volleyball is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object indicating the answer and the relevant cell is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"volleyball\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
