We must find who actually holds the European record from the table.\n   - In the row labeled as \"european record\", it shows Tatyana Kazankina (Urs) as the holder, not Hassiba Boulmerka (Alg).\n\n2. **Time**:\n   - The claim states a time of \"4:05:67\" for this record. \n   - From the table, we see that the European record's time is 3:52.47.\n\n3. **Location**:\n   - The claim mentions \"the location be Rome, Italy\".\n   - According to the table, the location for the European record is Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.\n\nNow, let\u2019s identify which cells in the table are relevant to these conditions:\n\n- Row labeled as \"european record\":\n  - Column with Tatyana Kazankina (Urs): This indicates who actually holds the European record.\n  - Column with time 3:52.47: This shows the actual time for the European record.\n  - Column with location Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland: This states where the European record was set.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The conditions of the claim are not supported by the table data; hence, the answer is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells in the table for verifying the claim:\n\n- Row index for \"european record\": 6\n  - Column name for athlete: \"tatyana kazankina ( urs )\"\n  - Column name for time: \"3:52.47\"\n  - Column name for location: \"z\u00e3\u00bcrich , switzerland\"\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tatyana kazankina ( urs )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"3:52.47\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"z\u00e3\u00bcrich , switzerland\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
