    "resp": "To verify the claim that in 2008 Polona was ranked 12 spots higher than in 2011 based on the year-end rankings provided in the table, we need to identify the relevant data points from the table.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need the \"year end ranking\" for both 2008 and 2011.\n   - From the table:\n     - The year 2008 corresponds to the row with \"overall win %: 70%\". Here, the \"year end ranking\" is given as 243.\n     - The year 2011 corresponds to the row with \"overall win %: 54%\". Here, the \"year end ranking\" is given as 36.\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Calculate the difference between the rankings for 2008 and 2011.\n   - Difference = Ranking in 2008 - Ranking in 2011 = 243 - 36 = 207\n\n3. **Check Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Polona was ranked \"12 spots higher\" in 2008 than in 2011.\n   - However, we calculated a difference of 207 spots.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the actual difference between the rankings for 2008 and 2011 is not 12 but 207. Thus, the answer to the claim is \"FALSE\".\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells are those containing the year-end ranking for both years.\n  - For 2008: Row with \"overall win %: 70%\" has a \"year end ranking\" of 243.\n  - For 2011: Row with \"overall win %: 54%\" has a \"year end ranking\" of 36.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"year end ranking\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year end ranking\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"2011 and 2008 be the year that Polona have the most grand slam match win,\" we need to focus on the data related specifically to Grand Slam matches for each year provided in the table.\n\nThe relevant section of the table under \"Grand Slam\" shows the number of wins and losses for each year:\n\n- **2011**: 6 - 8\n- **2008**: 2 - 7\n\nFrom this information, we can see that Polona had more Grand Slam match wins in 2011 (6 wins) compared to 2008 (2 wins). Therefore, the claim is false because only one of these years, 2011, has the most grand slam matches won when compared between the two specified years. \n\nThus, the JSON response will reflect this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2011\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- The relevant cells are the ones under the year columns for 2008 and 2011 in the Grand Slam section, which provide the win-loss records needed to compare these two specific years.",
