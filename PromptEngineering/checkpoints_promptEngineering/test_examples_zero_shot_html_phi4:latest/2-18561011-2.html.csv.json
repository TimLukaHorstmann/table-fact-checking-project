We will assume a stadium is large if it has a capacity of more than 10,000.\n- Check capacities for Edgeley Park and Firhill:\n  - **Edgeley Park**:\n    - Row 11, Column \"capacity (at time of closure)\": 10900\n  - **Firhill**:\n    - Row 12, Column \"capacity (at time of closure)\": 10887\n\nBoth stadiums have capacities greater than 10,000.\n\n### Step 3: Confirm They Are the Most Recent to Close\n- Verify if any other stadium closed in a year after 2012.\n- Reviewing all rows:\n  - Edgeley Park and Firhill are both on row indices 11 and 12 with closure years of 2012. \n  - All other stadiums have closure years before 2012.\n\nSince no stadium is listed as closing after 2012, these two stadiums indeed represent the most recent closures.\n\nGiven all conditions are met, the claim \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close , in 2012\" is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells for this verification include:\n- Closure year of Edgeley Park and Firhill.\n- Capacity at closure for both stadiums.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
