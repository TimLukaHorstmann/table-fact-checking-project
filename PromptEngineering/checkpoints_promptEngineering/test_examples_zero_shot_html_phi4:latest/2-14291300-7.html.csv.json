    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"during March 13, the Toronto Maple Leafs were the opponent with 63 points,\" we need to verify two main conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify the game that occurred on March 13 and check if the opponent was indeed the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n2. Confirm that the team had 63 points at that time.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- The \"game\" column indicates the sequence number, not a specific date like March 13.\n- The \"march\" column shows which game took place in March; it does not specify the exact day. For this claim, we're looking for the row where \"march\" is 13 to correspond with March 13.\n- The \"opponent\" column provides details about who they played against on that specific game during March.\n- The \"points\" column indicates the team's total points after each game.\n\nNow let's locate and verify these conditions:\n\n1. **Identify the Game on March 13:**\n   - Look for a row where the \"march\" value is 13. This corresponds to Row Index 6 in the table (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Verify Opponent and Points:**\n   - In this row, check that the \"opponent\" is \"toronto maple leafs.\"\n   - Check that the \"points\" are indeed 63 after this game.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n- Row Index 6:\n  - \"march\": 13\n  - \"opponent\": \"toronto maple leafs\"\n  - \"points\": 63\n\nAll conditions from the claim are satisfied by this row.
