Identify the last two games of the season.\n2. Check whether these games resulted in losses ('L').\n3. Ensure that these games occurred at a home venue.\n\n### Step-by-step Evaluation:\n\n#### 1. Last Two Games:\n- The table shows data for 16 weeks, indicating 16 games.\n- Therefore, the last two games are week 15 and week 16.\n\n#### 2. Check Results for Losses:\n- **Week 15**: Result is \"l 31 - 19\" (loss).\n- **Week 16**: Result is \"l 16 - 10\" (loss).\n\nBoth weeks indicate losses, satisfying the loss condition of the claim.\n\n#### 3. Determine if Games Were Home Games:\nThe table does not explicitly state which games were home or away. However, in the context of NFL teams, it's common for a team to play roughly half their games at home and half away. Without explicit information about home/away status, we cannot assume these losses automatically happened at home.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there is no direct indication in the table that specifies whether games were played at home or away, we lack sufficient data to conclusively determine if the last two games (losses) occurred at a home venue. Therefore, based on the information available within the table, the claim cannot be verified as true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nFor evaluating this claim:\n- **Week 15 and Week 16** rows are relevant.\n- We need both \"result\" to confirm losses and ideally would need another column (like \"location\") indicating home or away status which isn't provided.\n\nThus, we conclude the answer based on available data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe conclusion is \"FALSE\" because we cannot confirm the home game condition with the given data.",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the last 2 games of the season were won by the opponent in a home game,\" we need to analyze the final two entries in the table and assess their results:\n\n1. **Identify the Last Two Games:**\n   - The last two games are listed in rows 15 and 16.\n\n2. **Check the Results of These Games:**\n   - For row 15 (December 15, 1985): \n     - Opponent: San Francisco 49ers\n     - Result: L 31 - 19\n     - The team lost this game.\n   \n   - For row 16 (December 22, 1985):\n     - Opponent: Atlanta Falcons\n     - Result: L 16 - 10\n     - The team also lost this game.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim's Conditions:**\n   - According to the claim, both of these games should have been won by the opponents in a home game.\n   - While it is confirmed that the team lost both games (opponents won), the information provided does not include details about which teams were hosting the games.\n\n4. **Determine Relevant Information:**\n   - The relevant data for this claim includes:\n     - Rows 15 and 16\n     - Columns \"result\" to determine if the opponent won\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Although we know the team lost both games, without specific information about home or away status, we cannot fully confirm that these were indeed home games for the opponents.\n   - Therefore, based on the given data alone, we cannot conclusively say the claim is true.\n\nThe answer is \"FALSE\" because while it's established that the opponent won in each case, there isn't enough information to verify if they were home games for the opponents:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding the New Orleans Saints' performance in the 1985 season, we need to analyze each game's result listed in the provided table. The claim states there were only five weeks where they lost.\n\nThe relevant column for this analysis is \"result\", as it indicates whether the team won (denoted by 'w') or lost (denoted by 'l') a game. We will review all rows to identify losses and count them.\n\nHere's how we evaluate each row:\n\n1. Week 1: Result = \"l 47 - 27\" (Loss)\n2. Week 2: Result = \"l 34 - 23\" (Loss)\n3. Week 3: Result = \"w 20 - 13\" (Win)\n4. Week 4: Result = \"w 20 - 17\" (Win)\n5. Week 5: Result = \"w 23 - 21\" (Win)\n6. Week 6: Result = \"l 23 - 13\" (Loss)\n7. Week 7: Result = \"l 31 - 24\" (Loss)\n8. Week 8: Result = \"l 21 - 13\" (Loss)\n9. Week 9: Result = \"l 28 - 10\" (Loss)\n10. Week 10: Result = \"l 27 - 3\" (Loss)\n11. Week 11: Result = \"l 38 - 14\" (Loss)\n12. Week 12: Result = \"w 30 - 23\" (Win)\n13. Week 13: Result = \"w 29 - 3\" (Win)\n14. Week 14: Result = \"l 28 - 16\" (Loss)\n15. Week 15: Result = \"l 31 - 19\" (Loss)\n16. Week 16: Result = \"l 16 - 10\" (Loss)\n\nCounting the losses, we find there are a total of 11 weeks where the New Orleans Saints lost games.\n\nThe claim asserts that there were only five losing weeks in the season. Our analysis shows otherwise, indicating that the number is actually 11. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nBelow is the JSON object identifying the relevant cells (weeks with losses) used to determine this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identifying the game with the lowest total score.\n     2. Checking if this game occurred in week 1 and involved Kansas City.\n\n2. **Total Scores Calculation**:\n   - We calculate the total scores for each game using the `result` column, which provides the format \"Team A Score - Team B Score\".\n   - Compute the sum of both team's scores for each row to determine the total score of the game.\n   - Let's calculate these totals:\n\n     | Week | Opponent            | Result    | Total Score |\n     |------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|\n     | 1    | Kansas City Chiefs  | L 47 - 27 | 74          |\n     | 2    | Denver Broncos      | L 34 - 23 | 57          |\n     | 3    | Tampa Bay Buccaneers| W 20 - 13 | 33          |\n     | 4    | San Francisco 49ers | W 20 - 17 | 37          |\n     | 5    | Philadelphia Eagles | W 23 - 21 | 44          |\n     | 6    | Los Angeles Raiders | L 23 - 13 | 36          |\n     | 7    | Atlanta Falcons     | L 31 - 24 | 55          |\n     | 8    | New York Giants     | L 21 - 13 | 34          |\n     | 9    | Los Angeles Rams    | L 28 - 10 | 38          |\n     | 10   | Seattle Seahawks    | L 27 - 3  | 30          |\n     | 11   | Green Bay Packers   | L 38 - 14 | 52          |\n     | 12   | Minnesota Vikings   | W 30 - 23 | 53          |\n     | 13   | Los Angeles Rams    | W 29 - 3  | 32          |\n     | 14   | St Louis Cardinals  | L 28 - 16 | 44          |\n     | 15   | San Francisco 49ers | L 31 - 19 | 50          |\n     | 16   | Atlanta Falcons     | L 16 - 10 | 26          |\n\n3. **Identifying the Lowest Score**:\n   - The game with the lowest total score is in week 16 against the Atlanta Falcons, with a score of 26.\n\n4. **Verification Against Claim**:\n   - Check if this lowest score game occurred in week 1 and involved Kansas City.\n   - From the table: \n     - Week 1 involves Kansas City Chiefs with a total score of 74, which is not the lowest.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that \"the game with the lowest score was in week 1 against the head of the city of Kansas\" is FALSE.\n   - The relevant cells for verifying this are from week 16 and week 1 to compare scores and opponents.\n\n6. **JSON Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
