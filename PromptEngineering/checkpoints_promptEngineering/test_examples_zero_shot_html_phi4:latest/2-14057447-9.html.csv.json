    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze the table for relevant information about the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins series results:\n\n1. **Claim Analysis:**\n   - The claim states: \"Pittsburgh Penguins win the Wales Conference Final 4 - 2 in the 1990/91 season.\"\n   - Key points to verify:\n     - The final score of the series is 4-2 in favor of Pittsburgh Penguins.\n     - The context provided is about a playoff series, specifically the Wales Conference Final.\n\n2. **Table Analysis:**\n   - The table lists match results between Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins with dates and scores.\n   - We need to check if these matches are part of a series leading to a final score of 4-2 for Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\n3. **Match Results from Table:**\n   - May 1: Penguins 3 - 6 Bruins (Bruins win)\n   - May 3: Penguins 4 - 5 OT Bruins (Bruins win)\n   - May 5: Bruins 1 - 4 Penguins (Penguins win)\n   - May 7: Bruins 1 - 4 Penguins (Penguins win)\n   - May 9: Penguins 7 - 2 Bruins (Penguins win)\n   - May 11: Bruins 3 - 5 Penguins (Penguins win)\n\n4. **Series Score Calculation:**\n   - The series score is determined by counting the number of wins for each team:\n     - Pittsburgh Penguins' wins: May 5, May 7, May 9, May 11 (4 wins)\n     - Boston Bruins' wins: May 1, May 3 (2 wins)\n\n5. **Verification Against Claim:**\n   - The series score is indeed 4-2 in favor of the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n   - This matches the claim's assertion about the final score.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table data, the claim that \"Pittsburgh Penguins win the Wales Conference Final 4 - 2\" is supported by the series results provided.\n   - The season (1990/91) is not explicitly mentioned in the table but is part of the context of the claim.

The scores are given as \"visitor - home.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how we will analyze each row:\n\n1. **May 1**: Score is \"3 - 6\" (Pittsburgh vs. Boston). \n   - Margin: |3 - 6| = 3\n2. **May 3**: Score is \"4 - 5 (ot)\" (Pittsburgh vs. Boston).\n   - Margin: |4 - 5| = 1\n3. **May 5**: Score is \"1 - 4\" (Boston vs. Pittsburgh).\n   - Margin: |1 - 4| = 3\n4. **May 7**: Score is \"1 - 4\" (Boston vs. Pittsburgh).\n   - Margin: |1 - 4| = 3\n5. **May 9**: Score is \"7 - 2\" (Pittsburgh vs. Boston).\n   - Margin: |7 - 2| = 5\n6. **May 11**: Score is \"3 - 5\" (Boston vs. Pittsburgh).\n   - Margin: |3 - 5| = 2\n\nFrom this analysis, the largest margin of victory in these games is a difference of 5 goals, which occurred on May 9 with the score \"7 - 2.\"\n\nThe claim states that the largest margin of victory is specifically the game result \"7 - 2.\" While this result did have the largest margin, the actual wording of the claim refers to it as the margin itself. Since we determined the margin is 5 goals (from \"7 - 2\"), and no other game had a larger margin than 5, the claim can be considered TRUE because the specific score mentioned (\"7 - 2\") indeed represents the largest margin observed.\n\nThus, the relevant cells in the table are those with scores on May 9:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Pittsburgh Penguins lost this game (visitor score < home score).\n     - On May 3rd, the score is \"4 - 5 (ot)\" with Pittsburgh Penguins as visitors again.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we must break it down into its components and compare each part with the data in the table:\n\n1. **\"pittsburgh penguin win even game of the wale conference final in the 1990 / 91 seaon\":**\n   - The team name \"Pittsburgh Penguin\" should be verified against the actual team names in the table, which are listed as \"Pittsburgh Penguins\".\n   - Check for any mention or implication that this was a \"wale conference final,\" though no such information is provided in the table.\n   - Verify if any game mentioned is an \"even game\" and if Pittsburgh Penguins won it. An even game could be considered when both teams have scored the same number of points before overtime, which means there should not be a score difference or at least they reached equal scores during regulation time (before OT).\n   - The table does not provide information about seasons; it only includes dates without specifying years.\n\nNow, let's verify each part:\n\n- **Team Name:**\n  - \"Pittsburgh Penguin\" vs. \"Pittsburgh Penguins\": There is a discrepancy here since the team name in the claim has an extra 'e'.\n\n- **Even Game:**\n  - From the scores given:\n    - May 1: 3 - 6 (Not even)\n    - May 3: 4 - 5 (OT) (Equal score at the end of regulation time, hence it's considered even before overtime.)\n    - May 5: 1 - 4 (Not even)\n    - May 7: 1 - 4 (Not even)\n    - May 9: 7 - 2 (Not even)\n    - May 11: 3 - 5 (Not even)\n\n  The game on May 3 is the only one that had an equal score at regulation time, making it \"even\". Pittsburgh Penguins won this game in overtime.\n\n- **Season and Conference Final Context:**\n  - No data regarding the season or whether it was a conference final.\n\nBased on these evaluations:\n\n- There is a discrepancy with the team name.\n- The only even game mentioned is May 3, which Pittsburgh Penguins did win in OT. However, without confirmation of it being part of the \"wale conference final\" or the specified season (1990/91), we cannot conclusively verify that aspect.\n\nThus, given the information available, the claim is not fully supported by the table data due to missing context and discrepancies with details provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
