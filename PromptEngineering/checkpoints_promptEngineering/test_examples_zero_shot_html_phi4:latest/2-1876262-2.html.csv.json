    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about December 2011 is true or false, we must verify two pieces of information from the provided table:\n\n1. The percentage share of Firefox in December 2011.\n2. The percentage share of Chrome in December 2011.\n\nLet's examine each relevant condition stated in the claim against the data presented in the table:\n\n- The claim states that \"in December 2011, Firefox be at 23.24%.\"\n  \n  - Looking at the row corresponding to \"December 2011\" and the column titled \"firefox,\" we see a value of \"23.24%.\" This matches the percentage stated in the claim.\n\n- The claim also states that \"Chrome be at 25.08%\" for December 2011.\n  \n  - Checking the same row, \"December 2011,\" but now looking at the column titled \"chrome,\" we find a value of \"25.08%.\" This is also consistent with the claim's statement.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are verified against the table, and they align perfectly with the data presented for December 2011. Therefore, there is full support from the table for the statement made in the claim regarding the market shares of Firefox and Chrome during that month.\n\nTo provide a precise response according to the instructions given, we must identify which cells were relevant for verifying this information. The row index for \"December 2011\" is found within the body of the table; considering the header row as row index 0, and counting each subsequent data row, December 2011 corresponds to the last row in the provided table, which is row number 15 (indexing from zero).\n\nThe relevant cells are therefore:\n- The cell at row index 15 under the column \"firefox\" for Firefox's market share.\n- The cell at row index 15 under the column \"chrome\" for Chrome's market share.\n\nGiven that both pieces of information have been corroborated by the data, we can conclude with certainty that the claim is TRUE. Below is the JSON object containing our answer and the details of the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"firefox\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"chrome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim involves two specific conditions:\n\n1. The percentage of Safari usage should be exactly 5.87%.\n2. Simultaneously, the percentage of Internet Explorer usage should be exactly 30.27%.\n\nLet's go through the steps required to verify this claim using the given HTML table.\n\n### Analyzing the Table\n\nThe table contains data with months as rows and browser usage percentages across various columns labeled \"internet explorer\", \"chrome\", \"firefox\", and \"safari\". Each row corresponds to a specific month, but the first two rows are labels (\"desktop\" for rows and column names like \"internet explorer\", etc.).\n\n#### Relevant Columns\n- **Internet Explorer**: We're looking for a row where this value is 30.27%.\n- **Safari**: We need to check if in the same row, Safari's percentage equals 5.87%.\n\n### Finding the Row with Internet Explorer at 30.27%\nThe column labeled \"internet explorer\" contains usage percentages. We need to locate any entry that matches exactly 30.27%. \n\nBy examining each data row under this column:\n- The closest value to 30.27% is 30.81%, which occurs in the \"April 2012\" row (index 13).\n\n### Checking Safari Usage for This Row\nNext, verify if the percentage of Safari usage in the same row as 30.81% for Internet Explorer equals 5.87%. \n\n- In April 2012 (row index 13), the value under \"safari\" is 2.27%.\n\nSince the values do not match the claimed condition (\"Safari be 5.87%\" when \"Internet Explorer be 30.27%\"), we can conclude that no such row exists in the table.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim cannot be true because there isn't any instance where Internet Explorer usage is exactly 30.27% and Safari usage is simultaneously exactly 5.87%.\n\nNow, let's compile our results into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"internet explorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"safari\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThese relevant cells were checked:\n- The row index 13 was identified as the closest match for Internet Explorer (30.81%).\n- Safari's percentage in that same row confirmed it does not match the claim (2.27%).",
