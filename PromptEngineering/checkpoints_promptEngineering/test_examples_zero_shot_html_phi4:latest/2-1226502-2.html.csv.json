The relevant cells for this condition are:\n    - Row index 0, Column: year\n    - Row index 0, Column: pts\n\n- **1991 Entry Check**:\n  - Look at the entry with the year \"1991\".\n  - The points column shows \"0\", not \"5\". Thus, it contradicts the claim for this part. There is no mention of Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin either.\n  - Relevant cells are:\n    - Row index 4, Column: year\n    - Row index 4, Column: pts\n\nBased on these verifications:\n\n- The table does show a score of 5 points in 1988 but provides no information about Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin as an entrant.\n- In 1991, the score was 0, not 5.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there is no indication of Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin scoring 5 points in either year based on this table. \n\nHere's the JSON object with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to check if there's an entry for Gugelmin in the table with a consistent chassis designation as \"march 881\" across multiple years.\n\nLet's examine each relevant part of the claim:\n\n1. **Gugelmin's Entry**: We must first identify any rows associated with a driver named Gugelmin.\n2. **Chassis Consistency**: If there are entries for Gugelmin, check if they consistently use \"march 881\" as their chassis across all years.\n\nNow, let's go through the table:\n\n- The given table includes entries for various teams and their respective details over several years: 1988 to 1992.\n- The relevant columns for our verification are \"entrant\", \"chassis\", and \"year\".\n- We need to look for any mention of a driver named Gugelmin in the \"entrant\" column.\n\nUpon examining each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: `leyton house march racing team` - No mention of Gugelmin.\n2. **Row 1**: `leyton house racing` - No mention of Gugelmin.\n3. **Row 2**: `leyton house racing` - No mention of Gugelmin.\n4. **Row 3**: `leyton house` - No mention of Gugelmin.\n5. **Row 4**: `leyton house` - No mention of Gugelmin.\n6. **Row 5**: `sasol jordan yamaha` - No mention of Gugelmin.\n\nNone of the rows in this table list a driver or team associated with \"Gugelmin\". Therefore, there is no information about Gugelmin's chassis use throughout these years within this dataset.\n\nSince we do not have any relevant data concerning Gugelmin and his chassis usage, it's impossible to support the claim that he stayed with the \"march 881\" across the years. Thus, based on the available data in the table:\n\n- The claim is **FALSE** because there are no entries for a driver named Gugelmin.\n\nThe JSON response reflecting this conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n``` \n\nSince no cells contain information relevant to verifying the claim, the list of relevant cells is empty.",
