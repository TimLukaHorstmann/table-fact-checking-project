This means they lost on aggregate since 151 is greater than 136.\n2. **First Leg Score**: Their first leg score was 76 - 62, which they won.\n3. **Second Leg Score**: Their second leg score was 50 - 89, which they lost.\n\nSince `energa czarni slupsk` lost on aggregate (total points), they did not qualify to the next round or win against `unics kazan`.\n\nThe relevant cells in the table for verifying this claim are:\n- Row index 2, column \"agg\" showing 136 - 151.\n- Row index 2, column \"team 1\" showing `energa czarni slupsk`.\n- Row index 2, column \"team 2\" showing `unics kazan`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"ask riga be unable to qualify for the final round\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data provided in the table and understand how qualification for the next round typically works in a knockout competition.\n\nThe table provides results from a two-legged match series where each team plays against another in two separate games (1st leg and 2nd leg). The aggregate score over these two legs determines which team advances. Here's how we interpret the scores:\n\n- Aggregate score is the sum of points from both legs.\n- A higher aggregate score means that team wins the aggregate match.\n\nLet's focus on \"ask riga\" versus \"cholet\":\n\n1. **Scores for ask riga vs cholet:**\n   - 1st leg: ask riga 69 - 62 cholet\n   - 2nd leg: ask riga 73 - 75 cholet\n\n2. **Aggregate score:**\n   - Ask riga: 69 + 73 = 142\n   - Cholet: 62 + 75 = 137\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The aggregate score is 142 - 137 in favor of ask riga.\n\nSince \"ask riga\" has a higher aggregate score than \"cholet,\" they have won this matchup and should qualify for the next round, contrary to the claim.\n\nThus, the statement that \"ask riga be unable to qualify for the final round\" is FALSE based on the provided data.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
