    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there is a single draft pick by the Celtic in 1984 whose first name begins with the letter 'R'. \n\n### Steps for Verification:\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column \"player\" contains the names of the players drafted.\n2. **Check Each Row**: We need to inspect each row in this column to see if any player's first name starts with 'R'.\n3. **Determine First Names**: For each player, identify their first name by splitting the full name on spaces and taking the first element.\n4. **Verify the Condition**: Check if any of these first names start with the letter 'R'.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n- **Row 1**: Player - \"michael young\"\n  - First Name: \"michael\" (Does not start with 'R')\n- **Row 2**: Player - \"ronnie williams\"\n  - First Name: \"ronnie\" (Starts with 'R')\n- **Row 3**: Player - \"rick carlisle\"\n  - First Name: \"rick\" (Starts with 'R')\n- **Row 4**: Player - \"kevin mullin\"\n  - First Name: \"kevin\" (Does not start with 'R')\n- **Row 5**: Player - \"todd orlando\"\n  - First Name: \"todd\" (Does not start with 'R')\n- **Row 6**: Player - \"steve carfino\"\n  - First Name: \"steve\" (Does not start with 'R')\n- **Row 7**: Player - \"mark van valkenburg\"\n  - First Name: \"mark\" (Does not start with 'R')\n- **Row 8**: Player - \"champ godboldt\"\n  - First Name: \"champ\" (Does not start with 'R')\n- **Row 9**: Player - \"joe dixon\"\n  - First Name: \"joe\" (Does not start with 'R')\n- **Row 10**: Player - \"dan trant\"\n  - First Name: \"dan\" (Does not start with 'R')\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are two players whose first names begin with 'R': \"ronnie williams\" and \"rick carlisle\". The claim states that there is a single draft pick with the first name starting with 'R', but we found two such instances.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells for verification are those corresponding to the players \"ronnie williams\" and \"rick carlisle\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
