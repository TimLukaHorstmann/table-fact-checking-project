    "resp": "To determine if the claim about Johnny Miller's highest margin of victory being a 14-stroke win is true based on the table provided, we need to review all entries relevant to this context:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: The focus should be on finding instances where Johnny Miller has won tournaments and noting his margin of victory.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry**:\n   - Look for rows with \"Johnny Miller\" as part of the content (likely under 'Winner').\n   - Check the column that indicates the margin of victory to see if it matches or exceeds 14 strokes.\n   \n3. **Key Columns**: The relevant columns are likely those indicating winners and the margin of victory.\n\n4. **Analyzing Each Row**:\n   - Rows with a \"Winner\" mentioned need checking for Johnny Miller's name.\n   - Find the column specifying the margin of victory (likely labeled something like 'Margin' or similar, which is not explicitly named in this table but implied by numerical values indicating victories).\n\n5. **Find Specific Instances**:\n   - The row mentioning Johnny Miller as a winner with a 14-stroke margin of victory directly supports the claim.\n   - Verify if there are any rows where Johnny Miller won with a margin greater than 14 strokes, which would invalidate the claim.\n\n6. **Determine Support for the Claim**: \n   - If we find exactly one instance where Johnny Miller's margin is 14 strokes and no instances where it exceeds this number, the claim is supported.\n   - Otherwise, if there are margins exceeding 14 or none at all matching it exactly, the claim would be false.\n\n### Examination of Relevant Rows:\n\n- **Row 1**: \"johnny miller\", \"- 14 (69 + 64 + 67 + 70 = 270)\"\n  - This indicates a 14-stroke margin victory for Johnny Miller.\n\nNo other row with \"Johnny Miller\" exceeds this margin based on the provided data, and no additional entries indicate he won by more than 14 strokes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is fully supported because there is only one instance of a 14-stroke victory and no evidence of victories exceeding it.

The margin of victory for Johnny Miller in \"The Open Championship\".\n2. The margin of victory for Johnny Miller in \"Phoenix Open\" (referred to as \"Joe Garagiola - Tucson Open\" and \"NBC Tucson Open\").\n\n**Step 1: Verify Margin of Victory in \"The Open Championship\"**\n\n- Look through the table for entries with the tournament name \"The Open Championship\".\n- The relevant row is on July 10, 1976, where it lists a margin of victory of \"-9\".\n\n**Step 2: Verify Margin of Victory in \"Phoenix Open\"**\n\n- Identify the rows corresponding to tournaments known as \"Joe Garagiola - Tucson Open\", \"NBC Tucson Open\", and similar names.\n- The first relevant row is January 11, 1981 (\"Joe Garagiola - Tucson Open\"), with a margin of victory of \"-15\".\n- Another relevant entry is January 11, 1976 (\"NBC Tucson Open\") with a margin of victory of \"-14\".\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Margins**\n\n- The claim states Johnny Miller had a \"6 strokes\" margin in \"The Open Championship\". However, from our findings, it was actually a \"9 strokes\" margin.\n- For \"Phoenix Open\", the claim is \"14 strokes,\" but both relevant tournaments show either \"-15\" or \"-14\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince neither of the conditions in the claim matches the data from the table:\n- The margin for \"The Open Championship\" should be 9, not 6.\n- The margins for the Phoenix Open events are -15 and -14, which do not exactly match 14.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. \n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row index 22 (\"The Open Championship\"), Column name \"Margin of Victory\"\n- Rows indices 34 and 19 (Phoenix Open equivalents), Column names \"Margin of Victory\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Margin of Victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"Margin of Victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Margin of Victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim: \"Bob Hope Desert Classic be 1 of the 4 tournament Johnny Miller play in the year 1975,\" we need to check the table for relevant information about Johnny Miller's participation and performance in tournaments during that year.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Tournaments Played by Johnny Miller in 1975:**\n   - Look at the rows where the \"Year\" is 1975.\n   - Check if Johnny Miller participated in any of those tournaments.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Tournaments He Played:**\n   - Count how many tournaments are listed for Johnny Miller in 1975.\n\n3. **Verify Participation in Bob Hope Desert Classic:**\n   - Confirm that Johnny Miller played in the \"Bob Hope Desert Classic\" in 1975.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row Index 16:** \n  - Year: 1975\n  - Tournament: \"bob hope desert classic\"\n  - Player: Not explicitly mentioned, but we need to verify if Johnny Miller participated.\n\n- **Other Rows for 1975:**\n  - Check other rows where the year is 1975 to see if Johnny Miller played in any additional tournaments.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The table does not provide explicit information about who played each tournament. It only lists tournament names, years, and results.\n- We need to assume that Johnny Miller's participation is implicit unless otherwise stated.\n- Based on common knowledge (outside the table), Johnny Miller did play in the Bob Hope Desert Classic in 1975.\n- However, without explicit data in the table confirming his participation or listing other tournaments he played, we cannot definitively count four tournaments.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row Index 16:** Contains information about the \"Bob Hope Desert Classic\" in 1975.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit mention of Johnny Miller's participation and the absence of a complete list of tournaments he played in 1975 within the table, we cannot confirm the claim based solely on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
