    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"takaichi hirayama finish the event in 1.25,\" we need to check if this is supported by the data in the provided table.\n\nThe claim suggests two main points:\n1. Takaichi Hirayama was an opponent.\n2. The event finished at or resulted in a time of 1.25 units (likely minutes, based on common MMA reporting).\n\nLet's break down these requirements using the relevant columns from the table:\n\n- **Opponent**: Look for \"takaichi hirayama\" under the \"opponent\" column.\n- **Time**: Check if there is an event where the time recorded in the \"time\" column matches or indicates 1.25.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n1. In row 11, we find Takaichi Hirayama listed as the opponent:\n   - Opponent: \"takaichi hirayama\"\n   - Result: \"submission (rear naked choke)\"\n   - Time: \"6:24\"\n\nThe time recorded here is \"6:24,\" which indicates a duration of 6 minutes and 24 seconds, not 1.25 minutes.\n\nSince the table does not have any entry where Takaichi Hirayama finishes in exactly or approximately 1.25 units of time (which would be around 1 minute and 15 seconds), the claim is not supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim based on the provided information is \"FALSE.\"\n\nRelevant cells for verification include:\n\n- Row 11, \"opponent\" column: This confirms Takaichi Hirayama as an opponent.\n- Row 11, \"time\" column: This shows the actual time of the event was \"6:24,\" not 1.25.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
