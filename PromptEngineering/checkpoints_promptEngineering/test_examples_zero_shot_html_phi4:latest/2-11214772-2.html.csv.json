The team \"Elon\" is listed as the champion.\n2. The score of the game where Elon was the champion is \"12 - 1.\"\n3. The runner-up is \"Clemson.\"\n\nLet's analyze these conditions against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Condition 1: Champion**\n   - We need to find a row where the \"champion\" column contains \"Elon.\"\n\n2. **Condition 2: Score**\n   - In the same row as identified above, we check if the \"score\" is \"12 - 1.\"\n\n3. **Condition 3: Runner-up**\n   - Finally, in that row, verify if the \"runner - up\" column contains \"Clemson.\"\n\nNow let's go through the table to find a matching row:\n\n- Row 0 (year 2004): The champion is \"Duke,\" not \"Elon.\"\n- **Row 1 (year 2005)**: \n  - Champion is \"Elon.\" \u2705\n  - Score is \"12 - 1.\" \u2705\n  - Runner-up is \"Clemson.\" \u2705\n\nThis row meets all the conditions of the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the relevant cells in row index 1:\n- The champion column contains \"Elon.\"\n- The score column contains \"12 - 1.\"\n- The runner-up column contains \"Clemson.\"\n\nThe claim is fully supported by this row. \n\nHence, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify if there were two separate championships for the year 2005.\n2. Determine which team was the champion and which teams placed as runners-up, semi-finalists, or third-place in each event of 2005.\n\n**Step-by-step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Championships in 2005:**\n   - The table shows two entries for the year 2005:\n     - Row 1: Champion is Elon with a score of 12-1 and runner-up is Clemson.\n     - Row 2: Champion is Miami with a score of 6-5.\n\n2. **Check Semi-finalists for Each Event in 2005:**\n   - For the first event (Row 1):\n     - Semi-finalist 1: Western Carolina\n     - Semi-finalist 2: Longwood\n\n   - For the second event (Row 2):\n     - Semi-finalist 1: Embry-Riddle\n     - Semi-finalist 2: North Florida\n\n3. **Determine if Clemson Placed Third to Miami in Any Event:**\n   - In Row 2, where Miami is the champion, the semi-finalists are Embry-Riddle and North Florida.
