Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant cells for verification:**\n- Row index 1, `date`\n- Row index 1, `tournament`\n- Row index 1, `surface`\n- Row index 1, `score`\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
