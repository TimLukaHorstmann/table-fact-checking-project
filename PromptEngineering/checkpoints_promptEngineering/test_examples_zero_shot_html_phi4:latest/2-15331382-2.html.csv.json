    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding the San Diego Chargers' schedule during their 2004 season, we need to focus on two specific aspects of the data provided in the table: \n\n1. Identify when they played against the Oakland Raiders.\n2. Determine if there was a game against the Kansas City Chiefs one week after playing the Oakland Raiders.\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Week and Date for the Game Against Oakland Raiders\n\nFrom the table, we see two entries where the opponent is \"oakland raiders\":\n\n- **Row 8**: \n  - Week: 8\n  - Date: October 31, 2004\n\n- **Row 10**:\n  - Week: 11\n  - Date: November 21, 2004\n\n### Step 2: Check for a Game Against Kansas City Chiefs One Week After the Oakland Raiders\n\nNow, we check if there is a game against the \"kansas city chiefs\" in the week immediately following each identified date:\n\n- **After Week 8 (October 31, 2004)**:\n  - Look at Row 9 (Week 9, November 7, 2004) for an opponent. The opponent here is \"new orleans saints\".\n  - Therefore, there is no game against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 9.\n\n- **After Week 11 (November 21, 2004)**:\n  - Look at Row 11 (Week 12, November 28, 2004) for an opponent. The opponent here is \"kansas city chiefs\".\n  - This satisfies the condition of playing against Kansas City Chiefs one week after playing Oakland Raiders in Week 11.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that during the 2004 San Diego Chargers season, they played the Oakland Raiders one week before playing the Kansas City Chiefs. Based on our examination:\n\n- The game against the Kansas City Chiefs occurs in Week 12, one week after their game against Oakland Raiders in Week 11.\n\nThus, the claim is **TRUE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nWe need to provide the relevant cells that verify this information:\n\n- Row 10 (Week 11) with \"opponent\" as \"oakland raiders\".\n- Row 11 (Week 12) with \"opponent\" as \"kansas city chiefs\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
