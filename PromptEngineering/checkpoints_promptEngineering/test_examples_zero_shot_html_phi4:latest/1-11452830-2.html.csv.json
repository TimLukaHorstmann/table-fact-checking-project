The relevant row is at `row_index` 8.\n\n2. **Check the Result of the Game**:\n   - Verify that the game was a loss (\"l\"). In this row, the \"result\" column shows \"l\", indicating it was indeed a losing game.\n\n3. **Verify the Location of the Game**:\n   - The claim specifies the game was played at the \"louisiana superdome\". We check the \"game_location\" column for this entry and find that it matches \"louisiana superdome\".\n\n4. **Check the Team's Record After This Game**:\n   - According to the table, after this particular game, the team's record was \"2 - 3\". The claim states the record should be \"1 - 3\", which does not match.\n\nGiven these checks:\n\n- The game against the New Orleans Saints is identified correctly.\n- It was a losing game.\n- It was played at the Louisiana Superdome.\n- However, the team's record after this game was incorrectly stated in the claim as \"1 - 3\" instead of the actual \"2 - 3\".\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is false due to the incorrect record mentioned.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game_location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
