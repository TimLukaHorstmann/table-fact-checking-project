    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524\", we need to examine the specified conditions against the data presented in the table.\n\n1. **Opponent Check**:\n   - The claim states that the opponent in week 14 is \"Kansas City Chiefs\".\n   - Looking at the row corresponding to Week 14, we observe the \"opponent\" field: it indeed lists \"kansas city chiefs\".\n\n2. **Attendance Check**:\n   - The claim specifies an attendance of \"74524\" for the game against Kansas City Chiefs.\n   - However, in the row where \"Kansas City Chiefs\" is listed as the opponent (Week 14), the \"attendance\" field shows \"77778\".\n   - In contrast, there's a different entry with attendance \"74524\", which corresponds to Week 13.\n\nThus, while the claim correctly identifies Kansas City Chiefs as the opponent in week 14, it incorrectly states the attendance figure. The correct attendance for that week is \"77778\", not \"74524\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For Week and Opponent verification: Row 13 (0-indexed) with column name \"week\" and \"opponent\".\n- For Attendance check: Row 13 with column name \"attendance\", where the incorrect attendance value was mentioned in the claim.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
