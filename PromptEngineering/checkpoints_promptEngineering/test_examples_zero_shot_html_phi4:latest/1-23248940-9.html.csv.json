    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the bobcat have a record of more win than loss\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the \"record\" column for each game. The format of the record indicates the number of wins and losses respectively (e.g., \"24 - 23\" means 24 wins and 23 losses).\n\nHere's how we can break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** We are interested in the \"record\" column, as it provides the win-loss data needed to evaluate the claim.\n\n2. **Extract Records from Table:**\n   - Game 47: Record is 24 - 23\n   - Game 48: Record is 24 - 24\n   - Game 49: Record is 24 - 25\n   - Game 50: Record is 25 - 25\n   - Game 51: Record is 26 - 25\n   - Game 52: Record is 26 - 26\n   - Game 53: Record is 27 - 26\n   - Game 54: Record is 27 - 27\n   - Game 55: Record is 27 - 28\n   - Game 56: Record is 27 - 29\n\n3. **Calculate Total Wins and Losses:**\n   - From the records, we note that after each game, the number of wins is on the left side of the dash and losses are on the right.\n   - The final record after all games (Game 56) is 27 wins and 29 losses.\n\n4. **Compare Wins to Losses:**\n   - The final tally shows 27 wins and 29 losses, indicating more losses than wins.\n\n5. **Determine if Claim is True or False:**\n   - Since the number of losses (29) exceeds the number of wins (27), the claim that \"the bobcat have a record of more win than loss\" is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Each row provides data relevant to calculating the final record.\n   - Thus, all rows from 0 to 9 in the \"record\" column are relevant.\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
