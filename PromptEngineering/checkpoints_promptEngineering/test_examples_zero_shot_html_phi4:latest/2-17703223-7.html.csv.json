    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim \"Bruno Brand\u00e3o from Brazil have a snatch of 157.0,\" we need to examine relevant cells in the provided HTML table.\n\n1. **Identify Row**: The claim refers to Bruno Brand\u00e3o, who is associated with \"Brazil\" (denoted as \"bra\"). We will look for this name in the 'name' column of the table.\n\n2. **Locate Name**:\n   - Scan through the rows and find where \"bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra )\" appears.\n   - This is found at row index 3.\n\n3. **Check Country**: Verify that Bruno Brand\u00e3o's entry indicates Brazil (\"bra\").\n   - The name entry in row 3 confirms this: \"bruno brand\u00e3o ( bra )\".\n\n4. **Verify Snatch Value**:\n   - Check the 'snatch' column for the value corresponding to row index 3.\n   - The snatch value is 157.0, matching the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: All conditions in the claim are met based on the table data.\n\nThus, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\". The relevant cells for this verification process are:\n\n- Row index 3, column name 'name' (for identifying Bruno Brand\u00e3o and confirming Brazil association).\n- Row index 3, column name 'snatch' (for verifying the snatch weight).\n\nThe JSON object reflecting these findings is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"snatch\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
