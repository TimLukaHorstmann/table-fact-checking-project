    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"over 40 points be score for at least 5 games\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to evaluate the \"points\" column for each row and count how many times a value greater than 40 appears.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim specifies that the Montreal Canadiens scored over 40 points in at least five games.\n   - We are only concerned with the \"points\" column because it directly indicates the cumulative score after each game.\n\n2. **Examining the Table**:\n   - Extract and review the \"points\" column from the table for all entries where Montreal Canadien is the home team (since we're interested in games they played at home).\n   \n3. **Review of Points Column**:\n   - December 2: 32 points\n   - December 4: 34 points\n   - December 6: 35 points\n   - December 9: 37 points\n   - December 11: 37 points\n   - December 13: 37 points\n   - December 18: 39 points\n   - December 20: 41 points (first instance over 40)\n   - December 21: 42 points (second instance over 40)\n   - December 27: 44 points (third instance over 40)\n   - December 29: 46 points (fourth instance over 40)\n   - December 30: 48 points (fifth instance over 40)\n\n4. **Counting Relevant Entries**:\n   - We count the number of instances where \"points\" is greater than 40:\n     - Points > 40 in five games (December 20, 21, 27, 29, and 30).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that over 40 points were scored for at least five games. Based on our analysis, Montreal Canadiens scored over 40 points in exactly five home games.\n   - Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Relevant entries (rows) from the table are those where \"points\" > 40: December 20, December 21, December 27, December 29, and December 30.\n   - These correspond to row indices 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 in a zero-indexed system.\n\nThus, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
