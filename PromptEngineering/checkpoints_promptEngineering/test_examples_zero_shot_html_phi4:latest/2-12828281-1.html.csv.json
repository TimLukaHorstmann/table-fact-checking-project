    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there was a game played on December 2, 1963, and if it would be considered week 15 according to the data provided in the table.\n\n### Analyzing the Claim\n\n1. **Date Verification**: \n   - The claim states \"the game play on December 2, 1964\".\n   - We need to verify whether there is any entry with this date in the `date` column of the table.\n   - Upon examining each row's `date`, we find:\n     - Rows contain dates from September 13, 1964, to December 20, 1964. \n     - None of these rows have the date \"December 2, 1963\".\n\n2. **Week Number Verification**:\n   - The claim suggests that if there was a game on December 2, 1963, it would be week 15.\n   - The table lists weeks from 1 to 14.\n   - Since no games are listed in the table for December 2, 1963, we cannot establish any connection between this date and week 15.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is false because:\n- There is no entry in the table with the date \"December 2, 1963\".\n- Consequently, there can be no game associated with that date or week number.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo verify the above points, we examined the `date` column across all rows.
