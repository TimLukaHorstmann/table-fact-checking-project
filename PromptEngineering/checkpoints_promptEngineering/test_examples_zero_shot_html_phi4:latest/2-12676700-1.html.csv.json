    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"before week 6, attendance at San Diego Charger game total 13000,\" we need to verify two conditions from the table:\n\n1. Identify when the team played against the San Diego Chargers.\n2. Check if this occurred before week 6.\n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- **Row with Week 3**:\n  - The \"week\" column indicates it is week 3.\n  - The \"opponent\" column lists \"San Diego chargers.\"\n  - The \"attendance\" column shows a value of 13000.\n  \nSince this match against the San Diego Chargers occurred in week 3, which is indeed before week 6, we can confirm that the attendance at this game was exactly 13000.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table to verify this claim:\n\n- **Row index 2** (Week 3):\n  - \"opponent\": \"San Diego chargers\"\n  - \"attendance\": 13000\n\nTherefore, the attendance before week 6 at a San Diego Charger game was indeed 13000. The claim is supported by the data.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
