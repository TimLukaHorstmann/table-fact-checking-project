Thus, he does represent this district according to the table.\n\nGiven that the name matches exactly with what is listed in the table, we can confirm:\n- The claim correctly identifies that John J Douglas represents the district of Massachusetts 10.\n  \nTherefore, the claim \"John J Douglas represents a single district: Massachusetts 10\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the relevant JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The candidate mentioned is James A. Gallivan.\n2. It claims that he was \"unopposed.\"\n3. It asserts that his election result should not be \"re-elected\" despite being unopposed.\n\nLet's find the relevant information in the table:\n\n- **Row Index**: We need to identify which row corresponds to James A. Gallivan:\n  - The candidate is found in Row Index 5 under \"district: massachusetts 12\".\n\n- **Column Names**:\n  - **Incumbent**: This column lists incumbents, showing \"james a gallivan.\"\n  - **Party**: Indicates the party affiliation as \"democratic.\"\n  - **First Elected**: Shows when he was first elected, which is \"1914.\"\n  - **Result**: The result of his election is listed here. It shows \"re-elected,\" indicating he won again.\n  - **Candidates**: This column states that James A. Gallivan ran unopposed (\"james a gallivan (d) unopposed\").\n\nNow, evaluate the claim:\n- According to the table, James A. Gallivan was indeed unopposed in his election as indicated under \"candidates.\"\n- The result of the election is marked as \"re-elected\" in the \"result\" column.\n\nThe claim contradicts the information from the table because it states that he should not be \"re-elected,\" but the table clearly shows him being re-elected despite being unopposed.
