Identify the row corresponding to the year 2013.\n2. Check the \"mlb affiliate\" column for that row to confirm if it is indeed associated with Kansas City.\n3. Examine the \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\" columns for that same row.\n\n#### Steps Applied:\n1. **Find the Row:** The year 2013 corresponds to the last row in the table (row index 12).\n2. **Verify MLB Affiliate:**\n   - For row index 12, check the \"mlb affiliate\" column.\n   - It shows \"kansas city,\" confirming that this row is related to Kansas City for the year 2013.\n3. **Check Post-Season Records:**\n   - In row index 12, look at the columns \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %.\"\n   - Both are marked with \"-\", indicating no post-season record or win percentage.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe claim that \"Kansas City have no post-season record in 2013\" is supported by the data. The relevant cells confirm that Kansas City, for the year 2013, has no entries under both \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %.\"\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row Index: 12\n- Column Names: \"mlb affiliate\", \"post - season record\", \"post - season win %\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"post - season win %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Houston have no post-season record,\" we need to analyze the table and focus on the columns related to Houston's association with the team as well as their post-season records.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We first identify which rows pertain to seasons when the MLB affiliate was \"houston.\" These rows are:\n   - Row 0 (season 2001)\n   - Row 1 (season 2002)\n   - Row 2 (season 2003 \u2666)\n   - Row 3 (season 2004)\n   - Row 4 (season 2005)\n   - Row 5 (season 2006 \u2666)\n   - Row 6 (season 2007)\n   - Row 7 (season 2008)\n   - Row 8 (season 2009)\n   - Row 9 (season 2010)\n   - Row 10 (season 2011)\n   - Row 11 (season 2012)\n\n2. **Check Post-Season Record**: For each of these rows, we need to check the \"post-season record\" column:\n   - Row 0: Post-Season Record is \"4 - 0\"\n   - Row 1: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 2: Post-Season Record is \"0 - 2\"\n   - Row 3: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 4: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 5: Post-Season Record is \"0 - 2\"\n   - Row 6: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 7: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 8: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 9: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 10: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n   - Row 11: Post-Season Record is \"-\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that Houston have no post-season record. However, in row 0 (2001 season), we see a post-season record of \"4 - 0,\" and in row 2 (2003 \u2666) and row 5 (2006 \u2666), there are records of \"0 - 2.\" Therefore, the claim is not true because Houston does have a post-season record for those seasons.\n\nBased on this evaluation, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells involved in verifying this claim include all rows where the MLB affiliate is \"houston\" and specifically the \"post-season record\" column for these rows.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
