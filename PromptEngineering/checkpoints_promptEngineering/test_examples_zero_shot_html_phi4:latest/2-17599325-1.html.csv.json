We will focus on this column to count occurrences of each circuit name.\n\n2. **Count Circuit Occurrences**:\n   - Traverse through each row and record how many times each circuit appears.\n   \n3. **Analyze the Counts**:\n   - Check if any circuit occurs more than four times.\n   - If a circuit does appear more than four times, verify that \"mount panorama circuit\" is the only one with this distinction.\n\n4. **Relevant Data Extraction**:\n   - Extract data from each row where we count occurrences of circuits.\n   \nLet's process these steps:\n\n- Traverse through each row and note down the occurrence counts for each circuit name:\n\n  | Row Index | Circuit Name                      |\n  |-----------|-----------------------------------|\n  | 0         | gnoo blas circuit                 |\n  | 1         | fisherman 's bend                 |\n  | 2         | longford circuit                  |\n  | 3         | port wakefield circuit            |\n  | 4         | lowood circuit                    |\n  | 5         | lowood circuit                    |\n  | 6         | mount panorama circuit            |\n  | 7         | albert park                       |\n  | 8         | phillip island grand prix circuit |\n\n- Count the occurrences for each unique circuit name:\n\n  - gnoo blas circuit: 1 time\n  - fisherman 's bend: 1 time\n  - longford circuit: 1 time\n  - port wakefield circuit: 1 time\n  - lowood circuit: 2 times\n  - mount panorama circuit: 1 time\n  - albert park: 1 time\n  - phillip island grand prix circuit: 1 time\n\n- **Conclusion**: No circuit appears more than four times.
