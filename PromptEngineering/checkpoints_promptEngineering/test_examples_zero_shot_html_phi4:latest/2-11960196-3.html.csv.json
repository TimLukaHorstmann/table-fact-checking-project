    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the palace of auburn hills have less attendance than the wachovia center\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant cells in the table related to the attendance figures for games held at these locations.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - We are interested in the `location attendance` column because it contains the information about how many people attended each game.\n   - We need to extract data from this column where the location is either \"the palace of auburn hills\" or \"wachovia center.\"\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - For \"the palace of auburn hills\":\n     - Game 1 (Row 0): Attendance = 22076\n     - Game 2 (Row 1): Attendance = 22076\n     - Game 5 (Row 4): Attendance = 22076\n\n   - For \"wachovia center\":\n     - Game 3 (Row 2): Attendance = 18805\n     - Game 4 (Row 3): Attendance = 18347\n     - Game 6 (Row 5): Attendance = 14130\n\n3. **Calculate Average Attendance:**\n   - The average attendance for \"the palace of auburn hills\" is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{22076 + 22076 + 22076}{3} = 22076\n     \\]\n\n   - The average attendance for \"wachovia center\" is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{18805 + 18347 + 14130}{3} \\approx 17094\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare the Averages:**\n   - The average attendance at \"the palace of auburn hills\" (22076) is greater than the average attendance at \"wachovia center\" (17094).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the claim states that \"the palace of auburn hills have less attendance than the wachovia center,\" and our analysis shows this to be incorrect, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those from which we extracted the attendance data:\n     - Row 0, Column `location attendance`\n     - Row 1, Column `location attendance`\n     - Row 2, Column `location attendance`\n     - Row 3, Column `location attendance`\n     - Row 4, Column `location attendance`\n     - Row 5, Column `location attendance`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"the highest series of the season do not occur until May,\" we need to examine the \"series\" column in the provided table. This column shows the series results after each game, and our goal is to see if the highest series result (i.e., when a team leads most strongly) occurs before or during April.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Series is `1 - 0`\n- **Row 2**: Series is `1 - 1` \n- **Row 3**: Series is `2 - 1`\n- **Row 4**: Series is `2 - 2`\n- **Row 5**: Series is `2 - 3`\n\nAfter examining the series results up to April, we can see that the highest lead recorded by Detroit was in Row 3 with a series of `2 - 1`. This occurred on April 25.\n\nIn May (Rows 6 and beyond), the series values are:\n- **Row 6**: Series is `2 - 4`\n\nThe series `2 - 1` from April 25 indicates that Detroit was leading by one game, which is their highest lead up to this point. In May, they fall behind to a series of `2 - 4`, indicating a further loss.\n\nTherefore, the highest series for Detroit in this dataset occurs before May, specifically on April 25 with a series result of `2 - 1`.\n\nThe claim states that \"the highest series of the season do not occur until May,\" but we have determined that the highest series for Detroit did occur in April. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
