Confirm that \"Fury\" is an exception to this rule.\n\nLet's go through each ship and its commission date:\n\n- **fame**: Commissioned on 26 April 1935\n- **fearless**: Commissioned on 22 December 1934\n- **firedrake**: Commissioned on 30 May 1935\n- **foresight**: Commissioned on 15 May 1935\n- **forester**: Commissioned on 29 March 1935\n- **fortune**: Commissioned on 27 April 1935\n- **foxhound**: Commissioned on 6 June 1935\n- **fury**: Commissioned on 18 May 1935 (an exception as per the claim)\n- **faulknor (flotilla leader)**: Commissioned on 24 May 1935\n\nFrom this information, we can see:\n\n- \"Fame,\" \"Fearless,\" \"Forester,\" and \"Foxhound\" were not commissioned in May 1935.\n- \"Firedrake,\" \"Foresight,\" \"Fury,\" and \"Faulknor (flotilla leader)\" were commissioned in May 1935, with \"Fury\" being highlighted as an exception.\n\nThe claim states that all ships except \"Fury\" should have been commissioned in May 1935.
