    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table based on the following conditions in the claim:\n\n1. The claim states \"4 of the tallest buildings\" in Portland between 1907 and present.\n2. It further specifies that these buildings have been referred to as a \"bank building.\"\n\nLet's break down the claim step-by-step using relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Tallest Buildings\nWe need to verify if four buildings are indeed among the tallest based on height (in feet/meters) during the given time span:\n\n- **Wells Fargo Building**: 185/56 ft/m (1907 - 1911)\n- **Yeon Building**: 194/59 ft/m (1911 - 1913)\n- **American Bank Building**: 207/63 ft/m (1913 - 1927)\n- **Public Service Building**: 220/67 ft/m (1927 - 1962)\n- **Hilton Portland Hotel**: 241/73 ft/m (1963 - 1965)\n- **Harrison West Condominium Tower**: 256/78 ft/m (1965 - 1969)\n- **Union Bank of California Tower**: 268/82 ft/m (1969 - 1970)\n- **Standard Insurance Center**: 367/112 ft/m (1970 - 1972)\n- **Wells Fargo Center**: 546/166 ft/m (1972 - present)\n\n### Step 2: Determine If They Are \"Bank Buildings\"\nWe need to identify which buildings are referred to as a \"bank building\":\n\n1. **American Bank Building**:\n   - Name explicitly includes \"bank.\"\n   \n2. Union Bank of California Tower:\n   - Name explicitly includes \"bank.\"\n\n### Analysis\n- Only two buildings (American Bank Building and Union Bank of California Tower) have names that include the word \"bank.\" \n\nThe claim states there are 4 bank buildings among the tallest, but based on the analysis above, only 2 such buildings exist in this dataset.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the data from the table:\n- There are not 4 buildings referred to as \"bank building\" in the list of tallest Portland buildings between 1907 and present. Only two meet the criteria.\n\nThe answer is therefore **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nTo verify the claim, we should check the following cells:\n\n1. The 'name' column for each row where the name includes the word \"bank.\"\n2. Ensure these entries have heights indicating they were among the tallest at their respective times.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's examine each row sequentially for height (in feet) and number of floors:\n\n- Wells Fargo Building: 185 feet, 12 floors\n- Yeon Building: 194 feet, 15 floors (taller, more floors)\n- American Bank Building: 207 feet, 15 floors (taller, same number of floors)\n- Public Service Building: 220 feet, 16 floors (taller, more floors)\n- Hilton Portland Hotel: 241 feet, 22 floors (taller, more floors)\n- Harrison West Condominium Tower: 256 feet, 25 floors (taller, more floors)\n- Union Bank of California Tower: 268 feet, 15 floors (taller, fewer floors)\n- Standard Insurance Center: 367 feet, 27 floors (taller, more floors)\n- Wells Fargo Center: 546 feet, 41 floors (tallest, most floors)\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that the Union Bank of California Tower is indeed an exception with its height increasing but having fewer floors than the previous building.
