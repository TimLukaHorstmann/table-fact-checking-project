    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the game against Michigan took place at Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN\" is true or false, we need to verify specific details from the table regarding the game involving Michigan.\n\n1. **Locate the row for the game against Michigan:**\n   - We find a match in the \"opponent\" column with \"michigan.\"\n\n2. **Identify relevant columns and values for this row:**\n   - The relevant columns to check are:\n     - `opponent`: Confirm it's \"michigan.\"\n     - `site`: Check if the location is \"memorial stadium minneapolis, mn.\"\n\n3. **Verify the data in the table:**\n\n   - In the row where the opponent is \"michigan,\" we have:\n     - The date is \"11 / 21 / 1931.\"\n     - The site listed is \"michigan stadium ann arbor, mi.\"\n   \n4. **Comparison with the claim:**\n   - The table shows that the game against Michigan was played at \"michigan stadium ann arbor, mi,\" not \"memorial stadium minneapolis, mn.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the site does not match what is claimed, the statement is false.\n\n6. **Identify relevant cells for verification:**\n\n   - The relevant cells from this row are:\n     - Row index 8 (the row where Michigan appears as an opponent).\n     - Column \"opponent\" to verify it's \"michigan.\"\n     - Column \"site\" to check the location of the game.\n\nThus, the JSON output for this evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
