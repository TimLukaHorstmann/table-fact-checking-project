The relevant cells to verify this are those indicating the presence or absence of games for each week:\n\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - Week 3 is missing from the table (indicating one bye/missed game).\n  - Weeks 1 through 18 are present, with only one missing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThese cells indicate the presence of Weeks 1, 2, and 4 onwards in the table, highlighting the absence of Week 3.",

The claim specifies that there should be two instances where the opponents were held to zero points.\n\nLet's examine the entries for the \"result\" column:\n\n1. Week 1: Los Angeles Raiders - L 24-7\n   - Opponent score: 7 (Not zero)\n\n2. Week 2: Chicago Bears - W 10-7\n   - Opponent score: 7 (Not zero)\n\n3.

Week 17: Kansas City Chiefs - W 30-10\n    - Opponent score: 10 (Not zero)\n\n16. Week 18: Washington Redskins - W 14-9\n    - Opponent score: 9 (Not zero)\n\nUpon reviewing the table, we identify two games where the Minnesota Vikings held their opponents to zero points:\n- Week 6 against Tampa Bay Buccaneers with a result of \"W 15-0\"\n- Week 14 against Detroit Lions with a result of \"W 13-0\"\n\nThis confirms that there are indeed two weeks in which the claim holds true.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine each game played by the Minnesota Vikings as recorded in the table and check if there was any week where they held their opponent to zero points.\n\nThe relevant column for this task is \"result,\" which shows the final score of each game. Specifically, we are interested in whether the opponents' scores (the second number after the dash) were greater than zero in every game played by the Vikings during that season.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the data from the table:\n\n1. **Week 1:** Result = \"l 24 - 7\" (Los Angeles Raiders scored 24)\n2. **Week 2:** Result = \"w 10 - 7\" (Chicago Bears scored 7)\n3. **Week 4:** Result = \"w 15 - 13\" (Green Bay Packers scored 13)\n4. **Week 5:** Result = \"l 38 - 19\" (San Francisco 49ers scored 38)\n5. **Week 6:** Result = \"w 15 - 0\" (Tampa Bay Buccaneers scored 0)\n6. **Week 8:** Result = \"w 19 - 12\" (Chicago Bears scored 12)\n7. **Week 9:** Result = \"l 30 - 27\" (Detroit Lions scored 30)\n8. **Week 10:** Result = \"l 30 - 17\" (San Diego Chargers scored 30)\n9. **Week 11:** Result = \"w 26 - 23\" (Denver Broncos scored 23)\n10. **Week 12:** Result = \"l 23 - 10\" (Tampa Bay Buccaneers scored 23)\n11. **Week 13:** Result = \"l 17 - 14\" (New Orleans Saints scored 17)\n12. **Week 14:** Result = \"w 13 - 0\" (Detroit Lions scored 0)\n13. **Week 15:** Result = \"l 37 - 20\" (Dallas Cowboys scored 37)\n14. **Week 16:** Result = \"w 21 - 17\" (Green Bay Packers scored 17)\n15. **Week 17:** Result = \"w 30 - 10\" (Kansas City Chiefs scored 10)\n16. **Week 18:** Result = \"w 14 - 9\" (Washington Redskins scored 9)\n\nThe claim states that there was no week in which the Minnesota Vikings held their opponent to more than zero points, meaning each game should have opponents scoring at least one point.\n\nFrom examining the results:\n- In Week 6 and Week 14, the Vikings held their opponents (Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Detroit Lions, respectively) to 0 points. \n\nSince there are two weeks where the opponents scored exactly 0 points, it means that in those games, the opponents did not score more than zero points; hence they were indeed held to zero.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data presented in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
