    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"week 16 be win 38 - 16\" is true or false, we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The game result for week 16.\n2. The opponent faced during week 16.\n\nLet's break down the verification process based on the provided HTML table:\n\n- **Week Identification**: Locate row corresponding to \"week 16\". According to the table, this is the last row in the body section of the HTML code.\n  \n- **Result Verification for Week 16**:\n  - Look at the \"result\" column for week 16. The claim states that the result should be a win with a score of \"38 - 16\".\n  - From the table, for week 16, the \"result\" is \"w 38 - 16\", indicating a win by 38 to 16.\n\n- **Opponent Verification**:\n  - Although not explicitly required by the claim, confirming that this was against the San Francisco 49ers adds context and supports the claim.\n  - The table shows that in week 16, the opponent is \"san francisco 49ers\".\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information provided for week 16. Thus, both conditions of the claim are supported by the data.\n\n**Relevant Cells Verification:**\n\n- **Row Index**: Since we start counting rows from 0, week 16 corresponds to row index 15.\n- **Columns Involved**:\n  - \"result\" column with value \"w 38 - 16\".\n  - \"opponent\" column for additional context, showing the opponent as \"san francisco 49ers\".\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Comparing the totals:\n- Week 15 total score: 29\n- Week 16 total score: 54\n\nSince 54 (Week 16) is greater than 29 (Week 15), the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are those containing the results of Weeks 15 and 16:\n\n- **Week 15:**\n  - Row index: 14\n  - Column name: \"result\"\n\n- **Week 16:**\n  - Row index: 15\n  - Column name: \"result\"\n\nThus, the JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
