    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"bobby hull have score the most playoff goal of all chicago blackhawk player\" using the provided table, we need to focus on the columns related to playoff performance for each player listed.\n\n### Relevant Analysis:\n\n1. **Column Identification:**\n   - The relevant column for verifying this claim is the \"playoffs\" column since it indicates the number of playoff games each player participated in.\n   - However, note that the table shows \"playoff game appearances,\" not specifically goals scored during those playoffs. Without specific goal data, we cannot directly verify if Bobby Hull has the most playoff goals.\n\n2. **Comparison Across Players:**\n   - Review the \"playoffs\" column to determine if Bobby Hull participated in more playoff games than any other player listed.\n   - The values for each player are as follows:\n     - Bobby Hull: 62\n     - Stan Mikita: 59\n     - Steve Larmer: 45\n     - Denis Savard: 61\n     - Dennis Hull: 33\n     - Jeremy Roenick: 35\n     - Tony Amonte: 13\n     - Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n     - Bill Mosienko: 10\n     - Ken Wharram: 16\n\n3. **Verification of Claim:**\n   - Bobby Hull has the highest number of playoff games (62) compared to other players in this list.\n   - However, without specific goal data, we cannot confirm that he scored the most goals. The claim specifically asks about \"playoff goals,\" not just game appearances.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the table only provides information on playoff games played and not goals scored, we cannot verify if Bobby Hull has indeed scored the most playoff goals.

The column \"total\" represents the combined number of games played by each player during their regular season and playoffs, which could be interpreted as an indicator of scoring potential or contribution.\n\n### Steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Column**: The \"total\" column is relevant since it sums up a player's overall contribution across seasons.\n\n2. **Find Maximum and Minimum Values**:\n   - Identify the highest value in the \"total\" column.\n   - Identify the lowest value in the \"total\" column.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Compute the difference between these maximum and minimum values.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: Check if this calculated difference is 20 or less, as per the claim.\n\n### Examination of the Table:\n\n- **Row 0 (bobby hull)**: Total = 666\n- **Row 1 (stan mikita)**: Total = 600\n- **Row 2 (steve larmer)**: Total = 451\n- **Row 3 (denis savard)**: Total = 438\n- **Row 4 (dennis hull)**: Total = 331\n- **Row 5 (jeremy roenick)**: Total = 302\n- **Row 6 (tony amonte)**: Total = 281\n- **Row 7 (hubert pit martin)**: Total = 269\n- **Row 8 (bill mosienko)**: Total = 268\n- **Row 9 (ken wharram)**: Total = 268\n\n### Calculations:\n\n- **Maximum Value**: 666 (bobby hull, row 0)\n- **Minimum Value**: 268 (both bill mosienko and ken wharram, rows 8 and 9)\n\n**Difference**:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 666 - 268 = 398 \\]\n\nThe difference between the highest scorer and lowest scorer in terms of total games is 398, which is much larger than 20.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that there be only a 20 goal (or game) separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
