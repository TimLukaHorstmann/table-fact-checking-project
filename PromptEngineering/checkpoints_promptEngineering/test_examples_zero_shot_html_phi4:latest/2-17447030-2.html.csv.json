    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to examine each row in the 'record' column for entries matching \"5 - 3\".\n\nLet's evaluate the relevant rows:\n\n1. Row 2: The 'record' value is \"5 - 4 (1)\".\n2. **Row 2**: The 'record' value is \"5 - 3 (1)\". This matches the claimed record of \"5 - 3\".\n3. Row 3: The 'record' value is \"5 - 2 (1)\".\n\nFrom this examination, we find that only one fighter has a \"5 - 3\" record in row index 2 (third row when starting from 0), which supports the claim that only one fighter holds such a record. No other rows match the \"5 - 3\" record. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n- The cell at `row_index: 2`, `column_name: record` contains \"5 - 3 (1)\".\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
