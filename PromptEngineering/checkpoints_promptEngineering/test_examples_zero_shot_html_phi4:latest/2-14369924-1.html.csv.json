The claim that they both have an ERP W of 55 is false.\n\n3. **City of License for w290ag and w230av:**\n   - For `w290ag`, the city of license is Griffin, Georgia.\n   - For `w230av`, the city of license is Gadsden, Alabama.\n\n4. **Claim about cities of license:**\n   - The claim states one has a city of license as Anniston, Alabama, and the other as Macon, Georgia. This does not match the actual data for `w290ag` or `w230av`.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the claim is false. Let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For ERP W and Class:\n  - `w290ag`: Row 4, Columns \"erp w\" and \"class\".\n  - `w230av`: Row 0, Columns \"erp w\" and \"class\".\n\n- For City of License:\n  - `w290ag`: Row 4, Column \"city of license\".\n  - `w230av`: Row 0, Column \"city of license\".\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
