    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate specific data points from the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"paulistano lost as many games as s\u00edrio drew.\"\n\n1. Identify the relevant teams and their columns:\n   - **S\u00edrio**: We are interested in the number of games drawn by S\u00edrio.\n   - **Paulistano**: We need to check how many games Paulistano lost.\n\n2. Locate these values in the table:\n\n   - For S\u00edrio, located at row index 2 (third row):\n     - Look for the \"drawn\" column: Value is `4`.\n\n   - For Paulistano, located at row index 3 (fourth row):\n     - Look for the \"lost\" column: Value is `6`.\n\n3. Compare these values:\n   - S\u00edrio drew `4` games.\n   - Paulistano lost `6` games.\n\nSince the number of games Paulistano lost (6) does not equal the number of games S\u00edrio drew (4), the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are:\n\n- For S\u00edrio: row index 2, \"drawn\" column\n- For Paulistano: row index 3, \"lost\" column\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
