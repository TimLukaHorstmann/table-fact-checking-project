Instead, other players like Brandan Wright, Deron Williams, and Brook Lopez are leading scorers in their respective games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. We will identify the relevant cells where the \"high points\" column does not feature Jordan Farmar as the leading scorer:\n\n- Game 75: High Points - Brandan Wright (15)\n- Game 76: High Points - Deron Williams (18)\n- Game 77: High Points - Brook Lopez (30)\n- Game 78: High Points - Brook Lopez (39)\n- Game 79: High Points - Brook Lopez (27)\n\nThese are the first five games where Jordan Farmar does not lead in points, which is enough to disprove the claim. Thus, we do not need to check further.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding which game had the highest attendance, we need to compare the attendance figures provided in the table for each game.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"the most highly attended game be against minnesota at the prudential center.\"\n\nThis involves two key components to verify:\n1. The game with the highest attendance figure.\n2. Whether this game was played against Minnesota and at the Prudential Center.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - We will look at the \"location attendance\" column in each row of the table to determine which game had the highest attendance.\n\n   - Row 0: Philadelphia game, Wells Fargo Center, 16,695 attendees.\n   - Row 1: Miami game, Prudential Center, 18,711 attendees.\n   - Row 2: Minnesota game, Prudential Center, 13,461 attendees.\n   - Row 3: Detroit game, The Palace of Auburn Hills, 14,554 attendees.\n   - Row 4: New York game, Prudential Center, 18,023 attendees.\n   - Row 5: Toronto game, Air Canada Centre, 17,755 attendees.\n   - Row 6: Charlotte game, Prudential Center, 13,853 attendees.\n\n2. **Identify the Game with Maximum Attendance:**\n   - Comparing all attendance figures:\n     - Miami vs New York games at the Prudential Center have the highest attendances among their respective locations, both exceeding 18,000.\n     - The game against Miami has an attendance of 18,711, which is the highest number.\n\n3. **Verify Game Conditions:**\n   - According to the claim, the highest attended game should be against Minnesota at Prudential Center.\n   - However, from our comparison, the game with the maximum attendance (18,711) was against Miami, not Minnesota.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data shows that the most highly attended game was against Miami and not Minnesota. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n\n- The relevant cells to confirm this include all cells under the \"location attendance\" column since we needed these values to determine which game had the highest attendance.\n  \nHere are the relevant cells from each row that contain the attendance data:\n- Row 0: Location Attendance, Wells Fargo Center, 16,695\n- Row 1: Location Attendance, Prudential Center, 18,711\n- Row 2: Location Attendance, Prudential Center, 13,461 (Minnesota game)\n- Row 3: Location Attendance, The Palace of Auburn Hills, 14,554\n- Row 4: Location Attendance, Prudential Center, 18,023\n- Row 5: Location Attendance, Air Canada Centre, 17,755\n- Row 6: Location Attendance, Prudential Center, 13,853\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
