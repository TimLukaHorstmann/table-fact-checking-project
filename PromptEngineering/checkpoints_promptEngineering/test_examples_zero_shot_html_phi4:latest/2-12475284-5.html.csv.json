Hence, Tiger Woods does not have the highest score; rather, his score places him in third place among scores.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim \"Tiger Woods has the highest score\" is false because there are players with higher total strokes (i.e., a higher numerical value, which indicates worse performance in golf).\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**: \n   - To verify the claim, we need to examine the `score` of Tiger Woods and compare it against all other scores.\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are:\n     - Row index 2 (Henrik Stenson's score)\n     - Row index 3 (Tim Herron's score)\n     - Row index 4 (Davis Love III's score)\n     - Row index 5 (Geoff Ogilvy's score)\n     - Row index 6 (Tiger Woods' score)\n     - Row index 7 (Fred Funk's score)\n     - Row index 8 (Billy Mayfair's score)\n     - Row index 9 (Chris Riley's score)\n     - Row index 10 (David Toms' score)\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
