    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Ivana Abramovic play with Maria Abramovic only 1 time,\" we need to examine the table for matches where Ivana Abramovic is listed as a player alongside Maria Abramovic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The column of interest is \"Partner\" since it indicates who played with whom.\n   - We also need to check the \"Opponent 2\" column because it shows the opponent's partner, which in this context will be Maria Abramovic if she played.\n\n2. **Scan Each Row for Relevance:**\n   - Look through each row to see if Ivana Abramovic is listed in either the \"Partner\" or \"Opponent 2\" columns.\n   - If Ivana Abramovic appears as a partner, check if Maria Abramovic is listed as an opponent's partner.\n\n3. **Count the Matches:**\n   - Count how many times such matches occur.\n\n### Examination of Each Row:\n\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Partner: Maria Abramovic\n  - Opponent 2: Anastasia Rodionova (Anastasia Rodionova is not Ivana)\n  \n- **Row 8:** \n  - Partner: Alla Kudryavtseva\n  - Opponent 2: Anastasia Rodionova (Anastasia Rodionova is not Ivana)\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Partner: Maria Abramovic\n  - Opponent 2: Maria Jose Argeri, Leticia Sobral (No Ivana here)\n\n- **Row 10:** \n  - Partner: Aurelie Vedy\n  - Opponent 2: Edina Gallovits-Hall, Mervana Jugi\u0107-Salki\u0107 (No Ivana here)\n\n- **Rows 11 to 15:** \n  - In all these rows, Maria Abramovic is listed as the partner.\n  - Check if \"Ivana\" appears in the opponent's team:\n    - Row 11: Joana Cortez, Larissa Carvalho\n    - Row 12: Maria Fernanda Alves, Hana Sromova\n    - Row 13: Christina Fusano, Aleke Tsoubanos\n    - Row 14: Amina Rakhim, Arina Rodionova (Ivana is not listed)\n    - Row 15: Danica Krstajic, Sandra Martinovic\n    - Row 16: Arantxa Rus, Nicole Thyssen\n\n- **Row 17:** \n  - Partner: Maria Abramovic\n  - Opponent 2: Amina Rakhim, Arina Rodionova (Ivana is not listed)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nUpon reviewing the table, Ivana Abramovic does not appear in any row as either a partner or an opponent's partner alongside Maria Abramovic. Therefore, they did not play together at all.\n\nThe claim that \"Ivana Abramovic play with Maria Abramovic only 1 time\" is false because there are no instances of them playing together.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Ivana Abramovic never played in the Mexico City tournament,\" we need to examine the table for entries where the \"Tournament\" column lists \"Mexico City.\" Specifically, we should check if \"Ivana Abramovic\" is listed as the partner (\"Partner\" column) or if she is mentioned elsewhere relevantly.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Mexico City**: We need to find all rows where \"Mexico City\" appears in the \"Tournament\" column.\n   - Row 14: The tournament is \"Mexico City,\" and the partner is \"Maria Abramovic.\"\n   - Row 21: The tournament is \"Mexico City,\" and again, the partner is \"Maria Abramovic.\"\n\n2. **Check for Ivana Abramovic**: In these identified rows, check if Ivana Abramovic is mentioned in any column.\n   - Row 14:\n     - Tournament: Mexico City\n     - Partner: Maria Abramovic\n     - Opponents: Larissa Carvalho, Joana Cortez\n\n   - Row 21:\n     - Tournament: Mexico City\n     - Partner: Maria Abramovic\n     - Opponents: Arantxa Rus, Nicole Thyssen\n\nIn both rows where the tournament is \"Mexico City,\" \"Ivana Abramovic\" is not mentioned at all.
