    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the information provided in the table and verify if it supports the statement: \"Englewood, Illinois have 2 translator.\"\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- The claim mentions a specific city, \"Englewood, Illinois.\"\n- It states that this location has \"2 translator.\" In the context of radio frequencies, a \"translator\" is typically a radio station rebroadcasting another's signal at a different frequency. However, in this table, there are no direct indications of translation or rebroadcasting activities; it only lists basic details about radio stations such as call sign, frequency, city of license, ERP (Effective Radiated Power), class, and FCC information.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n1. Identify the row(s) related to \"Englewood, Illinois\" by examining the \"city of license\" column.\n2. Verify whether there is any mention or indication that this location has a translator station with an ERP of 2 watts (since translators often have lower power).\n\n**Relevant Cells from Table:**\n- The row corresponding to \"Englewood, Illinois\" needs examination:\n  - `w264bf` at frequency `100.7 MHz`, city of license is \"englewood , illinois\", with an ERP of `2 watts`.\n  \nThe claim can be evaluated by the following criteria:\n- There is a radio station in Englewood, IL.\n- This station's ERP is 2 watts.\n\nHowever, there are no specific details regarding whether this station acts as a translator. A single entry indicating a power level (ERP) alone does not confirm translation activities without additional context like frequency change or rebroadcasting information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Since the table does not provide explicit data on broadcasting as a translator and only lists ERP and other basic info, there is insufficient evidence from this table to conclude that Englewood has 2 translators based solely on having an ERP of 2 watts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"FALSE.\" The only relevant cell for evaluation is in row index 1 (0-based) under the columns indicating city (\"city of license\"), frequency, and ERP (\"erp w\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"city of license\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency mhz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"erp w\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
