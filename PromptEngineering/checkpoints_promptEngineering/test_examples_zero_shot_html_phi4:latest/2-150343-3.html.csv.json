    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"united kingdom have the same amount of miss world title as india,\" we need to focus on identifying and comparing the relevant data points in the table.\n\nThe table appears to list various countries along with some numerical statistics that could represent accomplishments or records, such as titles won. The structure suggests each row corresponds to a country, while columns likely denote different categories of achievements. For this claim, we are interested specifically in the number of \"Miss World title\" (or equivalent) each country has.\n\n1. **Locate Rows for Relevant Countries:**\n   - The United Kingdom is listed at index 1.\n   - India is listed at index 2.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We need to determine which column represents the \"Miss World title.\" While the table does not explicitly label its columns, we can infer that one of these columns must represent titles won based on context. Typically, tables like this might use a specific position for such achievements due to their significance.\n\n3. **Compare Values:**\n   - We extract and compare the values from the inferred column for both countries:\n     - For the United Kingdom (row 1), look at its value in the presumed \"Miss World title\" column.\n     - For India (row 2), do the same.\n\n4. **Verify if They are Equal:**\n   - If the values match, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - Once the relevant column is identified, note down its index for both countries as these will be the \"relevant_cells.\"\n\nLet\u2019s apply this process:\n\n- From inspection of the table:\n  - The United Kingdom (row 1) has a value of `7` in what we assume to be the \"Miss World title\" column.\n  - India (row 2) also has a value of `7` in that same assumed column.\n\nSince both countries have the same number of titles according to this table, the claim is true. Now, let's specify the relevant cells:\n\n- The index for United Kingdom\u2019s title count is row 1.\n- The index for India\u2019s title count is row 2.\n- Assume the inferred \"Miss World title\" column corresponds to the sixth column in our table (based on typical placement of significant data like titles).\n\nThus, the JSON object should be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"6\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"6\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The column number is inferred based on typical data placement and should be verified against actual labels if they are available.",
