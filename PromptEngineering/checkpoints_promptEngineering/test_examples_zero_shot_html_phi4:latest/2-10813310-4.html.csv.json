    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"at the venue 'the stoop,' the score be 24 - 28\" is true or false, we need to carefully examine the table provided.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points**:\n   - The claim mentions a specific venue: \"the stoop\".\n   - It also provides a score of \"24 - 28\".\n\n2. **Check for Venue Match**:\n   - We look through the \"Venue\" column to find an entry labeled as \"the stoop\". \n\n3. **Verify Score at the Identified Venue**:\n   - Once we locate the row with \"the stoop\", we check the \"Score\" column to see if it matches \"24 - 28\".\n\n4. **Determine Outcome Based on Data**:\n   - If both the venue and score match, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n5. **Extract Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step to find these details:\n\n- The row with \"the stoop\" as the Venue is at index 30:\n  ```\n  <tr>\n    <td>31 / 8 / 97</td>\n    <td>super league ii</td>\n    <td>the stoop</td>\n    <td>l</td>\n    <td>24 - 28</td>\n    <td>mcnamara 4 / 4</td>\n  </tr>\n  ```\n- In this row, the Venue is \"the stoop\" and the Score is \"24 - 28\", which exactly matches the claim.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is supported by the data in the table.\n   - Therefore, the answer to whether the claim is true or false is \"TRUE\".\n\n7. **List of Relevant Cells**:\n\n   The relevant cells are those containing the Venue and Score for the row where \"the stoop\" appears:\n   - Row index 30, Column name \"Venue\"\n   - Row index 30, Column name \"Score\"\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis provides a precise verification of the claim using the data from the table.",
