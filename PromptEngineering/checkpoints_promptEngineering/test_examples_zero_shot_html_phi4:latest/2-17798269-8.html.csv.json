    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the worst team the colorado avalanche play against in March 2009 be the new york islander\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the games played by the Colorado Avalanche during this period and their outcomes.\n\n1. **Understanding \"Worst Team\":** In hockey context, a \"worst team\" often refers to teams with the poorest performance record within a league at that time. However, since specific standings are not provided in the table, we can infer from the game results whether the opponents were particularly strong or weak based on the scores.\n\n2. **Analyzing Table Data:**\n   - The table lists games played by the Colorado Avalanche from March 2 to March 29.\n   - Each row includes the opponent team, score of each game (Avalanche vs. Opponent), and the outcome for the Avalanche.\n\n3. **Game Outcomes with the New York Islanders:**\n   - Date: March 2\n   - Opponent: New York Islanders\n   - Score: 4 - 2 (Colorado wins)\n\n4. **Comparing Other Games:**\n   - We need to compare this result with all other games played by the Avalanche in March.\n   - For each game, check whether the opponent scored more goals than Colorado. A higher score for an opponent generally indicates a weaker performance by the Avalanche, while a lower score for an opponent indicates a stronger performance.\n\n5. **List of Games and Results:**\n   - New York Islanders: 4 - 2 (Avalanche win)\n   - Detroit Red Wings: 3 - 2 (Avalanche loss)\n   - Chicago Blackhawks: 5 - 1 (Avalanche loss)\n   - Atlanta Thrashers: 3 - 0 (Avalanche win)\n   - Minnesota Wild (March 12): 2 - 1 (Avalanche win)\n   - Edmonton Oilers (March 14): 3 - 2 (Avalanche win)\n   - Vancouver Canucks (March 15): 4 - 2 (Avalanche loss)\n   - Minnesota Wild (March 17): 3 - 2 (Avalanche loss)\n   - Edmonton Oilers (March 19): 8 - 1 (Avalanche win)\n   - San Jose Sharks: 3 - 1 (Avalanche loss)\n   - Anaheim Ducks (March 25): 7 - 2 (Avalanche loss)\n   - Vancouver Canucks (March 27): 4 - 1 (Avalanche win)\n   - Anaheim Ducks (March 29): 4 - 1 (Avalanche loss)\n\n6. **Analysis:**\n   - Colorado Avalanche won against the New York Islanders with a score of 4-2.\n   - They also had wins where they conceded fewer goals or scored more compared to other opponents, such as Atlanta Thrashers (3-0) and Edmonton Oilers on March 19 (8-1).\n   - The worst performance in terms of scoring is against the Anaheim Ducks on March 29, losing 7-2.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the outcomes, Colorado Avalanche performed better against the New York Islanders than against several other teams.\n   - Therefore, the claim that the \"worst team\" they played was the New York Islanders is not supported by the game results, as they won convincingly against them and had worse losses against other teams.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
