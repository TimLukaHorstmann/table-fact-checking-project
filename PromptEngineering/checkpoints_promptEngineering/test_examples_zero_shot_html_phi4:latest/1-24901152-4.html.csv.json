    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the table's data, we need to verify two specific conditions:\n\n1. **Condition 1**: The partner in 2004 at the Indian Wells championship should be Martina Navratilova.\n2. **Condition 2**: The partner in 2003 at the Toronto championship should be Lisa Raymond.\n\nLet's examine each condition using the relevant data from the table:\n\n### Verification of Condition 1\n\n- Look for the row where \"year\" is 2004 and \"championship\" is Indian Wells:\n  - Row index: 2\n  - From this row, check the \"partner\":\n    - The partner listed is Elena Likhovtseva.\n  \nSince Martina Navratilova is not the partner in this case, Condition 1 is **false**.\n\n### Verification of Condition 2\n\n- Look for the row where \"year\" is 2003 and \"championship\" is Toronto:\n  - Row index: 1\n  - From this row, check the \"partner\":\n    - The partner listed is Martina Navratilova.\n  \nSince Lisa Raymond is not the partner in this case, Condition 2 is **false**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are false based on the table data. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, we will list the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n- For Condition 1 (Indian Wells, 2004), check:\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Column: \"partner\"\n\n- For Condition 2 (Toronto, 2003), check:\n  - Row index: 1\n  - Column: \"partner\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
