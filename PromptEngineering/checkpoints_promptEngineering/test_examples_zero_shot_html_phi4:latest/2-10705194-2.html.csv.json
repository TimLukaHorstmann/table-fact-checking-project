    "resp": "To verify the claim about Jeremija Sanders' opponent's record, we need to find the relevant match in the table where Jeremija Sanders was an opponent and check his/her own record at that time.\n\n1. **Identify the Row**: The row involving Jeremija Sanders is located at `row_index: 10`. In this row:\n   - \"Opponent\" is listed as \"Jeremija Sanders\".\n   - \"Record\" is provided for this match, with Jeremija Sanders having a record of \"7-0\".\n\n2. **Check Opponent's Record**: The claim states that the opponent (Jeremija Sanders) had a record of \"8-4\". However, according to the table, at the time of the fight against Travis Fowlkes:\n   - Jeremija Sanders' record was \"7-0\", not \"8-4\".\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The claim is incorrect because the opponent's (Jeremija Sanders) recorded history does not match the stated \"8-4\". Therefore, the answer to the verification of this claim is `FALSE`.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**: We identify the following cells as relevant for verifying the claim:\n   - Row 10, \"Opponent\" column: This identifies who the opponent was.\n   - Row 10, \"Record\" column: This provides the record of Jeremija Sanders at that time.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
