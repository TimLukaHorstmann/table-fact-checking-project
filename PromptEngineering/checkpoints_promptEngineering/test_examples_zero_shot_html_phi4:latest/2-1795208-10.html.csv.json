    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"jimmy white be list as the opponent in the final after 2009 at the paul hunter classic,\" we need to check if there is any entry in the table for the Paul Hunter Classic where Jimmy White was listed as an opponent in a year after 2009.\n\nLet's go through each row relevant to the \"Paul Hunter Classic\" and check the columns:\n\n1. Identify rows related to the \"paul hunter classic\":\n   - The first relevant row is at index 1:\n     - **year**: 2008\n     - **opponent in the final**: mark selby\n     - Since the year is not after 2009, this entry does not satisfy the claim.\n   \n   - The second relevant row is at index 4:\n     - **year**: 2009\n     - **opponent in the final**: jimmy white\n     - Although Jimmy White is listed as an opponent here, the year is not after 2009.\n\n2. There are no other rows for \"paul hunter classic\" with a year after 2009.\n\nTherefore, there is no entry where Jimmy White is listed as an opponent in any final of the Paul Hunter Classic after 2009.

Jimmy White is listed as the \"opponent in the final.\"\n\n### Checking the Table:\n\n- **First Row:**\n  - `outcome`: runner-up\n  - `year`: 2008\n  - `championship`: world series - berlin event\n  - `opponent in the final`: Graeme Dott\n  - This row is not relevant because it does not match any part of the claim.\n\n- **Second Row:**\n  - `outcome`: winner\n  - `year`: 2008\n  - `championship`: Paul Hunter Classic\n  - `opponent in the final`: Mark Selby\n  - This row matches the event but not the year or opponent, so it is irrelevant for verifying this specific claim.\n\n- **Third Row:**\n  - `outcome`: winner\n  - `year`: 2009\n  - `championship`: world series - grand final\n  - `opponent in the final`: John Higgins\n  - This row does not match the event, so it is irrelevant for verifying this claim.\n\n- **Fourth Row:**\n  - `outcome`: winner\n  - `year`: 2009\n  - `championship`: world series - champion of champions challenge\n  - `opponent in the final`: Jimmy White\n  - Although the opponent matches and the year does, the event doesn't match, so this row is irrelevant for verifying this claim.\n\n- **Fifth Row:**\n  - `outcome`: winner\n  - `year`: 2009\n  - `championship`: Paul Hunter Classic\n  - `opponent in the final`: Jimmy White\n  - This row matches all parts of the claim:\n    - The year is 2009.\n    - The event is \"Paul Hunter Classic.\"\n    - The opponent listed is Jimmy White.\n\nSince the fifth row satisfies all conditions of the claim, it supports the statement that Jimmy White was indeed the opponent in the final of the 2009 Paul Hunter Classic.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Answer:** TRUE\n- **Relevant Cells:**\n  - `year`: Row index 4, Column name \"year\"\n  - `championship`: Row index 4, Column name \"championship\"\n  - `opponent in the final`: Row index 4, Column name \"opponent in the final\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"championship\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
