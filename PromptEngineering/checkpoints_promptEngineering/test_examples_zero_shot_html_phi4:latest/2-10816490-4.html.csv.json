    "resp": "To verify the claim regarding average attendance for games played in May at the Eternal Derby (Croatia), we need to consider only the relevant data points from the table provided. Here's how we determine which cells are relevant and calculate the required average:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - We focus on columns: \"Date\", \"Home Team Name\", \"Away Team Name\", \"Attendance\". \n     - The \"Attendance\" column is crucial for calculating averages.\n   - Additionally, to ensure the games count as part of the Eternal Derby between Croatia's teams, we check against the \"Home Team Name\" and \"Away Team Name\".\n   \n2. **Filter Data by Month**:\n   - We need entries from May: 13th, 14th, 21st, 22nd, 28th, and 31st of various years.\n\n3. **Eternal Derby Teams**:\n   - The Eternal Derby in Croatia is between \"Dinamo Zagreb\" and \"HNK Hajduk Split\". Thus we only consider matches where one team is Dinamo Zagreb (either home or away) and the other is HNK Hajduk Split.\n   \n4. **Extract Relevant Rows**:\n   - From these conditions, identify rows with matches in May between these two teams.\n\n5. **Calculate Average Attendance**:\n   - Sum the attendance for these games and divide by the number of such games to find the average.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n- **13 May 2008**: Dinamo Zagreb vs HNK Hajduk Split, Attendance = 15000\n- **14 May 2008**: HNK Hajduk Split vs Dinamo Zagreb, Attendance = 6000\n- **28 May 2009**: Dinamo Zagreb vs HNK Hajduk Split, Attendance = 20000\n- **29 May 2009**: HNK Hajduk Split vs Dinamo Zagreb, Attendance = 18000\n- **31 May 2009**: HNK Hajduk Split vs Dinamo Zagreb, Attendance = 10000\n\nNow calculate the average attendance:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{15000 + 6000 + 20000 + 18000 + 10000}{5} = \\frac{69000}{5} = 13800\n\\]\n\nThe calculated average is **13,800**, which does not match the claimed average of **22,666**.\n\nThus, the claim is false.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table, we need to check for two specific conditions mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. The highest attendance.\n2. Whether this highest attendance occurred in November.\n\nLet's analyze the data from the table focusing on these points:\n\n- First, identify all entries with their respective \"Attendance\" values and \"Date.\" We'll examine each row to find the maximum attendance value and its corresponding date.\n\nHere are the relevant details extracted for analysis:\n\n| Date           | Attendance |\n|----------------|------------|\n| 2004-11-07     | 10000      |\n| 2005-09-10     | 12000      |\n| 2006-08-26     | 8000       |\n| 2007-06-03     | 6000       |\n| 2008-05-07     | 15000      |\n| 2009-02-22     | 38000      |\n| 2010-03-24     | 13000      |\n\nFrom the above data, we can observe:\n\n- The highest attendance recorded is **38,000** on **February 22, 2009**.\n\nGiven these details, let's evaluate the claim \"the highest attendance set a new record for game in November\":\n\n1. **Highest Attendance**: We have determined that the highest attendance was indeed 38,000.\n2. **Date Check**: The date of this highest attendance (February 22, 2009) is not in November.\n\nSince the highest attendance did not occur in November, the claim is incorrect based on the data provided.\n\nFinally, let's identify and list the relevant cells to verify the claim:\n\n- For verifying attendance values: rows with \"Attendance\" entries.\n- For checking if any game took place in November: rows where \"Date\" contains 'Nov' or '11'.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n1. Rows with Attendance for finding the maximum value (rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n2. Rows with Date containing November to check against attendance records (row 0).\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
