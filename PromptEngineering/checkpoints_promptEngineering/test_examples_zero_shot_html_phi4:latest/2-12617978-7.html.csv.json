Thus, we should verify this field matches \"eggxactly\" for the correct row.\n\n3. **Date of Episode Airing**: The date mentioned in the claim is August 3, 2006. We must check if the \"first aired\" column reflects this exact date for the episode featuring James Seddon and Eggxactly.\n\n4. **Money Requested**: Lastly, the claim specifies that $75,000 was requested.

Determining how much money each dragon invested across all episodes.\n2. Checking if Richard Farleigh indeed invested the most among all the participating dragons.\n\nLet's break down the investments based on the \"investing dragons\" data:\n\n- **Richard Farleigh**:\n  - Episode 1: Invested (inferred) as part of Richard Farleigh & Peter Jones for Eggxactly.\n  - Episode 3: Explicitly invested in First Light Solutions.\n\n- **Peter Jones**:\n  - Episode 1: Invested with Richard Farleigh for Eggxactly.\n\n- **Deborah Meaden**:\n  - Episode 2, 4, and 8: Invested with Theo Paphitis.\n  \n- **Theo Paphitis**:\n  - Episode 2, 4, 6, and 8: Invested often with Deborah Meaden, sometimes alone (as in Episode 6).\n\n- **Duncan Bannatyne**:\n  - Episode 5: Invested in Dr Cap.\n  - Episode 7: Invested with Peter Jones.\n\nTo assess the total investments by each dragon, we must infer from the episodes they were involved in:\n\n1. **Episode Analysis**:\n   - Episode 1 (75000): Richard Farleigh & Peter Jones\n     - Assume split or full investment unless specified.\n   - Episode 2 (200000): Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis\n   - Episode 3 (100000): Richard Farleigh\n   - Episode 4 (150000): Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis\n   - Episode 5 (150000): Duncan Bannatyne\n   - Episode 6 (65000 received, requested was 50000): Theo Paphitis & Deborah Meaden\n   - Episode 7 (100000): Peter Jones & Duncan Bannatyne\n   - Episode 8 (200000): Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis\n\n2. **Calculate Total Investments**:\n   - Richard Farleigh: 75000 (Episode 1) + 100000 (Episode 3) = 175000\n   - Peter Jones: 75000 (Episode 1) + 100000 (Episode 7) = 175000\n   - Deborah Meaden: 200000 (Episode 2) + 150000 (Episode 4) + 65000 (Episode 6) + 200000 (Episode 8) = 615000\n   - Theo Paphitis: 200000 (Episode 2) + 150000 (Episode 4) + 65000 (Episode 6) + 200000 (Episode 8) = 615000\n   - Duncan Bannatyne: 150000 (Episode 5) + 100000 (Episode 7) = 250000\n\nFrom this breakdown, Richard Farleigh invested a total of 175000, which is less than the amounts invested by Deborah Meaden, Theo Paphitis, and Duncan Bannatyne.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. Here are the relevant cells that were analyzed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
