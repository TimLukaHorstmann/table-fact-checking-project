Since it meets the condition of having a winner's share not less than $15,000, we can say that the claim holds true based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row index of `0` corresponds to the first row after 2012, which is for the year 2013.

We need to find if there's a row where the champion's name is \"jenny shin\".\n\n2. **Share Amount**: The claim mentions that she received \"$14000\" as her share.\n\n3. **Year of Winning**: Although not explicitly stated in the claim, it implies that this should be related to when \"she win\", which suggests identifying the year associated with Jenny Shin's win.\n\n### Steps for Verification:\n\n- **Locate \"jenny shin\" in the Champion Column**:\n  - By examining each row under the 'champion' column, we find that Jenny Shin is listed as the champion in the year 2010 (row index 4).\n\n- **Check the Winner\u2019s Share for Jenny Shin**:\n  - For the row where Jenny Shin is listed, check the 'winner's share' column to verify if it matches $14000.\n  - In row index 4, the winner's share is recorded as $15400.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Jenny Shin received $14000 when she won. However, according to the table, Jenny Shin's winner\u2019s share was actually $15400 in the year 2010.
