Then, check if Isidore Dollinger is the only vacator listed under such cases.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Resignation as Reason for Change:**\n   - Go through each row in the table and look at the \"reason for change\" column.\n   - Extract rows where the reason explicitly mentions a resignation.\n\n2. **Check Vacators in Identified Rows:**\n   - For each identified row, note down the vacator's name from the \"vacator\" column.\n\n3. **Verify Uniqueness of Isidore Dollinger as Vacator for Resignation:**\n   - Confirm that among all rows where resignation is the reason, only Isidore Dollinger appears as the vacator.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 9:** \n  - \"vacator\": Isidore Dollinger (D)\n  - \"reason for change\": Resigned December 31, 1959\n  - This matches our criteria of resignation being the reason and lists Isidore Dollinger as the vacator.\n\n- Check all other rows:\n  - None of the other rows have a \"reason for change\" mentioning resignation except Row 9.\n\nThus, Isidore Dollinger is indeed the only vacator listed whose reason for change was resignation.
