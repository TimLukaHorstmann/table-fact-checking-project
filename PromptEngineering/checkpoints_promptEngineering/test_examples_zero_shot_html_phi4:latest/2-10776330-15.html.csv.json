We will check the \"venue\" column across all rows for an entry that matches this name.\n\n2. **Date Consistency Across All Matches:**\n   - The claim specifies that all these venues were used on August 5, 1961. Hence, we need to ensure that every row in the table corresponds to this date.\n\nLet's proceed with verifying each condition:\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification\n\n1. **Check for Victoria Park in the Venue Column:**\n   - We will scan through each row of the \"venue\" column to find if \"victoria park\" is listed.\n   - In row 3 (index starting from 0), we see that \"victoria park\" is indeed mentioned as a venue.\n\n2. **Ensure All Matches Occurred on August 5, 1961:**\n   - We will verify the \"date\" column for each row to confirm they all match \"5 august 1961\".\n   - Checking each row:\n     - Row 0: Date is \"5 august 1961\"\n     - Row 1: Date is \"5 august 1961\"\n     - Row 2: Date is \"5 august 1961\" (This includes Victoria Park)\n     - Row 3: Date is \"5 august 1961\"\n     - Row 4: Date is \"5 august 1961\"\n     - Row 5: Date is \"5 august 1961\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Victoria Park is listed as a venue in row 2.\n- All entries, including the one for Victoria Park, have the date \"5 august 1961\".\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
