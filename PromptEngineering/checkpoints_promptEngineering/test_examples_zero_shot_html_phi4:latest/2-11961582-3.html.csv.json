    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the November 16 score be i 123 - 126,\" we need to locate the relevant data in the provided table and compare it against the claim.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Date:**\n   - The claim specifies the date as November 16.\n   - We search for a row where the `date` column is \"November 16.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Score on November 16:**\n   - Once we find the correct row, we need to check the `score` column to see if it matches \"123 - 126.\"\n\n3. **Verification Process:**\n   - Locate the row with `date = \"November 16\"`.\n   - Check the `score` in that row.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row with `date = \"November 17\"` has `score = \"96 - 105\"`, so this is not the correct row.\n- The row before it, which corresponds to `row_index = 8`, has `date = \"November 16\"` and `score = \"123 - 126\"`.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The score for November 16 in the table is indeed \"123 - 126.\"\n   - Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells:**\n   - Row index 8 (November 16) and column name `date`.\n   - Row index 8 and column name `score`.\n\nThe JSON object reflecting this analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
