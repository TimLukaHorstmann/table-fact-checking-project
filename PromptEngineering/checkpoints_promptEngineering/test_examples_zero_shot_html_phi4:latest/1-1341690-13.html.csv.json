Yates was re-elected (\"elect incumbant\").\n   - Under the \"result\" column for \"Illinois 9,\" it states \"re - elected.\"\n\nSince all parts of the claim are verified and supported by the table, the claim is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information from the table are:\n- For \"district\": Row index 3, Column name \"district\"\n- For \"incumbent\": Row index 3, Column name \"incumbent\"\n- For \"first elected\": Row index 3, Column name \"first elected\"\n- For \"result\": Row index 3, Column name \"result\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim regarding Sidney R. Yates from Illinois' electoral history as presented in the table, we need to evaluate each component of the claim against the data provided.\n\n1. **Claim Component Breakdown**:\n   - The claim states that \"Sidney R. Yates of Illinois 10 was elected as an incumbent from the Republican party in 1964.\"\n   \n2. **Relevant Conditions to Verify**:\n   - Sidney R. Yates is associated with a specific district number (Illinois 10).\n   - The year mentioned for his first election is 1964.\n   - The claim states he was elected as an incumbent from the Republican Party.\n\n3. **Verification Against Table Data**:\n   - We need to identify the row that mentions Sidney R. Yates and check:\n     - His district number\n     - The party he represents\n     - When he was first elected\n\n4. **Data Extraction from the Table**:\n\n   - **Row 4** in the table corresponds to:\n     - **District**: Illinois 9 (not Illinois 10, which is relevant to our claim)\n     - **Incumbent**: Sidney R. Yates\n     - **Party**: Democratic\n     - **First Elected**: 1964\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - The district number in the claim (Illinois 10) does not match the district number associated with Sidney R. Yates (Illinois 9).\n   - The party affiliation in the claim (Republican) does not match the actual party affiliation of Sidney R. Yates, which is Democratic.\n   - Although the year first elected matches the claim (1964), this alone does not validate the entire statement because other conditions are incorrect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the table data, Sidney R. Yates was indeed first elected in 1964 but he represented Illinois district 9 as a Democrat, not Illinois 10 as a Republican.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The cells relevant to verifying this claim are those that mention Sidney R. Yates and his associated details (district number, party, year first elected).\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"district\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first elected\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
