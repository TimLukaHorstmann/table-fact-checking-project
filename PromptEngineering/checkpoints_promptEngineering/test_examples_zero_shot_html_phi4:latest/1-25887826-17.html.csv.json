The task mentions a comparison with Monterrey's `09 pt`, but since there is no row corresponding to Monterrey, we can assume that the column name \"09 pt\" should apply wherever relevant.\n\nNow let's extract these values from the table:\n- Toluca's `10c pt`: Looking at the row for Toluca (row index 0), the value in the column named \"10c pt\" is **25**.\n- Monterrey: Since there is no direct entry, we need to find where it might refer. If we consider the logical assumption that the mention of Monterrey's `09 pt` refers generically to teams' points from a previous season and given there\u2019s no explicit row for Monterrey in this table but looking at common pattern columns (\"07 pt\", \"08 pt\", etc.), we can compare to Toluca's \"09 pt\" (row index 0), which is **27**.\n\nThe claim states that Toluca's `10c pt` should equal Monterrey\u2019s `09 pt`. Comparing:\n- Toluca's `10c pt`: 25\n- Monterrey's `09 pt`: assumed to be 27 (from Toluca's \"09 pt\" due to lack of direct information)\n\nSince **25 is not equal to 27**, the claim is false.\n\nNow, compile the relevant cells for verification:\n1. Toluca\u2019s row index is 0 with column name \"10c pt\".\n2. Assuming Monterrey refers generically based on available columns and pattern comparison, using Toluca's `09 pt` as a surrogate (row index 0, column name \"09 pt\").\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"10c pt\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"09 pt\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON reflects the verification process and confirms that the claim is false based on available data.",
