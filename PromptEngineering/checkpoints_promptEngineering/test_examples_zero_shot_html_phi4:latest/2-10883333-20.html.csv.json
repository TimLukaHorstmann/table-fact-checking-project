Identify which row corresponds to the game played between Richmond and Hawthorn.\n2. Compare the crowd sizes for all games listed in the table to see if this particular match had the largest crowd.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Game\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- The game between Richmond and their opponent is in Row 4:\n  - Home team: Richmond\n  - Away team: Carlton\n  - Crowd: 49,756\n\n- The game involving Hawthorn is in Row 6:\n  - Home team: Footscray (now known as Western Bulldogs)\n  - Away team: Hawthorn\n  - Crowd: 15,601\n\nThere isn't a direct match for \"Richmond versus Hawthorn\" in the table. Therefore, this part of the claim cannot be verified as true because such a game does not appear to have taken place on that date according to the data provided.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Crowd Sizes\n\nTo evaluate the crowd size aspect:\n\n- Row 0 (Geelong vs South Melbourne): Crowd = 10,973\n- Row 1 (Fitzroy vs Melbourne): Crowd = 13,181\n- Row 2 (Essendon vs North Melbourne): Crowd = 16,545\n- Row 3 (St Kilda vs Collingwood): Crowd = 28,359\n- **Row 4 (Richmond vs Carlton): Crowd = 49,756**\n- Row 5 (Footscray vs Hawthorn): Crowd = 15,601\n\nThe largest crowd is indeed at the Richmond versus Carlton game with a crowd size of 49,756.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim asserts that the \"largest crowd was at the game played by Richmond versus Hawthorn,\" which is incorrect because there isn't such a match in the table.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the closest scoring game, we need to calculate the difference in scores between home and away teams for each row in the table and identify which game has the smallest score difference.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Extract Scores**: The scores are given in a format like \"12.16 (88)\", where \"(88)\" is the total points scored by that team. We'll use these totals to calculate the differences.\n\n2. **Calculate Differences**:\n   - **Row 0**: Geelong vs South Melbourne\n     - Home: 88, Away: 105, Difference = |88 - 105| = 17\n   - **Row 1**: Fitzroy vs Melbourne\n     - Home: 100, Away: 89, Difference = |100 - 89| = 11\n   - **Row 2**: Essendon vs North Melbourne\n     - Home: 105, Away: 91, Difference = |105 - 91| = 14\n   - **Row 3**: St Kilda vs Collingwood\n     - Home: 137, Away: 156, Difference = |137 - 156| = 19\n   - **Row 4**: Richmond vs Carlton\n     - Home: 98, Away: 95, Difference = |98 - 95| = 3\n   - **Row 5**: Footscray vs Hawthorn\n     - Home: 93, Away: 91, Difference = |93 - 91| = 2\n\n3. **Identify the Closest Game**:\n   - The smallest difference is 2 points in Row 5 (Footscray vs Hawthorn).\n\n4. **Verify Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the closest scoring game was at Junction Oval with a difference of 0.15, which refers to Fitzroy vs Melbourne.\n   - However, the actual smallest difference is between Footscray and Hawthorn, not Fitzroy and Melbourne.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying the claim include:\n- The scores for both teams in each game (home team score and away team score columns).\n- The venue to confirm where the games took place.\n\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
