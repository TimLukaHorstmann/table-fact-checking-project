We will check each entry under this column.\n\n2. **Check Each Entry:**\n   - Row 7: Carlos Cuelllar, Transfer Fee = 7.8 m\n   - All other rows with a non-empty transfer fee:\n     - Row 18: Jean-Claude Darcheville, Transfer Fee = Free\n     - Row 25: Chris Burke, Transfer Fee = Free\n\n3. **Comparison:** \n   - The only numerical value for a transfer fee is in Row 7 (Carlos Cuelllar with 7.8 m). All other entries either have \"Free\" or are loans and thus do not have a transfer fee applicable.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since no other player has a recorded transfer fee higher than 7.8 m, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Transfer Fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Transfer Fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Transfer Fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant column for verifying this claim is the \"Amount\" associated with each transfer where the player's country or team is listed as \"sco\". We will then compare these amounts to determine if 'sco' indeed has the lowest total transfer amount.\n\n1. **Identify Transfers Related to 'sco':**\n   - Look for rows in the table where the country or team column indicates 'sco'.\n   - Extract the associated \"Amount\" values for these transfers.\n   \n2. **Calculate Total Transfer Amount for 'sco':**\n   - Sum up all relevant \"Amount\" entries for 'sco' transfers.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Transfers:**\n   - Calculate total transfer amounts for other countries/teams in similar manner and compare them to ensure that 'sco' indeed has the lowest amount.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Row 20: \"charlie adam\" is from sco, \"Amount\": \u00a32,000,000.\n   - Row 32: \"chris burke\" is from sco, \"Type\": Transfer, \"Amount\": Free (implying \u00a30).\n   \n2. **Calculate Total Amount for 'sco':**\n   - Charlie Adam's transfer cost: \u00a32,000,000\n   - Chris Burke's transfer was free: \u00a30\n   - Total = \u00a32,000,000 + \u00a30 = \u00a32,000,000\n\n3. **Verify if 'sco' has the Lowest Transfer Amount:**\n   - Compare with other entries:\n     - Row 21: \"jean-claude darcheville\" from fra, transfer is free (\u00a30).\n     - Other players not listed as having a specific amount for transfers in the table have been assigned 'Free', which implies \u00a30.\n   \n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since several other countries/teams also have transfers marked as \"free,\" their total amounts are \u00a30 or lower than \u00a32,000,000.\n   - Therefore, 'sco' does not have the lowest amount of transfer; instead, it has a higher amount compared to those with \"free\" transfers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is **FALSE**.

Identify rows with a \"free\" entry under the \"Fee\" column:\n   - Row 23: Jean-Claude Darcheville's transfer is marked as \"free.\"\n   - Row 27: Chris Burke\u2019s transfer is marked as \"free.\"\n\n2. Count the total number of players with a \"free\" transfer fee.\n   - From our identification, there are only two players (Jean-Claude Darcheville and Chris Burke) who have been transferred for free.\n\n3. Verify if Chris Burke is one among exactly five such instances:\n   - We found only 2 entries where the transfer was for a \"free\" fee, not five.\n\nThus, based on the table data, there are only two players with a \"free\" transfer fee, meaning the claim is false since it specifies that there should be five such cases, and Chris Burke should be one among them. \n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 23 (Jean-Claude Darcheville) where Fee = \"free\"\n- Row 27 (Chris Burke) where Fee = \"free\"\n\nThe JSON object with our conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Fee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Fee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
