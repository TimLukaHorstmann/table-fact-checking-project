    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data in the provided table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the closest time be between Estonia and Russia, where the difference be less than 3 seconds.\"\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the times for Estonia and Russia from the table.\n2. Calculate the difference between these two times.\n3. Check if this difference is indeed less than 3 seconds.\n\nLet's extract the relevant data:\n\n- **Russia**:\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Time: 5:39.18\n\n- **Estonia**:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Time: 5:42.22\n\nNow, we need to convert these times into seconds for easier comparison.\n\n- Russia's time in seconds:\n  - 5 minutes and 39.18 seconds = (5 * 60) + 39.18 = 339.18 seconds\n\n- Estonia's time in seconds:\n  - 5 minutes and 42.22 seconds = (5 * 60) + 42.22 = 342.22 seconds\n\nNext, we calculate the difference between these two times:\n\n- Difference: 342.22 - 339.18 = 3.04 seconds\n\nThe claim states that the difference should be less than 3 seconds, but our calculation shows a difference of 3.04 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells:\n\n1. Russia's time (Row index: 2, Column name: \"time\")\n2. Estonia's time (Row index: 3, Column name: \"time\")\n\nHere's the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
