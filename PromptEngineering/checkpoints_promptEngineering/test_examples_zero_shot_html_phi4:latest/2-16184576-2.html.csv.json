    "resp": "To verify the claim \"in 2001 the annual win - loss be 9 - 9 , while they didn't play in 1987\", we will examine specific cells from the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's focus on checking if the annual win-loss record for 2001 is indeed 9-9. We need to locate the row corresponding to \"Annual Win-Loss\" and check the column that represents 2001:\n\n1. **Row for Annual Win-Loss**:\n   - The relevant data starts at row index 15.\n\n2. **Column for 2001**:\n   - From this row, we look at the column labeled with the year 2001, which is found in cell (row_index 15, column_name \"2001\").\n\n3. **Content Check for 2001**:\n   - The content of that cell should be \"9 - 9\" to support part of the claim.\n\nNext, we need to verify if they didn't play in 1987:\n\n4. **Row for Annual Win-Loss**:\n   - Again, the relevant data is found starting at row index 15.\n\n5. **Column for 1987**:\n   - From this row, check the column labeled with the year 1987, which is found in cell (row_index 15, column_name \"1987\").\n\n6. **Content Check for 1987**:\n   - The content of that cell should be \"n / a\" or indicate no participation to support part of the claim.\n\nUpon examining these cells:\n\n- For 2001: Cell (15, \"2001\") shows \"9 - 9\", which supports the first condition.\n- For 1987: Cell (15, \"1987\") shows \"n / a\", which supports the second condition that they didn't play in 1987.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied based on the data from these cells. Thus, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"2001\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1987\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"in 1995, 1996, and 1997, the annual win-loss for grand slam be all 5 - 4,\" we need to examine the data relevant to these years within the provided table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - The table lists tennis tournaments and their associated results.\n   - Each row corresponds to a specific tournament or an aggregated result like \"Masters Series SR\" or \"Annual Win-Loss.\"\n   - Columns represent different years, and some columns are special (e.g., \"n/a\" for non-applicable data).\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data:**\n   - The claim pertains specifically to the \"Grand Slam\" tournaments' annual win-loss records.\n   - We need to locate rows that mention Grand Slams and then check their win-loss records for the years 1995, 1996, and 1997.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Table:**\n   - The table does not have a separate row explicitly labeled \"Grand Slam\" with individual year-wise results.\n   - However, the row titled \"Annual Win-Loss\" likely aggregates win-loss records for all tournaments, including Grand Slams, over each year.\n\n4. **Extracting Data from the \"Annual Win-Loss\" Row:**\n   - We focus on the entries under the years 1995, 1996, and 1997 in the \"Annual Win-Loss\" row.\n   - The relevant cells for these years are:\n     - 1995: \"4 - 5\"\n     - 1996: \"5 - 7\"\n     - 1997: \"2 - 4\"\n\n5. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the win-loss record for Grand Slams should be \"5 - 4\" for each of these years.\n   - However, from the extracted data:\n     - 1995 has a record of \"4 - 5\"\n     - 1996 has a record of \"5 - 7\"\n     - 1997 has a record of \"2 - 4\"\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The win-loss records for these years do not match the claim of \"5 - 4\" for each year.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"1995\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"1996\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"1997\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
