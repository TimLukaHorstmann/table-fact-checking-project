    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"subota be the mongolian word for sunday\" is true or false, we need to check the table for entries related to Mongolian language representations of days of the week.\n\n1. **Relevant Information in Table:**\n   - There are two relevant rows under the column named \"Mongolian\".\n     - The first row uses numerical names:\n       - Sunday is listed as \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\".\n     - The second row uses Tibetan-based terms:\n       - Sunday is listed as \"\u043d\u044f\u043c nyam\".\n\n2. **Relevant Cells for Mongolian:**\n   - For the numerical representation of days:\n     - Row index 12, Column Name: \"Mongolian (numerical)\"\n   - For the Tibetan-based representation of days:\n     - Row index 13, Column Name: \"Mongolian (tibetan)\"\n\n3. **Verification Against Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies that \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday.\n   - In both relevant rows under the \"Mongolian\" columns, \"subota\" does not appear as the word for Sunday.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data in the table, \"subota\" is not listed as the Mongolian word for Sunday. Instead, it appears under the column \"Serbian\", which means the claim is incorrect regarding its association with Mongolian.\n\nThus, the answer to the claim is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Mongolian (numerical)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Mongolian (tibetan)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
