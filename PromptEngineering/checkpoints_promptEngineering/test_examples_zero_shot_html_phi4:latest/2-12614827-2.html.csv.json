    "resp": "To verify the claim \"rob emerson have the highest win record of 13 - 10 in his mma career,\" we need to examine the records in the table for Rob Emerson's wins and losses, as well as compare them with other fighters listed.\n\n1. **Rob Emerson's Record:**\n   - Wins (column name: \"Win\"): Count the number of \"Win\" entries in rows where \"Name\" is \"Emerson, Rob.\"\n     - Row 11: Win\n     - Row 12: Win\n     - Row 13: Win\n     - Row 14: Win\n     - Row 15: Win\n     - Row 16: Win\n     - Row 17: Win\n     - Row 18: Win\n     - Row 19: Win\n     - Row 20: Win\n     - Row 21: Win\n     - Row 22: Win\n     - Row 23: Win\n   \n   Total Wins for Rob Emerson = 13\n\n   - Losses (column name: \"Loss\"): Count the number of \"Loss\" entries in rows where \"Name\" is \"Emerson, Rob.\"\n     - Row 1: Loss\n     - Row 2: Loss\n     - Row 3: Loss\n     - Row 4: Loss\n     - Row 5: Loss\n     - Row 6: Loss\n     - Row 7: Loss\n     - Row 8: Loss\n\n   Total Losses for Rob Emerson = 8\n\n   Thus, his record is indeed \"13 - 8\" (not 13 - 10 as claimed).\n\n2. **Comparison with Other Fighters:**\n   - Check the records of other fighters in the table:\n     - For each fighter, count wins and losses to see if any have a higher win total than Rob Emerson's 13.\n     - Example for comparison:\n       - Edgar, Frankie: Wins = 8 (Rows 9-16), Losses = 3 (Rows 1-3)\n       - Aldo, Jose: Wins = 10 (Rows 24-33), Losses = 2 (Rows 18-19)\n\n   The highest win record in the table is for \"Aldo, Jose\" with 10 wins.\n\nSince no fighter has a higher win total than Rob Emerson's 13 and his actual loss count is different from claimed, the claim about him having the highest win record but stating it incorrectly as \"13 - 10\" makes the statement false.\n\nTherefore, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Win\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Count Losses**: Identify rows where the `Winner` is someone other than Rob Emerson and the `Result` indicates a loss (e.g., \"Decision\", \"KO/TKO\", etc.). These are direct losses.\n\n2. **Count No Contests**: Identify rows where the result is marked as \"NC\" or similar, which should be counted towards losses in this context because they do not count as wins for Rob Emerson.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Losses**:\n  - Row 12: Winner is Dokonjonosuke Mishima, Result is Decision (unanimous).\n  - Row 13: Winner is Javier Vazquez, Result is Decision (split).\n  - Row 17: Winner is Jamal Perkins, Result is Decision (unanimous).\n  - Row 18: Winner is Jens Pulver, Result is Decision.\n  - Rows 22 to 29: These are all wins for Rob Emerson, so they do not count as losses.\n\n- **No Contests**:\n  - Row 9: Result is NC (no contest).\n\nAdding these up, we have:\n\n- Total Losses = 4\n- No Contests = 1\n\nTherefore, the total number of matches that did not result in a win for Rob Emerson is 5.
