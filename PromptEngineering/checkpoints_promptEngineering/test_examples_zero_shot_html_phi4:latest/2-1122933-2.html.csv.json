    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there are indeed a total of 26 drivers listed in the provided table.\n\nThe table structure indicates:\n\n- The header row contains column names: \"driver\", \"constructor\", \"laps\", \"time / retired\", and \"grid\".\n- Each subsequent row represents a driver with their respective details.\n\nLet's count the rows that contain data about drivers. This involves counting all the non-header rows in the table, as each of these corresponds to one driver entry:\n\n1. **Header Row**: We have 5 columns (header) which is not part of the driver entries.\n2. **Data Rows**: Each row after the header contains details of a specific driver.\n\nCounting the data rows:\n- The first data row starts with \"niki lauda\" and continues down to \"riccardo patrese\", where the last entry in the table indicates there are 19 drivers listed from \"niki lauda\" to \"eddie cheever\".\n- There is one additional row for \"riccardo patrese\", bringing the total count of rows with driver data to 20.\n\nThus, based on the table, there are only 20 entries (drivers) instead of the claimed 26 drivers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim stating there be a total of 26 drivers in the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix is **FALSE** as per the provided table.

Thus, he is not considered a finisher.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Marc Surer's Laps**\n\n- From the table, locate Marc Surer's row:\n  - **Row Index**: 10\n  - **Column \"laps\"**: 65\n\nMarc Surer completed 65 laps before retiring due to an exhaust issue. \n\nSince Thierry Boutsen did not finish the race, he cannot be considered as having finished right after any other driver.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe claim that \"Thierry Boutsen finish the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix right after Marc Surer\" is false because Thierry Boutsen did not finish the race. \n\nRelevant cells to this determination include those for Thierry Boutsen's retirement reason and Marc Surer\u2019s laps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
