He actually won it in 1994 according to the provided data.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification\n\nTo verify this claim against the table, we need:\n- The cell corresponding to the year \"1994\" and column \"mens singles.\"\n\nFrom the HTML format provided:\n- This corresponds to the first row (index 0) of the body (`<tbody>`) section in the \"mens singles\" column.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis solution indicates that while Ivan \u0110uri\u0107 is indeed a winner in the table, he did not win in 1978; thus, the claim is false. The relevant cells for this verification are those indicating the year and the corresponding winner in the men's singles category.",
