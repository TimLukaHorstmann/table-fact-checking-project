However, based on the table data:\n\n- The only player with a \"t12\" finish has a total of 282 but is from the United States.\n\nTherefore, the conditions of the claim are not fully met because the player associated with the specified total and finish is not from South Africa.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row index 2 for columns: \"player\", \"country\", \"total\", and \"finish\".\n\nGiven these observations, we conclude that the claim is false.
