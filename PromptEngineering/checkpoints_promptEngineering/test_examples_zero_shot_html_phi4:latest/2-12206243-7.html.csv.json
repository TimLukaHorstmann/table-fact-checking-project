    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"the record for June 13 be 29 - 32,\" we need to identify and examine relevant cells from the table provided. The structure of the table includes columns such as Date, Opponent, Score, Pitcher, Attendance, and Record. Given that the claim pertains specifically to a team's win-loss record on June 13, our focus will be on extracting information related to:\n\n1. **Date**: We need to locate the row where the date is \"June 13.\"\n2. **Record**: We need to verify if the record listed for this date matches \"29 - 32.\"\n\nHere are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Locate June 13 in the Date column.\n   - The table shows an entry for \"june 20\" onwards, so we need to find any earlier entries that might include June 13.\n\n2. Identify the row index for June 13:\n   - As per standard chronological listing and assuming no missing dates in between given entries, there should be a preceding record before June 20.\n   \n3. Check the Record column on this identified date:\n   - For each date prior to June 20 that we locate, verify if the \"Record\" cell reads \"29 - 32.\"\n\n4. Validate against the claim.\n\nBy inspecting the table:\n\n- There is no explicit entry for \"June 13.\" We must infer the preceding record before the first visible entry, which starts from \"june 20.\"\n- The last known record in the table prior to June 20 is \"37 - 39\" (on June 30).\n\nBased on typical sports record progression:\n- The record typically increments by one win or loss for each game. \n- Before June 20's \"33 - 34,\" it\u2019s logical to assume the games played were from the last mentioned date (June 30) backward, with their respective impacts on the record.\n  \nCalculating backwards:\n- June 29: Record was \"37 - 39\" after a win, so before this game, it must have been \"36 - 39.\"\n- June 28: Another win, so prior record \"35 - 39.\"\n- June 27: A win, so previous record \"34 - 39.\"\n- June 26: Another win, making the prior record \"33 - 39.\"\n- June 25: Yet another win leads us back to \"32 - 39.\"\n- June 24: With a loss, record was changed from \"33 - 38\" (previously) to \"33 - 39.\"\n- June 23: Loss again, record becomes \"33 - 37.\"\n\nThus:\n- After the game on June 22, where they lost, the record should have been \"33 - 36.\"\n- After a win on June 21, it was \"33 - 35.\"\n- After another win on June 20, the record changed to \"33 - 34,\" which is listed.\n  \nWorking further back:\n- On June 19 (inferred), a loss would have made the record \"32 - 34.\"\n- On June 18, another inferred loss from prior record (\"33 - 33\") would make it \"32 - 33.\"\n- On June 17: A win results in \"33 - 33,\" consistent with typical game progression.\n- On June 16: Another win leads to a potential pre-game record of \"32 - 33.\"\n- On June 15: Another inferred loss, so previous was \"32 - 32.\"\n- Finally, on June 14 and June 13 (both assumed as games due to the lack of specific entries):\n  - If on June 14 they lost, before this game it must have been \"31 - 32.\"\n  - Therefore, a win on June 13 would make the record become \"32 - 32.\"\n\nTherefore, the record for June 13 being \"29 - 32\" does not match the logical deduction of \"32 - 32.\" Hence, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSince there's no explicit row for June 13 in the table, `row_index` is marked as `null`, but it acknowledges that the columns Date and Record are pertinent to evaluating the claim.",

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"the record for June 13 be under 29 - 32\", we need to examine the table's \"Record\" column specifically for the date \"June 13\". The task is to confirm whether this particular record value is less than 29 - 32.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**:\n   - The claim specifically references June 13, so we must find the row where the \"Date\" column equals \"June 13\".\n\n2. **Locate the specific data in that row**:\n   - Check the \"Record\" column for this date to determine its value.\n\n3. **Compare with the condition from the claim**:\n   - The claim states that the record should be under \"29 - 32\". This is interpreted as a record worse than a win-loss of 29 wins and 32 losses, meaning fewer than 29 wins or more than 32 losses.\n   \n4. **Determine if the actual record meets this condition**:\n   - Compare the record value from June 13 to see if it is less favorable (worse) than 29 - 32.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Finding the row for June 13**:\n  - The row index for \"June 13\" in the table is 19.\n  \n- **Record on June 13**:\n  - The value of the \"Record\" column at this row is \"33 - 36\".\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - A record of \"33 - 36\" indicates 33 wins and 36 losses, which is not worse than 29 - 32. It actually represents a better performance (more wins) compared to 29 - 32.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the actual record for June 13 (\"33 - 36\") is not under 29 - 32, it does not satisfy the condition of being worse. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON output based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
