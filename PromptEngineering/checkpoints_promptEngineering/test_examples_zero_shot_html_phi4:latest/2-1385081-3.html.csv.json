    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table data and verify if Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 15 goals in all matches listed.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the claim: \"Cho Jae-jin score a total of 15 goal in the match show.\" This implies that the cumulative number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin across all the matches shown in the table should be 15. We will focus on the \"score\" column to calculate this total.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. Extract the number of goals from each row in the \"score\" column.\n2. Sum these values to find the total number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin across all matches.\n3. Compare this sum with 15 to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Scored \"1 goal\"\n- **Row 1**: Scored \"1 goal\"\n- **Row 2**: Scored \"1 goal\"\n- **Row 3**: Scored \"1 goal\"\n- **Row 4**: Scored \"1 goal\"\n- **Row 5**: Scored \"2 goals\"\n- **Row 6**: Scored \"1 goal\"\n- **Row 7**: Scored \"2 goals\"\n\nNow, let's sum these values:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10\n\nThe total number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in the matches shown is 10.\n\nSince 10 does not equal 15, the claim that Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 15 goals is false. \n\nWe will list all relevant cells (those from which we extracted the goal data) to verify this calculation:\n\n- Row index 0, column \"score\"\n- Row index 1, column \"score\"\n- Row index 2, column \"score\"\n- Row index 3, column \"score\"\n- Row index 4, column \"score\"\n- Row index 5, column \"score\"\n- Row index 6, column \"score\"\n- Row index 7, column \"score\"\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table and extract relevant information.\n\nThe claim states: \"Cho Jae-jin scored a total of 3 goals in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualifier.\"\n\nHere's how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**: We need to look for matches that are part of the \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\" competition.\n2. **Count Goals Scored by Cho Jae-jin**: For each relevant match, check the number of goals scored and sum them up.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- The first row has a date of 25 September 2003, venue Incheon, score \"1 goal\", result \"5 - 0\", and competition \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\".\n- The second row has a date of 24 October 2003, venue Muscat, score \"1 goal\", result \"7 - 0\", and competition \"2004 afc asian cup qualification\".\n\nBoth rows are relevant as they pertain to the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification. Now, let's sum up the goals:\n\n- From the first row: 1 goal\n- From the second row: 1 goal\n\nTotal goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualifier = 1 + 1 = 2 goals.\n\nThe claim states that he scored a total of 3 goals, but according to the table, he only scored 2 goals.
