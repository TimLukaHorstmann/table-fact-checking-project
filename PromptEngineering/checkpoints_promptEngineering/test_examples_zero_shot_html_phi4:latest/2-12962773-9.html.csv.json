    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table based on the specific conditions given in the claim: \n\n1. The player must be a \"guard\".\n2. The height of this guard must be taller than 2 meters (i.e., greater than 200 cm).\n\nLet's go through each row in the table and check these conditions:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Player: Mithat Demirel\n  - Position: Guard\n  - Height: 1.80 m \u2192 This is less than 2 meters.\n  \n- **Row 1**:\n  - Player: Ademola Okulaja\n  - Position: Forward\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Player: Stephen Arigbabu\n  - Position: Center\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Player: Robert Garrett\n  - Position: Guard\n  - Height: 1.92 m \u2192 This is less than 2 meters.\n  \n- **Row 4**: \n  - Player: Johannes Herber\n  - Position: Guard\n  - Height: 1.97 m \u2192 This is less than 2 meters.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Player: Steffen Hamann\n  - Position: Guard\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Player: Demond Greene\n  - Position: Guard\n  - Height: 1.85 m \u2192 This is less than 2 meters.\n  \n- **Row 7**: \n  - Player: Pascal Roller\n  - Position: Guard\n  - Height: 1.85 m \u2192 This is less than 2 meters.\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Player: Guido Gr\u00fcnheid\n  - Position: Forward\n\n- **Row 9**:\n  - Player: Patrick Femerling\n  - Position: Center\n  \n- **Row 10**:\n  - Player: Dirk Nowitzki\n  - Position: Forward\n\n- **Row 11**:\n  - Player: Jan-Hendrik Jagla\n  - Position: Center\n\nAfter evaluating all rows, none of the guards listed have a height greater than 2 meters.
