Identify the maximum number of laps completed.\n2. Confirm how many drivers completed this maximum number of laps.\n\nLet's analyze these one by one using the data provided in the table:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Maximum Laps Completed\n- We scan through the \"laps\" column to find the highest value.\n- The values are: 63, 63, 63, 63, 62, 62, 61, 61, 61, 61, 60, 59, 59, 59, 56, 56, 43, 36, 35, 31, 23, 19, 15, 14, 12, 10.\n- The maximum value in this column is **63 laps**.\n\n### Step 2: Count Drivers with Maximum Laps\n- We count the number of occurrences of \"63\" in the \"laps\" column:\n  - Damon Hill (row 0)\n  - Jean Alesi (row 1)\n  - Gerhard Berger (row 2)\n  - David Coulthard (row 3)\n\nThere are **4 drivers** who completed 63 laps.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions in the claim are satisfied: the most laps completed is indeed 63, and this was done by exactly 4 drivers.\n\nNow, we will identify the relevant cells that verify these claims:\n\n- The \"laps\" column entries for row indices 0 to 3 show the maximum laps of 63 completed.\n  \nThus, the relevant cells are from rows 0 to 3 in the \"Laps\" column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 3 drivers have to retire because of a gearbox issue\" is true or false, we need to inspect the relevant data from the provided HTML table.\n\nThe table columns include:\n- `driver`: The name of the driver.\n- `constructor`: The team and car manufacturer for the driver.\n- `laps`: Number of laps completed by the driver in the race.\n- `time / retired`: Indicates either the finishing time or the reason for retirement if applicable.\n- `grid`: Starting grid position.\n\nOur focus is on the \"time / retired\" column to identify drivers who retired due to a gearbox issue. The table provides specific reasons for retirement where applicable, such as \"gearbox,\" \"engine,\" \"spun off,\" etc.\n\nLet's examine each entry in the \"time / retired\" column:\n\n1. **Row 14** (\"bertrand gachot\"): Retired because of \"gearbox\"\n2. **Row 22** (\"andrea montermini\"): Retired because of \"gearbox\"\n3. **Row 27** (\"jos verstappen\"): Retired because of \"gearbox\"\n\nThere are only three drivers who retired due to a gearbox issue, according to the table.\n\nThe claim states that more than three drivers retired for this reason. Since we found exactly three instances and not more, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
