However, there is no column in the table that specifies the year. Therefore, we can only verify the rank and player name from the given data.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n- The condition regarding the rank being ninth for Roscoe Tanner is satisfied.\n- The player's name matches with \"roscoe tanner\".\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the table does not provide any information about the year, the claim cannot be fully verified as true solely based on this data.
