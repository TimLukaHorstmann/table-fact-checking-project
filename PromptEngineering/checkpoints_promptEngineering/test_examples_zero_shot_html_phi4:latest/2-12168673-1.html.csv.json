    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze each part of the claim with respect to the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant year and winner:**\n   - The claim mentions \"blueeyesintherein be the winner in 2012.\"\n   - From the table, we locate the row where the `year` column is 2012.\n   \n2. **Find the corresponding owner for that winner:**\n   - In the same row, check the `owner` column to verify the ownership details.\n\n3. **Verify if the specified owners match those in the claim:**\n   - The claim specifies \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\" as the owner.\n   - We need to ensure that this text matches exactly with what is listed under the `owner` column for the 2012 winner.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps using the table:\n\n- **Step 1:** Locate the row for the year 2012:\n  - The first row has a `year` value of \"2012\".\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the corresponding `winner` and `owner` columns in this row:\n  - The `winner` column shows \"blueeyesintherein\".\n  - The `owner` column shows \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\".\n\n- **Step 3:** Compare with the claim's owner text:\n  - The text \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\" matches exactly with what is in the table.\n\nThus, all conditions of the claim are met.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Overbrook farm and et al own winner bleeyesintherin after 2009,\" we need to verify two components of the statement against the table:\n\n1. **Ownership Information**: Check if \"Overbrook Farm\" is listed as an owner for any horse named \"bleeyesintherein.\"\n2. **Year Condition**: Ensure that this ownership occurs in a year after 2009.\n3. **Horse Name Accuracy**: Confirm that there is indeed a horse named \"bleeyesintherein.\"\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The claim refers to a horse named \"bleeyesintherin.\" From the table, we find \"blueeyesintherein\" in the year 2012 (row index 0). This appears to be a typographical error in the claim, as \"blueeyesintherein\" is the correct name from the table.\n\n- For row index 0 (year 2012), the owner listed is \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" There is no mention of \"Overbrook Farm.\"\n\n- We need to verify if there is any year after 2009 where \"Overbrook Farm\" is listed as an owner. Scanning through the table, we find:\n\n  - Row index 14 (year 1995), \"golden attraction,\" with owner \"overbrook farm.\" This is before 2009.\n\nThere are no entries for a horse named \"blueeyesintherein\" after 2009 where \"Overbrook Farm\" is listed as an owner. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- The entire row for year 2012 (row index 0) to check the name and ownership.\n- Scanning other rows post-2009 to ensure no \"Overbrook Farm\" entry exists as an owner.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
