By examining the data, we find that April 9 corresponds to the entry at `row_index` 13.\n\n2. **Verify the Teams Playing**:\n   - For the date of April 9, located at `row_index` 13, the \"Home\" team is listed as \"athletics,\" and the \"Away\" team is \"TOR.\"\n   - The claim mentions that the Toronto Blue Jays (often abbreviated as \"TOR\") play against the Angels (\"angels\"). Therefore, we need to verify:\n     - Whether \"TOR\" indeed stands for the Toronto Blue Jays.\n     - Whether the opposing team is listed as \"angels,\" which would mean they are the Los Angeles Angels.\n\n3. **Interpret Team Abbreviations**:\n   - In Major League Baseball (MLB), \"TOR\" commonly represents the Toronto Blue Jays, aligning with the claim's reference to them playing.\n   - The abbreviation \"angels\" in the table refers to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim or simply the Angels.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the information at `row_index` 13:\n- **Home Team**: Athletics\n- **Away Team**: TOR (Toronto Blue Jays)\n  \nThe Toronto Blue Jays are playing against the Athletics, not the Angels. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as per the provided data.\n\n### JSON Response\n\nGiven this analysis, we can construct the required JSON object indicating that the answer is \"FALSE\" and providing the relevant cells for verification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Away\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON indicates that upon checking the specific row and columns for April 9, we find evidence contrary to the claim.",
