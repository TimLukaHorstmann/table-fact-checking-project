Identify the column related to UK viewers:\n   - The relevant column here is \"uk viewers (million)\".\n\n2. Check each row for the values under the 'UK viewers (million)' column:\n   - Row 0: \"The Curse of Cornelius Sigan\" has 5.77 million viewers.\n   - Row 1: \"The Once and Future Queen\" has 5.94 million viewers.\n   - Row 2: \"The Nightmare Begins\" has 6.09 million viewers.\n   - Row 3: \"Lancelot and Guinevere\" has 5.69 million viewers.\n   - Row 4: \"Beauty and the Beast (part 1)\" has 5.53 million viewers.\n   - Row 5: \"Beauty and the Beast (part 2)\" has 6.14 million viewers.\n   - Row 6: \"The Witchfinder\" has 5.62 million viewers.\n   - Row 7: \"The Sins of the Father\" has 6.16 million viewers.\n   - Row 8: \"The Lady of the Lake\" has 6.30 million viewers (claim under consideration).\n   - Row 9: \"Sweet Dreams\" has 6.02 million viewers.\n   - Row 10: \"The Witch's Quickening\" has 6.01 million viewers.\n   - Row 11: \"The Fires of Idirsholas\" has 6.01 million viewers.\n\n3.

The goal is to identify whether the episode titled \"The Lady of the Lake\" has the smallest number of UK viewers compared to all other episodes listed.\n\nHere are the relevant steps and observations:\n\n1. **Identify \"The Lady of the Lake\" Episode:**\n   - Locate the row with the title \"the lady of the lake,\" which is in row 11 (indexing starts at 0).\n\n2. **Extract Viewer Numbers for All Episodes:**\n   - List out the UK viewership numbers from each episode:\n     - Row 10 (\"the curse of cornelius sigan\"): 5.77 million\n     - Row 11 (\"the once and future queen\"): 5.94 million\n     - Row 12 (\"the nightmare begins\"): 6.09 million\n     - Row 13 (\"lancelot and guinevere\"): 5.69 million\n     - Row 14 (\"beauty and the beast (part 1)\"): 5.53 million\n     - Row 15 (\"beauty and the beast (part 2)\"): 6.14 million\n     - Row 16 (\"the witchfinder\"): 5.62 million\n     - Row 17 (\"the sins of the father\"): 6.16 million\n     - **Row 18 (\"the lady of the lake\")**: 6.30 million\n     - Row 19 (\"sweet dreams\"): 6.02 million\n     - Row 20 (\"the witch 's quickening\"): 6.01 million\n     - Row 21 (\"the fires of idirsholas\"): 6.01 million\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Compare the viewership number for \"The Lady of the Lake\" (6.30 million) with all other episodes.\n   - The episode with the least UK viewers is \"beauty and the beast (part 1)\" with 5.53 million viewers.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \"the lady of the lake\" does not have the least number of UK viewers, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells to verify this claim include all rows' \"uk viewers (million)\" column and specifically the cell in row 18 (\"the lady of the lake\") in the same column.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"uk viewers (million)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
