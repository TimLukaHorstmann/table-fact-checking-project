Vancouver (home) scored 5 goals.\n   - **April 7**: Score is \"4 - 5\". Vancouver (visitor) scored 5 goals, but not relevant as they are the visitor team here.\n   - **April 9**: Score is \"1 - 8\".

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each game involving Vancouver and check if the attendance was fewer than 15,000 for six of those games.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We focus on rows where \"vancouver\" appears in either the \"visitor\" or \"home\" column, as these indicate games involving Vancouver.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data:**\n   - For each relevant row, extract the attendance figure from the \"attendance\" column.\n\n3. **Count Games with Attendance < 15,000:**\n   - Count how many of these games have an attendance figure fewer than 15,000.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states there should be fewer than 15,000 attendees for six of Vancouver's games.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **April 1:** Attendance = 10,425 (Vancouver is visitor)\n- **April 3:** Attendance = 19,875 (Vancouver is visitor)\n- **April 4:** Attendance = 10,575 (Vancouver is visitor)\n- **April 7:** Attendance = 15,858 (Vancouver is home)\n- **April 9:** Attendance = 20,214 (Vancouver is visitor)\n- **April 11:** Attendance = 16,150 (Vancouver is home)\n- **April 13:** Attendance = 16,150 (Vancouver is home)\n- **April 15:** Attendance = 16,005 (Vancouver is home)\n\nNow, count the games with attendance fewer than 15,000:\n\n- April 1: 10,425\n- April 4: 10,575\n\nOnly two games have attendance figures below 15,000.\n\nSince the claim requires six games with fewer than 15,000 attendees and we only found two, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON response with relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim regarding Vancouver's second-highest goal score in a single game during the season based on the provided table, we need to analyze and compare the goals scored by Vancouver in each row where they were listed as the visitor or home team.\n\nLet's review each relevant entry from the table:\n\n1. **April 1**: Visitor (Vancouver) - Score: 5 - 3  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 5\n\n2. **April 3**: Visitor (Vancouver) - Score: 1 - 5  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 1\n\n3. **April 4**: Visitor (Vancouver) - Score: 3 - 0  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 3\n\n4. **April 7**: Home (Vancouver) - Score: 4 - 5  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 5\n\n5. **April 9**: Visitor (Vancouver) - Score: 1 - 8  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 1\n\n6. **April 11**: Home (Vancouver) - Score: 3 - 6  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 6\n\n7. **April 13**: Home (Vancouver) - Score: 4 - 7  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 7\n\n8. **April 15**: Visitor (Vancouver) - Score: 8 - 6  \n   Goals scored by Vancouver = 8\n\nNext, we compile a list of goals scored by Vancouver in each game they played:\n\n- 5 (April 1)\n- 1 (April 3)\n- 3 (April 4)\n- 5 (April 7)\n- 1 (April 9)\n- 6 (April 11)\n- 7 (April 13)\n- 8 (April 15)\n\nNow, we sort these scores in descending order to identify the highest and second-highest goal tallies:\n\n1. 8 (April 15)\n2. 7 (April 13)\n3. 6 (April 11)\n4. 5 (April 1 and April 7)\n5. 3 (April 4)\n6. 1 (April 3 and April 9)\n\nThe highest number of goals Vancouver scored in a single game is 8, achieved on April 15. The second-highest score is 7, from the game on April 13.\n\nAccording to the claim, \"the second most goal vancouver score in a single game be 8,\" which does not match our findings because the second highest was actually 7. Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant rows and columns for checking this are those that indicate the games Vancouver played (either as visitor or home) along with their scored goals:\n\n- April 1: Column 'score', Row 0\n- April 3: Column 'score', Row 1\n- April 4: Column 'score', Row 2\n- April 7: Column 'score', Row 3\n- April 9: Column 'score', Row 4\n- April 11: Column 'score', Row 5\n- April 13: Column 'score', Row 6\n- April 15: Column 'score', Row 7\n\nHere is the JSON object with our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
