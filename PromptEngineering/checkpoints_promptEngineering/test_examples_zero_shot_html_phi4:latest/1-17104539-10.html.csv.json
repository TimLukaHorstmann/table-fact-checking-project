The game prior to this (Row 22) had a win (\"w 71 - 55\"), so there wasn't an ongoing losing streak immediately before Row 23.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is partially incorrect because while \"Chicago\" was indeed the opponent and the score was \"l 68 - 60,\" it does not continue a losing streak since the game right before this had been won.\n\nBased on our analysis, the relevant cells to verify these conditions are from Row 22 and Row 23:\n\n- **Row 22**:\n  - \"opponent\": \"new york liberty outdoor classic\" (to check the previous result)\n  - \"score\": \"w 71 - 55\" (to confirm it was a win before game against Chicago)\n\n- **Row 23**:\n  - \"opponent\": \"chicago\"\n  - \"score\": \"l 68 - 60\"\n\nConclusively, since there wasn't an ongoing losing streak immediately prior to this match, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
