    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"Minnesota have an attendance of 11921 at the Target Center,\" we need to verify two specific pieces of information from the provided table:\n\n1. The team played against Minnesota on January 2.\n2. The game was held at the Target Center with an attendance of 11,921.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step using the table:\n\n- **Row Identification**: We first identify the row where Minnesota is listed as the opposing team. This occurs in row index 0 (the first row).\n\n- **Checking Team Information**:\n  - In row index 0 under the \"Team\" column, the entry is \"Minnesota,\" confirming that this game involves a matchup against Minnesota.\n\n- **Verifying Location and Attendance**:\n  - We need to confirm two things: the location of the game and the attendance figure. These details are found in the \"Location\" and \"Attendance\" columns, respectively.\n  - In row index 0 under the \"Location\" column, the entry is \"Target Center,\" confirming that this game was indeed held at the Target Center.\n  - Additionally, in row index 0 under the \"Attendance\" column, the entry is \"11,921,\" matching the claimed attendance figure.\n\nGiven these checks, all conditions of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- The team played against Minnesota on January 2.\n- The game took place at the Target Center with an attendance of 11,921.\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer to the evaluation is \"TRUE.\"\n\nThe relevant cells that confirm this information are:\n- Row index 0, column \"Team\" (to verify Minnesota as the opponent)\n- Row index 0, column \"Location\" (to check for Target Center)\n- Row index 0, column \"Attendance\" (to validate attendance of 11,921)\n\nHere's the resulting JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
