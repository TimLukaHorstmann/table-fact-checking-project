The claim requires that **all** episodes of season 1 be directed by Dean Devlin.\n\nSince the table does not provide information about all episodes in season 1, and only one episode is listed with Dean Devlin as director, we cannot confirm that every episode in season 1 was directed by Dean Devlin based on this data alone.

This corresponds to checking the row where the 'series' column is equal to 50.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row:**\n   - From the table, we find that the row with `series` = 50 contains:\n     - `season`: 6\n     - `title`: \"the carnival job\"\n     - `directed by`: \"frank oz\"\n     - `written by`: \"m scott veach & paul guyot\"\n     - `original air date`: \"july 31 , 2011\"\n     - `us viewers (in millions)`: 3.38\n\n3. **Verify the Viewer Count:**\n   - The claim states there are \"3.38 million viewer\" for series number 50.\n   - In the identified row, the value in the 'us viewers (in millions)' column is indeed 3.38.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both the series number and viewer count match exactly with those stated in the claim, the claim is fully supported by the data provided in the table.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The relevant cells that need to be checked are:\n     - For `series` = 50 (located at row index 5).\n     - For `us viewers (in millions)` = 3.38 (also located at row index 5).\n\nBased on this evaluation, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (in millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Episodes from \"season 1\".\n2. Marc Roskin as the director of those episodes.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions by reviewing relevant entries in the table:\n\n### Evaluating Season 1\n- The table shows that all episodes listed are under \"Season\" numbers greater than 1 (from season 1 to season 17). None of the episodes have a \"season\" value equal to 1.\n  \n### Checking Director Marc Roskin\n- We need to identify which entries list \"Marc Roskin\" as the director:\n  - Row with `series` 47: Title is \"the 15 minutes job\", Directed by is \"marc roskin\".\n  - Row with `series` 55: Title is \"the experimental job\", Directed by is \"marc roskin\".\n  - Row with `series` 60: Title is \"the gold job\", Directed by is \"marc roskin\".\n\nNone of these rows belong to season 1, as confirmed from the \"season\" column.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- There are no episodes in season 1 directed by Marc Roskin.\n  \nThus, the claim \"Marc Roskin direct season 1\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this conclusion include checking all director entries for rows where the season is equal to 1 (none exist), and confirming which rows have Marc Roskin as a director.

We look for this title in the 'title' column.\n2. **Director Check**: It claims that Marc Roskin directed it. We need to check the 'directed by' column for this information.\n3. **Original Air Date Check**: The claim states the original air date as \"July 3, 2011\". This needs verification against the 'original air date' column.\n\nLet's break down each step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Title\n- From the table, row 2 has the title \"the 10 li'l grifters job\" (note there is a slight discrepancy in spelling with an extra 's').\n\n### Step 2: Verify Director\n- In row 2 under the column 'directed by', it states \"arvin brown\", not Marc Roskin. \n\n### Step 3: Check Original Air Date\n- The original air date for this title is listed as \"July 3, 2011\" in row 2 of the table.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim contains an error regarding the director's name. While the title and original air date match correctly with the data from row 2, Marc Roskin is not mentioned as the director.
