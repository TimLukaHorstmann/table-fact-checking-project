    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that \"Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng win with the lowest number of strokes,\" we need to look at the relevant data in the table concerning their scores. The specific column to consider is the \"score\" column, as it directly represents the number of strokes taken by the champion.\n\nFirstly, identify the entries for Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng:\n- Annika S\u00f6renstam's record appears in row 10 with a score of 278.\n- Yani Tseng's records appear in rows 4 and 8, both with scores of 272.\n\nNext, compare these scores to all other champions' scores in the \"score\" column:\n\n1. **Scores for Annika S\u00f6renstam**:\n   - Row index: 10\n   - Score: 278\n\n2. **Scores for Yani Tseng**:\n   - Row index: 4\n   - Score: 272\n   - Row index: 8\n   - Score: 272\n\n3. **Other Scores in the Table**:\n   - Row indices and corresponding scores are as follows:\n     - 0: 282\n     - 1: 273\n     - 2: 281\n     - 3: 271\n     - 5: 281\n     - 6: 269\n     - 7: 272\n     - 9: 273\n     - 11: 277\n\nUpon reviewing the scores, we find that the lowest score recorded in the table is 269 (Row index 6) by Karen Stupples. Both instances of Yani Tseng's wins with a score of 272 do not represent the lowest number of strokes; therefore, she does not have the record for the lowest strokes.\n\nThus, Annika S\u00f6renstam's and Yani Tseng's scores are not the lowest in the table, making the claim false.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this include:\n- The score entries for Annika S\u00f6renstam (row 10) and both of Yani Tseng\u2019s victories (rows 4 and 8).\n- All other \"score\" column entries were reviewed, with a specific note on row 6 which holds the record.\n\nHere is the JSON object that encapsulates this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
