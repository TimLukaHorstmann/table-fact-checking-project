We need to find a row where the outgoing manager's name matches \"Daniel Uberti.\"\n\n2. **Team Name**: The claim specifies Nejapa as the team. So, we need to find a row where the team is \"Nejapa.\"\n\n3. **Manner of Departure**: According to the claim, Daniel Uberti was sacked. We should check if the manner of departure in the corresponding row is \"sacked.\"\n\n4. **Date of Vacancy**: The claim mentions December 29, 2008, as the date of vacancy. We need to ensure that this matches the table's entry.\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant row in the table:\n\n- Row with `team = \"nejapa\"`\n- `outgoing manager = \"daniel uberti\"`\n- `manner of departure = \"sacked\"`\n- `date of vacancy = \"29 december 2008\"`\n\nAll conditions specified in the claim match perfectly with this row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
