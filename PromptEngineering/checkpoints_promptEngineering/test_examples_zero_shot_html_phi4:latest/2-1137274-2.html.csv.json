    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Don Colliver direct all 27 episodes of this show,\" we need to verify two main components from the table:\n\n1. **Total Number of Episodes**: Check if there are indeed 27 rows (episodes) in the table.\n2. **Director Consistency**: Ensure that Don Colliver is listed as the director for every episode.\n\nLet's break down these checks step-by-step using the provided data:\n\n### Step 1: Counting Total Episodes\nWe need to count how many episodes are listed in the table. By examining the row indices (starting from 0) and ending at the last index, we can determine this number:\n\n- The first episode is at `row_index = 0`.\n- The last episode is at `row_index = 19`.\n\nThis gives us a total of 20 episodes (from index 0 to 19 inclusive), not 27 as claimed.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying Director for Each Episode\nNext, we need to check if Don Colliver is listed as the director in each row under the \"directed by\" column:\n\n- The relevant column for this check is \"directed by\".\n- We must verify that every entry under this column from `row_index = 0` to `row_index = 19` reads \"Don Colliver\".\n\nUpon reviewing, it can be confirmed that Don Colliver is indeed listed as the director in each row.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile Don Colliver directs all episodes present in the table (20 episodes), the claim states he directed 27 episodes. The number of episodes does not match the claimed total.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"Don Colliver direct all 27 episodes of this show\" is **FALSE** because there are only 20 episodes listed, not 27.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells to check for verifying both components (total count and consistency) are under the column \"directed by\" from `row_index = 0` to `row_index = 19`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Don Colliver directed 25 episodes of this show out of 27,\" we need to verify two things:\n\n1. The number of episodes Don Colliver directed.\n2. The total number of episodes listed in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step verification:**\n\n1. **Counting Episodes Directed by Don Colliver:**\n   - Check each row in the \"Directed By\" column to see how many times \"Don Colliver\" appears.\n   - In the given table, every episode (row) lists \"Don Colliver\" as the director.\n\n2. **Total Number of Episodes:**\n   - Count the total number of rows in the table to determine the total number of episodes.\n   - The table has 27 rows, indicating there are 27 episodes.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Since Don Colliver is listed as the director for all 27 episodes, he directed 27 episodes, not 25.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim that \"Don Colliver directed 25 episodes of this show out of 27\" is false because he actually directed all 27 episodes.\n\n**Relevant cells to verify the claim:**\n- All rows in the \"Directed By\" column are relevant since we need to check each episode's director.\n- The total number of rows (episodes) is also relevant.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Directed By\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
