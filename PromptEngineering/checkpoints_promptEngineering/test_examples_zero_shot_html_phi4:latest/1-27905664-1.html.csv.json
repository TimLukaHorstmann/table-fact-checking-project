From the table data at row index 55, we see that they are indeed listed among the writers for \"Immortality,\" along with Brad Anderson.\n\nAdditionally, the viewership number matches exactly (3.74 million).\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the information in the table. \n\nThe relevant cells from the table to verify this claim are:\n\n- The cell at row index 55 and column name \"Title\" for the episode title \"Immortality\".\n- The cell at row index 55 and column name \"Writer(s)\" to check the writers.\n- The cell at row index 55 and column name \"US Viewership (millions)\" for the viewership number.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting this evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 55, \"column_name\": \"Title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 55, \"column_name\": \"Writer(s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 55, \"column_name\": \"US Viewership (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

This matches our requirement for the director.\n\n- **Verifying Production Code**:\n  - In the same row (index 12), the production code is listed as 3x6113.
