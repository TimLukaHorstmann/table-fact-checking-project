    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"selhurst park be the venue for 2 game\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each row in the table and check how many times \"Selhurst Park\" appears in the \"venue\" column.\n\nHere's a step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **First Row**:\n   - Season: 1969 - 70 FA Cup\n   - Venue: Highbury (not Selhurst Park)\n\n2. **Second Row**:\n   - Season: 1970 - 71 FA Cup\n   - Venue: Selhurst Park (matches the claim, this is one occurrence)\n\n3. **Third Row**:\n   - Season: 1971 - 72 FA Cup\n   - Venue: St Andrew's (not Selhurst Park)\n\n4. **Fourth Row**:\n   - Season: 1972 - 73 FA Cup\n   - Venue: Highbury (not Selhurst Park)\n\n5. **Fifth Row**:\n   - Season: 1973 - 74 FA Cup\n   - Venue: Filbert Street (not Selhurst Park)\n\nUpon reviewing all the rows, \"Selhurst Park\" appears only once as a venue in the second row.\n\nSince \"Selhurst Park\" is mentioned as a venue for only one game and not two games as claimed, the statement is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cell to verify this claim is found in:\n- Row 1: Not Selhurst Park\n- **Row 2**: Selhurst Park (relevant)\n- Row 3: Not Selhurst Park\n- Row 4: Not Selhurst Park\n- Row 5: Not Selhurst Park\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
