    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"melbourne be 1 of the 3 team that play on august 26th, 1967,\" we need to determine how many teams played on August 26, 1967.\n\nThe table provides information about various matches, including:\n- Home and away teams for each match.\n- The date of each match.\n\nLet's break down the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Identify Matches by Date**: We need to find all matches that occurred on \"26 august 1967.\"\n2. **Count Teams Involved**: For each match on this date, identify both the home and away teams involved.\n\nNow, let's analyze the table:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Home Team: Geelong\n  - Away Team: Richmond\n  - Date: 26 August 1967\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Home Team: Footscray\n  - Away Team: North Melbourne\n  - Date: 26 August 1967\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Home Team: Carlton\n  - Away Team: South Melbourne\n  - Date: 26 August 1967\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Home Team: Hawthorn\n  - Away Team: Fitzroy\n  - Date: 26 August 1967\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Home Team: Melbourne\n  - Away Team: Essendon\n  - Date: 26 August 1967\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Home Team: St Kilda\n  - Away Team: Collingwood\n  - Date: 26 August 1967\n\nFrom this, we can see that there are six matches on August 26, 1967. Each match involves two teams (a home team and an away team).\n\nThus, the total number of unique teams playing on this date is:\n\n- Geelong, Richmond\n- Footscray, North Melbourne\n- Carlton, South Melbourne\n- Hawthorn, Fitzroy\n- Melbourne, Essendon\n- St Kilda, Collingwood\n\nThis results in 12 team participations across six matches. The claim suggests that only three teams played on this date, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are all rows with the date \"26 august 1967\" and both the home and away team columns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
