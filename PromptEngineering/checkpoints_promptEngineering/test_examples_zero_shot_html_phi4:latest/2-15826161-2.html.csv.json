    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Italy have 2 gold medals and 3 total medals,\" we need to check two specific pieces of information from the table for Italy:\n\n1. The number of gold medals.\n2. The total number of medals.\n\nWe will locate Italy's row in the table and examine the relevant columns: \"gold\" for gold medals and \"total\" for total medals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Locate Italy in the Table:**\n   - Italy is listed on two rows with a rank of 10, specifically:\n     - Row 10\n     - Row 11\n\n2. **Check Gold Medals for Italy:**\n   - Look at the \"gold\" column for both row indices (10 and 11).\n   - In both rows for Italy, the value in the \"gold\" column is `0`.\n\n3. **Check Total Medals for Italy:**\n   - Look at the \"total\" column for both row indices (10 and 11).\n   - In both rows for Italy, the value in the \"total\" column is `1`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Italy has 2 gold medals; however, the table shows they have 0.\n- The claim also states that Italy has a total of 3 medals; however, the table shows they have 1.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are incorrect based on the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nTo support this conclusion, we identify the relevant cells from the table:\n- Row index 10, column \"gold\"\n- Row index 11, column \"gold\"\n- Row index 10, column \"total\"\n- Row index 11, column \"total\"\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
