Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells to verify this information include:\n- Row index 3 (corresponding to the date \"13 march 1990\").\n- Columns for \"date\", \"opponent\", and \"result\".\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
