This corresponds to the seventh-to-last row in the table.\n\n3. **Check the Opponent for Game 63:**\n   - In this specific row, we need to verify the value under the \"opponent\" column.\n\n4. **Verification Process:**\n   - From the HTML table:\n     - Row index for game 63 is 11 (as it's zero-indexed).\n     - The opponent listed in that row is \"new york islanders.\"\n\n5. **Determine Claim Validity:**\n   - The claim states \"the new york islander be the opponent,\" which matches \"new york islanders\" (ignoring minor capitalization and plurality differences).\n\nSince all conditions match, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
