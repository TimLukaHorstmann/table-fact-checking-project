    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"the entrant team lotus have 0 point for the year 1963,\" we need to check two conditions in the table: whether the year is 1963 and if the points are indeed 0 for the corresponding entry.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant parts of the table:\n\n1. **Year Check**: We need an entry where the \"year\" column shows 1963.\n2. **Points Check**: For this specific year (1963), we must ensure that the \"points\" column is 0.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells in the table:\n\n- The first row of the table corresponds to the year 1963.\n- In this row:\n  - The \"year\" cell has a value of 1963.\n  - The \"entrant\" cell shows \"team lotus\".\n  - The \"points\" cell contains the value 0.\n\nBoth conditions match: the entry is for \"team lotus\" in the year 1963, and they have 0 points. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row of data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify these facts are:\n- Row index 0, Column name \"year\"\n- Row index 0, Column name \"entrant\"\n- Row index 0, Column name \"points\"\n\nGiven that both conditions (the year and points) match the claim, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
