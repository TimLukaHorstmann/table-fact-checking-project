    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table: specifically the \"opponent\" and \"november\" columns for each game entry.\n\nThe claim states:\n\"The atlanta flame be the opponent in a game sooner than the los angeles king be.\"\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify when Atlanta Flames are listed as opponents.\n2. Identify when Los Angeles Kings are listed as opponents.\n3. Compare the \"november\" column values for these two games to see which occurs first.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify Atlanta Flames game entry:**\n   - Look through the table and find the row where \"opponent\" is \"atlanta flames\".\n   - The relevant row is:\n     - Game 20, November 21\n     - Opponent: atlanta flames\n     - Score: 3 - 1\n     - Record: 14 - 5 - 1\n\n2. **Identify Los Angeles Kings game entries:**\n   - Look through the table and find rows where \"opponent\" is \"los angeles kings\".\n   - The relevant row(s) are:\n     - Game 16, November 12\n       - Opponent: los angeles kings\n       - Score: 5 - 1\n       - Record: 11 - 4 - 1\n     - Game 24, November 29\n       - Opponent: los angeles kings\n       - Score: 2 - 2\n       - Record: 15 - 7 - 2\n\n3. **Compare the \"november\" values:**\n   - Atlanta Flames: November 21 (Game 20)\n   - Los Angeles Kings: November 12 (Game 16) and November 29 (Game 24)\n\nFrom this comparison, we see that:\n- The first game against the Los Angeles Kings is on November 12.\n- The game against the Atlanta Flames is later, on November 21.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"the atlanta flame be the opponent in a game sooner than the los angeles king be\" is FALSE because the Los Angeles Kings are opponents earlier (November 12) compared to the Atlanta Flames (November 21).\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- For the game against Atlanta Flames:\n  - Row index: 9, Column name: \"opponent\"\n  - Row index: 9, Column name: \"november\"\n\n- For the first game against Los Angeles Kings:\n  - Row index: 5, Column name: \"opponent\"\n  - Row index: 5, Column name: \"november\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"november\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"november\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
