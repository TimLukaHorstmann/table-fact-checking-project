    "resp": "To verify the claim, we need to determine how many players from Canada and the United States were selected between picks 64 and 84 in this table. Specifically, we will count players based on their \"nationality\" column.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The relevant column for determining nationality is the \"nationality\" column.\n\n2. **Count Canadian Players:** Go through each row from picks 64 to 84 and count how many times the nationality is listed as \"Canada\".\n\n3. **Count US Players:** Similarly, count how many times the nationality is listed as \"United States\".\n\n4. **Compare Counts:** Finally, compare the counts for Canada and the United States.\n\nLet's perform these steps using the data provided in the table:\n\n- **Canadian Nationality Count:**\n  - Pick 65 (Brent Grieve)\n  - Pick 69 (Allain Roy)\n  - Pick 72 (Reid Simpson)\n  - Pick 73 (Jim Mckenzie)\n  - Pick 75 (J F Quintin)\n  - Pick 76 (Doug Macdonald)\n  - Pick 79 (Todd Nelson)\n  - Pick 80 (Jackson Penney)\n  - Pick 83 (Andre Racicot)\n\n  Total Canadian players: 9\n\n- **US Nationality Count:**\n  - Pick 64 (Mark Janssens - not US, but we're listing only those who are.)\n  - Pick 66 (Not listed, not relevant to this specific count)\n  - Pick 67 (Not listed, not relevant to this specific count)\n  - Pick 68 (Not listed, not relevant to this specific count)\n  - Pick 70 (Mark Janssens - again not US, correcting the listing mistake)\n  - Pick 71 (Not listed, not relevant to this specific count)\n  - Pick 74 (Not listed, not relevant to this specific count)\n  - Pick 77 (Doug Macdonald - already counted under Canada)\n  - Pick 81 (Jim Maher)\n  - Pick 82 (Trent Klatt)\n  - Pick 84 (Ryan O'Leary)\n\n  Total US players: 4\n\nNow, we compare the counts:\n- Canadian players = 9\n- US players = 4\n\nSince there are more Canadian players than US players in this range, the claim \"there be less canadian player than us player\" is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
