Specifically, we will examine the \"candidates\" column for each district listed and check if there are any women candidates.\n\nLet's review each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (North Carolina 2)**\n   - Candidates: Hutchins G. Burton (c - dr), Jesse A. Dawson\n     - No mention of a woman candidate.\n   \n2. **Row 1 (North Carolina 4)**\n   - Candidate: Richard Dobbs Spaight, Jr. (c - dr)\n     - Only one male candidate listed; no women candidates.\n\n3. **Row 2 (North Carolina 5)**\n   - Candidates: Charles Hooks (c - dr), John D. Jones\n     - Both are men; no mention of a woman candidate.\n   \n4. **Row 3 (North Carolina 6)**\n   - Candidate: Weldon N. Edwards (c - dr)\n     - Only one male candidate listed; no women candidates.\n\n5. **Row 4 (North Carolina 7)**\n   - Candidates: John Culpepper (a - f), Alexander McNeill\n     - Both are men; no mention of a woman candidate.\n   \n6. **Row 5 (North Carolina 9)**\n   - Candidate: Romulus M. Saunders (c - dr)\n     - Only one male candidate listed; no women candidates.\n\n7. **Row 6 (North Carolina 10)**\n   - Candidates: John Long (c - dr), John McClelland\n     - Both are men; no mention of a woman candidate.\n\nUpon reviewing the table, there is no mention or indication of any female candidates in any of the rows provided for the North Carolina U.S. House of Representatives election districts listed.
