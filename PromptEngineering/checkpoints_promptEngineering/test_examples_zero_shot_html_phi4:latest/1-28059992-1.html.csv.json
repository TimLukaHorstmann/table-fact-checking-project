    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"Jason Clemett was picked after the player Mark Farraway,\" we need to analyze the relevant rows from the table based on the pick order.\n\n1. Identify the row for Jason Clemett:\n   - From the table, Jason Clemett is associated with row 7, where `pick = 7`.\n\n2. Identify the row for Mark Farraway:\n   - From the table, Mark Farraway is associated with row 8, where `pick = 8`.\n\n3. Compare their pick numbers to determine the order:\n   - Jason Clemett's pick number (row 7) is 7.\n   - Mark Farraway's pick number (row 8) is 8.\n\n4. Assess the claim:\n   - The claim states that Jason Clemett was picked after Mark Farraway, which would mean his pick number should be greater than Mark Farraway\u2019s.\n   - However, since 7 < 8, Jason Clemett was actually picked before Mark Farraway.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this are:\n- The `pick` column in row 7 (Jason Clemett's pick number).\n- The `pick` column in row 8 (Mark Farraway's pick number).\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
