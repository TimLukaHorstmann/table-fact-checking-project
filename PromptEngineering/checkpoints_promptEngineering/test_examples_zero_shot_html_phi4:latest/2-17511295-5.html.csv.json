This is a home game for Philadelphia.\n- **Row 1 (December 4)**: Visitor is New Jersey, home is Philadelphia. Another home game.\n- **Row 2 (December 6)**: Philadelphia is the visitor, home is Carolina. Not a home game.\n- **Row 3 (December 9)**: Visitor is NY Islanders, home is Philadelphia. A home game.\n- **Row 4 (December 11)**: Visitor is Carolina, home is Philadelphia. Another home game.\n- **Row 5 (December 13)**: Visitor is Pittsburgh, home is Philadelphia. Home game again.\n- **Row 6 (December 16)**: Colorado is the visitor, home is Philadelphia. This is a home game.\n- **Row 7 (December 18)**: Philadelphia is the visitor, Montreal is the home. Not a home game for Philadelphia.\n- **Row 8 (December 20)**: Washington is the visitor, home is Philadelphia. A home game.\n- **Row 9 (December 21)**: Visitor is New Jersey, Philadelphia is the home team. Another home game.\n- **Row 10 (December 23)**: Ottawa is the visitor, home is Philadelphia. Home game.\n- **Row 11 (December 26)**: Philadelphia is the visitor, Chicago is the home. Not a home game for Philadelphia.\n- **Row 12 (December 27)**: Philadelphia is the visitor, Columbus is the home. Again not a home game for Philadelphia.\n- **Row 13 (December 30)**: Visitor is Vancouver, home is Philadelphia. This is a home game.\n\nNow, count all these identified home games:\n1. December 2\n2. December 4\n3. December 9\n4. December 11\n5. December 13\n6. December 16\n7. December 20\n8. December 21\n9. December 23\n10.
