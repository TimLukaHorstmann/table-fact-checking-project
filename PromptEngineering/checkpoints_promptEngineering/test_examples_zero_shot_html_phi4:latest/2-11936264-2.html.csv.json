    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"tie for lowest rank be municipal chorrillo and atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the relevant data from the table.\n\nThe claim suggests a tie at the lowest rank between two teams: \"municipal chorrillo\" and \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\". To verify this, we should consider the column that determines ranking in the context of sports leagues, which is typically the \"points (pts)\" column. Teams with fewer points generally have lower ranks.\n\nLet's extract and compare the relevant data:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows:**\n   - \"municipal chorrillo\" appears at row index 3.\n   - \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\" appears at row index 9.\n\n2. **Extract the 'points (pts)' values for these teams:**\n   - For \"municipal chorrillo\": 27 points\n   - For \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\": 11 points\n\n3. **Compare their ranks based on points:**\n   - \"municipal chorrillo\" has 27 points and is ranked 4th.\n   - \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\" has 11 points and is ranked 10th.\n\nSince the points are different, there is no tie for the lowest rank between these two teams. The team with the fewest points is clearly \"atl\u00e9tico verag\u00fcense\", making it the lowest-ranked team on its own.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points (pts)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
