    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify the following information from the table:\n\n**Claim:** The date of the week 3 game is October 9, 1960.\n\nWe will identify the relevant cells needed for this verification:\n\n1. **Week Number**: We are interested in row where `week` equals 3.\n2. **Date**: For that specific week (row with `week = 3`), we need to check if the `date` is \"October 9, 1960\".\n\n### Steps:\n\n- **Locate Week 3**:\n  - Find the row in which the `week` column has the value 3.\n\n- **Verify Date for Week 3**:\n  - Check the `date` value in that row to see if it is \"October 9, 1960\".\n\n### Relevant Data from Table:\n\n- Row with `week = 3`: This corresponds to the third row (considering zero-based indexing as per programming standards).\n- In this row (`row_index = 2`), check:\n  - Column `date` has the value \"October 9, 1960\".\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying this claim are thus:\n\n- Row index: 2\n- Column name: `week`\n- Row index: 2\n- Column name: `date`\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe table confirms that in week 3, the date is indeed October 9, 1960.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim \"October 9, 1960 be the date after week 3,\" we need to analyze the relevant cells in the provided table.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The phrase \"be the date after week 3\" suggests that October 9, 1960 should correspond to the game scheduled immediately following the one played during week 3.\n   \n2. **Checking Week 3**:\n   - Row with `week` value of 3: Check its `date`, which is \"October 9, 1960\".\n   - This matches with the date mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. **Identifying the Date after Week 3**:\n   - The row immediately following week 3 (i.e., week 4) should have a game on a date subsequent to October 9, 1960.\n   - Row with `week` value of 4: Check its `date`, which is \"October 16, 1960\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that October 9, 1960 \"be the date after week 3\", but in fact, it is the date for week 3 itself.\n   - Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 2 (index 2 as indexing starts from 0): The `date` column showing \"October 9, 1960\" confirms this is Week 3's date.\n   - Row 3 (index 3): The `date` column shows \"October 16, 1960\", which should be the date after week 3.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
