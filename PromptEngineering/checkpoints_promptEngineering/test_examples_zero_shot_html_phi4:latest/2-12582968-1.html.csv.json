    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"luk\u00e1\u0161 melich never throw for greater than 78 m\" is true or false, we need to examine the table's 'notes' column where distances in meters (m) are recorded.\n\nWe will inspect each row and look at the 'notes' field:\n\n1. **1998**: `61.51 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n2. **1999**: `64.20 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n3. **2001**: `66.41 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n4. **2003**: `71.26 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n5. **2005**: `74.53 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n6. **2006**: `73.77 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n7. **2008**: `70.56 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n8. **2009**: `74.47 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n9. **2012**: `77.17 m` - This is less than 78 m.\n10. **2013**: `79.36 m` - This is greater than 78 m.\n\nThe row from the year 2013 shows a throw of `79.36 m`, which exceeds 78 m, thus refuting the claim that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich never threw for greater than 78 meters.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.
