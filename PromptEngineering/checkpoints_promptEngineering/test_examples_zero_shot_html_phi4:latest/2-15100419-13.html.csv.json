    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify two conditions:\n\n1. Andrew Carnahan has the highest overall pick number of 252.\n2. Chad Nkang follows Andrew Carnahan with an overall pick number.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions based on the provided table data:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Andrew Carnahan's Overall Pick\n- Look for \"Andrew Carnahan\" in the \"name\" column and check his \"overall\" pick number.\n- In row index 10, we find:\n  - `row_index`: 10\n  - `column_name`: \"name\"\n  - `value`: \"andrew carnahan\"\n\n- Check the \"overall\" pick for Andrew Carnahan in the same row:\n  - `row_index`: 10\n  - `column_name`: \"overall\"\n  - `value`: 252\n\n### Step 2: Verify Chad Nkang's Overall Pick\n- Look for \"Chad Nkang\" in the \"name\" column and check his \"overall\" pick number.\n- In row index 9, we find:\n  - `row_index`: 9\n  - `column_name`: \"name\"\n  - `value`: \"chad nkang\"\n\n- Check the \"overall\" pick for Chad Nkang in the same row:\n  - `row_index`: 9\n  - `column_name`: \"overall\"\n  - `value`: 251\n\n### Step 3: Determine if Andrew Carnahan Has the Highest Overall Pick\n- Compare all entries in the \"overall\" column to see if any value is greater than 252.\n- The highest overall pick number listed in the table is indeed 252, which belongs to Andrew Carnahan.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Andrew Carnahan does have the highest overall pick of 252.\n- Chad Nkang follows with an overall pick of 251.\n\nBoth conditions of the claim are satisfied.

The phrase \"who be choose 229\" refers to an error or misinterpretation about Chad Nkang's overall pick number.\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step using the table data:\n\n### Step 1: Find Overall Pick Numbers\n\n- **Andrew Carnahan**: According to the table, Andrew Carnahan is listed in row with `overall` value of 252.\n  \n- **Chad Nkang**: According to the table, Chad Nkang is listed in a different row with `overall` value of 251.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Conditions\n\n1. **Condition:** \"Andrew Carnahan have the highest overall of more than Chad Nkang\"\n   - From our findings:\n     - Andrew Carnahan's overall pick number = 252\n     - Chad Nkang's overall pick number = 251\n  \n   - Clearly, 252 (Andrew Carnahan) is greater than 251 (Chad Nkang). This part of the claim is true.\n\n2. **Condition:** \"who be choose 229\"\n   - The phrase seems incorrect as it appears to confuse Chad Nkang with another player's overall pick number.\n   - According to the table, John Broussard has an `overall` value of 229, not Chad Nkang.\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is partially true based on the comparison but contains a factual error in stating Chad Nkang was chosen at 229.
