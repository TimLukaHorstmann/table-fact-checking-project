    "resp": "To verify the claim that \"2000 be the only year Rafael M\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition,\" we need to examine each row in the table and identify the instances where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal. We will also ensure that these goals were scored within the year 2000.\n\nHere are the steps to determine if the claim is true:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with More Than One Goal Scored:**\n   - A row indicates more than one goal scored by M\u00e1rquez if the number in the \"goal\" column is greater than 1.\n\n2. **Check the Year of Each Goal:**\n   - Extract the year from the \"date\" column for each relevant row and check if it matches with the year mentioned in the claim (2000).\n\n3. **Verify if 2000 is the Only Year with More Than One Goal Scored:**\n   - Ensure that no other year, apart from 2000, has any row where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal.\n\nNow, let's examine each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 1:** \n  - `goal`: 1 (Not more than 1)\n  \n- **Row 2:**\n  - `goal`: 2\n  - `date`: 13 February 2000\n  - Year: 2000\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - `goal`: 3\n  - `date`: 3 September 2000\n  - Year: 2000\n\n- **Row 4 to Row 12:** \n  - All have `goal` values of 1.\n\n- **Row 13:**\n  - `goal`: 1 (Not more than 1)\n\nFrom this analysis, we find:\n- In row 2 and row 3, Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in the year 2000.\n- No other rows indicate that he scored more than one goal in any other year.\n\nThus, the claim is true because 2000 is indeed the only year where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions according to this table.\n\nNow, let's provide the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Friendly matches do not count as international competitions for this purpose.\n\n2. **Result Condition**: Identify if Mexico lost the match (i.e., the result is in favor of the opposing team).\n\n3. **Rafael M\u00e1rquez's Goal Contribution**: Confirm that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in the game, which is indicated by \"goal\" column values greater than 0.\n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze each row:\n\n- **Row 1** (5 February 1999, Carlsberg Cup): Goal scored, Result: Win (3-0), Competition Type: International.  \n  - Not a loss.\n  \n- **Row 2** (13 February 2000, CONCACAF Gold Cup): Goal scored, Result: Win (4-0), Competition Type: International.  \n  - Not a loss.\n\n- **Row 3** (3 September 2000, World Cup Qualifier): Goal scored, Result: Win (7-1), Competition Type: International.\n  - Not a loss.\n  \n- **Row 4** (12 May 2002, Friendly): Goal scored, Result: Win (2-1), Competition Type: Friendly.  \n  - Not an international competition.\n\n- **Row 5** (24 July 2003, CONCACAF Gold Cup): Goal scored, Result: Win (2-0), Competition Type: International.\n  - Not a loss.\n\n- **Row 6** (19 June 2004, World Cup Qualifier): Goal scored, Result: Win (3-0), Competition Type: International.  \n  - Not a loss.\n\n- **Row 7** (7 September 2005, World Cup Qualifier): Goal scored, Result: Win (5-0), Competition Type: International.\n  - Not a loss.\n\n- **Row 8** (24 June 2006, FIFA World Cup): Goal scored, Result: Loss (1-2 AET), Competition Type: International.  \n  - This is the only instance where Mexico lost in an international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\n- **Rows 9 to 13**: Analyze these for similar conditions.\n  - Row 9: Friendly, not an international competition.\n  - Row 10: World Cup Qualifier, Result: Win (2-1), Goal scored.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 times in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal,\" we need to analyze each row in the table where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal and determine whether Mexico lost or did not lose in those instances. Here's how we do it:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim specifies two scenarios:\n   - Mexico plays an international competition (not \"friendly\").\n   - Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\n   - Out of these occurrences, Mexico loses once and does not lose (win or draw) in one other occurrence.\n\n2. **Relevant Columns**:\n   - `score`: to confirm Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored.\n   - `result`: to determine if Mexico won, lost, or drew the match.\n   - `competition`: to differentiate between international competitions and friendlies.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Row**:\n\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - Goal: Yes (1)\n     - Result: 3-0\n     - Competition: 1999 Carlsberg Cup\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n   \n   - **Row 1**:\n     - Goal: Yes (2)\n     - Result: 4-0\n     - Competition: 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Goal: Yes (3)\n     - Result: 7-1\n     - Competition: 2002 World Cup Qualifier\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n   \n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Goal: Yes (4)\n     - Result: 2-1\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - Not relevant since it is a friendly match.\n\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Goal: Yes (5)\n     - Result: 2-0\n     - Competition: 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n   \n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Goal: Yes (6)\n     - Result: 3-0\n     - Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualifier\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n\n   - **Row 6**: \n     - Goal: Yes (7)\n     - Result: 5-0\n     - Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualifier\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n   \n   - **Row 7**:\n     - Goal: Yes (8)\n     - Result: 1-2 (AET)\n     - Competition: 2006 FIFA World Cup\n     - Mexico lost the match.\n\n   - **Row 8**: \n     - Goal: Yes (9)\n     - Result: 4-2\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - Not relevant since it is a friendly match.\n   \n   - **Row 9**:\n     - Goal: Yes (10)\n     - Result: 2-1\n     - Competition: 2010 World Cup Qualifier\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n\n   - **Row 10**: \n     - Goal: Yes (11)\n     - Result: 1-1\n     - Competition: 2010 FIFA World Cup\n     - It's a draw, so Mexico did not lose.\n   \n   - **Row 11**:\n     - Goal: Yes (12)\n     - Result: 4-1\n     - Competition: 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n     - Mexico did not lose; they won.\n\n   - **Row 12**: \n     - Goal: Yes (13)\n     - Result: 4-2\n     - Competition: Friendly\n     - Not relevant since it is a friendly match.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - In international competitions where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored, we have two relevant instances of Mexico not winning in the context of the claim (Mexico lost only once in these instances).\n   - From rows 0 to 7 (considering competition types), there are three wins and one loss for Mexico. Row 7 is the single instance where they lost.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 times\" does not hold true since they did not lose in two different instances; instead, they won all but once.\n\nThe relevant cells that verify this analysis are from rows where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored and the match was an international competition (not a friendly). \n\nThus, the JSON representation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We are interested in the \"date\" and \"competition\" columns to verify if there are any entries for the years 2001, 2009, or 2012 where no goals were recorded.\n\nLet's examine each year:\n\n1. **Year 2001:**\n   - Look at the dates in the table: \n     - The closest entries around this time are from February 13, 2000 (\"goal\" number 2) and September 3, 2000 (\"goal\" number 3).\n   - No entry exists for any date within the year 2001.\n\n2. **Year 2009:**\n   - Check the dates in the table:\n     - The closest entries around this time are from March 28, 2007 (\"goal\" number 9) and September 10, 2008 (\"goal\" number 10).\n   - There is no entry for any date within the year 2009.\n\n3. **Year 2012:**\n   - Check the dates in the table:\n     - The closest entries around this time are from June 11, 2010 (\"goal\" number 11) and June 12, 2011 (\"goal\" number 12).\n   - There is no entry for any date within the year 2012.\n\nSince there are no entries for the years 2001, 2009, or 2012 in the table, it implies that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not participate in any recorded international competition (as per this data) in those years.
