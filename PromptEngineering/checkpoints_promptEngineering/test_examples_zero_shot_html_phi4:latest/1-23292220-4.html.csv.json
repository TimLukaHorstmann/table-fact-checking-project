Here is the relevant row extracted from the table for verification:\n\n- Row 6 (4x07):\n  - `episode`: 4x07\n  - `first broadcast`: 1 December 2006\n  - `seans team`: John Barrowman and Vic Reeves\n  - `daves team`: Chris Addison and Jade Goody\n  - `scores`: 4 - 6\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Score\n\nNext, we need to check if the score for this episode is \"4 - 6\".
