The goal is to identify if Bethlehem Steel FC achieved their highest ranking during the regular season in that particular year.\n\nSteps to verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to 1930**: From the table, locate the entry for the year \"1930\" where all relevant information can be found under different columns including \"division,\" \"league,\" and importantly, \"reg season.\"\n\n2. **Check the ranking in the \"reg season\" column for 1930**:\n   - For the row corresponding to the year 1930, the value in the \"reg season\" column is \"7th (spring).\"\n\n3. **Compare with other years' performances**:\n   - Examine all entries under the \"reg season\" column across different years to identify if there's any instance where Bethlehem Steel FC ranked higher than \"7th.\"\n   - The highest ranking noted in previous years are as follows:\n     - 1912/13: 1st\n     - 1913/14: 1st\n     - 1914/15: 1st\n     - 1918/19: 1st\n     - 1919/20: 1st\n     - 1920/21: 1st\n     - 1926/27: 1st\n   - These years indicate that Bethlehem Steel FC achieved a \"1st\" rank multiple times, which is superior to the \"7th\" rank in 1930.\n\n4. **Conclude based on comparison**:\n   - Since there are several years where Bethlehem Steel FC ranked higher (1st) than they did in 1930 (7th), it follows that 1930 was not the year of their best regular season performance.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.
