    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate each part of the claim against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Engine Type**: The claim mentions \"m47d20\". We should identify all rows with this engine type.\n\n2. **Year Condition**: The claim states that the engine was made before 1999. This means we are looking for years less than 1999.\n\n3. **Power Rating Condition**: The power rating specified in the claim is \"100 kw (134hp) 4000\". We need to find this exact power specification.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each row with the engine type \"m47d20\":\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Engine: m47d20\n  - Year: 1998\n  - Power: 100 kw (134hp) 4000\n\n  This row satisfies all conditions of the claim.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Engine: m47d20\n  - Year: 2001\n  - Power: 85 kw (114hp) 4000\n\n  This row does not satisfy the year condition or the power condition.\n\nSince there is at least one row that satisfies all conditions of the claim, the statement \"the m47d20 engine be make before 1999 and have a power rating of 100 kw (134hp) 4000\" is true.

We will check if there are any rows where the engine is \"m47tu2d20\" and the year is 2004.\n\n3. **Power Specification**: The claim mentions a power of \"90 kw (121hp) 4000.\" We need to verify that for entries with \"m47tu2d20\" from the year 2004, there is a row where the power matches this specification.\n\nNow, let's examine the table:\n\n- **Rows with Engine \"m47tu2d20\":**\n  - Row 7: Year = 2004, Power = 90 kw (121hp) 4000\n  - Row 8: Year = 2005, Power = 90 kw (121hp) 4000\n  - Row 9: Year = 2004, Power = 120 kw (161hp) 4000\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- **Relevant Rows for \"m47tu2d20\" and Year 2004**:\n  - Row 7: Matches both the engine type and year.
