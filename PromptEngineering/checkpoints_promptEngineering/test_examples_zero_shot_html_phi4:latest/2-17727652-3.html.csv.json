    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts from the table:\n\n1. Whether there is a match at the \"Marco Island\" tournament where the outcome was \"runner-up\".\n2. If so, whether the score for this match was \"6 - 3, 0 - 6, 4 - 6\".\n\nLet's go through each relevant condition based on the provided table:\n\n- The claim specifies that the event happened at \"Marco Island\". We will look for a row where the \"tournament\" column matches \"marco island\".\n  \n- Next, we need to check if the \"outcome\" for this specific tournament is listed as \"runner-up\".\n\n- Finally, verify that the score of the match was recorded as \"6 - 3, 0 - 6, 4 - 6\".\n\nBy examining the table:\n\n1. The fifth row corresponds to a match at the \"Marco Island\" tournament.\n2. In this same row (index 4), the outcome is indeed listed as \"runner-up\".\n3. Additionally, the score in that row is given as \"6 - 3, 0 - 6, 4 - 6\".\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in row 4:\n\n- Tournament: Marco Island\n- Outcome: Runner-up\n- Score: 6 - 3, 0 - 6, 4 - 6\n\nThus, all relevant parts of the claim are true according to the table.\n\nHere is the JSON output indicating that the claim is TRUE and listing the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's carefully examine each condition in the claim against the table:\n\n1. **Tournament Location**: The claim states \"marco island\". We need to find a row where the tournament is held on Marco Island.\n\n2. **Date**: According to the claim, this event occurs on November 7, 1983. We need to check if there's an entry with this date for the Marco Island tournament.\n\n3. **Surface**: The claim specifies that the surface is \"clay\". We must ensure that the corresponding row has \"clay\" listed as the surface.\n\n4. **Score**: Finally, the claimed score is 6 - 4, 6 - 3. This needs to match exactly with what's recorded in the table for that event.\n\nNow let's examine the table:\n\n- The tournament on Marco Island is found in row index 4:\n  - \"outcome\": runner-up\n  - \"date\": January 23, 1984 (not November 7, 1983)\n  - \"tournament\": Marco Island\n  - \"surface\": clay\n  - \"opponent\": Bonnie Gadusek\n  - \"score\": 6 - 3, 0 - 6, 4 - 6\n\n- There is no tournament listed on Marco Island with the date November 7, 1983. Instead, that date corresponds to a tournament in Honolulu (row index 3):\n  - \"outcome\": winner\n  - \"date\": November 7, 1983\n  - \"tournament\": Honolulu\n  - \"surface\": carpet (i)\n  - \"opponent\": Carling Bassett\n  - \"score\": 4 - 6, 6 - 2, 7 - 6 (1)\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- The tournament location is correct (Marco Island), but the date and surface do not match.\n- There is no entry for a Marco Island tournament on November 7, 1983, with clay as the surface.\n\nTherefore, the claim does not hold true according to the table. Relevant cells from the table include:\n\n1. Row index 4: This row contains information about the Marco Island tournament but has an incorrect date.\n2. Row index 3: This row corresponds to a tournament on November 7, 1983, but it's for Honolulu with a carpet surface.\n\nThe JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
