    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"on july 29, sk brann host the champion league (q)\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine specific details about the match on July 29.\n\n1. **Date Verification**:\n   - The row with the date \"July 29\" must be identified.\n   - According to the table, this corresponds to `row_index: 11`.\n\n2. **Home Team Verification**:\n   - We need to check which team is listed as the home team for that date.\n   - For `row_index: 11`, the \"Home Team\" column indicates \"sk brann,\" confirming they are hosting.\n\n3. **Competition Verification**:\n   - Next, verify what competition is being played on this date.\n   - The table shows that for `row_index: 11`, the \"Competition\" column lists \"uefa cup.\"\n\n4. **Claim Analysis**:\n   - The claim specifies the \"champion league (q)\" as the competition, whereas the actual competition from the table is \"uefa cup.\"\n   - Therefore, the competition part of the claim does not match.\n\nConsidering these steps, the relevant cells are:\n- `row_index: 11`, column \"Date\" for confirming the date.\n- `row_index: 11`, column \"Home Team\" to confirm sk brann as the host.\n- `row_index: 11`, column \"Competition\" to compare with the claim.\n\nThus, based on the data from the table, the claim is false because it incorrectly names the competition.

In row index 5, the location matches as \"brann stadion, bergen\".\n\n4. **Home/Away Status**:\n   - Since \"sk brann\" is listed first in the table on July 29 (indicating they are the home team), \"fk ventspils\" must be playing away.\n\nThe claim states that \"fk ventspils play as a visitor team against sk brann at the Brann stadion, Bergen\", which aligns perfectly with the information found in row index 5 of the table.

    "resp": "To verify the claim \"champion league (q) be the tournament on april 21 host by stab\u00e6k,\" we need to examine several components of the statement and compare them against the data in the table:\n\n1. **Tournament Name:** The claim mentions \"champion league (q),\" which seems to be a typographical error or misunderstanding. The correct term should likely be \"Champions League\" or, as it appears in the table, \"Champions League (q)\" for qualifying rounds.\n\n2. **Date of Event:** The claim specifies that this event occurred on April 21. We need to find an entry in the table with a date matching April 21.\n\n3. **Opponent Team:** The claim states that the opponent is \"stab\u00e6k.\" We will check if stab\u00e6k is listed as the opponent for any match on April 21.\n\n4. **Verification Steps:**\n\n   - Look at the column labeled \"Date\" to find an entry for April 21.\n   - Check the corresponding row for the tournament name in the \"Tournament\" column to see if it matches \"Champions League (q)\" or another similar qualifying round designation.\n   - Verify that \"stab\u00e6k\" is listed as the opponent in the \"Opponent\" column for this date.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Row with Date April 21:**\n  - The entry on April 21 lists the tournament as \"Champions League (q).\"\n  - The opponent listed is \"stab\u00e6k.\"\n\nThis information fully supports the claim. Therefore, the relevant cells are those from the row where:\n- The date is April 21.\n- The tournament name includes \"Champions League (q).\"\n- The opponent is stab\u00e6k.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
