The time of this match was 2:00 PM.\n\nLet's examine these one by one using the data provided in the HTML table:\n\n### Step-by-step Verification\n\n**Condition 1: Match Involving Geelong and West Coast**\n\n- From the table, we find that there is a row with:\n  - Home team: \"geelong\"\n  - Away team: \"west coast\"\n\nThis condition is satisfied.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Condition 1:**\n- Row index 1, column name \"home team\"\n- Row index 1, column name \"away team\"\n\n**Condition 2: Ground Being Football Park**\n\n- For the same row (Row index 1), the ground listed is:\n  - Ground: \"waverley park\"\n\nThis condition is not satisfied as it specifies \"Waverley Park\" instead of \"Football Park\".\n\n**Relevant Cells for Condition 2:**\n- Row index 1, column name \"ground\"\n\n**Condition 3: Time Being 2:00 PM**\n\n- For the same row (Row index 1), the time listed is:\n  - Time: \"8:00 pm\"\n\nThis condition is not satisfied as it specifies \"8:00 pm\" instead of \"2:00 pm\".\n\n**Relevant Cells for Condition 3:**\n- Row index 1, column name \"time\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the game between Geelong and West Coast was at Football Park at 2:00 PM. However, based on our examination:\n\n- The match did occur between Geelong and West Coast (satisfied).\n- The ground was Waverley Park, not Football Park (not satisfied).\n- The time of the match was 8:00 PM, not 2:00 PM (not satisfied).\n\nSince two conditions were not met, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ground\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We need the game involving West Coast as away team on this date.\n\n3. **Venue**: The claim states \"in waverley park\".
