Checking if \"south sydney rabbitohs\" are the premiers:\n- We need to locate the row where the \"premiers\" column matches \"south sydney rabbitohs.\"\n- In the table, this is found in the first row (index 0), under the \"premiers\" column.\n\n#### 2. Checking if the event is the \"1951 nswrfl grand final\":\n- We need to verify that the same row has a matching event description.\n- Again, in the first row (index 0), the \"details\" column contains \"1951 nswrfl grand final.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied in the first row of the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo support this conclusion, we focus on the following relevant cells:\n- The cell at `row_index` 0, `column_name` \"premiers\" for verifying the winning team.\n- The cell at `row_index` 0, `column_name` \"details\" to confirm the event year and competition.\n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"premiers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"details\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
