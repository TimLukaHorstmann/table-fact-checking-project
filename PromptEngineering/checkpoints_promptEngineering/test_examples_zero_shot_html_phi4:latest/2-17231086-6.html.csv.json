    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"there be a total of 5 country represent by the player,\" we must examine the \"country\" column in the provided table. The goal is to identify how many distinct countries are represented among the players listed.\n\nHere's an analysis of each row relevant to the \"country\" column:\n\n1. Row 0: Curtis Strange from United States\n2. Row 1: Chip Beck from United States\n3. Row 2: Mark McCumber from United States\n4. Row 3: Ian Woosnam from Wales\n5. Row 4: Brian Claar from United States\n6. Row 5: Masashi Ozaki from Japan\n7. Row 6: Scott Simpson from United States\n8. Row 7: Peter Jacobsen from United States\n9. Row 8: Paul Azinger from United States\n10. Row 9: Hubert Green from United States\n11. Row 10: Tom Kite from United States\n12. Row 11: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal from Spain\n\nNow, let's list the distinct countries represented:\n\n- United States (appears multiple times)\n- Wales\n- Japan\n- Spain\n\nCounting these unique entries gives us a total of four distinct countries.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are five countries represented is false. There are only four different countries listed in the table.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the most amount of money won by someone from Wales be 46823.\"\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We are looking for players who are from \"Wales.\"\n   - We are interested in their associated \"money\" winnings.\n\n2. **Extract Data Related to the Claim**:\n   - From the table, we identify that there is one player from Wales: Ian Woosnam.\n   - The row corresponding to Ian Woosnam shows:\n     - Place: t2\n     - Player: Ian Woosnam\n     - Country: Wales\n     - Money: 67823\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the most amount of money won by someone from Wales is 46823.\n   - From the table, we see that Ian Woosnam (from Wales) has won 67823.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The actual highest amount of money won by a player from Wales in this dataset is 67823, not 46823 as stated in the claim.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant row for verifying this claim is the one corresponding to Ian Woosnam.\n   - The relevant cells are those under \"country\" and \"money.\"\n\n6. **Row Indexing**:\n   - Assuming the first row of data (not headers) has an index of 0, Ian Woosnam's data starts at row index 3.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
