    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Gillingham's game on January 21, 1982, we need to carefully analyze the provided table for relevant information.\n\nThe claim states: \"the score in gillingham's home game on 21 january 1982 be 0 - 1.\" Let\u2019s break down the components of this claim:\n\n1. **Team**: The team mentioned is Gillingham.\n2. **Type of Match**: It specifies a \"home game.\"\n3. **Date**: The date specified is January 21, 1982.\n4. **Score**: The score mentioned is \"0 - 1.\"\n\nNow let's go through the table to verify these details:\n\n- We first look for Gillingham in the \"home team\" column since the claim refers to a home game.\n  \n- Upon checking each row:\n  - Row with `tie no` = 4: Gillingham is indeed listed as the \"home team.\"\n  - The score recorded for this match is \"0 - 1,\" which matches the claim's specified score.\n  - However, the date of the match listed in this row is \"23 January 1982,\" not \"21 January 1982\" as stated in the claim.\n\nSince there is no entry for a game involving Gillingham on January 21, 1982, and the only recorded home game for them occurred on January 23, 1982, the date mentioned in the claim does not match any entry. Therefore, we can conclude that the claim about the score of \"0 - 1\" in a Gillingham home game on January 21, 1982, is false.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table used to verify this:\n\n- Row with `tie no` = 4:\n  - Column \"home team\": Contains \"gillingham.\"\n  - Column \"score\": Contains \"0 - 1.\"\n  - Column \"date\": Contains \"23 january 1982.\"\n\nBased on these findings, we conclude the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding tie number 17 and Huddersfield Town as the home team in this table, we need to examine relevant entries in the \"tie no\" column and the \"home team\" column.\n\nThe structure of each row in the table is defined by these columns: \n- \"tie no\"\n- \"home team\"\n- \"score\"\n- \"away team\"\n- \"date\"\n\nOur focus will be on verifying if there exists any instance where:\n1. The value in the \"tie no\" column is 17.\n2. The corresponding entry in the \"home team\" column is Huddersfield Town.\n\nLet's examine relevant parts of the table:\n\n- Row indices for each tie are as follows, with focus on identifying when tie numbers change and what they are:\n  - Row 0: Tie No = 1\n  - Rows 1 & 2: Both labeled \"replay\" (not a sequential number)\n  - Row 3: Tie No = 2\n  - Continue through this process up to the last numbered tie.\n\nUpon examining each row, we find:\n- The highest tie number listed in the table is 16, associated with Hereford United vs. Leicester City on January 23, 1982 (Row index 15).\n- There are no rows explicitly labeled with a \"tie no\" of 17.\n- Therefore, there's no match for a tie number of 17.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The claim that \"17 be the tie no of the game that home team Huddersfield Town play\" is false because there is no such entry in the table where tie number is 17. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify are those under the \"tie no\" and \"home team\" columns, specifically checking all rows for a match with these criteria:\n\n- Row index: 15 (corresponding to \"tie no\": 16, which shows Huddersfield Town as an away team in tie 15)\n- No row with \"tie no\": 17.\n\nThus, the JSON object providing this answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
