We must confirm that the result was indeed a \"loss.\"\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- First, we locate the row with the date \"nov 25\" in the table. This corresponds to row index 12 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\n- Next, we check the opponent for this game. In row index 12, under the \"opponent\" column, it states \"cincinnati bengals.\"\n\n- Finally, we verify the result of the game. In row index 12, under the \"result\" column, it is listed as \"loss.\"\n\nAll parts of the claim match the data in the table:\n\n- Date: \"nov 25\"\n- Opponent: \"cincinnati bengals\"\n- Result: \"loss\"\n\nThus, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"oct 22 be the date the streak be lose at 7,\" we need to verify two parts of the statement based on the table provided:\n\n1. **Date Verification**: Confirm that October 22 is indeed a game date in the dataset.\n2. **Streak Verification**: Check if the loss streak on this date was indeed seven games long.\n\n**Step-by-step Evaluation:**\n\n- **Locate October 22 Date in Table:**  \n  We search the \"date\" column for \"oct 22.\" According to the table, row index 7 contains \"oct 22.\"\n\n- **Check Result and Streak on October 22:**  \n  - From row index 7, check the \"result\" column which shows \"loss,\" confirming that a loss occurred.\n  - Next, verify the \"streak\" column in row index 7. It indicates \"lost 2,\" meaning this game continued a losing streak but did not start it at seven.\n\nSince the \"streak\" value is \"lost 2,\" October 22 was not when the streak reached seven losses; instead, it had been ongoing for two games (including the game on October 22 itself). Therefore, the claim that the streak was lost at seven on this date is false. The relevant cells to verify these parts of the claim are:\n\n- Date (\"date\" column) from row index 7.\n- Result and Streak (\"result\" and \"streak\" columns) from row index 7.\n\nConsequently, the final answer is that the claim is false, as verified by the relevant table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"streak\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
