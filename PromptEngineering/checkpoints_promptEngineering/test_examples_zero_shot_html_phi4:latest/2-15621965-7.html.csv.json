    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we must examine two main aspects of the claim:\n\n1. **Duration of Pat Garrity's time with Orlando Magic**: The claim states that Pat Garrity was with the Orlando Magic for a span of 10 years.\n\n2. **Comparison to other players' tenures**: The claim asserts that no other player had a longer period with Orlando Magic than Pat Garrity did.\n\nLet us evaluate these aspects against the provided table data:\n\n1. **Pat Garrity's Duration**: According to row index 2 (third row in the table), Pat Garrity played from \"1999 - 2008\", which indeed spans 10 years (from 1999 to 2008 inclusive).\n\n2. **Comparison with Other Players**:\n   - Reece Gaines: Played for 2 years (\"2003 - 2004\").\n   - Kiwane Garris: Played for 2 years (\"1999 - 2000\").\n   - Chris Gatling: Played for 2 years (\"1999 - 2000\").\n   - Gordan Giri\u010dek: Played for 2 years (\"2003 - 2004\").\n   - Drew Gooden: Played for 2 years (\"2003 - 2004\").\n   - Marcin Gortat: Played for 4 years (\"2007 - 2010\").\n   - Horace Grant: First entry played from \"1994 - 1999\", which is a span of 6 years. His second entry shows he played again from \"2001 - 2003\", another period of 3 years, totaling 9 years across both spans.\n   - Litterial Green: Played for 3 years (\"1992 - 1994\").\n   - Sidney Green: Played for 2 years (\"1989 - 1990\").\n\nFrom the comparison above, Pat Garrity's tenure of 10 years is indeed the longest among all players listed in the table.\n\nWith this analysis, the claim that \"Pat Garrity have be with Orlando Magic for the longest period of time span 10 year\" is TRUE. The relevant cells from the table to confirm this are:\n\n- Row index 2 (for Pat Garrity's years), column \"years in orlando\"\n- Each row's \"years in orlando\" columns, as they were all necessary to verify that no other player had a longer span than Pat Garrity.\n\nThus, the JSON response would be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
