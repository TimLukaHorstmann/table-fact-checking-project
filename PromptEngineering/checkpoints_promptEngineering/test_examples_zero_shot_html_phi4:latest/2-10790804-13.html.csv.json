The relevant scores can be found in the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns.\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:**\n   - Home Team Score: 17.20 (122) \u2192 122 points\n   - Away Team Score: 12.8 (80) \u2192 80 points\n\n2. **Row 1:**\n   - Home Team Score: 13.13 (91) \u2192 91 points\n   - Away Team Score: 12.13 (85) \u2192 85 points\n\n3. **Row 2:**\n   - Home Team Score: 14.19 (103) \u2192 103 points\n   - Away Team Score: 13.11 (89) \u2192 89 points\n\n4. **Row 3:**\n   - Home Team Score: 13.13 (91) \u2192 91 points\n   - Away Team Score: 8.21 (69) \u2192 69 points\n\n5. **Row 4:**\n   - Home Team Score: 11.14 (80) \u2192 80 points\n   - Away Team Score: 14.12 (96) \u2192 96 points\n\n6. **Row 5:**\n   - Home Team Score: 8.11 (59) \u2192 59 points\n   - Away Team Score: 17.16 (118) \u2192 118 points\n\nUpon reviewing the scores, we find that in rows 3 and 5, one of the teams scored below 10 goals:\n- Row 3: Footscray scored 8.21 (69), which is equivalent to 8 goals.\n- Row 5: Essendon scored 8.11 (59), which is equivalent to 8 goals.\n\nThus, the claim that none of them scored below 10 points is false.\n\nRelevant cells are those containing scores from all rows in both \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
