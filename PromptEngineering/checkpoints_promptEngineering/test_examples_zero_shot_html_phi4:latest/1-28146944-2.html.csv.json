Locate the row with \"no in series\" = 36.\n   - Row index 15 has \"no in series\" = 36 (indexing starts at 0).\n\n2. Check the corresponding title for this row:\n   - The \"title\" column of row index 15 reads: \"good times at pupu goodtimes\".\n\n3. Compare the table's title with the claim:\n   - The claim states \"Good Time At Pupu Goodtimes\", but from the table, it is noted as \"good times at pupu goodtimes\".\n   - Note that there's a slight difference in wording: the claimed title uses \"Time\" while the table has \"Times\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the titles do not match exactly due to the discrepancy (\"Time\" vs. \"Times\").
