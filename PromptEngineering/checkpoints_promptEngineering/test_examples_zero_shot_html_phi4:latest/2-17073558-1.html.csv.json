The relevant row for 2007 must be identified to check both conditions:\n\n- **Row for the year 2007** (4th index, as indexing starts from 0):\n  - `year`: 2007\n  - `regional gva`: 9432\n  - `agriculture`: 11\n  - `industry`: 1565\n  - `services`: 7856\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Regional GVA in 2007**:\n   - The table entry for 'year' = 2007 shows 'regional gva' as 9432, which matches the claim.\n\n2. **Industry value in 2007**:\n   - The table entry for 'year' = 2007 lists 'industry' as 1565, also matching the claim.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in the table, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe cells relevant to verifying this claim are located at row index 4 (0-based indexing) for columns 'regional gva' and 'industry'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"regional gva\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"industry\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
