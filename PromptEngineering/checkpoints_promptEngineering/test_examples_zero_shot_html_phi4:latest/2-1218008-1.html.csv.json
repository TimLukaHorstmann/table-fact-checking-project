    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the Milwaukee Brewers' performance at County Stadium during the 1982 World Series, we need to assess specific details from the table.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n1. **Location of Games**: We must identify which games were played at \"county stadium\" and determine if they were won by the Milwaukee Brewers.\n2. **Outcome of the Games**: For each game at County Stadium, check whether the Milwaukee Brewers won or lost based on the score.\n\n### Relevant Information from the Table:\n- The table provides information about seven games between the Milwaukee Brewers and the St. Louis Cardinals, including scores, locations, and other details.\n\n#### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Games Played at County Stadium**:\n   - **Row 3**: Date \"October 15\", Location \"county stadium\".\n     - Score: \"St. Louis Cardinals - 6 , Milwaukee Brewers - 2\"\n     - Outcome: Milwaukee Brewers lost.\n   \n   - **Row 4**: Date \"October 16\", Location \"county stadium\".\n     - Score: \"St. Louis Cardinals - 5 , Milwaukee Brewers - 7\"\n     - Outcome: Milwaukee Brewers won.\n\n   - **Row 5**: Date \"October 17\", Location \"county stadium\".\n     - Score: \"St. Louis Cardinals - 4 , Milwaukee Brewers - 6\"\n     - Outcome: Milwaukee Brewers won.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the Milwaukee Brewers won all games at County Stadium.\n   - From our analysis, they lost one game (on October 15) and won two games (on October 16 and October 17).\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because they did not win all games at County Stadium.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 3**: Score column (\"St. Louis Cardinals - 6 , Milwaukee Brewers - 2\"), Location column (\"county stadium\").\n- **Row 4**: Score column (\"St. Louis Cardinals - 5 , Milwaukee Brewers - 7\"), Location column (\"county stadium\").\n- **Row 5**: Score column (\"St. Louis Cardinals - 4 , Milwaukee Brewers - 6\"), Location column (\"county stadium\").\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the st louis cardinal score in all their match,\" we need to determine if there is consistent information regarding the St. Louis Cardinals' scores across all matches listed in the table.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what needs to be checked:\n\n1. **Extracting Relevant Data**: For each game, extract the score where it mentions \"St. Louis Cardinals\" and record their score from that particular match.\n\n2. **Checking Consistency**:\n   - We need to verify if there is any variation in the scores recorded for St. Louis Cardinals across all games.\n   - The claim suggests a uniformity or consistency in scoring, which we must confirm.\n\nLet's examine each row where the scores are listed:\n\n- **Row 1 (Game 1)**: \"milwaukee brewers - 10 , st louis cardinals - 0\"\n  - St. Louis Cardinals score: 0\n\n- **Row 2 (Game 2)**: \"milwaukee brewers - 4 , st louis cardinals - 5\"\n  - St. Louis Cardinals score: 5\n\n- **Row 3 (Game 3)**: \"st louis cardinals - 6 , milwaukee brewers - 2\"\n  - St. Louis Cardinals score: 6\n\n- **Row 4 (Game 4)**: \"st louis cardinals - 5 , milwaukee brewers - 7\"\n  - St. Louis Cardinals score: 5\n\n- **Row 5 (Game 5)**: \"st louis cardinals - 4 , milwaukee brewers - 6\"\n  - St. Louis Cardinals score: 4\n\n- **Row 6 (Game 6)**: \"milwaukee brewers - 1 , st louis cardinals - 13\"\n  - St. Louis Cardinals score: 13\n\n- **Row 7 (Game 7)**: \"milwaukee brewers - 3 , st louis cardinals - 6\"\n  - St. Louis Cardinals score: 6\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The scores for the St. Louis Cardinals across the seven games are: 0, 5, 6, 5, 4, 13, and 6.\n- These scores are not uniform; they vary from game to game.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim that \"the st louis cardinal score in all their match\" implies consistency or a specific pattern which is not present.
