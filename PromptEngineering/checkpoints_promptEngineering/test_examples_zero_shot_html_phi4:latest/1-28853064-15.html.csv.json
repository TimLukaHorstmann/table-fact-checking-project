    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"sergio luis henao be give the general classification award and the point classification award\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table data related to \"general classification\" and \"points classification.\" Specifically, we will look for instances where \"Sergio Luis Henao\" has been awarded in these categories.\n\n1. **General Classification**:\n   - We need to find rows where \"sergio luis henao\" is listed under the \"general classification\" column.\n   \n2. **Points Classification**:\n   - Similarly, we will check for rows where \"sergio luis henao\" is noted in the \"points classification\" column.\n\nNow, let's examine the table data to find these occurrences:\n\n- Row 1: \n  - General Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n  - Points Classification: No award\n\n- Row 9:\n  - General Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n  - Points Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n\n- Row 10:\n  - General Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n  - Points Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n  \n- Row 11:\n  - General Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n  - Points Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n\n- Row 12:\n  - General Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n  - Points Classification: Sergio Luis Henao\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that \"sergio luis henao\" is indeed given both the general classification award and the points classification award in rows 9, 10, 11, and 12. Therefore, the claim is supported by these instances.\n\nThe relevant cells for this verification are:\n\n- General Classification: Rows 1, 9, 10, 11, 12\n- Points Classification: Rows 9, 10, 11, 12\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.

Oscar Solis receives the points classification award.\n2. EP:UNE receives the sprints classification award.\n\nThe table contains several columns indicating various classifications and winners for each stage. The key relevant column here is \"winner,\" as it shows who wins each stage. We also need to check other related classifications that could change under these hypothetical conditions, specifically the points classification (\"points classification\") and sprints classification (\"sprints classification\").\n\nLet's break down the claim step by step:\n\n1. **Identify when Freddy Gonzalez won a stage:** \n   - According to the table, Freddy Gonzalez is listed as the winner for stage 7.\n\n2. **Check the conditions at stage 7:**\n   - Current points classification winner at stage 7 is Oscar Sevilla.\n   - Current sprints classification winner at stage 7 is Julian Lopez.\n\n3. **Apply hypothetical changes to these classifications at stage 7:**\n   - Change points classification winner to Oscar Solis (as per the claim).\n   - Change sprints classification winner to EP:UNE (as per the claim).\n\n4. **Determine if Freddy Gonzalez remains the winner after applying these conditions:**\n   - The table's \"winner\" column does not depend on changes in other classifications like points or sprints; it is already set independently for each stage.\n   - Therefore, even with hypothetical adjustments to other classification winners at this stage, Freddy Gonzalez remains listed as the winner of stage 7.\n\nNow let\u2019s identify and list the relevant cells:\n\n- For the row where Freddy Gonzalez wins (stage 7), check:\n  - \"winner\" column to see if he is listed.\n  - \"points classification\" column to verify current and hypothetical changes.\n  - \"sprints classification\" column for current and hypothetical changes.\n\nThe relevant cells are as follows:\n\n- **Row index 6** (Stage 7):\n  - Column: \"winner\" (Freddy Gonzalez)\n  - Column: \"points classification\" (Oscar Sevilla, change to Oscar Solis hypothetically)\n  - Column: \"sprints classification\" (Julian Lopez, change to EP:UNE hypothetically)\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points classification\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"sprints classification\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
