The row where the role contains \"geoffrey fitton\".\n2. In that row, check if the number of performances listed in the \"performances\" column matches 44.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- **Row Identification**: We look for a row in which the \"role\" column specifies \"geoffrey fitton\". According to the table, this appears in the fifth row (considering a zero-based index).\n\n- **Performance Verification**: Once we have identified the correct row, we check the \"performances\" column of that same row. In the fifth row, it lists 44 performances.\n\nBoth conditions from the claim are satisfied by this row: \n\n1. The role is \"geoffrey fitton\".\n2. There are 44 performances.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this information are in the following row and columns:\n\n- Row index 4 (zero-based indexing) for both the \"role\" column (\"geoffrey fitron\") and the \"performances\" column (44).\n\nThus, the JSON object representing our conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"role\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"performances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Specifically, this involves identifying any entries associated with the role \"Geoffrey Fitton\" and checking their corresponding number of performances.\n\n**Step-by-step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Role:** \n   - Look through the \"role\" column in the table for the entry \"Geoffrey Fitton.\" This is found in row index 4.\n   \n2. **Check Performances for Geoffrey Fitton:**\n   - In row index 4, the number of performances listed is 44.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:** \n   - The claim suggests that the maximum number of performances for \"Geoffrey Fitton\" should be 8.
