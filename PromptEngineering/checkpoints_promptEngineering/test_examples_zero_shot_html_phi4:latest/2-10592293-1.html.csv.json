Thus, the claim that Tom Gullikson and Butch Walts were opponents on August 8, 1980, is false.\n\nNow, let's specify which cell supports our conclusion:\n\n- The relevant row for the date \"8 August 1980\" is the second last row in the table.\n- Within this row, we are particularly interested in the column that lists the opponent names.
