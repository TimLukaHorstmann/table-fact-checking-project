However, we can use the total number of games and the win percentage to calculate the number of ties for each coach using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ties} = \\text{Games Played} - (\\text{Wins} + \\text{Losses}) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Wins can be calculated as \\( \\text{Wins} = \\text{Games Played} \\times \\frac{\\text{Win \\%}}{100} \\)\n- Losses can be derived from: \\( \\text{Losses} = \\text{Games Played} - \\text{Wins} - \\text{Ties} \\)\n\nThe calculation of the number of ties is necessary to identify which coach has the most. Let's calculate it for each relevant coach:\n\n1. **Frank McGuire (1964-1980)**\n   - Games: 142\n   - Win %: 666% (which seems like an error; usually, win percentage cannot exceed 100%)\n\nAssuming there was a transcription error and it should be 66.6%, calculate:\n   - Wins = \\(142 \\times \\frac{666}{1000} \\approx 94.572\\), round to 95\n   - Losses = 142 - 95 - Ties\n   - Since ties are not directly given, we need to use the win-loss record.\n   \nSince there is an apparent error with the win percentage for Frank McGuire, let's proceed by assuming it should be a valid number (like others in historical data):\n\n2. **Other Coaches:**\n   - Check other coaches similarly if their ties are not explicitly stated.\n\nGiven the absence of direct tie information, we need to focus on whether any coach has more than one tie or zero as it appears only Frank McGuire could potentially have a significant number due to an unusual win percentage.\n\n**Calculation Verification:**\n\n- For **Frank McGuire**, assuming a realistic interpretation:\n  - If wins are approximately 95, then losses would be \\(142 - 95 = 47\\).\n  - This leaves no room for ties (0 ties) unless there is an error in input data.\n\nSince no other coach has explicit tie counts or unusual win percentages suggesting multiple ties, and given the typical context where ties are rare:\n\n- **Conclusion:** Based on standard win-loss records without ties, Frank McGuire does not have the most ties.
