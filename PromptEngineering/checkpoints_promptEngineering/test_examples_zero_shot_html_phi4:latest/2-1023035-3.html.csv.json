    "resp": "To evaluate the claim that if Chris Wood scores 5 more goals throughout his time with the New Zealand national football team, he will become the highest scoring athlete for the team, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Chris Wood's Current Goals:**\n   - Look at the row corresponding to Chris Wood.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row index: 13\n     - Column \"goals\": 10\n\n2. **Determine Potential New Goal Total for Chris Wood:**\n   - If Chris Wood scores 5 more goals, his new total would be \\(10 + 5 = 15\\) goals.\n\n3. **Find the Current Highest Scoring Athlete:**\n   - Examine all rows to find the maximum number of goals scored.\n   - Vaughn Coveny has the highest current goal count:\n     - Row index: 0\n     - Column \"goals\": 28\n\n4. **Compare Chris Wood's Potential Goal Total with Current Highest:**\n   - Chris Wood\u2019s potential total (15) is compared to Vaughn Coveny's current total (28).\n   - Since 15 < 28, even with the additional goals, Chris Wood would not surpass Vaughn Coveny.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that Chris Wood will become the highest scoring athlete if he scores 5 more goals is false.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to consider several aspects based on the data provided in the HTML table:\n\n1. **Current Players**: The claim mentions players being \"current\" for the New Zealand national football team. In the context of the table:\n   - Current players should have an ongoing career (indicated by a dash `-` after their end year, e.g., `2003 -`, `2000 -`, or `2009 -`).\n   \n2. **Top 20 Goal Scorers**: The claim specifies that these current players are in the \"top 20 of highest goal score for the team.\" We need to verify:\n   - Whether Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner are indeed part of this top 20.\n   - No other current player should have more or equal goals than them.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant aspect:\n\n### Analysis of Current Players\n- **Current Players**: From the table, the players with ongoing careers (i.e., those who are still playing as per the given data) are:\n  - Shane Smeltz (`2003 -`)\n  - Chris Killen (`2000 -`)\n  - Chris Wood (`2009 -`)\n\n### Analysis of Top 20 Goal Scorers\n- **Top 20 Goals**:\n  - Steve Sumner: 22 goals\n  - Grant Turner: 15 goals\n  - Colin Walker: 10 goals\n\nThe table provides goal counts for various players. To determine if Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner are indeed in the top 20, we must count down from the highest number of goals:\n- Vaughan Coveny (28)\n- Shane Smeltz (23)\n- Steve Sumner (22) - Top scorer among current\n- Brian Turner (21)\n- Keith Nelson (16)\n- Chris Killen (16)\n- Jock Newall (17)\n- Chris Jackson (10)\n\nFrom this, we see that:\n- Steve Sumner is indeed in the top 5.\n- Grant Turner and Colin Walker are further down the list.\n\n### Verification of the Claim\nThe claim states \"Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner be the only current New Zealand national football team player who be also in the top 20 of highest goal score for the team.\"\n\n- **Steve Sumner** is a valid member as he has the most goals among current players.\n- **Grant Turner** and **Colin Walker**, however, are not current players according to the given data.\n\nAdditionally, Chris Killen and Chris Wood (current players) have 16 and 10 goals respectively. While they don't surpass Steve Sumner's count, their presence means that Grant Turner and Colin Walker cannot be considered as \"the only\" current top scorers since others are still current with a comparable goal tally.\n\nThus, the claim is false because:\n- Only Steve Sumner qualifies as both current and among the top 20.\n- Grant Turner and Colin Walker are not current players.\n  \n### Relevant Cells\nTo verify this conclusion, we need to check:\n- The \"Career\" column for each player's status (current or past).\n- The \"Goals\" column for goal counts.\n\nRelevant cells:\n1. Steve Sumner: Row 3, Career (`1982\u20131988`), Goals (`22`)\n2. Grant Turner: Row 12, Career (`1984\u20131988`), Goals (`10`)\n3. Colin Walker: Row 18, Career (`1984\u20131988`), Goals (`10`)\n4. Shane Smeltz: Row 2, Career (`2003 -`), Goals (`23`)\n5. Chris Killen: Row 15, Career (`1995\u20132003`), Goals (`10`)\n6.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Vaughan Coveny's caps and career in the table provided:\n\n### Breakdown of the Claim:\n1. **\"Vaughn Coveney have a cap during his second year and during his third year of the team\"**\n   - We need to verify that Vaughan Coveny was capped (played in an official game) at least once in both his second and third years.\n   \n2. **\"Overall he have 19 cap throughout his year with the team\"**\n   - This part states that he accumulated a total of 19 caps over his career.\n\n### Verification Against the Table:\n- Vaughan Coveny's entry is found in row 0.\n  \n#### Relevant Information from Row 0:\n1. **Name:** Vaughn Coveny\n2. **Career:** 1992 - 2006\n   - Implies a total career duration of 14 years.\n3. **Caps:** 64 \n4. **First Cap:** 7 June 1992\n5. **Most Recent Cap:** 4 June 2006\n\n### Evaluating the Conditions:\n1. **Capped During Second and Third Years:**\n   - Career starts in 1992, so second year would be 1993-1994, third year 1994-1995.\n   - The total number of caps is 64, indicating he was capped multiple times over his career, including within the second and third years. However, specific dates for caps are not given to verify individual years in detail.\n\n2. **Total Caps:**\n   - Clearly stated as 64 caps throughout his career from 1992-2006.\n   - The claim states \"19 cap throughout his year with the team,\" which contradicts the table's information of 64 caps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe part about having a cap during the second and third years is not verifiable due to lack of detailed date records in the table, but we can determine that he does have more than 19 caps, specifically 64. Therefore, the claim about having only 19 caps is false.\n\n**JSON Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"caps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
