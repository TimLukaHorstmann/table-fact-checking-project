In this row:\n- Drawn = 0 (matches the condition)\n- Points Difference = 19 - 19 (matches the condition)\n- Points = 6 (matches the condition)\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied in Row 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
