Ensure that among the entries, there is a record set by Malcolm Campbell at Coniston Water.\n\n### Analysis of Table:\n\n- **Row 14**: \n  - Pilot: \"Malcolm Campbell\"\n  - Location: \"coniston water\"\n  \nThis row confirms that Malcolm Campbell did indeed set a speed record at Coniston Water.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is supported by the data in Row 14.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Donald Campbell be the pilot at Lake Guntersville\" is true based on the given table, we need to analyze the relevant columns: \"pilot\" and \"location\". Specifically, we should look for entries where Donald Campbell is listed as the pilot and Lake Guntersville is mentioned in the location field.\n\n1. **Examine the Column Entries**:\n   - The column labeled \"pilot\" contains names of individuals who piloted boats on specific dates at certain locations.\n   - The column labeled \"location\" lists the places where these events occurred.\n\n2. **Search for Relevant Information**:\n   - Look through each row to find an instance where the pilot is listed as \"donald campbell\".\n   - Within those rows, check if the location matches \"lake guntersville\".\n\n3. **Analysis of Data**:\n   - In reviewing the table data:\n     - Row 16 lists \"pilot\" as \"lee taylor\" and \"location\" as \"lake guntersville\". Therefore, this row does not satisfy both conditions.\n     - All other rows with \"donald campbell\" as the pilot have locations like \"ullswater\", \"lake mead\", \"coniston water\", \"lake dumbleyung\"\u2014none of which is \"lake guntersville\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no row in the table where both conditions are met: Donald Campbell being the pilot and Lake Guntersville as the location.\n\n5. **Determine the Answer**:\n   - Since there is no evidence in the table supporting the claim, the answer to whether \"Donald Campbell be the pilot at Lake Guntersville\" is false.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Although no row satisfies both conditions, rows with Donald Campbell as the pilot (rows 19-25) and rows with Lake Guntersville as the location (row 27) can still be referenced to clarify why the claim does not hold true.\n   \nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"pilot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
