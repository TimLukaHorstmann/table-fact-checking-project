    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"every team have several win,\" we need to determine if each entry in the table corresponding to a different team has more than one win. The relevant column for this evaluation is \"wins.\"\n\nLet's examine each row:\n\n1. **Row 0:**  \n   - Team: bvm minardi team\n   - Wins: 0\n\n2. **Row 1:**  \n   - Team: bvm minardi team (same as Row 0)\n   - Wins: 0\n\n3. **Row 2:**  \n   - Team: bvm minardi team (same as Rows 0 and 1)\n   - Wins: 4\n\n4. **Row 3:**  \n   - Team: bvm minardi team (same as previous rows)\n   - Wins: 0\n\n5. **Row 4:**  \n   - Team: bvm minardi team (same as previous rows)\n   - Wins: 0\n\n6. **Row 5:**  \n   - Team: manor motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\n7. **Row 6:**  \n   - Team: manor motorsport (same as Row 5)\n   - Wins: 0\n\n8. **Row 7:**  \n   - Team: bvm - target racing\n   - Wins: 3\n\n9. **Row 8:**  \n   - Team: s fortec motorsport\n   - Wins: 0\n\nThe teams present in the table are:\n- bvm minardi team\n- manor motorsport\n- bvm - target racing\n- s fortec motorsport\n\nNow, let's verify if each team has several wins (more than one):\n\n- **bvm minardi team**: Has rows with 0 and 4 wins. Although they have a total of 4 wins in one season, not all entries show \"several wins.\"\n- **manor motorsport**: Both entries show 0 wins.\n- **bvm - target racing**: Shows 3 wins in the relevant row.\n- **s fortec motorsport**: Shows 0 wins.\n\nSince not every team has several wins (more than one win) across all their entries, the claim is false. The relevant cells are those under the \"wins\" column that show less than or equal to one win for each team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
