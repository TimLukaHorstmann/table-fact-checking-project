Therefore, Fitzroy is not listed as a home team.\n\nThis already disproves the first part of the claim that Fitzroy was a home team with a score.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Scores\n- Even though we've found that Fitzroy was not a home team, let's list all scores for completeness:\n  - Row 1: Collingwood (home) scored 7.14 (56), Footscray (away) scored 11.14 (80).\n  - Row 2: Melbourne (home) scored 20.14 (134), Geelong (away) scored 14.17 (101).\n  - Row 3: South Melbourne (home) scored 9.7 (61), Fitzroy (away) scored 18.11 (119).\n  - Row 4: North Melbourne (home) scored 8.13 (61), Essendon (away) scored 14.12 (96).\n  - Row 5: St Kilda (home) scored 10.12 (72), Carlton (away) scored 14.15 (99).\n  - Row 6: Richmond (home) scored 11.25 (91), Hawthorn (away) scored 13.6 (84).\n\n- Comparing all home team scores:\n  - Melbourne has the highest score as a home team with 20.14 (134).\n\nThus, Fitzroy not only did not have the highest score as a home team, but they were also never a home team according to the table.\n\nBased on these observations, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nTo verify this, we examined:\n- \"home team\" column for each row to check if Fitzroy was ever listed.\n- \"home team score\" column to find scores of all home teams and compare them.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are from columns \"home team\" and \"home team score\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
