    "resp": "To verify the claim \"Emilio Materassi drive a in 1927,\" we need to check specific details from the table regarding the driver, year, and location.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - The relevant columns for this claim are \"year\", \"driver\", and \"location\".\n   \n2. **Check Each Condition of the Claim Against the Table**:\n   - The claim specifies that \"Emilio Materassi\" is the driver.\n   - It also specifies the year as \"1927\".\n   - Finally, it implies a location, which we will check for consistency.\n\n3. **Locate Relevant Row in the Table**:\n   - We need to find a row where the \"year\" is 1927 and the \"driver\" is Emilio Materassi.\n   \n4. **Examine the Specific Row**:\n   - In the table, locate the row with `row_index` 6 (considering zero-based indexing):\n     - Year: 1927\n     - Driver: Emilio Materassi\n     - Location: Tripoli\n\n5. **Verify All Conditions**:\n   - The year matches \"1927\".\n   - The driver name matches \"Emilio Materazzi\" (note the typo in the claim, but assuming it refers to the same person).\n   - The location is \"Tripoli\", which does not contradict the claim since the claim does not specify a particular location.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied based on the table data, the claim is supported by the evidence provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row Index: 6\n  - Column: \"year\"\n  - Column: \"driver\"\n  - Column: \"location\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
