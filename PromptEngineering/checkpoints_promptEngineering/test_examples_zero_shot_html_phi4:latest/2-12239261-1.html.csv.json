    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to examine the relevant data from the table for the 1991 season. The claim states: \"during season 1991, West Indies be the holder at the end of the series and the host England have the result of series drawn.\"\n\nHere's how we can verify this:\n\n1. **Season**: We locate the row corresponding to the year 1991.\n2. **Host Team**: Check who the host team was in that season.\n3. **Series Result**: Determine if the result of the series was \"drawn.\"\n4. **Holder at the End**: Identify which team held the title at the end of the series.\n\nFrom the table:\n- In row 16, corresponding to the year 1995 (since we count from the header row), it shows data for the 1991 season.\n- The host team in that row is \"england.\"\n- The result column indicates \"series drawn.\"\n- The holder at the end of the series is \"west indies.\"\n\nThe claim specifies:\n- West Indies should be the holder, which matches with our finding from the table.\n- England as the host, which also matches with the data in the table.\n- Series result should be drawn, confirmed by the table.\n\nAll conditions mentioned in the claim align with the information provided for the 1991 season. Therefore, the statement is fully supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- Row 16, \"Year\": \"1995\" (because it corresponds to the 1991 season).\n- Row 16, \"Host\": \"england.\"\n- Row 16, \"Result\": \"series drawn.\"\n- Row 16, \"Holder at End\": \"west indies.\"\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Holder at End\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
