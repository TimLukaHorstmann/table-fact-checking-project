    "resp": "To evaluate the claim against the provided table, we need to break down and verify each part of the statement: \"there be no win when the top 25 and even the top 10 be less than 4.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim suggests that whenever both the \"top-25\" and \"top-10\" counts are less than 4, there should be no wins (\"wins = 0\").\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Row**:\n   - We need to check each tournament row (excluding the \"totals\") to see if both \"top-25\" and \"top-10\" are less than 4.\n   - If this condition is met for any row, we then verify that \"wins = 0\".\n\n3. **Row-by-row Verification**:\n   - **Masters Tournament**: \n     - Top-25: 4 (not less than 4)\n     - Top-10: 3 (less than 4)\n     - Wins: 0\n     - Condition not fully met (Top-25 is not less than 4).\n\n   - **US Open**:\n     - Top-25: 3 (less than 4)\n     - Top-10: 1 (less than 4)\n     - Wins: 0\n     - Condition met, and wins are indeed 0.\n\n   - **The Open Championship**:\n     - Top-25: 2 (less than 4)\n     - Top-10: 1 (less than 4)\n     - Wins: 0\n     - Condition met, and wins are indeed 0.\n\n   - **PGA Championship**:\n     - Top-25: 4 (not less than 4)\n     - Top-10: 1 (less than 4)\n     - Wins: 0\n     - Condition not fully met (Top-25 is not less than 4).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - For all rows where both \"top-25\" and \"top-10\" are less than 4, the number of wins is indeed 0.\n   - Therefore, the claim holds true for this table.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify the claim are those where both conditions (\"top-25 < 4\" and \"top-10 < 4\") are met and where we check the \"wins\" column.\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim about the table data, let's break down each part of the statement and verify it against the information in the HTML table:\n\n1. **Claim**: \"pga championship when top - 25 be less than 4 have 0 win with cut made 6 and top - 5 be greater than 0\"\n\n   We'll address each condition one by one:\n   \n   - **Condition 1**: \"pga championship when top - 25 be less than 4\"\n     - Look at the row for \"pga championship\":\n       - `top - 25` is 4.\n     - This means the condition \"less than 4\" is not met. However, we still need to check other conditions.\n\n   - **Condition 2**: \"...have 0 win\"\n     - In the \"pga championship\" row:\n       - `wins` is 0.\n     - This part of the claim holds true.\n\n   - **Condition 3**: \"...with cut made 6\"\n     - In the \"pga championship\" row:\n       - `cuts made` is 8, not 6.\n     - This condition does not hold true.\n\n   - **Condition 4**: \"...and top - 5 be greater than 0\"\n     - In the \"pga championship\" row:\n       - `top - 5` is 1, which is indeed greater than 0.\n     - This part of the claim holds true.\n\nSince Condition 1 and Condition 3 are not met for the \"pga championship,\" the overall claim does not hold. Therefore, we conclude that the entire statement is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells to verify these conditions:\n\n- **Row index**: The row corresponding to \"pga championship\" has an index of 3.\n- **Relevant columns**:\n  - `top - 25` for checking if it is less than 4.\n  - `wins` for verifying that there are 0 wins.\n  - `cuts made` for the condition regarding 6 cuts being made.\n  - `top - 5` for confirming it's greater than 0.\n\nThus, we gather these relevant cells:\n\n- \"pga championship\" row (index 3):\n  - Column: `top - 25`\n  - Column: `wins`\n  - Column: `cuts made`\n  - Column: `top - 5`\n\nHere is the JSON object with our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
