    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the game on March 8, we need to examine specific details in the table related to this date. The claim is: \"the game on March 8 be play by Minnesota (home) and Philadelphia (visitor).\"\n\nLet's break down the necessary conditions from the claim:\n1. The game takes place on March 8.\n2. Minnesota is listed as the home team.\n3. Philadelphia is listed as the visitor team.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for March 8:**\n   - Locate the row where the date is \"march 8.\" This corresponds to the 5th row in zero-based indexing (since rows start from 0).\n\n2. **Check the 'visitor' Column:**\n   - For the game on March 8, verify that the visitor team is \"philadelphia.\"\n\n3. **Check the 'home' Column:**\n   - Verify that the home team for this date is listed as \"minnesota.\"\n\n4. **Examine the 'score' Column (Optional):**\n   - While not explicitly required by the claim, confirming the score could provide additional verification of which team was at home or away if necessary.\n\n### Verification from the Table:\n\n- **Row 5 (March 8 Entry):**\n  - Date: \"march 8\"\n  - Visitor: \"philadelphia\"\n  - Home: \"minnesota\"\n\nThe details in row 5 confirm that on March 8, the visitor team was Philadelphia and the home team was Minnesota. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince all conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the table's data for March 8, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim regarding the specified game in the table, we need to verify each part of it against the data provided:\n\n1. **Check if Edmonton was a visitor on March 9:** \n   - Look at the row where \"date\" is \"march 9\". The relevant cell should show that \"visitor\" is \"edmonton\".\n\n2. **Verify the game's location as Philadelphia:**\n   - Still in the same row, confirm that \"home\" is indeed listed as \"philadelphia\", which indicates it was an away game for Edmonton.\n\n3. **Ensure the record on March 9 was 44 - 7 - 15:**\n   - Check the cell under \"record\" to see if it states \"44 - 7 - 15\".\n\nBy locating the row in the table corresponding to March 9 and examining these specific cells, we can verify whether each part of the claim is accurate.\n\n- **Row for March 9:**  \n  - Date: march 9\n  - Visitor: edmonton (matches claim)\n  - Home: philadelphia (matches claim)\n  - Record: 44 - 7 - 15 (matches claim)\n\nSince all parts of the claim are confirmed as true based on the table data, we can conclude that the claim is indeed correct.\n\nHere is the JSON object reflecting these findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
