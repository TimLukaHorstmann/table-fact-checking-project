    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Bobby Riggs win against Jack Kramer in the final\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine specific conditions from the claim:\n\n1. The player named Bobby Riggs must be mentioned as the winner.\n2. The opponent in the final must be Jack Kramer.\n\nLet's analyze each relevant column of the table for these conditions:\n\n- **Column: \"outcome\"**: We are looking for an entry where the outcome is \"winner\", indicating a win.\n- **Column: \"opponent in the final\"**: For Bobby Riggs to have won, Jack Kramer must be listed as the opponent.\n\nNow, let's go through the table row by row:\n\n1. **Row 0**:\n   - Outcome: \"runner-up\"\n   - Opponent in the Final: Don Budge\n   - Not relevant because the outcome is not a win and the opponent is not Jack Kramer.\n\n2. **Row 1**:\n   - Outcome: \"winner\"\n   - Opponent in the Final: Don Budge\n   - Not relevant because although it's a win, the opponent is not Jack Kramer.\n\n3. **Row 2**:\n   - Outcome: \"winner\"\n   - Opponent in the Final: Don Budge\n   - Not relevant for the same reason as Row 1.\n\n4. **Row 3**:\n   - Outcome: \"runner-up\"\n   - Opponent in the Final: Jack Kramer\n   - Not relevant because although Jack Kramer is the opponent, the outcome is not a win.\n\n5. **Row 4**:\n   - Outcome: \"runner-up\"\n   - Opponent in the Final: Jack Kramer\n   - Again, not relevant for the same reason as Row 3.\n\n6. **Row 5**:\n   - Outcome: \"winner\"\n   - Opponent in the Final: Don Budge\n   - Not relevant because although it's a win, the opponent is not Jack Kramer.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, there is no instance where Bobby Riggs is listed as a winner against Jack Kramer. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are those that mention \"winner\" and include Jack Kramer as an opponent, which are in rows 3 and 4 under the \"outcome\" and \"opponent in the final\" columns respectively. However, since no row satisfies both conditions of being a win for Bobby Riggs against Jack Kramer, these cells serve to confirm the claim's falsity.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent in the final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

A game is counted based on the \"score in the final\" column for each row.\n\nHere's how the evaluation proceeds:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows**:\n   - We consider matches from 1942 up to and including 1947, as specified by the claim.\n   \n2. **Count the number of games in each match score**:\n   - A game is represented by a segment between two numbers separated by commas or spaces (e.g., \"6-3\" counts as one game).\n\nLet's break down the scores:\n\n- **1942 Match**: Score = \"2 - 6 , 2 - 6 , 2 - 6\"\n  - Games: 3\n\n- **1946 Match**: Score = \"6 - 3 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 1\"\n  - Games: 3\n\n- **1947 Match**: Score = \"3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 10 - 8 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3\"\n  - Games: 5\n\nNow, compare these with matches after 1947:\n\n- **1948 Match**: Score = \"12 - 14 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 3 - 6\"\n  - Games: 4\n\n- **1949 (Wembley Pro) Match**: Score = \"6 - 2 , 4 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 4 - 6\"\n  - Games: 4\n\n- **1949 (US Pro) Match**: Score = \"9 - 7 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5\"\n  - Games: 4\n\nThe match with the highest number of games before and including 1947 is the 1947 US Pro championship, which had 5 games.\n\nComparing this to matches after 1947 (the maximum being 4 games), we find that indeed, the most number of games occurred in a match before or during 1947.
