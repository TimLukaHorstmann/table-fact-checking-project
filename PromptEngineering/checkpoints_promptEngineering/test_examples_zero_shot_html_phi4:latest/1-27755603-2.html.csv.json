Greg Monroe has the highest of 8, but not the overall highest.\n\n**Analyzing Part 2**: \"Rodney Stuckey (16) score the highest number of point in the game\"\n\n- We need to find the maximum value under the column \"high points\" for Rodney Stuckey and check if he scored the most points in that particular game.\n- From the table:\n  - Row 1: Ben Gordon (17)\n  - Row 2: Austin Daye (21)\n  - Row 3: Rodney Stuckey (16)\n  - Row 4: Austin Daye (16)\n  - Row 5: Austin Daye (18)\n  - Row 6: Rodney Stuckey (25)\n  - Row 7: Rodney Stuckey (34)\n\n- In row 3, Rodney Stuckey scored 16 points.

The relevant pieces of information include the team playing against \"Dallas\" and the points scored by Austin Daye.\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Dallas**: \n   - The column 'team' tells us which opponent is being played.\n   - We look for rows where the value in the 'team' column matches \"dallas.\" This will help us identify which game involves Dallas as an opponent.\n\n2. **Check Points Scored by Austin Daye**:\n   - The column 'high points' lists who scored the highest points and their score within each game.\n   - We need to find instances where Austin Daye is mentioned, specifically looking for the lowest scoring instance of him, which according to the claim is 16 points.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - After identifying rows involving Dallas as the opponent, we check if in any of those games, Austin Daye scored exactly 16 points.\n   - If this condition matches with the lowest score (which it does per the claim), and Dallas was indeed an opponent in such a game, then the claim is true.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row Analysis**:\n  - Row 1: Opponent = \"miami\", Austin Daye points are not mentioned.\n  - Row 2: Opponent = \"milwaukee\", Austin Daye (21) \u2013 Not Dallas, and not lowest for Austin Daye.\n  - Row 3: Opponent = \"atlanta\", Austin Daye points are not mentioned.\n  - **Row 4**: Opponent = \"dallas\", Austin Daye (16).
