    "resp": "To evaluate the claim: \"after 1985, the United States contributed 2 players with Rafael Ara\u00fajo being the most recent,\" we need to verify two conditions based on the table:\n\n1. Identify all U.S. players who joined after 1985.\n2. Verify if Rafael Ara\u00fajo is the most recent among them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Condition 1: Identifying U.S. Players After 1985\nWe examine each row to check for:\n- Nationality as \"united states\".\n- Years played with the Utah Jazz after 1985.\n\n**Relevant Rows:**\n- **Rick Adelman**: 1974 - 75 (before 1985)\n- **John Amaechi**: 2001 - 03 (after 1985, England nationality, not relevant for U.S. players)\n- **Louis Amundson**: 2007 (after 1985)\n- **JJ Anderson**: 1982 - 85 (up to 1985, not after)\n- **Shandon Anderson**: 1996 - 99 (after 1985)\n- **Rafael Ara\u00fajo**: 2006 - 07 (after 1985, Brazil nationality, not relevant for U.S. players)\n- **Carlos Arroyo**: 2002 - 05 (after 1985, Puerto Rico nationality, not relevant for U.S. players)\n- **Isaac Austin**: 1991 - 93 (after 1985)\n- **Anthony Avent**: 1998 - 99 (after 1985)\n\nFrom the above, we find four U.S. players who joined after 1985:\n- Louis Amundson (2007)\n- Shandon Anderson (1996 - 99)\n- Isaac Austin (1991 - 93)\n- Anthony Avent (1998 - 99)\n\n#### Condition 2: Checking if Rafael Ara\u00fajo is the Most Recent\n- **Rafael Ara\u00fajo** played from 2006 - 07, but he is Brazilian.\n- The most recent U.S. player is **Louis Amundson**, who joined in 2007.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states there are two U.S. players after 1985 with Rafael Ara\u00fajo being the most recent. However:\n- There are four U.S. players after 1985, not two.\n- Rafael Ara\u00fajo is not a U.S. player and not the most recent; Louis Amundson is.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim include nationality, years for Jazz, and player name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years for jazz\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
