The location should match \"arizona, new mexico, and utah.\"\n2. The year 2000 should have a value of 46.5.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant data from the table:\n\n- **Row 0**:\n  - Reservation: \"navajo indian reservation\"\n  - Location: \"arizona , new mexico , and utah\" (matches the location in the claim)\n  - Year 2000 Value: 46.5 (matches the value in the claim)\n\nThis row satisfies both conditions of the claim.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cell:\n\n- **Row Index**: 0\n- **Column Name for Location**: \"location\"\n- **Column Name for Year 2000**: \"2000\"\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n1.

According to the table, these correspond to the \"Navajo Indian Reservation.\"\n\n2. **Find the Year 1979 Data for Navajo Indian Reservation**:\n   - Look at the row where the reservation is \"Navajo Indian Reservation.\"\n   - Check the value in the column labeled \"1979.\"\n\n3. **Compare the Value**:\n   - The value for \"Navajo Indian Reservation\" in 1979 is 47.3.\n   - We need to verify if this value (47.3) is higher than 54.2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 47.3 is not greater than 54.2, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The relevant row index for \"Navajo Indian Reservation\" is 0.\n- The relevant column name for the year 1979 is \"1979.\"\n\nHere is the JSON response with the conclusion and the relevant cell information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1979\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, it includes \"utah,\" which is not mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Row 1 (Cheyenne River Indian Reservation)**:\n  - Location: \"south dakota\"\n  - Year 2000 value: 42.3\n\nThis row matches part of the location (\"south dakota\") but does not match the year 2000 value.\n\n- **Row 2 (Standing Rock Indian Reservation)**:\n  - Location: \"south dakota and north dakota\"\n  - Year 2000 value: 41.2\n\nThis row matches part of the location (\"south dakota\") but does not match the year 2000 value.\n\n- **Other Rows**: None of the other rows match both the specified value (46.5) for the year 2000 and the locations \"arizona, new mexico, and south dakota.\"\n\nConclusion:\nThe claim is partially correct in that there is a row with a value of 46.5 for the year 2000, but it does not fully match the location criteria specified in the claim (since it includes \"utah\" instead of just \"south dakota\").
