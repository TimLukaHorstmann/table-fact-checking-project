    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to carefully analyze each condition in the claim against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Conditions in the Claim:\n1. **Pittsburgh must be the visitor** for a game.\n2. The game must result in **more than 24 points**.\n3. The game must have an **attendance of 14995**.\n\nLet's examine these conditions one by one using the data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Games where Pittsburgh is the Visitor:**\n   - Look at the \"visitor\" column for entries with \"pittsburgh\".\n   - Relevant rows are:\n     - December 5 (Row Index 2)\n     - December 12 (Row Index 5)\n     - December 15 (Row Index 6)\n     - December 22 (Row Index 10)\n     - December 26 (Row Index 11)\n     - December 28 (Row Index 12)\n\n2. **Check for Points Greater than 24:**\n   - The \"points\" column shows the team's total points after each game.\n   - We need to find games where Pittsburgh is the visitor and their points exceed 24.\n   - From the relevant rows:\n     - December 5: Points = 22\n     - December 12: Points = 24\n     - December 15: Points = 24\n     - December 22: Points = 25 (greater than 24)\n     - December 26: Points = 27 (greater than 24)\n     - December 28: Points = 27 (greater than 24)\n\n3. **Check for Attendance of 14995:**\n   - The \"attendance\" column provides the number of attendees.\n   - Check if any of the games where Pittsburgh's points are greater than 24 have an attendance of 14995.\n   - For December 22, attendance is 17250 (not 14995).\n   - For December 26, attendance is 14626 (not 14995).\n   - For December 28, attendance is 11158 (not 14995).\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo game exists where Pittsburgh was the visitor, their points exceeded 24, and the attendance was exactly 14995. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells for Verification:\n- For row index 10 (\"December 22\"), check \"visitor\" = \"pittsburgh\", \"points\" > 24, and \"attendance\" != 14995.\n- For row index 11 (\"December 26\"), check \"visitor\" = \"pittsburgh\", \"points\" > 24, and \"attendance\" != 14995.\n- For row index 12 (\"December 28\"), check \"visitor\" = \"pittsburgh\", \"points\" > 24, and \"attendance\" != 14995.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the Pittsburgh team's performance and attendance after December 19, we need to assess several conditions stated in the claim against the data from the table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games**:\n   - The claim mentions that the event occurs \"after december 19\". Therefore, we should consider games occurring on or after December 22 (as no game is listed for December 20 or 21).\n\n2. **Condition of Pittsburgh Playing Against Montreal**:\n   - The game where Pittsburgh visits Montreal is listed in the table:\n     - Date: December 25\n     - Visitor: Montreal\n     - Home: Pittsburgh\n\n3. **Check Points After December 19**:\n   - We need to ensure that after December 19, Pittsburgh has more than 24 points.\n   - Review of the relevant rows (after December 19):\n     - December 22: Points = 25\n     - December 25: Points = 27\n     - December 26: Points = 27\n     - December 28: Points = 27\n     - December 31: Points = 28\n\n   After December 19, the points for Pittsburgh increase to more than 24.\n\n4. **Check Attendance**:\n   - The attendance on December 25 (Montreal vs. Pittsburgh) is listed as 7778 in the table.\n   - The claim mentions \"more than 14995 attendee\", which does not match the actual attendance figure of 7778 for that game.\n\nBased on these checks, we find:\n\n- **Pittsburgh did play against Montreal after December 19** with more than 24 points.\n- However, the attendance was not more than 14995. \n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because one condition (attendance being more than 14995) is not satisfied.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n\n- The row for December 25, which confirms the game against Montreal and its details:\n  - Row Index: 10\n  - Columns: \"date\", \"visitor\", \"home\", \"attendance\", \"points\"\n\n- Checking that Pittsburgh had more than 24 points after December 19 involves rows from December 22 onward:\n  - Row Indices: 11, 12, 13, 14\n  - Column Name: \"points\"\n\nTherefore, the final JSON object is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
