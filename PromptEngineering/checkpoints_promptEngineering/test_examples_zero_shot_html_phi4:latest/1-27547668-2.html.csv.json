    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Steve Scaini directed one more episode than Mike Clattenburg\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to examine the relevant data:\n\n1. **Identify episodes directed by Steve Scaini:**\n   - The row with `title = \"a horse divided\"` lists `directed by` as \"steve scaini\". This corresponds to row index 10 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n2. **Identify episodes directed by Mike Clattenburg:**\n   - The rows with titles:\n     - `\"fathers and sons\"` list `directed by` as \"mike clattenburg\", corresponding to row index 0.\n     - `\"duchess of george\"` also lists `directed by` as \"mike clattenburg\", corresponding to row index 2.\n\n3. **Count the number of episodes directed:**\n   - Steve Scaini directed 1 episode (row index 10).\n   - Mike Clattenburg directed 2 episodes (rows indices 0 and 2).\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that Steve Scaini directed one more episode than Mike Clattenburg.\n   - However, Mike Clattenburg directed more episodes (2) compared to Steve Scaini (1), so the claim is false.\n\n5. **List relevant cells from the table:**\n   - For Steve Scaini:\n     - Row index 10, column \"directed by\".\n   - For Mike Clattenburg:\n     - Row index 0, column \"directed by\".\n     - Row index 2, column \"directed by\".\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
