    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"the andrean fighting '59ers have an enrollment of 587,\" we need to verify two key pieces of information from the table:\n\n1. The school named \"andrean\" should correspond to a row where the mascot is \"fighting '59ers.\"\n2. The enrollment number for this specific school and mascot should be 587.\n\nNow, let's examine the relevant parts of the table:\n\n- We first look at the column labeled \"school\" to identify the row corresponding to \"andrean.\" This occurs in the first row (index 0).\n  \n- Within that same row (index 0), we check the column labeled \"mascot\" and confirm it matches \"fighting '59ers.\"\n\n- Finally, within the same row (index 0), we verify the value in the \"enrollment\" column is indeed 587.\n\nSince all these conditions are satisfied by row index 0 with columns \"school,\" \"mascot,\" and \"enrollment,\" the claim is true. The relevant cells from this verification process are:\n\n- Row 0, Column \"school\"\n- Row 0, Column \"mascot\"\n- Row 0, Column \"enrollment\"\n\nThese three cells collectively verify the truth of the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
