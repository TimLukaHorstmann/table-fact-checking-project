Our task is to identify all values within this column and find the minimum value.\n\nLet's analyze each row under the `attendance` column:\n\n1. Row 1 (Week 1): Attendance = 54125\n2. Row 2 (Week 2): Attendance = 50840\n3. Row 3 (Week 3): Attendance = 77292\n4. Row 4 (Week 4): Attendance = 55041\n5. Row 5 (Week 5): Attendance = 60174\n6. Row 6 (Week 6): Attendance = 45908\n7.

The claim states: \"the Minnesota Vikings defeat the Lion in both games they play.\" We must break down this statement into parts and verify each part against the data.\n\n1. **Identify games involving the Minnesota Vikings**:\n   - From the table, look for rows where the opponent is listed as \"minnesota vikings\".\n   - There are two such entries:\n     - Week 3: September 26, 1976, vs. Minnesota Vikings (Result: l 10 - 9)\n     - Week 9: November 7, 1976, vs. Minnesota Vikings (Result: l 31 - 23)\n\n2. **Identify games involving the Lions**:\n   - We need to check for any entries where \"lions\" are listed as the opponent.\n   - The table does not have any rows with \"lions\" listed in the opponent column.\n\n3. **Verify results of games played against the Lions**:\n   - Since there are no games listed against the Lions, it is impossible for the Minnesota Vikings to defeat them in both games.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The claim involves two parts: \n     - \"the Minnesota Vikings defeat\" implies a win (indicated by 'w' in results).\n     - \"in both games they play\" suggests there must be two entries involving the Lions, which is not the case.\n   - As there are no games listed against the Lions, it's impossible for the Vikings to have won any.\n\nGiven these observations, we can conclude that the claim is false because there were no games played between the Minnesota Vikings and the Lions.
