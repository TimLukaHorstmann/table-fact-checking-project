    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"jehan mubarak be on the team that get 9th and 10th place\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the partnerships associated with the 9th and 10th positions.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - The claim concerns the 9th and 10th partnerships.\n   - We will look at rows where `wicket` is \"9th\" and \"10th\".\n\n2. **Extract Partnership Information**:\n   - For the 9th place, check the `partnerships` column for row with `wicket = \"9th\"`.\n   - For the 10th place, check the `partnerships` column for row with `wicket = \"10th\"`.\n\n3. **Verify Presence of Jehan Mubarak**:\n   - Check if \"jehan mubarak\" is listed in either of these partnership entries.\n\n4. **Determine Truth Value**:\n   - If \"jehan mubarak\" appears in both the 9th and 10th partnerships, then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n5. **Extract Relevant Cells**:\n   - Record the row indices and column name for these relevant cells.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n- **9th Position**: \n  - Row index: 8\n  - Partnerships: \"jimmy kamande / rajesh bhudia\"\n  - Jehan Mubarak is not present here.\n\n- **10th Position**:\n  - Row index: 9\n  - Partnerships: \"majid haq / dewald nel\"\n  - Jehan Mubarak is not present here either.\n\nSince Jehan Mubarak does not appear in both the 9th and 10th partnerships, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"partnerships\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"partnerships\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
