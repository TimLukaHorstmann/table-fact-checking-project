The relevant cells in this context are:\n\n- Row Index: 11\n  - Column Name: \"team\" (to identify the team as Evansville Triplets)\n  - Column Name: \"sport\" (to verify it's baseball)\n  - Column Name: \"class\" (to confirm class is AAA)\n\nGiven that all these checks affirm the claim, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To verify the claim regarding the Evansville Triplet baseball team, we need to check several conditions against the data provided in the table:\n\n1. **Team Name and Sport**: The claim mentions \"evansville triplet baseball team.\" In the table:\n   - There is a row for \"evansville triplets\" with the sport listed as \"baseball.\" This matches part of the claim.\n\n2. **Class Level**: The claim states that the Evansville Triplets were class AAA.\n   - According to the table, the \"class\" for the \"evansville triplets\" is \"aaa,\" which confirms this part of the claim.\n\n3. **League**: The claim indicates that they were in the Three-I League and won championships in 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957.\n   - The table shows that the \"evansville triplets\" played in the \"american association,\" not the Three-I League. This is a discrepancy.\n\n4. **Championships**: The claim mentions winning titles in 1946, 1948, 1956, and 1957.\n   - The table lists these years as championship wins for the \"evansville braves\" in the Three-I League, not the Evansville Triplets.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The team name and sport match.\n- The class level matches.\n- However, the league and championships do not align with the claim.
