This matches exactly with the part of the claim concerning the score.\n\n3. **Check that it occurs after week 9**:\n   - The entry in question is associated with `week` number 8 from the table. Since 8 comes before 9, this does not meet the condition \"after week 9\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While there is a result of `w 65 - 20`, it occurred during week 8, not after week 9 as claimed.\n   \nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells that verify these details are:\n\n- Row index 8 for the column `date` (to confirm the date \"november 13 , 1949\")\n- Row index 8 for the column `result` (to check the result \"w 65 - 20\")\n- Row index 8 for the column `week` (to verify it is week 8, not after week 9)\n\nHere's the JSON object representing this conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
