    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table with respect to the specific conditions stated in the claim: identifying instances where a player acted as a \"nightwatchman\" for Australia.\n\nA nightwatchman is typically a lower-order batsman sent out earlier than usual to protect more skilled batsmen from being dismissed early in an innings. The term doesn't necessarily appear directly in the table, but we can use contextual clues such as the player's team and performance record.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Australian Players:**\n   - We need to find rows where the \"team\" column indicates \"australia.\"\n\n2. **Check Performance Records for Clues of Nightwatchman Role:**\n   - A nightwatchman is often sent in under challenging conditions, and their scores might not necessarily be high but significant enough to stabilize the innings.\n   - High-scoring performances by lower-order batsmen can indicate that they were playing as a nightwatchman.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Data:**\n   - Look for rows where \"team\" equals \"australia,\" then examine the player's performance (\"score\") and context (e.g., high scores under pressure).\n\n### Analysis of the Table:\n\n- **Row 1:** `player`: \"tony mann\", `team`: \"australia\", `score`: \"105\", `versus`: \"india\", `year`: \"1977\"\n  - Tony Mann scored a significant total, which could suggest he was playing as a nightwatchman.\n\n- **Row 6:** `player`: \"jason gillespie\", `team`: \"australia\", `score`: \"201 not out\", `versus`: \"bangladesh\", `year`: \"2006\"\n  - Jason Gillespie's innings of 201* is extraordinary, indicating he may have been a nightwatchman who was promoted to open the batting due to an early wicket fall.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth players from Australia (Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie) had significant scoring performances that could suggest they were playing in a nightwatchman role.

However, the claim specifically mentions that England played twice against a nightwatchman, which is slightly ambiguous because it's more about when they were opponents rather than when England themselves employed a nightwatchman.\n   - The focus here seems to be on instances where \"England\" appears in the \"versus\" column.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - We need to identify all rows where the \"versus\" column contains \"england\", as this indicates that England was the opponent team in those matches.\n\n3. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - `player`: nasim-ul-ghani\n     - `team`: pakistan\n     - `score`: 101\n     - `versus`: england\n     - `year`: 1962\n     - Relevance: England was the opponent.\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - `player`: tony mann\n     - `team`: australia\n     - `score`: 105\n     - `versus`: india\n     - `year`: 1977\n     - Relevance: England is not mentioned, so this row is irrelevant.\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - `player`: syed kirmani\n     - `team`: india\n     - `score`: 101 not out\n     - `versus`: australia\n     - `year`: 1979\n     - Relevance: England is not mentioned, so this row is irrelevant.\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - `player`: mark boucher\n     - `team`: south africa\n     - `score`: 125\n     - `versus`: zimbabwe\n     - `year`: 1999\n     - Relevance: England is not mentioned, so this row is irrelevant.\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - `player`: mark boucher\n     - `team`: south africa\n     - `score`: 108\n     - `versus`: england\n     - `year`: 1999\n     - Relevance: England was the opponent.\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - `player`: jason gillespie\n     - `team`: australia\n     - `score`: 201 not out\n     - `versus`: bangladesh\n     - `year`: 2006\n     - Relevance: England is not mentioned, so this row is irrelevant.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the analysis above, there are exactly two rows where England was the opponent (\"versus\" column contains \"england\"): Row 0 and Row 4.\n   - Since the claim states that England played twice in situations involving a nightwatchman (inferred as matches against them), these two instances satisfy the condition.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is supported by the data: \"TRUE\".\n   - The relevant cells are those where the \"versus\" column contains \"england\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"versus\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"versus\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"Mark Boucher has the highest score,\" we need to examine the scores from each entry in the table and identify if Mark Boucher indeed holds the highest score among them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Scores in the Table:**\n   - Row 0: Nasim-ul-Ghani, Score = 101\n   - Row 1: Tony Mann, Score = 105\n   - Row 2: Syed Kirmani, Score = 101 not out (treated as 101 for comparison)\n   - Row 3: Mark Boucher, Score = 125\n   - Row 4: Mark Boucher, Score = 108\n   - Row 5: Jason Gillespie, Score = 201 not out\n\n2. **Compare Scores:**\n   - The scores are as follows:\n     - Nasim-ul-Ghani: 101\n     - Tony Mann: 105\n     - Syed Kirmani: 101 (not out)\n     - Mark Boucher's highest score is 125\n     - Jason Gillespie: 201 not out\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Score:**\n   - Comparing all scores, Jason Gillespie has a score of 201 not out, which is higher than Mark Boucher\u2019s highest score of 125.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"Mark Boucher has the highest score\" is false because Jason Gillespie scored higher.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to check all scores for comparison:\n     - Row 0, Column 'score': 101\n     - Row 1, Column 'score': 105\n     - Row 2, Column 'score': 101 not out (treated as 101)\n     - Row 3, Column 'score': 125\n     - Row 4, Column 'score': 108\n     - Row 5, Column 'score': 201 not out\n\nBased on the analysis above, here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
