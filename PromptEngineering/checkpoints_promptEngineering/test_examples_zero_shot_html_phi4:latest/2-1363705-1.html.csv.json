Identify the columns relevant to the claim:\n   - Median Household Income (column name: \"Median household income\")\n   - Median Family Income (column name: \"Median family income\")\n\n3. Extract and evaluate the values for Harding County from these columns:\n   - Median Household Income for Harding is 14684.\n   - Median Family Income for Harding is 33750.\n\n4. Verify if both values are under 25000 as claimed:\n   - The Median Household Income (14684) is indeed less than 25000.\n   - However, the Median Family Income (33750) is greater than 25000.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The condition for Median Household Income being under 25000 is met.\n- The condition for Median Family Income being under 25000 is not met. \n\nSince both conditions must be true for the claim to be fully supported, but one of them fails, the entire claim is false.\n\nThus, we construct our JSON response accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Median household income\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Median family income\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant cells are identified by their row index and column name: Harding County is at the 22nd row (index 21 due to zero-based indexing) in the table for both \"Median household income\" and \"Median family income.\"",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Bernalillo county have the lowest population of all the list county, except for Guadalupe county,\" we need to examine the columns related to population estimates and determine which county has the lowest value in each column, excluding Guadalupe.\n\nThe relevant columns are:\n- `Population Estimate 2019`\n- `Population Estimate 2020`\n- `Population Estimate 2021`\n\nWe will identify the county with the lowest values for these columns and check if Bernalillo County is among them, considering that Guadalupe can have a lower value without affecting the claim.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify Lowest Population in Each Column:**\n   - Check each column individually to find which county has the smallest population estimate.\n   \n2. **Compare with Bernalillo and Guadalupe:**\n   - Ensure that for all columns, the lowest value belongs to either Bernalillo or Guadalupe.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Population Estimate 2019:**\n  - Lowest value is `12932` (Mckinley)\n  \n- **Population Estimate 2020:**\n  - Lowest value is `14684` (Harding)\n\n- **Population Estimate 2021:**\n  - Lowest value is `15687` (Luna)\n\nIn all three columns, Bernalillo County does not have the lowest population estimate. Instead, Mckinley, Harding, and Luna have the lowest values respectively.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because Bernalillo County does not have the lowest population estimates in any of the years listed.
