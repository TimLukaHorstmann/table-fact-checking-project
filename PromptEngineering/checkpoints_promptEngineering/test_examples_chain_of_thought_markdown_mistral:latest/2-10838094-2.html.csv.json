    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the stadiums with their opening years after 2015, as the claim only considers stadiums opened after this year. From the table, we can see that all but three stadiums (afyonkarahisar stadi, basaksehir stadi, ay - yildiz stadium) were opened in or after 2015.\n\n2. For the remaining three stadiums (afyonkarahisar stadi, basaksehir stadi, ay - yildiz stadium), we can see that their capacities are less than new trabzon stadium's capacity of 41513. Therefore, they cannot be the largest capacity stadium opened after 2015.\n\n3. Since there are no other stadiums in the table with a larger capacity and an opening year after 2015, we can conclude that new trabzon stadium indeed holds the largest capacity among those opened after 2015.\n\nThe JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify stadiums opened after 2015, compare their capacities to new Trabzon Stadium's capacity, and eliminate other options based on this comparison.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}",
