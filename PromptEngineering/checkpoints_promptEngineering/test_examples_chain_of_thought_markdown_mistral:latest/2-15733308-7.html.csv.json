In this table, it can be found in row 8 with the column name \"total forest area\" and the rank being 47.\n2. Find the rows where the column names are either 'year' or contain 'year'. In this table, there are two such rows: row 1 (year: 2005) and row 6 (year: 2000).\n3. Compare the rank of \"total forest area\" with the ranks of the years. Since the year 2005 has a higher rank (1) than the rank of \"total forest area\" (47), and the year 2000 is earlier than the given year in the claim, we need to check if there's another year later than 2005 where the rank of \"total forest area\" is smaller than 71.\n4. However, since there are no rows with column names that explicitly contain 'year' after row 6 (which represents the year 2003), we can conclude that there are no more years later than 2005 in the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row and column of total forest area, find the rows with year-related columns, compare ranks, check for later years\", \"Since there are no rows after 2003, we can conclude that there are no more years later than 2005 in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}\nRelevant_cells: [\n  { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total forest area\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\" }\n]",
