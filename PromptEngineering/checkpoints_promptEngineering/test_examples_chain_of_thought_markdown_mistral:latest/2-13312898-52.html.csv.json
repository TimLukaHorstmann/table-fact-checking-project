In American football, the offensive players typically include quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, offensive linemen (tackles, guards), and fullbacks.\n\n2. Next, we'll go through each row of the table one by one to identify if the player is an offensive player based on their position. Here are my findings:\n   - bob sanders (row 2) is a safety, not an offensive player.\n   - ben hartsock (row 3) is a tight end, which is an offensive player.\n   - gilbert gardner (row 4) is a linebacker, not an offensive player.\n   - kendyll pope (row 5) is a linebacker, not an offensive player.\n   - jason david (row 6) is a cornerback, not an offensive player.\n   - jake scott (row 7) is a guard, which is an offensive player.\n   - von hutchins (row 8) and jim sorgi (row 9) are cornerbacks, not offensive players.\n   - david kimball (row 10) is a placekicker, not an offensive player.\n\n3.
