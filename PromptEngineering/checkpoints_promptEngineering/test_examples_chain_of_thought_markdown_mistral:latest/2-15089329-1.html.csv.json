    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will check the value in the 'type' column for each row in the table to determine whether they are primary schools. The 'type' column values are either 'primary', 'special', or empty (indicating unknown).\n2. I will then count the number of rows where the 'type' column value is 'primary'. If this count equals 11, then the claim is true; if it's less than 11, then the claim is false.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Check each row in the 'type' column for the value 'primary'.\",\n    \"Step 2: Count the number of rows with a value of 'primary' and compare it to the total number of schools (11).\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
