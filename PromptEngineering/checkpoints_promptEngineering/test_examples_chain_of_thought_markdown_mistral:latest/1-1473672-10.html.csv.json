    "resp": "Here are the steps to verify the claim:\n\n1. Identify the column that contains the player positions and the column that lists the draft picks. In this table, the position column is labeled \"position\" and the draft pick column can be determined by observing the numerical values in the leftmost column.\n\n2. Examine the row corresponding to rene lambert (146th pick). Check the value in the position column for that row to determine his playing position.\n\n3. Compare the playing position of rene lambert with the claim's statement. The claim mentions that rene lambert plays right wing, so we need to check if the position listed for rene lambert is \"right wing\".\n\n4. Draw a conclusion based on the information found in steps 2 and 3: If the playing position of rene lambert (found in step 2) matches the claim's statement (\"right wing\"), then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let us present the result using the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify position column and draft pick column\", \"Examine row 146 for rene lambert\", \"Check if playing position matches claim's statement\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
