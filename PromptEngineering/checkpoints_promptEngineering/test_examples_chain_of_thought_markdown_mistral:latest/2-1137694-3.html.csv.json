    "resp": "Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which drivers appear in the table. We see two drivers in the 'winning driver' column: Mika H\u00e4kkinen and Michael Schumacher.\n2. Next, we should look for the constructor associated with each driver. We do this by checking the 'winning constructor' column. For Mika H\u00e4kkinen, we find McLaren - Mercedes while for Michael Schumacher, we find Ferrari.\n3. Finally, we compare the constructors of the two drivers to determine if they are the same or different.\n\nThe claim is: \"both michael schumacher and david courtland drive ferraris\"\n\nThe relevant cells in this case are:\n- {row_index: 3, column_name: 'winning driver'}, {row_index: 3, column_name: 'winning constructor'}\n- {row_index: 7, column_name: 'winning driver'}, {row_index: 7, column_name: 'winning constructor'}\n- {row_index: 10, column_name: 'winning driver'}, {row_index: 10, column_name: 'winning constructor'}\n- {row_index: 13, column_name: 'winning driver'}, {row_index: 13, column_name: 'winning constructor'}\n- {row_index: 15, column_name: 'winning driver'}, {row_index: 15, column_name: 'winning constructor'}\n- {row_index: 16, column_name: 'winning driver'}, {row_index: 16, column_name: 'winning constructor'}\n\nIn the relevant cells, we can see that Michael Schumacher drives a Ferrari in all the races where he appears as the winning driver.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identify the drivers and their associated constructors by examining the 'winning driver' and 'winning constructor' columns.
