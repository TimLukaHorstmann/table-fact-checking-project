This will allow us to compare schools with lower enrollment numbers first.\n   2. Next, we identify the school located in Newark, DE, which is the \"university of delaware\". Its enrollment is 19067 students (as per the table).\n   3. We then move on to the remaining schools and compare their enrollments with that of the University of Delaware. The next school, Lebanon Valley College has an enrollment of 2100 students. Since this number is less than the enrollment of the University of Delaware, we can conclude that it has a lower enrollment count.\n   4. However, since there are more schools to compare with, we need to check the remaining schools as well to confirm whether any other school has a smaller enrollment than Lebanon Valley College. But if we consider the rest of the schools (University of Rhode Island, Rutgers University, Stony Brook University, and West Chester University), their enrollments are all greater than that of Lebanon Valley College.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the claim is TRUE, as there is indeed a school with lower enrollment after the school located in Newark, DE (Lebanon Valley College).\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Sort the table by enrollment count in ascending order\", \"Identify the school located in Newark, DE\", \"Compare the enrollments of the remaining schools with that of the University of Delaware\", \"Check if there is any school with a smaller enrollment among the rest\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}]\n}",
