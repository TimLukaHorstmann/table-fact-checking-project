Determine the data source: The data provided in the table is related to tennis players and their statistics, but it does not explicitly state the year (1973) or the ranking of each player. However, we can assume that the rankings are based on the number of matches won since that is a common factor in determining tennis player rankings.\n\n3. Analyze the data: Compare the number of matches won by each player listed in the table.\n\n4. Find roscoe tanner's position and number of matches won: In our table, there are two players with 16 wins in the \"matches won\" column (row indices 8 and 9). Roscoe Tanner is at row index 9 (roscoe tanner | usa | 27 | 16), so his position among the players listed here is 9th.\n\n5. Compare the results: Since there are 9 players in our data, and the rankings are based on the number of matches won, the player with the most wins (the first ranked) must have more than 16 wins to surpass roscoe tanner. However, none of the listed players have more than 16 wins, so it is impossible for any player to have been ranked first if roscoe tanner had the fewest matches won among these players.\n\n6.
