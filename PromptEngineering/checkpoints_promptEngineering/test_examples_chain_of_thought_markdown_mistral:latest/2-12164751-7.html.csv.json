Adding up their values (824 + 838) gives us 1662 million euros, which is 34.4% of the total value of the top 5 clubs (1662/4686).\n\n3. Since we are looking for clubs with zero debt as %of value that are among the top 20%, we need to find out if 34.4% is greater than or equal to 20%. To do this, divide the total percentage (100%) by the number of clubs we have considered (20) and compare it to 34.4%:\n\n(100% / 20) >= 34.4% => 5% >= 34.4% which is FALSE.\n\nThe claim is not true since only two out of the top 20 football clubs have zero debt as %of value, but this percentage (2/20 = 10%) is less than 20%.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the top 5 most valuable football clubs based on their 'value (m)' column\",\n    \"Find clubs with zero debt as % of value among these\",\n    \"Calculate the combined value of those clubs and compare it to 20% of the total value of the top 5 clubs\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"debt as % of value\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"value (m)\" }\n  ]\n}",
