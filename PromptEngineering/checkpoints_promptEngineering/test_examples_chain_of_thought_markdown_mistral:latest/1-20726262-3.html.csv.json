The table contains information about various episodes of a television series, and the claim is \"brett conrad & liz sagal write fa guan in season 9\".\n\n2. Next, find the relevant rows in the table for the episode titled \"fa guan\" (row 22) and for season 9 (column no in season = 9). This gives us row_index = 22 and column_name = 'no in season'.\n\n3. Check the value of the cell at this position in the table. If it is equal to 9, then \"fa guan\" is in season 9. In our case, the value is 9.\n\n4. Now, identify the row for the episode titled \"fa guan\". The column 'title' should have the value 'fa guan'. This gives us row_index = 22 and column_name = 'title'.\n\n5. Check the values of the cells in the 'writtenby' column for this row (row_index = 22). If one of the values is either \"brett conrad\" or \"liz sagal\", then they are the writers for the episode \"fa guan\". In our case, the value for the first 'writtenby' cell in this row is \"stephen kay\", and there is no second 'writtenby' cell.\n\n6.
