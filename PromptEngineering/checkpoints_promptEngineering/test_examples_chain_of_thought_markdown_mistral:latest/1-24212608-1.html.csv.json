The viewer count of 9.73 can be found in the 6th row, as shown by the row_index 5 (since counting starts from 0).\n\n2.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the table's structure, which contains episode number, broadcast date, BBC One presenter(s), starring, Radio 1 presenter, viewers, and the corresponding values for each category.\n\n2. To answer the claim, we need to find the row where the broadcast date is 2010 and check if the BBC One presenter in that row matches the name \"myleene klass\".\n\n3. We go through the table row by row:\n   - Row 1 has a broadcast date of 2005, so we ignore it because it doesn't match our condition.\n   - Row 2 has a broadcast date of 2006, so we move to the next row.\n   - Row 3 has a broadcast date of 2007, so we move to the next row.\n   - Row 4 does not have an episode number (it's labeled as '5'), and the broadcast date is 2009. In this row, the BBC One presenter is \"myleene klass\", but it doesn't match our condition since the year is not 2010.\n   - Row 5 has a radio 1 presenter instead of a BBC One presenter for that episode, so we move to the next row.\n   - Finally, in Row 6, we find the BBC One presenter \"jake humphrey\", which does not match our condition of having \"myleene klass\" as the BBC One presenter. In Row 7, the same is true.\n   - Row 8 has a broadcast date of 2012, so it doesn't match our condition either.\n\n4.
