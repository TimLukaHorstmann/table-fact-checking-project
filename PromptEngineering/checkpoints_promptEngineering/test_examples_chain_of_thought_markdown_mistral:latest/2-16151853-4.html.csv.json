    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the total number of gold medals won by Italy from the table. Since the gold medal column for Italy has 0, we know that Italy won no gold medals.\n\n2. Check if Italy won more than 1 silver medal. In the silver medal column, Italy has 3 silver medals.\n\n3. Compare the number of silver medals won by Italy (3) with the total number of silver medals in the table (13). Since 3 is less than 13, Italy did not win more than 1 silver medal.\n\n4. Comparing the conditions stated in the claim with the facts found from the table, we can conclude that Italy won 0 gold medals and exactly 1 silver medal. Therefore, while it is true that Italy won 0 gold medals, the claim that they won more than 1 silver medal is false.\n\nOutput:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify gold medals for Italy (0), Check if Italy has more than 1 silver medal (3 < 13)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n  ]\n}",
