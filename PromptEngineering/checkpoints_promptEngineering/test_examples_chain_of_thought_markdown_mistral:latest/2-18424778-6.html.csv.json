Since the earliest date is our reference, we will consider this as the original release date.\n\n3. Check if there's a global digital release on iTunes 4 years after the original release. We can see that \"Black Ice\" was made available for digital download on iTunes on November 19th, 2012 (global - iTunes). Four years after October 17th, 2008 is October 17th, 2012, which is less than the given date.

In our table, we have albums released in Europe, Australia, United Kingdom (twice), United States, Japan, and Germany. However, some of these albums were released in different years or in a limited edition format that doesn't count as a separate release.
