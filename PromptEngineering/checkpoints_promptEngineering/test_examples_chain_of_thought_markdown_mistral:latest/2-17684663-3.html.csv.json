For Aprilia, we find 12 instances (rows). For Honda, we find 17 instances (rows).\n3. Compare the counts from steps 1 and 2. In this case, Honda has more instances than Aprilia, so Honda is the most commonly used manufacturer.\n4. The claim states that \"Aprilia be the second most manufactured brand that rider use\". Since we found out that Honda is the most common manufacturer, and we have already confirmed that Aprilia is not the most common, it follows that Aprilia must be the second most common.\n5. To confirm our answer, we can check if there are any other manufacturers with fewer instances than Aprilia. In this case, Yamaha has 2 instances (rows) which are less than Aprilia's 12 instances, but Honda still has more.
