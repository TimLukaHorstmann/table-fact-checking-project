    "resp": "1. Identify the subject of the claim: The claim states that there are 2 instances where a Detroit Pistons player tied for the most rebounds during a specific period of the 2010-2011 season.\n\n2. Determine which column in the table represents the number of rebounds by each Detroit Pistons player: The relevant column is \"high rebounds\".\n\n3. Identify all the rows where the team column equals \"Detroit\": We need to focus on the rows with \"team\" equal to \"Detroit\" as those represent games played by Detroit Pistons players.\n\n4. Examine each row in the relevant subset to find instances of ties: Look for rows where the value in the \"high rebounds\" column is repeated for more than one player on the same row (indicating a tie).\n\n5. Evaluate the results: If there are at least 2 such rows, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow let's check the relevant cells to verify the answer:\n\n- Relevant cells: [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" }\n]\n\nBy examining the highlighted rows, we can see that Greg Monroe tied for the most rebounds in games 1 and 3, and Austin Daye, Ben Gordon, and Chris Wilcox tied for the most rebounds in game 7. Since there are at least two instances of ties (games 1 and 3), the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify subject and relevant column;\", \"Find Detroit Pistons rows;\", \"Examine for ties in high rebounds column;\", \"Evaluate results.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" }\n  ]\n}",
