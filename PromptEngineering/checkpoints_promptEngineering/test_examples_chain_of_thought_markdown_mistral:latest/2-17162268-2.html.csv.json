The table provides information about various golfers, their countries, number of wins (total), strokes over par at the tournament (to par), finishing position (finish).\n\n2. To determine if Australia has the highest total out of all the players, we need to find the total for each player and compare them against the total for David Graham from Australia.\n\n3. We can see that the total column shows the number of strokes for each player. The total for David Graham is 302.\n\n4. We then compare this total with the totals for the other players in the table.
