    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team associated with Bemidji State University (wcha) from the table.\n2. Check if any player drafted by that team is from the United States.\n3. From the table, we can see that Steve Johnson (row_index=98) is drafted by Toronto Maple Leafs (which is represented in the table as a team associated with Bemidji State University).\n4. We also know that Steve Johnson's nationality is not mentioned in the table, but based on the fact that Bemidji State University is located in the United States, it can be assumed that he is from the United States.\n5. Therefore, it can be concluded that a player (Steve Johnson) drafted by Toronto Maple Leafs is indeed from the United States.\n\nNow, here's my final answer as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team associated with Bemidji State University (wcha).\",\n    \"Check if any player drafted by that team is from the United States.\",\n    \"Determine that Steve Johnson is drafted by Toronto Maple Leafs and assume his nationality to be American since BSU is located in the US.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 98,\n      \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 98,\n      \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This statement implies that there exists a player who was drafted by the New York Rangers and played for the Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (QMJHL), in addition to being a defenseman.\n\n2. Next, I go through each row of the table looking for players who meet the given criteria:\n   - Row 97 has Jean-Denis Royal as a defender and the college/junior team listed is Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (QMJHL), which is relevant. However, the drafted NHL team is New York Rangers.\n   - No other rows in the table meet all the criteria for the claim.\n\n3. Finally, I conclude that there exists a player in the provided table who was drafted by the New York Rangers and played for the Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Alouettes (QMJHL), but they are not a defenseman as per the given claim.

Identify the key piece of information required to verify the claim - whether any player listed in the table has a college/junior/club team that is associated with the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n2. Scan through the table to find players who attended Bemidji State University (relevant column: college / junior / club team).\n3. Check if any of those players have the Toronto Maple Leafs as their NHL team (relevant row for comparison: any row with a player attending Bemidji State University and another row with a player from Toronto Maple Leafs).\n4.
