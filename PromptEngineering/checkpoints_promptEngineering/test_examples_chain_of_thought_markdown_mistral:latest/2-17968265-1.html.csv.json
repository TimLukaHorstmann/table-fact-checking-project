    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the teams and seasons from the claim. The team is not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume it refers to a team that played 107 points in the season 1987 - 1988 since that's the only condition given in the claim.\n2. Find the row in the table that matches the conditions of the team playing 107 points in the 1987 - 1988 season. No such row is found, so it seems like there was no team that played exactly 107 points during this season according to the given data.\n3. The claim also mentions that when \"1987 - 88 be 31\". We can check if any row has a value of 31 in the column named \"played\" for the year 1987 - 1988. No such row is found, so it seems like there was no team that played exactly 31 games during this season according to the given data.\n4. Since we couldn't find a match for any of the conditions specified in the claim, it appears that the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams and seasons from the claim\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that matches the conditions of the team playing 107 points in the 1987 - 1988 season\",\n    \"Check if any row has a value of 31 in the column named 'played' for the year 1987 - 1988\",\n    \"Since we couldn't find a match for any of the conditions specified in the claim, it appears that the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
