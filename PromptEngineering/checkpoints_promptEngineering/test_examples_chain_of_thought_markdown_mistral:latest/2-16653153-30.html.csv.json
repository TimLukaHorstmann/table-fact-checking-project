In the table, the column name for away wins is \"away\" and the column name for away losses is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as the negative of the total points scored at away games (since points are subtracted). To calculate this, we take the total points value for each team's away games and subtract it from 100 (since their total points are shown as a percentage).\n3. For the South Dragons, their away record can be calculated by taking 100 - 9 (their total points scored at away games) = 91. For the Melbourne Tigers, this is 100 - 6 = 94.\n4.
