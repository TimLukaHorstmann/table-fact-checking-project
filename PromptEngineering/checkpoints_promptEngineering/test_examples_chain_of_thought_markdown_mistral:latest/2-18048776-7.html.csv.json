    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the player who has the lowest score, which indicates the winner of the championship according to the table.\n2. Calculate the score of Vijay Singh by adding the four scores in his row (70 + 66 + 67 + 68 = 271) and compare it with the scores of other players.\n3. Verify if Vijay Singh's score is indeed the lowest, which would make him the winner.\n4. Calculate Vijay Singh's score under par by subtracting his score from the par for each round (usually 72 in golf) and summing the differences. Since par was not explicitly given in the table, we can assume a total par of 288 for the four rounds (4 * 72).\n5. Check if Vijay Singh is 9 under par by calculating his to-par score (288 - 271 = 17) and verify that he has a score of 9 under par.\n6. Determine how many strokes ahead of the second-place player Vijay Singh is, which would be relevant for the claim about being two strokes in front.\n\nAfter performing these steps:\n\nThe winner of the championship based on the table is Vijay Singh with a score of 271. His score under par is calculated as (4 * 72) - 271 = 17, so he is indeed 9 under par.
