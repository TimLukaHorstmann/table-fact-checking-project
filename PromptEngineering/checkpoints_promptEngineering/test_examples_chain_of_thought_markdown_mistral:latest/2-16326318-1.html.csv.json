Calculate the qualification times for each driver by converting the time values from minutes:seconds format to seconds and adding them up (Note that the table already includes seconds, but I will do it again to be consistent). For example, 1:15.978 becomes 60*1 + 15.978 = 66.978 seconds.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of drivers (n) in the table. In this case, n=14.\n\n3. Multiply each driver's qualification time by the count of qualifying attempts for that driver (which is always 2 since there are two qualifying sessions). Sum up all these products to get the total time in seconds.\n\n4. Divide the total time by 2 (since we multiplied it by 2 in step 3) and then divide that result by n to get the average qualification time in seconds.\n\n5. Convert the average time from seconds to the format used in the table, which is minutes:seconds. To do this, convert the decimal part of the average time to seconds (e.g., 0.342 becomes 34.2), divide that value by 60 to get the number of minutes, and round it to two decimal places. Then add the integer part of the average time (e.g., 56 in our example) as minutes, with a colon separator. The result should be in the format 'minutes:seconds'.\n\nNow, let's check the table values for the claimed average qualifying time:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Calculate the total of all qualification times in seconds\",\n    \"Divide that total by the number of drivers to get the average qualification time in seconds\",\n    \"Convert the average time from seconds to minutes:seconds format\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"qual 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"qual 1\"},\n    ...\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"qual 2\"}\n  ]\n}",
