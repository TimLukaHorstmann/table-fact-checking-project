However, in this case, we don't have enough information about the distribution of players from each state across colleges to make such an assumption.\n   4.

To determine if James Campbell is one of the three players originating from Oklahoma, I search for players who have 'oklahoma city' or 'oklahoma' as their college and 'united states' as their nationality.\n5. In the table, we find James Campbell, who has both \"oklahoma city\" (in the college column) and \"united states\" (in the nationality column). This means that he is a player from Oklahoma.\n6. There are four players with these characteristics in the table: Ralph Sampson (row 1), Chuck Barnett (row 5), James Campbell (row 9), and Jim Stack (row 6), but since their pick numbers are different, they cannot all be the same player.
