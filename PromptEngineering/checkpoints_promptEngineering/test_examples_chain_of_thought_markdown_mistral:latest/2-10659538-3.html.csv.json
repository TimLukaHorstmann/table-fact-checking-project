    "resp": "1. First, we identify the row that corresponds to the game played by the Indianapolis Colts. To do this, we look for the opponent's name (Indianapolis Colts) in the \"opponent\" column.\n2. Second, we find the corresponding attendance value for the identified row. In this table, the attendance values are located in the \"attendance\" column.\n3. Finally, we compare the attendance value found in step 2 with the claim's specified attendance number (66084). If the two numbers match, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row that corresponds to Indianapolis Colts\",\n    \"Find the corresponding attendance value for the identified row (in the 'attendance' column)\",\n    \"Compare the found attendance value with the specified attendance number in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "Here are the steps to follow for determining the truthfulness of the claim:\n\n1. First, we will identify the row corresponding to week 8. The table shows weeks starting from 1 and going up to 17, so there's no row for week 8 as it hasn't been filled in yet. However, this doesn't affect our ability to verify or refute the claim about week 7 since that data is available.\n\n2. Next, we look for the row where the \"record\" column has a value of 6 - 1 (meaning 6 wins and 1 loss). From the table, this only corresponds to week 7 with the result \"l 34 - 31\".\n\n3. Finally, we check the attendance value for that row. In this case, it's 34 - 31 = 3, which is not a valid attendance value as it should be the number of people who attended the game (not the score difference). However, since there seems to be a mistake in the table itself, we cannot rely on the given attendance value.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to definitively determine whether the claim is true or false, I'll provide an answer that reflects this ambiguity:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check for a row where the record column has a value of 6 - 1\",\n    \"Identify the attendance value for that row if it exists\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
