The relevant rows are 1, 8, 9, and 18.\n3. Check if any of these gold medals were won during the time period 1995-2009. In row 1 (1995), the beer won a 'runner up' prize rather than a gold medal. In row 8, the beer won a gold medal in 2008 which is outside of the specified time period. In row 9, the beer won a gold medal in 2009, but it also won another gold medal in a different competition in the same year (row 18). We can only count one gold medal per beer per year, so we consider this as a single gold medal. In row 18, the beer won a gold medal in 1995 which is within the specified time period.\n4. The claim is that 'West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter Healer beer win 3 gold medals between 1995 and 2009'.

Identify the claim: The claim states that \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild has won a gold medal every single instance in which it wins a prize between 1995 and 2009\".\n\n2. Determine the condition to check: In this case, the condition is when the beer name is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and the prize is a gold medal within the years 1995-2009.\n\n3. Iterate through the table and compare each row with the determined condition:\n   - Row 1: Not relevant as it's not between 1995-2009.\n   - Row 2: Not relevant as it's not \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" or a gold medal.\n   - Row 3: The beer is not \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\", so not relevant.\n   - Row 4: The prize is not a gold medal, so not relevant.\n   - Rows 5 to 7 (2002): The beer is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and it has won a gold medal in the right year, so these rows are relevant.\n   - Row 8: Not relevant as it's not between 1995-2009.\n   - Row 9: The prize is not a gold medal, so not relevant.\n   - Rows 10 to 12 (2005): The beer is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and it has won a gold medal in the right year, so these rows are relevant.\n   - Row 13: Not relevant as it's not between 1995-2009.\n   - Row 14: The prize is not a gold medal, so not relevant.\n   - Rows 15 to 17 (2006): The beer is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and it has won a silver medal in the right year, so these rows are not relevant since we're looking for gold medals.\n   - Row 18: Not relevant as it's not between 1995-2009.\n   - Row 19: The prize is not a gold medal, so not relevant.\n   - Rows 20 to 22 (2007): The beer is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and it has won a silver medal in the right year, so these rows are not relevant since we're looking for gold medals.\n   - Row 23: Not relevant as it's not between 1995-2009.\n   - Row 24: The prize is not a gold medal, so not relevant.\n   - Rows 25 to 27 (2008): The beer is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and it has won a silver medal in the right year, so these rows are not relevant since we're looking for gold medals. However, it's worth noting that there's a gold medal win for this beer in 2008 (for best local beer), but it was not specifically a gold medal for \"mild\".\n   - Row 28: Not relevant as it's not between 1995-2009.\n   - Row 29: The prize is not a gold medal, so not relevant.\n   - Rows 30 to 32 (2009): The beer is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and it has won a gold medal in the right year for best local beer and in category at Camra Reading Branch Beer Festival, but it was not specifically a gold medal for \"mild\". Also, there's another gold medal win for this beer in 2009 (at the London and South East Regional Competition), but it was not specified if it was for \"mild\" or not.\n\n4. Analyze the results: Out of a total of 32 rows, we found 7 relevant rows where \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" won a gold medal between 1995 and 2009. However, only 3 out of these 7 instances were specifically for \"mild\".\n\n5. Output the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Determine the condition\",\n    \"Iterate through the table and compare each row with the determined condition\",\n    \"Analyze the results\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prize\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"prize\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"prize\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"prize\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"year\" }\n  ]\n}",
