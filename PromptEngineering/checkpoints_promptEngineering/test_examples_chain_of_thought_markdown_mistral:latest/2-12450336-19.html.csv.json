    "resp": "Here are the steps I've taken to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what the table represents. Given the context, it appears to be a summary of UEFA Cup (or Europa League) matches from the 2008-09 season, including details such as team names, aggregate scores, and results from each leg of the match.\n\n2. Next, I need to determine whether there are any teams that scored 4 goals in aggregate during the two legs of their respective matches. To do this, I will go through each row and check the 'agg' column for values equal to or greater than 4.\n\n3. Upon inspection, I find that Marseille and Hamburg scored 4 goals in aggregate (Marseille with a score of 4-3 against Ajax, and Hamburg with a score of 4-3 against Galatasaray).
