After finding the venue with the least amount of crowd, verify if it is the one when Essendon plays Collingwood.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}, ..., {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}, ..., {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]\n\nThe final answer will depend on the comparison of crowd sizes at each venue. Let's assume that brunswick street oval has the least amount of crowd among all venues. If Essendon plays Collingwood at brunswick street oval, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nTo determine if Essendon plays Collingwood at brunswick street oval, we need to check the home and away teams for each venue:\n- If a team's name is identical to \"essendon\" or \"collingwood,\" that team is playing at that venue.\n\nRelevant cells for this comparison:\n- [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}]\n- [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}]\n\nBased on the comparison of home and away teams, if Essendon plays Collingwood at brunswick street oval, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nThe final answer will be in this format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"<explained steps here>\",\n  \"answer\": \"<final determination based on comparison of crowd sizes and home/away teams>\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ list of relevant cells as objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\" ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the home team mentioned in the claim, which is Essendon.\n2. Locate the row corresponding to the home team Essendon in the table. In this case, it's the 6th row with the values `essendon`, `12.16 (88)`.\n3. Identify the away team mentioned in the claim, which is Collingwood.\n4. Locate the row corresponding to the away team Collingwood in the table. In this case, it's the 6th row as well with the values `collingwood`, `13.10 (88)`.\n5. Compare the score of the home team Essendon and the away team Collingwood from the identified rows. The score for Essendon is `12.16 (88)` and for Collingwood is `13.10 (88)`. Since `12.16 < 13.10`, it means that Collingwood has a higher score than Essendon in this specific game.\n6. However, the claim states that \"Essendon have the highest amount of points on the table with 25.29 (179) and collingwood have the lowest with 8.15 (63)\". To verify this statement, we need to compare the total scores for each team across all games, not just the game between Essendon and Collingwood.\n7. Scan through the table again and identify the row where the home team has the highest score of `25.29 (179)`. In this case, it's the 2nd row with the values `fitzroy`, `25.29 (179)`. The corresponding column for the team name is 'home team'.\n8. Identify the row where the home team has the lowest score of `8.15 (63)`. In this case, it's the 5th row with the values `richmond`, `8.8 (56)`. The corresponding column for the team name is 'home team'.\n9. Compare the total scores for each team across all games. Since `25.29 > 8.15`, it's true that Fitzroy (in this case) has the highest amount of points on the table and Richmond has the lowest. However, the claim states that Essendon has the highest points, which is not correct based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify home team (Essendon) and away team (Collingwood)\",\n    \"Find the corresponding rows for each team\",\n    \"Compare their scores in the identified rows\",\n    \"Verify if Essendon has the highest score across all games and Collingwood has the lowest\",\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" }\n  ]\n}",
