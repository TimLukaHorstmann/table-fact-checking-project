    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will identify the total points scored by Kevin Martin in each game from the table (score column).\n2. Then, compare these scores to determine if there is a game where he did not score the highest amount of points singularly.\n3. If all his scores are the highest in their respective games, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's check the total points scored by Kevin Martin in each game:\n- Game 76: Kevin Martin scored 33 points\n- Game 77: Kevin Martin scored 35 points (highest single score)\n- Game 78: Kevin Martin scored 30 points\n- Game 79: Kevin Martin scored 21 points\n- Game 80: Kevin Martin scored 16 points\n- Game 81: Kevin Martin scored 28 points\n\nSince Kevin Martin's score in all games (except game 80) is not the highest in his respective game, but still higher than others in that particular game, we have to check game 80. In game 80, there are multiple players with the same number of points as Kevin Martin (16). However, this does not contradict the claim since the claim specifies \"highest amount of point singularly,\" which is not met in this case.\n\nSince Kevin Martin scored the highest amount of points singularly for all games except game 80, and his score in game 80 is tied with other players, we cannot confirm that he had the highest single score for every game. Thus, let's mark the claim as \"FALSE.\"\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Kevin Martin's points scored in each game\",\n    \"Compare his scores to determine if he scored the highest amount of points singularly for all games\",\n    \"Find out whether the claim is true or false based on our comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",

To verify this claim, we need to check if Brad Miller scored the highest points in each game where he played and then check if there is a game (April 11) where someone else had a higher score than Brad Miller.\n4. We see that Brad Miller didn't play in the April 11 game since his name isn't present in that row.\n5. For the remaining games, we look at the \"score\" column and the \"team\" column to check if Brad Miller scored the highest points in those games:\n   - In game 76 (April 1, San Antonio): Kevin Martin scored 33 points, not Brad Miller.\n   - In game 77 (April 3, Atlanta): Kevin Martin scored 35 points, not Brad Miller.\n   - In game 78 (April 5, Sacramento): Kevin Martin didn't score the highest points; there were multiple players with 30 points (Kevin Martin and Chuck Hayes).\n   - In game 79 (April 6, New Orleans): Kevin Martin scored 21 points, not Brad Miller.\n   - In game 80 (April 9, LA Clippers), there were three players with 16 points each: Chase Budinger, Kevin Martin, and Brad Miller.
