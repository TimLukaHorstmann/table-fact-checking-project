However, since the table lists medal winners for different years and locations, we can check if Nadia al - moutawaa won any gold medals in any year. If she did, then we move on to step 3. If not, then the claim is FALSE because it would be impossible for her to have won the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games without winning a gold medal in any event.\n\n3. In the table, Nadia al - moutawaa won gold in the year 1982 in New Delhi. This means she has won a gold medal in some event in the past, but we cannot determine if it was equestrian based on the given data.\n\n4. Now, we check if Nadia al - moutawaa won a silver medal in another year. In the table, she won silver in the same year (1982) that she won gold.\n\n5.
