Identify the tournaments mentioned in the claim - pga championship, Brian Watt (as he's not provided, I will assume he participates in the same events as the other tournaments), us open.\n2. Find the number of cuts made for each tournament from the table. For simplicity, let x be the number of cuts made by Brian Watt at any given tournament, and y be the number of cuts made by the other tournaments at that same event. In this case, since we don't have data on Brian Watt, we will use the cuts made by all other tournaments (excluding pga championship) as both x and y.\n3. Calculate the difference in the number of cuts made between the us open and the pga championship.
