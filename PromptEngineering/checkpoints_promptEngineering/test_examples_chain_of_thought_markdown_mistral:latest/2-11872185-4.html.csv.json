Next, we check if there is any row where the \"year\" column value is before 2009 and the \"lifetime india distributor share\" is not empty or null. However, in our table, all rows with a non-empty \"lifetime india distributor share\" have years equal to or greater than 2009.\n3.

    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I need to identify the release year of each movie listed in the table. This will allow me to compare them with the year 2009, which corresponds to \"ek tha tiger\".\n2. From the table, it's evident that the release years for the movies are listed in the \"year\" column. I will go through each row and note down the corresponding year.\n3. By scanning the table, I can see that \"ek tha tiger\" was released in 2012 (row number 2). Comparing this with the other release years, I will determine if any movie from the list was released in 2009.\n4. No movie listed in the table has a year matching 2009.

The table provides information about various movies including their rank, title, year of release, studio(s), and the lifetime distributor share in India.\n2. To determine if \"agneepath\" was released first, we need to compare the \"year\" column for all rows where the movie title is \"agneepath\".\n3. There is only one row with the movie title as \"agneepath\", and its year is listed as 2012 (row_index: 9).\n4. We then check the other rows to see if there are any movies that were released before \"agneepath\" (year < 2012). However, since all the other movies in the table have years that are equal or later than 2012, we can conclude that none of the movies were released before \"agneepath\".\n5.
