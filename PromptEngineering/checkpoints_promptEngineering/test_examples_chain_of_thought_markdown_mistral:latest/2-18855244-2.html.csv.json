Therefore, his total number of medals is:\n     1 * 3 + 1 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 6 * 1 = 10 medals\n   - For Larisa Latynina, we can see that she has 2 instances where she won 1 medal, 1 instance where she won 2 medals, and 7 instances where she won 1 gold medal. Therefore, her total number of medals is:\n     2 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 7 * 1 = 10 medals\n3.
