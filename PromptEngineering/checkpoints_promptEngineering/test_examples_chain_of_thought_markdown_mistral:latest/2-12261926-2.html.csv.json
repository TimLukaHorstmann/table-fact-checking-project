In these stages, silvio martinello and stefano zanini have different values, indicating they are ranked differently based on their points accumulated at those stages. However, starting from stage 15, all riders except for pavel tonkov and fabrizio guidi share the same value (fabrizio guidi), suggesting that only these two riders were in contention for the points classification after stage 14.\n3. To confirm our suspicion, look at the final row, which represents the overall standing of the race. Here we can see that pavel tonkov is first in the points classification and fabrizio guidi is second. However, since no rider has a higher points value than pavel tonkov before stage 15, it implies that only pavel tonkov could have been leading the point classification after stage 14, which would make fabrizio guidi the only other rider in contention and thus the only one with any points left to be counted.\n4.
