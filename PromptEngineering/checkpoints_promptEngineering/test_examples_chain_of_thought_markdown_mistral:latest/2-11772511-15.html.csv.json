    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to answer the question:\n\n1. Identify the player whose position is either c or w (Brandon Sutter) from the table.\n2. Note down the round number where Brandon Sutter's information is provided (round 1).\n3. Determine if there is any additional information about the draft round for this player in the table. No such information was provided for Brandon Sutter.\n4. In professional sports like hockey, being drafted in the first round usually indicates that a player was selected during the first round of the draft. Since Brandon Sutter was drafted in round 1 and there's no contradictory information about his draft round, it is reasonable to assume he was indeed drafted in the first round.\n\nWith this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify player whose position is either c or w (Brandon Sutter)\",\n    \"Note down Brandon Sutter's draft round (round 1)\",\n    \"Determine if there is any additional information about the draft round for this player\",\n    \"Consider that being drafted in the first round usually indicates selection during the first round of the draft\",\n    \"Since Brandon Sutter was drafted in round 1 and no contradictory information provided, assume he was drafted in the first round\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
