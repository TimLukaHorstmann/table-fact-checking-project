Read the table and understand its structure, i.e., there are four columns: episode number, season number, format type, and title of the episode. Each row contains information about one episode.\n2. Identify the episode whose number is 223, which can be found in the first column of the 15th row.\n3. Check the format type of the identified episode by looking at its corresponding cell in the third column of the same row. In this case, it's 'q146'.\n4.
