This can be done by looking at the \"difference\" column in the table.\n3. We see that the values for the \"difference\" column are 8, 10, 4, 3, -10, 0, -2, -10, and -13 respectively.\n4. To find pairs with equal goal differences, we compare each difference value to every other difference value in the list.\n5. Comparing the first number (8) with all others, it is not equal to any of them. Moving on to the second number (10), we find that there are no more occurrences of this exact value. Continuing our check through the remaining numbers in the list, we don't find any other pairs with matching goal differences.\n6.
