    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the hand that matches the claim - In this case, it's four aces.\n2. Find the corresponding credits for that hand - The table shows that 4 credits yield 640, so we can find the value for other credit amounts by scaling proportionally.\n3. Calculate the value for 5 credits - Since there's no direct value for 5 credits, we scale up from 4 credits. The ratio is (value at 5 credits) / (value at 4 credits) = (number of credits) / 4, which gives us 5/4 * 640 = 800.\n4. Calculate the value for 1 credit - To find the value for 1 credit, we scale down from 4 credits. The ratio is (value at 1 credit) / (value at 4 credits) = (1/number of credits), which gives us 1/4 * 640 = 160.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the hand that matches the claim - Four Aces, Find the corresponding credits for that hand - 640 for 4 credits, Calculate the value for 5 credits - Scaling up from 4 credits (5/4 * 640 = 800), Calculate the value for 1 credit - Scaling down from 4 credits (1/4 * 640 = 160)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"4 credits\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"5 credits\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"1 credit\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
