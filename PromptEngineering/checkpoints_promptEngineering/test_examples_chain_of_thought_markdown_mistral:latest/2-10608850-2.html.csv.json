    "resp": "Chain of Thought:\n1. First, we need to understand the claim. The claim states that the majority of locomotives when built and withdrawn cannot handle non-empty timestamp arguments. However, the table does not contain any timestamp data, it only contains years for the date of build and withdrawal.\n2. Since the table does not have any timestamp data, we cannot determine whether the majority of locomotives' dates (as years) can handle non-empty timestamp arguments as per the claim. The claim is comparing two different types of data structures (timestamps vs years), which are not directly comparable in this context.\n3. To validate this conclusion, we could assume that if a year can be converted to a date object with a specific month and day (e.g., January 1st), then it could theoretically handle a non-empty timestamp argument. However, the table does not provide any additional information about whether these years correspond to specific dates or not, making such an assumption invalid.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the majority of locomotives when built and withdrawn cannot handle non-empty timestamp arguments\",\n    \"However, the table does not contain any timestamp data, it only contains years for the date of build and withdrawal\",\n    \"Since the table does not have any timestamp data, we cannot determine whether the majority of locomotives' dates (as years) can handle non-empty timestamp arguments as per the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

Count the number of rows where the \"builder\" column equals 'brighton' (m=106, since some rows have empty cells for the 'builder' column)\n3. Calculate the proportion of rows with 'brighton' as the builder by dividing the count found in step 2 by the total number of rows (proportion = m/n = 106/112 approximately equals 0.947 or 94.7%)\n4. Compare the calculated proportion to the claim that \"nearly all\" means almost every single item belongs to a specific category, which in this case is 'brighton'.
