Examine the table structure to determine if any data about listing frequency is provided. No such column exists in the table.\n3. If a column for listing frequency does not exist, we must infer the listing frequency by looking at the unique player names in each round and comparing them with their respective row indices.\n4. Iterate through the rows of the table and count the number of times each player appears:\n   - Player \"rob bellamy\" is only found in round 3 (one appearance), so he lists once.\n   - No other players appear only once, as they also have appearances in later rounds.\n5. Compare the results from step 4 with the claim: The claim states that no player should list more than once. Since \"rob bellamy\" is the only one who lists once, no other players should list more than once either.\n6. Check whether every player listed appears only once (i.e., not twice or more): All players listed are found to appear in multiple rounds, except for \"rob bellamy.\"\n7.
