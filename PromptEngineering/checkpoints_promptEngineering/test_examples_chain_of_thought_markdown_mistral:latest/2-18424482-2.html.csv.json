We start by looking at the first row, and observe that the duration for \"why baby why\" (in row 1) is 2 minutes 18 seconds.\n4. Subsequently, we check the remaining rows one by one:\n   - In row 2, the song's duration is 2 minutes 46 seconds, longer than that of \"why baby why\".\n   - In row 3, the song's duration is 2 minutes 59 seconds, also longer.\n   - In row 4, the song's duration is 4 minutes 21 seconds, definitely longer.\n   - In row 5, the song's duration is 4 minutes, but \"why baby why\" still has a shorter duration.\n   - In row 6, the song's duration is 2 minutes 35 seconds, longer than \"why baby why\".\n   - In row 7, the song's duration is 2 minutes 35 seconds, again equal to the length of \"why baby why\".
