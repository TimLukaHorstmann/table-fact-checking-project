    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we identify the agent for which we are checking the claim: cyanogen bromide.\n2. Next, we find the row corresponding to cyanogen bromide in the table. In this case, it is the fourth row (index 3).\n3. Then, we check the effectiveness as a blood agent for cyanogen bromide by looking at the column \"effectiveness as blood agent\" and finding its value in the fourth row: The value is 9.\n4. Similarly, to find the field stability of cyanogen bromide, we look at the column \"field stability\" and find its value in the fourth row: The value is also 5.\n5. Lastly, we compare the values obtained for effectiveness as a blood agent (9) and field stability (5) with the claim (\"cyanogen bromide have a field stability of 5 and effectiveness as a blood agent of 9\").\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the agent for which we are checking the claim\", \"Find the row corresponding to the agent in the table\", \"Check the value for effectiveness as a blood agent for the given agent\", \"Check the value for field stability for the given agent\", \"Compare the values obtained with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"effectiveness as blood agent\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"field stability\"}]\n}",

Compare the values in the table for cyanogen chloride with the values stated in the claim:\n   - Persistence, open area: The value in the table for cyanogen chloride in the \"persistence, open area\" column is 3.
