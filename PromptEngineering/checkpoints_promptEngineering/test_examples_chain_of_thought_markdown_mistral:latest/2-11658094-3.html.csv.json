Next, find the institutions that left their current conference before 1975. In the table, the relevant columns are \"joined\" and \"left\". The lenoir-ryne university joined in 1930 and left in 1975, which is a match for our criteria.\n\n3.

This will give us a list of potential institutions that could have left between 1975 and the current date.\n2. Narrow down this list by looking for institutions whose location is in North Carolina, as stated in the claim.\n3. From the remaining institutions, find the ones that were members (joined) before 1930 and left after 1967. This is because the table only provides data from 1930 to 2013, so any institution that left before 1967 will not have a 'left' value in the table.\n4.
