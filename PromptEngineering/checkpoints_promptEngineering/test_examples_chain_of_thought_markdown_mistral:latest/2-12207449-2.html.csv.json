Check the records of each game day: Starting from the first game on April 8th, check for a streak of four consecutive losses.\n\n3. Analyze the records: The record of the player on April 8th is 0-1 (loss). On April 9th, the record changed to 1-1 (win), so the losing streak ended there. On April 10th, another loss occurred for a different player, but the losing streak didn't extend beyond that game as the next day had a win.

If there's a match, the claim would be validated.\n3. Look for the game where the Blue Jays won with a score of 11-x. We know that the opposing team's score (\"y\") should not be equal to or greater than 11 because it is subtracted from 11, which means the Blue Jays would have lost if \"y\" were equal to or greater than 11.\n4. Check the opposing team for the game where the Blue Jays scored 11 runs. From the table, we find that the Blue Jays played the Rangers on April 22 and scored 10 - 1 (row 22). Since we need to find a game where the Blue Jays scored exactly 11, we look for another game against the Rangers and check their scores.\n5. We find a previous game against the Rangers where the Blue Jays scored 11 runs: April 21 with a score of 7 - 6 (row 21).

Observe that from April 10 to April 13, there is a sequence of three games with Blue Jays players losing (Harris, Gubicza, Stieb), which makes it a streak of 3 losses. However, from April 14 to April 22, there is no streak as some games were wins or had no record listed due to postponements.\n4. Start looking for the next sequence after the break, and find one starting from April 25 which continues until April 27 (Aase, Henke, Dixon). This forms a streak of 3 losses again.\n5. Finally, look at the game on April 19, and check if there is any other game in this sequence that has a shorter losing streak. In this case, the Blue Jays player lost on this day (Black) but was not part of the previous or subsequent losing streaks (as explained in steps 2 and 3).\n6.
