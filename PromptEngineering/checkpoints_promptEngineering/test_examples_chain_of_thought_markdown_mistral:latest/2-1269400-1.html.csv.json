Check the table for each event: For each event, find the row that corresponds to it in the table and check if there is any data related to \"relay\".\n3. Verify the positions: In the row corresponding to 1998 Nagano-Nozawa, there is no data for \"relay\", but the individual position is 47th. For 2002 Salt Lake City, the \"relay\" position is 9th and the individual position is 46th.\n4. Compare the results with the claim: The claim states that at the 1998 Nagano-Nozawa event, Tomasz Sikora was 5th in relay and in 2002 Salt Lake City he was 9th in relay. From the table, it can be seen that at the 1998 Nagano-Nozawa event, there is no data for \"relay\" for Tomasz Sikora, which means he did not participate in the relay event during that year. However, at the 2002 Salt Lake City event, Tomasz Sikora was indeed 9th in the relay event as per the table data.\n5. Conclusion: The claim is only partially correct since Tomasz Sikora was indeed 9th in the relay event during the 2002 Salt Lake City event but he did not participate in the relay event during the 1998 Nagano-Nozawa event as there is no data available for that.\n\nNow, here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the events and individual in question\",\n    \"Check the table for each event\",\n    \"Verify the positions at the specified events\",\n    \"Compare the results with the claim\",\n    \"Conclusion based on the comparison\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"relay\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"relay\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"individual\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"individual\" }\n  ]\n}",
