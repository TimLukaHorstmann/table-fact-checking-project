    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n1. First, identify the week and date where the game took place on December 14, 1986. The table shows that it was during Week 15 (row index 15).\n2. Next, find out who the opponent was for this game. By looking at the \"opponent\" column, we see that the opponent for this game was the New England Patriots.\n3. Finally, check if the result of the game against the New England Patriots on December 14, 1986 was a loss by the score of 34-3. By looking at the \"result\" column, we see that the result was indeed a loss by the score of 31-7, which is similar to the claimed score in the sense that it's a loss but not exactly as stated (34-3 instead of 31-7).\n\nSince the game was played on December 14, 1986 and it was a loss against the New England Patriots, the claim is somewhat true. However, the exact score given in the claim does not match the actual result from the table.\n\nHere's my output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row that contains the game played on December 14, 1986\", \"Identify the opponent for this game\", \"Check if the result of the game against the identified opponent was a loss by the score given in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE (but not exactly as claimed)\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":15,\"column_name\":\"date\"},{\"row_index\":15,\"column_name\":\"opponent\"},{\"row_index\":15,\"column_name\":\"result\"}]\n}",
