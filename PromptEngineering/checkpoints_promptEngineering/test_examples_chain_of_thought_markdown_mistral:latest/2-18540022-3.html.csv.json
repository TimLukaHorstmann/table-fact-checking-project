Find the row in the table that corresponds to this romaji title. In this case, it's the 9th row as the romaji title is located in the 9th row.\n3. Check the episodes column for the corresponding row. The number of episodes for 'regatta~kimi to ita eien~' is 9.\n4. Compare this number with the total episode count for all shows. To do this, add up the number of episodes for each show. In this table, there are 10 shows in total, and their total number of episodes are 11 (sapuri), 12 (fushin no toki ~woman wars~, kekkon dekinai otoko, hanayome wa yakudoshi!, my\u2606boss my\u2606hero), 12 (\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!, ca\u3068\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3063!), 10 (\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f), and 9 (\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e, shimokita sundays). The total episodes are 72.\n5. Compare the number of episodes for 'regatta~kimi to ita eien~' with the total number of episodes.

Next, we need to check if there is any other entry with a higher total number of episodes. For this, we compare the value in the row where the title is located ('regatta~kimi to ita eien~') with the value in the 'episodes' column for all rows. In our given table, the value for that cell is 9 (column_name='episodes', row_index=8).\n\n3. After checking all other cells in the 'episodes' column, it can be seen that there are no entries with a higher value than 9.\n\n4. Finally, we confirm that the title \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" has the highest episode count of 20 (since the table does not provide total episodes for each title).
