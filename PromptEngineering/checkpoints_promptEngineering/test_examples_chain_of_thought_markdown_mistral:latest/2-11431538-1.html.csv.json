From the given table, it can be observed that there are five columns: date, pilot, weapon systems officer, aircraft, tail code, call sign, and kill.\n2. Next, I will look for rows that contain the specific tail code (ed) in the \"tail code\" column. There's only one row in the table with a tail code of ed (in the second row).\n3. Then, I will check if the row containing the tail code ed has a call sign value of paula 01 in the 'call sign' column. The relevant cells for this step are: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n4. Upon inspecting the cell at row_index 1 and column_name call sign, I can see that it does indeed have the value paula 01.\n5.
