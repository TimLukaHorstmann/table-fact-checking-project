Check the table for the number of medals each nation won in football (gold, silver, and bronze are considered as different types of medals). Since no nation has any gold or silver medals, we will look at the bronze medals.\n\n3. Find the nations that have won a bronze medal. In this case, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil have won 1 bronze medal each.\n\n4. Check if any nation (other than Canada) has won more than 1 bronze medal. Since no other nation has won any additional medals, we can focus on Canada.\n\n5. Count the total number of medals that Canada has won. This can be done by adding up the values in the \"total\" row for the \"Canada\" column. In this case, Canada has 1 gold + 0 silver + 0 bronze = 1 medal.\n\n6. Compare the total number of medals won by Canada with the required number to disprove the claim (since the claim is that only Canada should have won more than 1 medal and other nations have won at most 1 medal, if Canada has also won only 1 medal, it would contradict the claim). In this case, since Canada has 1 medal, it does not meet the requirement of winning more than 1 medal.
