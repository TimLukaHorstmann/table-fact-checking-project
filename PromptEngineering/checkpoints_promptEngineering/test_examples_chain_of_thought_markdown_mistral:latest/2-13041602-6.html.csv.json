All dates should be in this format (MM-DD), but in the table they are in MM DD format, so we can treat it as-is.\n\n2. Next, we will find the game with the highest attendance. Sort the \"attendance\" column in descending order and find the row with the maximum value.\n\n3. Lastly, compare the pitcher's loss from this game with the other games to determine if they lost any game where the attendance was lower than this maximum attendance game. If there is a loss with a smaller attendance, then the claim is false because there is another game where the Brewers lost and had a smaller audience.\n\n4. If after checking all the games, we find that this maximum attendance game is the only loss for the Brewers or all losses have an equal or higher attendance, then the claim is true.\n\nNow let's check the table:\n\n1. Filtering the dates in August: row indices: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31]\n\n2. Finding the maximum attendance game: August 15 (row index: 15) with an attendance of 18596\n\n3. Checking for losses with lower attendance:\n   - From row indices [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14]: none of these games are losses for the Brewers.\n   - Row index 1 (August 2): this game is a loss for the Brewers, but the attendance was 32453 which is higher than the maximum attendance found in step 2.\n   - Row indices [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]: these games are all wins for the Brewers.\n   - Row index 23 (August 23): this game is a win for the Brewers with an attendance of 20318 which is lower than the maximum attendance found in step 2.\n   - Row indices [25, 26, 27, 28]: these games are all losses for the Brewers, but the attendances are equal to or higher than the maximum attendance found in step 2.\n   - Row index 30 (August 30) and row index 31 (August 31): these games are both wins for the Brewers.\n\n4.

The table does not provide any specific date information, so we cannot directly determine this from the given table. However, it might be reasonable to assume that a series of three consecutive games against the same opponent (if they exist) could imply that they are on the same day, though this is not explicitly stated.\n\n2. If there are three consecutive games against the same opponent, then the middle game should have a 50/50 win-loss record.
