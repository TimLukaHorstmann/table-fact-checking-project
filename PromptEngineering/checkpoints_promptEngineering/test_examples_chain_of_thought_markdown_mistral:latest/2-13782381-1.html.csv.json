    "resp": "Chain of Thought:\n1. First, find the row where the week number is 12 in the table. The data corresponds to the game between the New York Giants and the team (the Meadowlands' team, which we can assume is the New York Jets).\n2. Next, compare the result column of the found row with the claim's result \"28 - 17\". Note that the result is a loss for the Jets (since the score difference is negative).\n3. To evaluate the claim, it is necessary to know whether the average of the results for all games is supposed to be exactly 28-17 or if it is expected to be close in some way (e.g., within a certain range). However, without specific criteria for what \"average\" means in this context, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row corresponding to week 12\",\n    \"Compare the result of the game with the claim's result (28 - 17)\",\n    \"Determine if the average for all games is expected to match exactly or be close in some way\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
