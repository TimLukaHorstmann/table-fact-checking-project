Next, we need to check which constructor Nigel Mansell was driving for during these races. From the table, it is clear that he was driving a McLaren - TAG car in the Monaco Grand Prix (as race winner) and British Grand Prix (as race winner), but in the Belgian Grand Prix, he was driving a Williams - Honda car (as reported), and in the European Grand Prix, he was also driving a Williams - Honda car (as reported).\n3. Since the claim specifies \"mclaren - tag\" as the constructor for the race where Nigel Mansell ran the fastest lap, we need to see if there's a match between this condition and any of the races where he ran the fastest lap.

First, we need to look for a race where both the race location and the racer are the same as specified in the claim (\"spa - francorchamps\" and \"ayrton senna\").\n\n2. In the table, we find the Belgian grand prix with location \"spa - francorchamps\" on row 13 (since counting starts from 0) and the racer as \"ayrton senna\".\n\n3. We then check who won the race by looking at the \"race winner\" column for that specific row. In this case, it is \"alain prost\", which is different from the claim (\"ayrton senna\").\n\n4.
