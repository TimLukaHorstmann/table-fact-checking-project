Check the table to find out the total counties in Nevada. Since all the rows represent different counties in Nevada, we can assume that there are 14 counties in total.\n3. Count the number of rows where the 'gore %' value is greater than 0 (to account for any ties) and the 'bush %' value is less than 100%. This will give us the counties won by Gore.\n4. In this case, there is only one county, Clark county (row index: 1), where 'gore %' is greater than 0 and 'bush %' is less than 100%, which means it was won by Al Gore.\n5. Check the total vote count for each candidate in Clark county to verify if it's more for Gore or Bush. In this case, the 'gore' value (2191) is greater than the 'bush' value (6237), but since the percentages given in the table are relative to their respective counties and not the total votes, the claim doesn't necessarily have to be false due to a difference in vote counts.\n6.
