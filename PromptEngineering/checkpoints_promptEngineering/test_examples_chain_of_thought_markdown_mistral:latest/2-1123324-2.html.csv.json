In this table, we have Mika H\u00e4kkinen (row 1) and David Coulthard (row 2).\n\n2. Determine their finishing positions by looking at the 'grid' column, which indicates their starting position, and the 'laps' column, which shows the number of laps completed. Since they both completed all the laps without any issues, we can consider their grid positions as their final positions (as there were no retirements after the start).\n\n3. Verify if either Mika H\u00e4kkinen or David Coulthard finished in the first or second position. In this case, Mika H\u00e4kkinen started at the first position and completed the race, so he finished in the first position. David Coulthard started at the second position but had a slight time disadvantage due to being slower than Mika H\u00e4kkinen (+ 1.102 seconds).\n\n4. Compare the finishing positions of the McLaren-Mercedes drivers with the claim: The claim states that the McLaren-Mercedes constructor should take both the first and second position at the finish line.

Compare each driver's laps column to 72 (the total race laps), to see if they completed all the laps.\n3. Of the 23 drivers, only Mika Hakkinen, David Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen have a 'laps' value of 72.\n4. To confirm that these four drivers completed all the laps without any issues, check if their 'time / retired' column shows a time (indicating they finished the race) or if it has a '+' sign, indicating retirement. None of them have a '+' sign, which means they didn't retire.\n5. Since none of these drivers are marked as retiring (i.e., having a '+' sign in their 'time / retired' column), we can conclude that only 4 drivers completed all the 72 laps of the race at the 1998 Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nThe relevant cells for this reasoning are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" }\n]\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify total drivers, compare laps column with total laps (72), verify that they didn't retire by checking the 'time / retired' column.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" }\n  ]\n}",
