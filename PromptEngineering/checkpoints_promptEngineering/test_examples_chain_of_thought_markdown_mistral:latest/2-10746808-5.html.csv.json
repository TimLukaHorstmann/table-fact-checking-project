The away team scores are 12.17 (89) for Melbourne against Richmond and 11.7 (73) for South Melbourne against North Melbourne.\n\nSince the home team score is greater than the away team score in both matches, it indicates that Melbourne beat Richmond (122 > 89) and South Melbourne beat North Melbourne (75 > 73).\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare scores of Melbourne vs Richmond and South Melbourne vs North Melbourne from the table.\", \"Melbourne score is 19.8 (122), Richmond score is 12.17 (89).\", \"South Melbourne score is 10.15 (75), North Melbourne score is 11.7 (73).\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}]\n}",

For example, the first row has melbourne (home) vs richmond (away), the second row has essendon (home) vs st kilda (away), and so on.\n\n2. Obtain the score of the home team and away team from their respective columns in the table for each pair found in step 1. For example, for melbourne vs richmond, the scores are 19.8 (122) and 12.17 (89), respectively.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between the scores obtained in step 2 for each match pair. If the home team score is greater than the away team score, then this difference will be positive. Conversely, if the away team score is greater than the home team score, then this difference will be negative. For example, for melbourne vs richmond, the score difference would be (19.8 - 12.17) = 7.63 or approximately 8 points in favor of Melbourne (rounded down to the nearest whole number).\n\n4. Check whether any of the calculated differences from step 3 match the scores mentioned in the claim.
