    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to find out which club debuted after 1999 as per the claim. In the table, we have players from clubs like Roma (1992), Udinese (2002), Genoa (1999), Verona (2000), Parma (1999), Milan (2004), Juventus (2000), Inter (2008), and Chievo (n/a). Since the claim mentions that a club debuted after 1999, we can narrow our focus to Genoa, Verona, Parma, Milan, and Chievo.\n\n2. Second, we need to find players from the clubs mentioned in step 1 who scored less than or equal to 96 goals. We can see that only Chievo's club (as \"n/a\" suggests it was founded later) is not represented in the table. However, we have two players from Chievo, Sergio Pellissier and an unnamed player (Amauri).\n\n3. Third, we look up the number of goals scored by each player to find out if they collectively scored less than or equal to 96 goals. From the table, we can see that Amauri has scored 76 goals and Sergio Pellissier has scored 86 goals. Combined, they have scored 162 goals which is greater than the claimed 96 goals.\n\n4. Since the combined total of goals scored by Chievo's players (Amauri and Sergio Pellissier) is more than 96 goals, it means that the claim \"there be 96 goal achieve when chievo be the club which debut after 1999\" is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\" }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find clubs that debuted after 1999\",\n    \"Narrow down to clubs with players in the table\",\n    \"Look up number of goals scored by each player from those clubs\",\n    \"Check if combined total is less than or equal to 96 goals\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\" }\n  ]\n}",
