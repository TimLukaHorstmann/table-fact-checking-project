    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we identify the table column names and their corresponding tenses. From the table headers, we can see that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" is in the imperative tense and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is in the simple present tense.\n\n2. Next, we look at the definition of past habitual and probable future tenses. Past habitual is typically denoted by a verb + \u090f\u0901/\u0906\u092f\u094b/\u0925\u0947 or a verb + \u0913 for the third person singular. Probable future is usually denoted by adding -\u0932\u093e to the base form of the verb.\n\n3. In the table, we observe that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" is not associated with any of the forms that denote past habitual (i.e., \u090f\u0901/\u0906\u092f\u094b/\u0925\u0947 or \u0913). Also, \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\" doesn't follow the pattern of probable future (-\u0932\u093e) in the table.\n\n4. Similarly, we notice that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is not associated with any of the forms that denote probable future (i.e., adding -\u0932\u093e to the base form). However, it follows the pattern for simple present tense in the table.\n\n5. From our analysis above, we can conclude that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\" does not correspond to past habitual as per the given table definitions, and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\" does indeed correspond to simple present tense according to the table.\n\n6.

Since we have established that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\" is not the simple past and we know it refers to a probable future, we can conclude that it cannot be the simple future tense since it implies uncertainty or probability.\n6.

Understand the context of the table: The table provides the different verb forms in Nepalese language (Newa dialect) for various tenses and moods.\n3. Compare the claim with the table data: In the table, we can see that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\" is an imperative form (May you do), not a simple past form.
