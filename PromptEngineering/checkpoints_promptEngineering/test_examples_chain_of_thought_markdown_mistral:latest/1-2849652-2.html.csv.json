The relevant row has a \"season\" of fall and a \"sport\" of soccer.\n3. Check the \"1st tournament\" column for this row to see when the first state tournament was held for soccer in the table. If it's after 2011, then the claim is false as the table only goes up to 2012. However, in this case, the year provided (1985) is before 2011-2012, so we can continue our analysis.\n4. Check if there's a location given for the state tournament of soccer in the \"2011 - 2012 state tournament location\" column.

From the table, we find that gymnastics takes place during the winter season and had its state tournament in Hilliard Bradley High School in 1977. However, there is no row indicating the location of the state tournament for any other year within the given time frame (2011-2012) for gymnastics.\n\n3. Moving on to the next sport, swimming and diving, we find that it also takes place during the winter season and had its state tournament in Branin Natatorium, Canton in 1977. Similar to gymnastics, there is no row indicating the location of the state tournament for any other year within the given time frame (2011-2012) for swimming and diving.\n\n4. The last winter sport on the table is bowling. Examining this row, we find that its 2011 - 2012 state tournament location was at Wayne Webb's Columbus Bowl in Columbus.
