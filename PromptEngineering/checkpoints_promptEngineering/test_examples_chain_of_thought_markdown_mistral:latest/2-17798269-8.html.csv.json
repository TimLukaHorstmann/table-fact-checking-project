Next, we need to find out if any of these games had the highest attendance for the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009. We can do this by comparing each game's \"attendance\" value with the others.\n3. Looking at the table, the highest attendance is 22121 (row index 3) for the game against the Chicago Blackhawks on march 8.\n4. Since we found a game with higher attendance than any other in the table and this game was against the Chicago Blackhawks, it's possible that this game had the highest attended game for the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009.\n5. To confirm, we need to check if there are any games with equal or higher attendance not included in the table. If no such games exist, then the claim is true.\n6.

However, the table provided does not list the teams' names, only the opponents. We can infer that the team playing against the listed opponents is the home team in each game. Since we're looking for the highest scoring game of the Avalanche, we should look for the games where the opponent scored fewer goals than the Avalanche.\n\n2. Look for the rows where the \"score\" column shows a higher number for the left-side date (the first column) than the corresponding number in the \"opponent\" column. This will help us find the games where the Avalanche scored more goals than their opponent, and we can then check if any of these games had a higher score than the current highest score (3 - 2).\n\n3. We compare each game's score with the current highest score:\n   - The first game (row 1) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (4 vs. 2).\n   - The second game (row 2) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (3 vs. 2).\n   - The third game (row 3) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (5 vs. 1).\n   - The fourth game (row 4) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (3 vs. 0).\n   - The fifth game (row 5) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (2 vs. 1).\n   - The sixth game (row 6) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (3 vs. 2).\n   - The seventh game (row 7) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (4 vs. 2).\n   - The eighth game (row 8) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (3 vs. 2).\n   - The ninth game (row 9) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (8 vs. 1).\n   - The tenth game (row 10) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (3 vs. 1).\n   - The eleventh game (row 11) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (3 vs. 1).\n   - The twelfth game (row 12) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (4 vs. 2).\n   - The thirteenth game (row 13) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (7 vs. 2).\n   - The fourteenth game (row 14) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (4 vs. 1).\n   - The fifteenth game (row 15) is not relevant because the opponent scored more goals (4 vs. 2).\n\n4.
