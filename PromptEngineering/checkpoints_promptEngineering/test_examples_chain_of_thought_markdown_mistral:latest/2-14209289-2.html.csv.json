    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to find the row that corresponds to the match where Pittsburgh defeated Montreal. From the table, it's the row with the date \"october 15\".\n2. Next, we check the 'score' column for this row to determine Pittsburgh's score in that game. It is 2 - 5, indicating a loss for Pittsburgh.\n3. However, since the claim states that Pittsburgh defeated Montreal, it must be an error or misunderstanding in the question. In reality, the score should not change after each game, so the current record of Pittsburgh remains unchanged.\n4. Finally, we verify the current record of Pittsburgh. From the table, the latest row with Pittsburgh as 'home' is at index 9, and the 'record' column value is 5 - 0 - 2. Since there have been no games played since then, Pittsburgh's record should still be 5 - 0 - 2.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row corresponding to Pittsburgh vs Montreal match (row index 5), check Pittsburgh's score (2 - 5) and confirm that it doesn't match the claimed score (3), determine Pittsburgh's current record from the table (5 - 0 - 2) and verify it hasn't changed since then\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}",

Find the first game with Montreal as the visiting team which is on October 8th (row index 2).\n3. Check the record of Pittsburgh after this game. The record in the table shows that Pittsburgh has a 1 - 0 - 1 record, indicating one win, no losses, and one draw. This means the loss referenced in the claim has not occurred yet for Montreal at this point.\n4. Since the loss in question has not happened before October 15th, it is impossible for Montreal to have a 3 - 0 - 2 record before October 15th with Pittsburgh as their opponent (as per the game on October 8th).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check for games where Montreal was the visitor team before October 15th, find the first such game and its result, check Pittsburgh's record after this game to see if it matches the loss mentioned in the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}",
