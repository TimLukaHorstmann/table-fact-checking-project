Check if there's another fight involving Gabriel Veiga in which he lost in the third round. Note that the table only includes victories, so any subsequent losses would not be recorded here.\n\n3.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the column that contains the event duration, which is the 'time' column. This column provides the duration of each fight in minutes and seconds. However, the claim does not specify whether it is looking for the duration of a single round or the entire event. Since the event name is not provided in the table, it's impossible to determine the exact event duration.\n\n2. Identify the row that corresponds to takaichi hirayama, which is the 10th row as indicated by the 'win | 10 - 2' in the first column (res).\n\n3. In this row, check the 'time' column to see the duration of takaichi hirayama's fight. The time recorded for his fight is '1:25', which corresponds to 1 minute and 25 seconds. However, since there's no way to determine whether this is the total event duration or the duration of a single round, it's impossible to confirm if takaichi hirayama finished the event in 1.25 (1 minute and 25 seconds).\n\nGiven these steps, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false without more information about the event duration.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column that contains the event duration (time).\",\n    \"Check the row that corresponds to takaichi hirayama (10th row).\",\n    \"Inspect the 'time' cell of the identified row.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
