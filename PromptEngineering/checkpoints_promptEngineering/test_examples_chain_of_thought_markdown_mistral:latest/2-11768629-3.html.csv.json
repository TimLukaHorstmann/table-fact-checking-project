Each row represents a match, with columns for round, date, opponent, score, attendance, report.\n2. Scan through the rows to find a match where the date matches October 25th. Since the dates are listed in the \"date\" column, we compare this value across each row.\n3. Compare the opponents in the matching row with October 25th.
