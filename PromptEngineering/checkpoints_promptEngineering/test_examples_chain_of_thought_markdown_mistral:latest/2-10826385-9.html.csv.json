    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, identify the team for which we need to check the score - in this case, Geelong.\n2. Next, look through the table to find the row corresponding to Geelong. The relevant row is the 5th one with the \"home team\" column equal to \"geelong\".\n3. In that row, find the value for the \"away team score\" column - it's 16.13 (109).\n4. To answer the claim, we need to determine if Geelong lost their game and if they scored more points than all but 3 other teams.\n5. A team loses when their score is lower than their opponent's score. In this case, since we are comparing Geelong's score (16.13) with the \"home team score\" of other rows, we need to find home team scores that are greater than 16.13.\n6. By going through the table again, compare each home team score with Geelong's away team score:\n   a. footscray (12.9) < 16.13 - OK\n   b. fitzroy (12.25) < 16.13 - OK\n   c. essendon (15.17) > 16.13 - Not OK (this means Geelong lost to Essendon, but more than 3 teams scored less)\n   d. collingwood (28.16) > 16.13 - Not OK (This means Geelong lost to Collingwood, and they scored less than 3 other teams)\n   e. carlton (16.13) = 16.13 - This team scored the same as Geelong, so we will consider them one of the three teams that scored more points than Geelong\n   f. st kilda (9.19) < 16.13 - OK\n7. So, after checking all the scores, Geelong lost their game but scored more points than all but 2 other teams on May 27 (Carlton and Essendon).
