    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the structures or buildings that could be considered tallest in London.\n2. Determine the years they were tallest and compare them to find out which ones had a time gap of almost 3 centuries.\n3. Check if there is any building in Southwark that became the tallest during this period.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (Old St Paul's Cathedral location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (Southwark Cathedral location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (Monument to the Great Fire of London location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (St Mary - le - Bow location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (St Paul's Cathedral location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (Battersea Power Station location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (Crystal Palace transmitting station location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (One Canada Square location and years as tallest)\n- [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}] (Shard London Bridge location and years as tallest)\n\nThe relevant structures to consider are those that were tallest during the period of interest. From the table, we can see that Old St Paul's Cathedral was the tallest between 1310-1666, Southwark Cathedral between 1666-1677, Monument to the Great Fire of London between 1677-1683, St Mary - le - Bow between 1683-1710, and St Paul's Cathedral between 1710-1939. There is no structure in Southwark that became the tallest after 1677 until at least 1939. Since the claim states \"just under 3 century pass before southwark have the tallest building or structure,\" this statement is TRUE as there was a gap of about 244 years (from 1677 to the construction of Shard London Bridge in 2010) without any building in Southwark being the tallest.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify structures that were tallest in London\",\n    \"Compare their years as tallest to find gaps of almost 3 centuries\",\n    \"Check if there is any building in Southwark that became the tallest during this period\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n    // ... repeat for all the relevant cells in the table ...\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n  ]\n}",
