This would mean the score for both teams should be equal.\n\n2. Next, we need to count the number of such ties and check if any of them proceeded to penalty kicks.\n\n3. From the table:\n   - Toulouse FC vs OGC Nice, Lille OSC vs AJ Auxerre, Montpellier HSC vs FC Sochaux, Stade de Reims vs Le Havre AC are not tied at the end of regulation play (since scores for both teams are not equal).\n   - Fc Metz vs FC Mulhouse and FC Set\u00e9 vs RC Lens are not complete rounds yet.\n   - AEP Bourg sous la Roche vs Stade Quimperois, So Chartellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil are tied at the end of regulation play (1-1 and 0-0 respectively).\n\n4. Only two games were tied at the end of regulation play: AEP Bourg sous la Roche vs Stade Quimperois and So Chartellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil. None of these games proceeded to penalty kicks as the table doesn't provide information on that. However, it is not necessary for the claim to be accurate since it only states that 2 of those games go to penalty kick, not all.\n\n5. The claim can still be considered true because there are 3 tied games at the end of regulation play, and 2 of them (AEP Bourg sous la Roche vs Stade Quimperois, So Chartellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil) fit the description without requiring information about any possible penalty kicks.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games where scores for both teams are equal at the end of regulation play\",\n    \"Count the number of such ties and check if any proceeded to penalty kicks\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
