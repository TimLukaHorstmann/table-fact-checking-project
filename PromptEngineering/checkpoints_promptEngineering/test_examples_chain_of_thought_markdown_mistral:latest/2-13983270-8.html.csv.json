To determine if the record on August 24 was 70-50, I need to find the row in the table that corresponds to August 24 and compare the \"record\" column with the value 70-50.\n2. I will then look for a row where the \"date\" is August 24. In this table, dates are listed chronologically from left to right and top to bottom. I find the date on the diagonal going from the leftmost edge of the table to the row number 19 (since there are 19 rows in total), which corresponds to August 24.\n3. Now that I have found the correct row, I will check the \"record\" column for this row. If it matches 70-50, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nBased on my reasoning process:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to August 24\",\n    \"Check the 'record' column for this row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
