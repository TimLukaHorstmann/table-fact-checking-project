To do this, we will compare each pick value with the college of the player who made the pick (found in the row below).\n2. We start by checking the first row (round 1, pick 14) and find that the player making the pick is Chris Williams.\n3. Then, we look at the next row (round 2, pick 44) but this player (Matt Forte) did not make a pick in round 1, so we do not compare his college with pick 14.\n4. Next, we check the third row (round 3, pick 70) and find that Earl Bennett is the one who made the pick. However, Earl Bennett made pick 70, not pick 14.\n5. We continue this process for all rows but do not find a match between pick 14 and any college associated with a player who made a pick in an earlier round (rounds 1-6).\n6. Finally, we reach row 9 (pick 243) where the player, Joey Larocque, did not make a pick in any of the first 8 rounds, so again, we do not compare his college with pick 14.\n7.
