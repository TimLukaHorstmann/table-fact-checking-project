    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the rows in the table that correspond to the year 2012. In this case, there are two rows where the 'year' column equals 2012.\n\n2. Next, for each row, we compare the team names given in the 'winner' and 'loser' columns with Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs respectively. This is to determine if the given match-up (Oakland Raiders vs Kansas City Chiefs) took place in 2012. Both rows meet this criteria.\n\n3. Now, we need to check the location of each game. In the table, there are two possible locations for games between these teams in 2012: arrowhead stadium and oco coliseum. We look for a row where both the 'winner' and 'location' columns match Oakland Raiders and arrowhead stadium respectively AND the 'loser' column matches Kansas City Chiefs. Similarly, we also look for a row where the 'winner' and 'location' columns match Kansas City Chiefs and oco coliseum respectively AND the 'loser' column matches Oakland Raiders.\n\n4. We find one such row: the second row where the 'winner', 'loser', and 'location' are Oakland Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, and arrowhead stadium respectively. This game fulfills the condition that Oakland lost to Kansas City at arrowhead stadium in 2012 with a score of 31 - 10, which is not what the claim stated (15 - 0).\n\n5. We do not find any row that matches the given claim (Oakland Raiders lose to Kansas City Chiefs at arrowhead stadium with a result of 15 - 0 in 2012). Therefore, we conclude that the given claim is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify rows for year 2012, Check team match-ups, Determine game location, Find if Oakland lost to Kansas City at arrowhead stadium with a score of 15 - 0\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"loser\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\" }\n  ]\n}",
