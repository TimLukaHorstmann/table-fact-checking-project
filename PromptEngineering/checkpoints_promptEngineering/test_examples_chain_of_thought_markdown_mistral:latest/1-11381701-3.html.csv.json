This implies comparing the percentage of Windows to the sum of all other operating systems (excluding Blackberry, Symbian/Series 40, Bada, and IOS as they are not mentioned in the comparison).\n\n2.

We can calculate the difference between these two values as follows: `3.3% - 0.2% = 3.1%`.\n\n4. The claim states that \"Windows have a percentage of 1.80% lower when other be 0.3%\". To check if this is true, we can compare the calculated difference (3.1%) with the claimed difference (1.80%).\n\n5.
