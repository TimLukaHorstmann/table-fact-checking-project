    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the players who have 4 games played (nalchik) with an rl qualification and a jermuk score of less than 140. This will narrow down the list of players to consider.\n2. Examine the table for players meeting these criteria. The only player that matches is Peter Leko, as he has 4 games played (nalchik), an rl qualification, and a jermuk score of 100.\n3. Compare the nalchik score (140) of Peter Leko with his jermuk score (100). Since 100 is less than 140, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify players meeting criteria (4 games played, rl qual, jermuk < 140).\", \"Examine the table for matching player.\", \"Compare nalchik and jermuk scores.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nalchik\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to determine whether the claim about Peter Leko's scores is TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1. Identify the player whose score we want to check: In this case, it is Peter Leko.\n\n2. Locate the row corresponding to the player in the table: The row for Peter Leko has an empty cell under \"player,\" followed by a row with an index number 8.\n\n3. Determine the columns corresponding to 'jermuk' and 'nalchik': These are located at indices 5 and 6 respectively, as they represent the 6th and 7th columns in the table.\n\n4. Check if the values of the cells at the found column positions for Peter Leko match the given scores (100 for jermuk and 140 for nalchik): In our table, we find that the cell at row index 8 (Peter Leko) and column name 'jermuk' has a value of 100, while the cell at row index 8 and column name 'nalchik' has a value of 140.\n\n5. Compare these values with the given scores: The values in the table match the given scores for Peter Leko (100 for jermuk and 140 for nalchik).\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player: Peter Leko\\nLocate row: Row with an empty cell under 'player' and index number 8\\nDetermine columns for 'jermuk' and 'nalchik': Columns at indices 5 and 6 respectively\\nCheck values of the cells for Peter Leko in 'jermuk' and 'nalchik': Values match the given scores (100 for jermuk, 140 for nalchik)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nalchik\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
