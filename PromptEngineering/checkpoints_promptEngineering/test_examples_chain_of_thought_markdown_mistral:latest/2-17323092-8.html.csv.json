However, it is interesting to note that 'charlotte' appears multiple times in the 'team' column.\n4. Since there are multiple games involving 'charlotte' and no other teams, it might be temptative to think that 'charlotte' is indeed Toronto. But, at this point, we need more evidence to confirm this claim.\n5. In addition to the 'team' column, the table also includes a 'location' column which indicates the location where each game was played. This information can help us verify if there were any games between Toronto (if it indeed exists) and Charlotte.\n6.

Determine the final answer: Since both Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n and Chris Bosh have the same number of games with the highest number of assists, they are tied for the first place. However, the original claim was about the \"second most\" high assists, so even though Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n and Chris Bosh have the same number of high assists (7), we should not consider them in our comparison for the second position.\n8. In this scenario, no other player has more than 7 games with the highest number of assists, therefore, no other player can surpass Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n or Chris Bosh in terms of high assists count in March.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player whose assists are being analyzed\", \"Determine the table column relevant to the analysis\", \"Iterate through each row in the table\", \"Record the number of times the player has the highest number of assists\", \"Compare with other players to determine the ranking\", \"Check for other players with the same number of high assists\", \"Determine the final answer\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 62, \"column_name\": \"high assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"high assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 64, \"column_name\": \"high assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 65, \"column_name\": \"high assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 66, \"column_name\": \"high assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"high assists\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"high assists\" }\n  ]\n}",
