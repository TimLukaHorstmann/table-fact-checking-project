For example, let's look at the first three teams (Czechoslovakia, Soviet Union, Canada). They all have 0 draw and less than 1 loss. This is consistent with the claim because according to the claim, having more draws should be associated with more losses.\n                            4. Now let's compare teams that have drawn once with those who lost more (West Germany, United States, East Germany, Finland). Teams with 1 draw (Soviet Union and Sweden) also had less than the other four in both games lost and games drawn. This is consistent with the claim as well.\n                            5. At this point, we have compared all teams based on the number of draws and losses, and it appears that there is a trend where more draws are associated with more losses. However, to confirm this, we should ideally compare the exact number of draws and losses for each team.

This means that teams with higher points should have fewer losses, and vice versa.\n2. To verify this, I will first find the number of games lost for each team (since that's what is relevant to the claim) and compare it with their total points.\n3. In the table, look at the \"lost\" column which shows the number of losses for each team. Then, find the corresponding \"points\" column that represents their total points.\n4. Compare the values in these two columns for each team:\n   - Team | Lost | Points\n   - czechoslovakia | 0 | 14\n   - soviet union | 1 | 12\n   - canada | 3 | 8\n   - sweden | 3 | 8\n   - west germany | 4 | 5\n   - united states | 5 | 3\n   - east germany | 5 | 3\n   - finland | 5 | 3\n\n5.
