For rebound:\n   - In row 3, greg monroe has 7 rebounds (column 'high rebounds') which is the maximum among all occurrences of his name in the table.\n   - In row 6, rodney stuckey doesn't have any recorded rebound. So, no player had a higher number of rebounds than greg monroe.\n\n3. For score:\n   - In row 1, rodney stuckey has 17 points (column 'score'), but this is not the highest occurrence for him in the table.\n   - In row 6, rodney stuckey scores 25 points which is the maximum among all his occurrences.\n   - In every other occurrence of rodney stuckey, he has a score lower than 25.\n\n4. To verify whether any other player scored higher than rodney stuckey's highest score (25), we need to compare it with the scores of each player in the table.

Here, it is \"milwaukee\".\n\n4. Check if the team's record matches a record of 0-1: To check this, look at the \"record\" column in each row and find one with a value of 0-1. In our table, only the first row matches that record (index 1).\n\n5. Compare the score and team to determine whether Austin Daye scored the highest number of points for his team: Since we have found that Austin Daye has 16 points and he plays for \"milwaukee\" (which has a record of 1-1), we need to compare this with other scores in the table.
