To determine if a team plays as a home team 2 times, we need to count the number of rows where the home team matches the given team (hawthorn) and check if it's equal to or greater than 2.\n2. In this table, each row represents a different match, with columns showing information about the teams, scores, grounds, crowds, date, and time of the match.\n3. We search for rows where the home team equals hawthorn.\n4. If we find more than one such row, it means that hawthorn played as a home team at least 2 times.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check the number of rows where the home team is hawthorn\", \"If there are more than one such row, return TRUE, otherwise return FALSE\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
