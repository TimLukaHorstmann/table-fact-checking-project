Since there are no more rows after 2009 and the table is complete, we can assume that there are no more wins for the USA team past 2009.\n4. Compare the number of wins by the USA team from 1990 to 2009 with the total count of Solheim Cups held during that period (which should be the same as the row index of the last 'USA' win minus the row index of the first 'USA' win plus one, since the first win is not included in the count). In this case, it would be 4 (2009 - 1990 + 1) = 5. However, we found only 4 wins for the USA team from 1990 to 2009.
