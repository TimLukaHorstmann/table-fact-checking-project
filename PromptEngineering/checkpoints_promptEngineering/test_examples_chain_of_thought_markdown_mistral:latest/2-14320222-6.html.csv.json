    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the game number (61) from the table and find its points column (86). This tells us that the game has a total of 86 points.\n2. Check if there are any other games in the table with a total point equal to or close to 86. By scanning through the table, we can see that no other game has exactly 86 points. However, since the question asks for any game totaling 86 points and not necessarily an exact match, we need to check if there are games with fewer points but could be combined with some other game to reach 86.\n3. To check for this possibility, we can start by finding the smallest number of points less than 86, which is 72 (game 52), and then summing up the difference between the current point total and the lowest remaining point total on our right, which is 14 (from game 60's 84 points). If this sum is equal to or greater than the desired target of 86, then there would be a possibility for multiple games with fewer points to combine and reach 86. In this case, the sum is 72 + 14 = 86, which matches our target.\n4. To confirm, we can check if there exists another game with a point total within or equal to the sum calculated in step 3. By scanning through the table from right to left, we find that game 50 has 72 points (which is less than or equal to the sum), and if we add game 61's points (86), we indeed get a total of 158, which does not correspond to any valid game record in the table.\n5. Since there's no combination of games that adds up to exactly 86 points, we can conclude that game 61 is one of the three games with a total of 86 points.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify game 61 in the table and find its total points (86)\",\n    \"Check for other games with a total close to or equal to 86\",\n    \"Calculate the sum of the difference between game 61's points and the lowest remaining point total on our right (72 + 14 = 86)\",\n    \"Check if there exists another game with a point total within or equal to the calculated sum\",\n    \"Find that no such combination is possible in the table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}",

To find the lowest score among all games in February, we compare the scores of all games in Row 2 to Row 17 (since the game numbers increase from left to right and top to bottom).

However, to compare this correctly with the other games, we need to convert it from win-loss format to points scored (2 for a win and 1 for an overtime loss). So 2 points for the home team (52) and 2 points for the away team (Quebec Nordiques), totaling 4 points.\n4. Compare the total score of this game with other scores:\n   - The Winnipeg Jets' game has a total score of 8-4, which is not the highest score in the table.\n   - However, the game with the highest score (5-3) involves teams 60 (Los Angeles Kings) and 8 (Montreal Canadiens), but since we are interested in finding the game where Winnipeg played, not the overall highest score, we need to check other games involving the Winnipeg Jets.\n5.

Next, we look at the claim which states that \"only 2 teams play in games that have a total of 80 points\". This implies that we should find pairs of teams where their combined point totals equal 80.\n3. We then start scanning the table from the top to bottom and compare the 'points' column of each row with other rows, looking for combinations of rows whose sum equals 80.\n4. We find two such pairs: (57, 58) and (61, 62). The team with ID 57 has 80 points, and the team with ID 58 also has 80 points.
