Identify the tournament level from the table provided - It appears that the table lists results for the ATP Master Series tournaments in 1994, as indicated by the \"ATP Master Series\" label at the top of the table.\n2. Locate the annual win-loss record for the year 1994 - To find the annual win-loss record, we need to look for the row that corresponds to 1994 (row_index = 6) and identify the column that contains the win-loss record (column_name = \"annual win - loss\").\n3. Extract the annual win-loss record from the table - From the table, we can see that for row_index = 6 and column_name = \"annual win - loss\", the value is \"2 - 6\".\n4. Compare the extracted value with the claim - The claim states that the annual win-loss record for the ATP Master Series in 1994 was 2 - 4. Comparing this with our extraction from step 3, we see that the values match (2 - 6 and 2 - 4 have the same number of wins and losses).\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the tournament level\", \"Locate the annual win-loss record for the year 1994\", \"Extract the annual win-loss record from the table\", \"Compare the extracted value with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "1. The claim states that the annual win-loss for grand slam should be 5-4 for the years 1995, 1996, and 1997.\n2. To verify this claim, we need to find the row in the table that corresponds to these specific years (1995, 1996, and 1997) and check if the win-loss is indeed 5-4 for each of them.\n3. In the table, there are no distinct columns with the year label, but we can infer the year from the rows (the first row seems to be a header or title). The years appear to increase downwards in the table. So, let's assume that the second row corresponds to 1995, the third row to 1996, and the fourth row to 1997.\n4. Checking the relevant cells for each year:\n   - For 1995 (second row), the win-loss value is given as \"26\" which does not equal 5-4. So, 1995 is not a match for the claim.\n   - For 1996 (third row), the win-loss value is given as \"20\" which does not equal 5-4. So, 1996 is not a match for the claim.\n   - For 1997 (fourth row), the win-loss value is given as \"13\", which can be rewritten as 13-0 if we assume that losses are represented by the opposite of wins in this table. However, 13-0 does not equal 5-4, so 1997 is also not a match for the claim.\n\nSince none of the specified years (1995, 1996, and 1997) have an annual win-loss record of 5-4 in this table, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"win-loss\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"win-loss\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win-loss\" }\n]",
