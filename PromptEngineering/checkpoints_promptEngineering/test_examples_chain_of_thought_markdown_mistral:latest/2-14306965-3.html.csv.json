    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row where Kazakhstan (kaz) is mentioned in the table. Since it's in the 5th row, we will refer to the gold count in that row for our analysis.\n2. Check the value of the cell corresponding to \"gold\" in the 5th row and first column. In this case, the value is 0.\n3. Compare the value found with the claim's condition: \"gold be not smaller than zero\". Since the observed value is indeed less than zero (0), the claim does not hold true.\n4. To answer the overall claim, we must also consider if the total of the nation (Kazakhstan) being more than zero would make the claim true. However, since the gold count is 0 for Kazakhstan and the total number of medals they have is also 0 (since silver and bronze counts are both 0), their total is indeed 0, making the overall claim false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row of Kazakhstan in the table\",\n    \"Check if gold count for Kazakhstan is greater than or equal to zero\",\n    \"Analyze whether total of a nation being more than zero would make the claim true\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\" }\n  ]\n}",
