We don't see any drivers with exactly 7 laps, but we do find a group of drivers who have completed 6 or fewer laps. These drivers are: Fran\u00e7ois Cevert (45 laps), Howden Ganley (42 laps), Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (33 laps), Emerson Fittipaldi (58 laps - retired due to engine issues), John Surtees (56 laps - retired due to gearbox issues), and Jacky Ickx (78 laps - retired due to lap penalties).\n5. Since the number of drivers with 7 or fewer laps includes all drivers with exactly 7 laps, there is a 2-way tie for the least amount at 7 (Peter Gethin and Jo Bonnier) and another 6-way tie for the least amount including those who have retired due to technical issues (Fran\u00e7ois Cevert, Howden Ganley, Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, Emerson Fittipaldi, John Surtees, and Jacky Ickx).\n\nThe final answer is presented in a JSON object as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify drivers who have completed 75 laps\",\n    \"Check for ties among these drivers in terms of the number of laps completed\",\n    \"Identify drivers who have completed less than 7 laps\",\n    \"Check if all drivers with exactly 7 laps are included in the group of drivers with 6 or fewer laps\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"laps\" }\n  ]\n}",
