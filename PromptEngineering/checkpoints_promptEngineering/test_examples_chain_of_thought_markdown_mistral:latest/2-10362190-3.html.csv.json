Scroll through the table to find the row that matches the week number for this date. In a real scenario, you would use a search function or algorithm to do this efficiently. However, since we're manually going through the table:\n   - The first row has \"week 1\" and the date is September 3, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The second row has \"week 2\" and the date is September 10, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The third row has \"week 3\" and the date is September 17, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The fourth row has \"week 4\" and the date is September 24, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The sixth row has \"week 6\" and the date is October 8, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The seventh row has \"week 7\" and the date is October 15, 1995, so it matches the claim's date.\n   - The eighth row has \"week 8\" and the date is October 22, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The ninth row has \"week 9\" and the date is October 30, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The tenth row has \"week 10\" and the date is November 5, 1995, so it can be eliminated.\n   - The eleventh row has \"week 11\" and the date is November 12, 1995, which matches the claim's date and contains the attendance data we're interested in.\n\n3. Since the relevant row matches the date mentioned in the claim, we can now check if the claimed attendance (51342) matches the value in the table for this game:\n   - In the table, the row with week 11 and November 12, 1995 has an attendance of 51342.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the date mentioned in the claim (November 12, 1995).\",\n                       \"Find the row that matches the week number for this date.\",\n                       \"Check if the claimed attendance (51342) matches the value in the table for this game.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]\n}\n```",
