    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, I check the table to find the driver named 'tarso marques'.\n2. Next, I verify the number of laps completed by 'tarso marques'. Since the value in the 'laps' column for this driver is 0, it means he did not complete any lap.\n3. Lastly, I confirm that there are no other columns that might contradict the initial observation about the number of laps completed. No such conflicting information is found.\n\nWith these steps in mind, here's my final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find 'tarso marques' driver\",\n    \"Check the number of laps completed by 'tarso marques'\",\n    \"Verify there are no other columns that might contradict the initial observation\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"grid\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
