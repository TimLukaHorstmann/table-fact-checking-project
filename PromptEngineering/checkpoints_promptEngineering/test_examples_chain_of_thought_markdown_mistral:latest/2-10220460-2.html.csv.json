    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the answer:\n\n1. Identify the target fighter in the table - In this case, we are looking for records of Dan Christison.\n2. Filter the table based on the target fighter - We will look for rows where \"res\" (result) is equal to \"win\", and \"record\" matches \"8 - 2\". This will narrow down the table to one row because only one such row exists.\n3. Check if any of the opponent's records in the filtered row have 3 rounds - In this case, the row indicates that Dan Christison fought against \"shane ott\" and won with a record of \"8 - 2\". We will look for Shane Ott's record in the table, since his opponent is our target (Dan Christison) from step 1.\n4. Filter the table again based on the opponent found in step 3 - In this case, we filter the table to find rows where \"res\" is equal to any value and \"opponent\" matches \"shane ott\". This will return one row since Shane Ott fought only once in our table (against Dan Christison).\n5. Check the number of rounds for the opponent found in step 4 - In this case, the row indicates that Shane Ott fought against \"roy nelson\" and lost with a record of \"8 - 3\". We will look for Roy Nelson's record in the table since he was Shane Ott's opponent.\n6. Filter the table one last time based on the opponent found in step 5 - In this case, we filter the table to find rows where \"res\" is equal to any value and \"opponent\" matches \"roy nelson\". This will return two rows since Roy Nelson fought twice in our table (once against Shane Ott and once against Dan Christison).\n7. Check the number of rounds for both fights involving Roy Nelson - The first row indicates that Roy Nelson fought against \"dan christison\" with a record of \"loss 4 - 2\". In this fight, Roy Nelson had 2 rounds (round 1 and round 2). The second row indicates that Roy Nelson fought against someone else (not relevant to our claim) with a record of \"loss 8 - 3\". This fight also had 2 rounds (round 1 and round 2).\n\n   Based on the analysis above, it is clear that Dan Christison has one opponent (Shane Ott) who has fought in three rounds.
