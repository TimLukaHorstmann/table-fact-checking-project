Look for players who have the same score and are under par (i.e., those with a 'to par' value of 'e'). Note that 'under par' means that their total score is 1 stroke less than the expected number of strokes for each hole in a round, which is typically par.\n\n3. In this table, there are four players (david graham, sandy lyle, d a weibring, and peter senior) who have a score of 140 (-1), as they all have two rounds of 68 and 71 each.

To do this, I look for the rows where the 'score' column is the same and check if they have the same 'to par' value as well.\n2. In the table, there are multiple rows with identical scores (140 or 141). However, the 'to par' values are not consistent across these rows. Some players have '-1', some have 'e', and some have '+1'. Since a score of 'e' indicates that a player is even par for the tournament, and the others are above or below par, there isn't a tie for the lead among players with a score of 2 under par.\n3. To find if there is a tie for the lead among those who are either even par (score 140) or 1 over par (score 141), I look at the 'place' column to see where they stand in the tournament. If players with the same score have the same place, it indicates a tie.\n4. In this table, there are four players tied for third place (rows 3-6) with a score of 140 and an 'e' in the 'to par' column.

The player with the lowest score who is not tied for third place or lower is Howard Clark (row 8) with a score of 141 and a '+1' in the 'to par' column, which means he is 1 over par for the tournament.

In this table, all the tied players have a 'to par' value of 'e', which means they are even to par.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find players tied at second place by comparing their scores (excluding those below par) and check their 'to par' values.\", \"Check if all the tied players have an 'even to par' status.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}",
