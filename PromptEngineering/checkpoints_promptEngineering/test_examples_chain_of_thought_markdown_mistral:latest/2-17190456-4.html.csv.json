    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we identify all the rows where 'home' is 'pittsburgh', date is after December 21st (7th day of the month), and attendance is smaller than 5307 (refer to the table headers for clarity). The relevant rows are: [{\"row_index\": 6}, {\"row_index\": 7}, {\"row_index\": 8}, {\"row_index\": 9}]\n2. Next, we calculate the points for each of these rows by looking at the 'points' column in the table (since it's added across wins and losses, we know that a 4-win and 3-loss game will always have 18 points). We find that all the points for the selected rows are indeed 18.\n3. Finally, we confirm that the sum of these points is equal to 18 by adding them up: 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 72. Since this equals the total number of points in our selected rows, our claim is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify rows meeting conditions (home=pittsburgh, date>=Dec-22nd, attendance<5307).\", \"Calculate points for each row using the 'score' column.\", \"Confirm that the sum of these points equals 18.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6}, {\"row_index\": 7}, {\"row_index\": 8}, {\"row_index\": 9}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the condition given in the claim: The score (column 'score') should be 2 - 3 when the visitor (column 'visitor') is Pittsburgh, and the points (column 'points') should be less than 20.\n2. Scan through the table to find rows where the visitor is Pittsburgh. There are multiple such rows: rows 1, 5, 8, 14, 15, 17, 26, and 27.\n3. For each of these rows, check if the score matches the condition (2 - 3). The scores for rows 1, 5, 14, 15, 17, and 27 do not match the condition. However, the score for row 15 has two values: 3 - 5. Since the score is represented as a tuple (home_score, visitor_score), we need to find the element that corresponds to the Pittsburgh team. The relevant value here is '3'. So, we can see that at least one of these scores matches the condition.\n4. For the remaining row where the score matches the condition (row 8), check if the points are less than 20. The points for this row are 18. Since 18 is greater than 20, it does not satisfy the condition.\n5. Conclusion: The claim that \"2 - 3 be score , when visitor be pittsburgh , and when point be less than 20\" is FALSE.
