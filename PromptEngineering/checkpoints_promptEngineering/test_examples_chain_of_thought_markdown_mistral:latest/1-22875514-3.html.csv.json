    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to check if COLE's field goals (the number of successful shots from within the three-point line) are 18 out of 50 as claimed.\n2. To do this, we compare the number of successful field goals against the total number of attempts. In the table, COLE has 18 successful field goals and a total of 50 attempts in the \"field goals\" column.\n3. Since 18 is equal to 18 (the number of successful field goals) and 50 is equal to 50 (the total number of attempts), it follows that COLE indeed has 18 out of 50 field goals as claimed.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check if the number of successful field goals for player 'cole' is 18 out of 50.\", \"Compare the number of successful field goals ('field goals = 18') with the total number of attempts ('50').\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a player, and each column represents a specific statistic about the player (field goals, three pointers, free throws, assists, steals, rebounds, points). The data in the cells are formatted as \"value - total attempts\".\n\n2. In this case, we are looking for the row that corresponds to \"cole\" in the table.\n\n3. We can see that the row with the header \"cole\" contains a value of \"18 - 50\" under the column heading \"field goals\". This indicates that Cole made 18 field goals out of a total of 50 attempts.\n\n4. Comparing this to the claim, we find that the number of successful field goals (18) matches the number in the claim. Therefore, if we consider just the number of field goals, the claim is correct. However, it's important to note that the claim also mentions the total attempts (50), which should be considered as well.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the structure of the table, find the row corresponding to 'cole', and compare the field goal data in the table with the number in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"field goals\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total attempts\"}]\n}",
