    "resp": "Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Check the number of tries each player has made, and see if any player other than Tevita Vaikona has made more than 23 attempts. If there is a player who has made more than 23 tries, then we can conclude that the claim is FALSE since someone else scored over 100 points in more than 23 attempts.\n\n2. Scan through the \"tries\" column to find players with more than 23 attempts and compare their points scores against Tevita Vaikona's 100 points. If we find a player with more than 23 tries and over 100 points, then the claim is FALSE.\n\n3. Identify if Tevita Vaikona is the only player who made more than 23 attempts and scored at least 100 points. In this case, since Tevita Vaikona has exactly 25 tries and scored 100 points, he is the only player that meets the criteria.\n\n4. Finally, verify that there are no other players with more than 23 attempts but less than 100 points to ensure that Tevita Vaikona is indeed unique in this regard. In our table, we find that no other players meet these criteria.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check the number of tries for each player, compare their points score with Tevita Vaikona's 100 points to see if anyone scored more than 100 points in fewer than 23 attempts\",\n                       \"Identify if Tevita Vaikona is the only player who made more than 23 attempts and scored at least 100 points.\",\n                       \"Verify that there are no other players with more than 23 attempts but less than 100 points.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the player in question: The player in question is Tevita Vaikona.\n2. Determine the position of the player: Tevita Vaikona plays at the position of wing.\n3. Check if there is a column for points in the table: Yes, there is a column named \"points\".\n4. Check if there is a column for tries in the table: Yes, there is a column named \"tries\".\n5. Identify the row that corresponds to Tevita Vaikona: The row number for Tevita Vaikona is 2 (since the first row is labeled \"player\", and the second row has \"robbie paul\" in the player column, with Tevita Vaikona listed on the third row).\n6. Check if the value under the \"points\" column matches 100 for Tevita Vaikona: No, the value under the \"points\" column is 100 for other players but not for Tevita Vaikona.\n7. Check if the value under the \"tries\" column matches 25 for Tevita Vaikona: Yes, the value under the \"tries\" column is 25 for Tevita Vaikona.\n8. Compare the total points scored by Tevita Vaikona with the points scored on his tries: Since the goal value is 0 for Tevita Vaikona and 1 point is scored per try, we can calculate the expected points from goals as 25*1 = 25, which does not equal the total points (100) for Tevita Vaikona.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the claim \"Tevita Vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries\" is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player in question\", \"Determine the position of the player\", \"Check if there is a column for points\", \"Check if there is a column for tries\", \"Identify the row that corresponds to the player\", \"Check if the value under the 'points' column matches 100\", \"Check if the value under the 'tries' column matches 25\", \"Compare the total points scored by the player with the points scored on his tries\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}]\n}",
