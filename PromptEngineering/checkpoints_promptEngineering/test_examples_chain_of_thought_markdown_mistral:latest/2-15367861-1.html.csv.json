    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the meaning of the table columns.\n   - Position: The ranking of each team.\n   - Team: The name of the soccer team.\n   - Points: The total points a team has earned.\n   - Played: The number of games a team has played.\n   - Drawn: The number of draws a team has had.\n   - Lost: The number of losses a team has suffered.\n   - Against: The total goals conceded by a team.\n   - Difference: The goal difference (goals scored - goals conceded).\n\n2. To answer the claim, we need to find the number of losses for Corinthians and compare it with 11.\n\n3. In the table, row_index 6 corresponds to Corinthians. The \"lost\" value in this row is 10.\n\n4. Since Corinthians have suffered 10 losses (which is less than 11), the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the meaning of each column in the table.\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to Corinthians.\",\n    \"Extract the 'lost' value for Corinthians.\",\n    \"Compare the extracted value with 11.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"lost\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "claim": "there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point",

    "resp": "The reasoning steps to determine the validity of the claim are as follows:\n\n1. Examine the table for information about the number of points scored by each team (the 'points' column).\n2. Identify Corinthians in the table (row with position 6). Check its points total (32).\n3. Look up teams against which Corinthians have lost (in the 'lost' column). The value is 10.\n4. Calculate the number of matches played by Corinthians (from the 'played' column, which is 22).\n5. Determine the number of matches that Corinthians won in those 22 games, and subtract this from the total number of matches they played to find the number of losses (22 - 10 = 12 losses).\n6. Compare the total number of points scored by Corinthians (32) with the number predicted by the claim (more than 25). The given condition (score over 25 points) is met in this case.\n7. Finally, check if there are any instances where Corinthians lost a match after scoring more than 25 points (this would contradict the claim). In our table, we don't see any such matches as Corinthians have only scored 32 points, which is less than 25 in this context.\n\nThe final answer to the question is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Examine the 'points', 'lost', and 'played' columns for Corinthians (row 6)\", \"Calculate the number of losses from played and lost\", \"Compare the points scored by Corinthians with the condition in the claim\", \"Check if there are any instances where Corinthians lost a match after scoring more than 25 points\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"played\"}\n  ]\n}",
