    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the team mentioned in the claim (South Melbourne) and confirm it as the away team in the table. In this case, the team appears twice in the table - once as a home team and once as an away team. Since we're focusing on the away games for this question, select the row where South Melbourne is listed as the away team.\n2. Verify that the score provided in the claim (8.18 or 66) matches the score for South Melbourne when they are the away team in the table.\n3. Examine the venue for the game where South Melbourne is the away team. In this case, the venue is lake oval.\n4. Compare the claimed date (not provided in the claim) with the dates in the table. Since the table only provides one date (17 july 1954 and 24 july 1954), it's unclear whether the claimed date matches any of these or if there is a discrepancy. However, since we are focusing on verifying the score and venue for South Melbourne as the away team, this mismatch in dates should not affect our answer.\n\nThe claim states that \"when south melbourne be the away team , their score be be 8.18 (66) when they play at lake oval\". In this table, when South Melbourne is the away team, their score is indeed 8.18 (66), and they play at lake oval. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify South Melbourne as the away team\",\n    \"Confirm that their score (8.18 or 66) matches the score for South Melbourne when they are the away team in the table\",\n    \"Examine the venue for the game where South Melbourne is the away team\",\n    \"Compare the claimed date with the dates in the table, but since it's unclear if there's a discrepancy, this doesn't affect our answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
