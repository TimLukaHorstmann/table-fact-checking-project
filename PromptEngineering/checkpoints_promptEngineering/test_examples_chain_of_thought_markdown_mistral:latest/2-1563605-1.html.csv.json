Compare the scores at these two dates, in terms of both the venue (since the score might be different due to multiple matches at the same date) and the competition. If both scores are identical, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, let's find out if Adnan Al Talyani played on the specified dates:\n- November 9, 1994: We see that Adnan Al Talyani participated in a match on this date as evidenced by rows with the \"date\" value of \"1994-11-09\".
