    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the game number we are interested in, which is 35 according to the claim.\n2. Find the row in the table that corresponds to game number 35. This row will have information about game 35.\n3. Check the 'score' column in the identified row (row_index=35) for the value of the score of game 35.\n4. Compare the score value obtained in step 3 with the claimed score, which is \"l90 - 98 (ot)\"\n\nThe score obtained from the table does not match the claimed score. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the game number from the claim\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to the identified game number\",\n    \"Check the 'score' column in the found row for the score of the game\",\n    \"Compare the obtained score with the claimed score\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
