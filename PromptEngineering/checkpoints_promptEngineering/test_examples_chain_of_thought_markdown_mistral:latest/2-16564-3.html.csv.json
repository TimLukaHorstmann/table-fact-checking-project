Check the table: The table provides information about different years, start positions, qualifying scores, ranks, finishing positions, number of laps completed, and total race distance.\n3. Find the row for the year 1961: In the table, the first row represents the data for 1961.\n4. Check the column 'qual': The value in the 'qual' column for the 1961 row is 145.144.\n5. Compare the claim with the table: The claim states that the qualifying score for the year 1961 should be 145.144.
