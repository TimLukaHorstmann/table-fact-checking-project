    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the rows in the table where both the home team and away team are either 'nuggets' or 'warriors'.\n2. Next, we will check if these matches happened on the same month (December 2007) and day by comparing the dates for each row.\n3. If there is a pair of rows where both conditions above hold true, we will then verify that each team won on their home court. This means checking the 'score' column in these rows: if the row with 'nuggets' as home team has a score greater than or equal to 100 and the one with 'warriors' as home team has a score less than 100, then each team won on their home court.\n\nRelevant Cells (assuming that rows are ordered chronologically):\n- Row Index: 8, Column Name: date (for nuggets)\n- Row Index: 8, Column Name: home (for nuggets)\n- Row Index: 9, Column Name: date (for warriors)\n- Row Index: 9, Column Name: home (for warriors)\n- Row Index: 8, Column Name: score (nuggets)\n- Row Index: 9, Column Name: score (warriors)\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
