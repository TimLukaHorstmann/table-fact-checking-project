In the table, this value can be found in the \"score\" column and the \"+ to par\" column.\n2. Look at the row indices where the values in the \"to par\" column are 8. No such row exists in the given table.\n3. However, we note that the score (in strokes) for a player can be found by adding the two numbers in each of the four-cell rows (place, player, country, and score). In some cases, these scores are over par (+), meaning they require more strokes to complete the course than par.\n4. We notice that there are several instances where players have a score equal to or greater than 148 (since the lowest score in this table is 144, and all the rows with a lower score have a \"to par\" value less than 8).\n5. Check the scores of these players who have a score of at least 148. We find that bob harris (row 7) and jack burke, jr (row 8) both have a score of 148. Since their \"+ to par\" values are also 8, we can conclude that they scored an 8 over par.\n6. Sam snead (row 5) also has a score of 148, but his \"+ to par\" value is 8 minus the number of strokes he was under par for the first round, which is 0.

So, we will first calculate the actual scores and then check if any golfer's actual score is 3 lower than par (which would be -3 if the par for each tournament round is assumed to be 72).\n\n2. Parse the table to understand the structure. The table has six columns: place, player, country, score (which is actually the sum of two rounds), to par, and a space. We are interested in the \"score\" column as it gives us the total score for each player.\n\n3. Calculate the actual scores by subtracting the to par value from the total score. For example, harvie ward (a) has a total score of 144 and to par of +4. So, his actual score would be 144 - 4 = 140.\n\n4. Check if there are any rows where the calculated score is 3 less than par.
