Identify the row where the match between Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks took place on April 14, as this is the date mentioned in the claim. In this case, it is row 3.\n   2. Check the 'record' column for the match that happened on April 14 for both teams. The record is displayed next to each team, with a space between their score and their opponent's score. For example, in row 3, \"chicago black hawks\" has a score of 2 - 1.\n   3. Find the record for Detroit Red Wings on April 14. In this case, it is '1' as the first number in the space-separated string (2 - 1).\n   4. Check the second part of the record for Detroit Red Wings on April 14. Since we are looking for a match where the score was 5 - 3, add the two numbers in the space-separated string to compare them with the desired result (5 + 3 = 8).\n   5. Compare the calculated result (8) with the second part of the record found in step 3. If they match or are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.
