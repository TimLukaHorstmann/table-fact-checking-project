To find the date, we look at the \"february\" column and search for the row with the value closest to 21. In this case, it is the row with index 63.\n   2. Next, we check the score of the game corresponding to February 21 by looking at the score column of the identified row (row 63). The score for the game on February 21 is given in the \"score\" column as 5 - 4.\n   3. Since the claimed score matches the score found from the table, our conclusion is that the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row corresponding to February 21 by looking at the 'february' column and searching for the value closest to 21.\",\n    \"Check the score of the game corresponding to February 21 by looking at the 'score' column of the identified row.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"february\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 63, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
