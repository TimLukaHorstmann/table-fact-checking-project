Find the earnings of each casino in the years 2008, 2009, and 2010 (the claim doesn't specify the year 2010 but it's included here as a consistency check). We can find these values in columns fy08 millions and fy09 millions.\n\n3. Compare the earnings of each casino in the relevant years to determine which had the highest earnings. In this case, Washoe has 977 million dollars in 2008 and 856 million dollars in 2009. We don't have a 2010 value for Washoe but all other casinos have lower values in both 2008 and 2009.\n\n4.

However, since the claim mentions specifically 'i - 80' road, we will focus on the 'road' column for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n2. Compare the values in the 'road' column for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010 across each row to find the one with the highest earnings for 'elko'. Since we are only concerned about 'elko', we can focus on the third row of the table.\n3. Look at the values in the 'road' column (i - 80) for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010 for elko (row index 17). The values are [47071, 303, 279].\n4. Compare these values to find the highest one. In this case, the highest value is 47071 (from the year 2008).\n5. Since 'elko' has the highest earnings in the year 2008 on 'i - 80', we can now check whether it also has the highest earnings for the years 2009 and 2010. For this, we would need additional data not provided in the table, as we only have data up to 2009 for 'elko' on 'i - 80'.\n6. Since we don't have enough data to check whether 'elko' has the highest earnings for 2009 and 2010, we cannot make a definitive statement about those years.
