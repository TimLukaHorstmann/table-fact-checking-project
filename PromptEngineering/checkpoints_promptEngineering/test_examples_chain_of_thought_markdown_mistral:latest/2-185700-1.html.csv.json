    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. First, we will compare the points obtained by the songs \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and \"croire\" in the table.\n2. To do this, we need to find the row numbers where these song titles appear in the table.\n   - For \"vivo (ti scrivo)\", it is located at row 18.\n   - For \"croire\", it is located at row 17.\n3. Once we have their row numbers, we can compare their corresponding points, which are found in the \"points\" column.\n4. Comparing the points for both songs:\n   - The song \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has 52 points.\n   - The song \"croire\" has 90 points.\n5. Finally, we compare the values to check if the claim is true or false.\n   - If the song \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" has more points than \"croire\", then the claim is false.\n   - However, in this case, \"croire\" has higher points (90) compared to \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" (52).\n\nNow let's construct the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find song 'vivo (ti scrivo)' and 'croire' in the table.\",\n    \"Compare their row numbers to locate their points.\",\n    \"Compare the obtained points for both songs.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}",
