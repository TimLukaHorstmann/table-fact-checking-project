The date of that game can be found by looking at the \"score\" column and finding the row with a score difference of 13 (as the score was 112 - 105, which is a difference of 13 points). This occurs on the 13th row.\n2. Check the name of the opposing team in that game by looking at the \"home\" column in the same row. This should be the Cavaliers as per the table.\n3. Since we are looking for a match where Gin\u00f3bili scored 46 points and the game ended with a score difference of 1 (as 100 - 99 is a difference of 1 point), we need to check if there's any other row where these conditions are met, but we find no such rows.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the row with Gin\u00f3bili as lead scorer (46 points), then check the 'home' team in that row to ensure it matches the opponent mentioned in the claim ('cavaliers'), and finally verify that there are no other rows where Gin\u00f3bili scored 46 points and the game ended with a difference of 1 point.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
