Count the number of games won (highlight wins) and lost (highlight losses) in these games.\n3. Sum up the total number of games (wins + losses) to check if it matches the series record given in the claim.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the table:\n\n1. Games played at Boston Garden: Rows 1, 2, and 5 have \"boston garden\" as the location.\n2. Wins: Detroid Pistons won games 2 and 5 (may 9 and may 15). Losses: They lost game 1 (may 7).\n3. Sum of wins + losses: 2 (wins) + 1 (loss) = 3\n\nThe claim is comparing the series record at Boston Garden with the number of games played there, not the total series score. Since the Detroid Pistons have a 3-1 record in games played at Boston Garden, and the claim states 5-2, it is not accurate (FALSE).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify games played at 'boston garden', count wins and losses for these games, and check if the sum of wins + losses matches the series record in the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}",
