    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we check each row to see if it contains information about Tony Mendoza. This will help us find the event where he was the opponent.\n2. Scanning the table, we find a row with \"Tony Mendoza\" as the opponent in the 'opponent' column. The row number for this record is 11.\n3. In this row, we can see that the 'event' for Tony Mendoza is listed as 'wfc : rumble in the rockies'. This event has a specific time of 2:41 in the 'time' column.\n4. However, our claim states that the event where Tony Mendoza was the opponent had a time of 2:49.\n5. Comparing the given information with the claim, we find that they do not match. The event where Tony Mendoza was the opponent did not occur at 2:49, but rather at 2:41.\n\nThe final answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check each row for 'Tony Mendoza'. Find event where he is the opponent.
