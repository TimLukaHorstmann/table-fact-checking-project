In our table, there are 5 players who attended Oklahoma (rows 1, 3, 4, 26, and 27).\n2. Next, we want to see if any of these players were drafted in the first round. The 'round' column gives us this information. We will look at each of the 5 Oklahoma players to find out if they were picked in the first round.\n3. By examining the 'pick' column for each of the Oklahoma players, we can see that billy vessels (row 1), buck mcphail (row 3), tom catlin (row 4), scott prescott (row 26), and ray graves (row 27) were all picked in the first round.\n4. Finally, since all 5 Oklahoma players were drafted in the first round, we can conclude that the Colt Draft indeed drafted 3 players from Oklahoma.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify players from Oklahoma by examining the 'college' column, Check if they were picked in the first round by looking at the 'round' and 'pick' columns\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}",
