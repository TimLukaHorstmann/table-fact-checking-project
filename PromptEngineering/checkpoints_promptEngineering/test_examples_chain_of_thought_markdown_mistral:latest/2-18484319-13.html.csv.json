Identify the row corresponding to round 5 (row index = 5).\n3. Check the home team for this round, which is Adelaide United according to the table.\n4. Since the home team changes from match to match, if a team has previously played as the away team, it cannot be the last away game they play in that season without further information about later matches.\n5.
